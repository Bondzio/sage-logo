<abstract>
<p>Total automation is often not a good solution for tasks in highly customized or unstructured environments or where human interaction itself is the task. Human operation of machines involves the transmission of information in two directions and clearly can confront the limited information channel capacity of the human. An effective solution is known to be the use of more channels or modalities of communication. Directly communicating with haptic channels can augment the overloaded visual and auditory channels and additionally stimulate appropriate corrective manual commands to machines under human control or supervision, resulting in a lower cognitive workload. Sensors, actuators and computational ability are constantly improving. This article examines the opportunities and challenges of employing the haptic sensory channels and also the associated command interfaces that take advantage of this channel. A systems and control perspective is essential to realize the advantages without unduly suffering the adverse effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human beings are back in the picture! The drive for the “lights out factory” of yesteryear has been replaced with human-friendly robotics and human–machine cooperation. The human operator is appropriately returned to the loop. Full automation of every task that must be accomplished in a highly unstructured and increasingly customized world is not seen as optimal in many situations. What then, is better? A blend of human and machine is increasingly sought after as witnessed by the European Clearinghouse for Open Robotics Development program in Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959651812440070">1</xref></sup>, which seeks to strengthen industry–academia cooperation in this area. In realization of the potential of human and machine working together, the new National Robotics Initiative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959651812440070">2</xref></sup> in the USA is addressing the significant challenges of human and machine sharing not only the physical but also the cognitive portions of a task jointly tackled. Countries in Asia have already seriously embraced human–machine cooperation, with the machine, configured in some cases as a humanoid, as a personal companion and occupational accomplice. While manufacturing sought to maximize automation, industries such as construction and agriculture have never steered toward full automation due to the unstructured nature of the workplace. These industries now seek a more intelligent role for machines. Personal transportation is another stronghold of manual control that is on the verge of partial automation and presents a need for cooperation between operator and enabling machine.</p>
<p>Communication between a human operator and the enabling machine about the ultimate task is strongly needed, and can benefit the overall effectiveness of the human–machine system. Each field has its personality and resulting challenges, but much can be gained from an overview of their needs for a human–machine interface. How, then, will a human operator communicate bilaterally with their mechanical assistant? Electrically coded digital data has become the native language of today’s machines. Messages are transmitted from an expanding array of sensors to computers, then to actuators of increasing variety and scale. However, the same five senses remain the communication channels by which the human operator receives information. The human, in turn, communicates to the world primarily via two means: speech and motion. Impressive progress is being made with direct interfacing with the nervous system, and this may become viable in the future, particularly for amputees and the disabled. What though, are we doing to utilize the human’s sophisticated but capacity-limited natural information channels to enhance the human–machine interface? In particular, how can we better use the most pervasive channel, the sense of touch, and all its variations and locations in the human body?</p>
<sec id="section2-0959651812440070">
<title>The sense of touch</title>
<p>The sense of touch is composed of, or closely linked to, several organs and their related responses. These are broadly included in the “somatosensory system” with different sensory components in the skin, muscles, joints, bones and elsewhere. In the skin, rapidly changing forces are detected by fast-acting sensors of two varieties referred to as FA1 and FA2. The slow-acting sensors are more sensitive to slowly varying forces, referred to as SA1 and SA2. When the orientation and actuation of a joint is detected, the proprioceptive sense is involved. This gives us valuable directional information when we resist a force or act to create one. Temperature and pain have their own impact on the interface between our bodies and the outside world. In this complex relationship between responses we often merge the sensations into a single and not totally distinguishable sense of what our body is experiencing. With some reservation this collection of sensations is referred to as haptics; a term deriving from the Greek word <italic>haptesthai</italic> meaning “to touch.”</p>
<p>There is also a close connection between haptic inputs and the primary outputs of sound and motion. We innately shout and jerk our hand to remove it from pain. It is this involuntary response that connects input to output without the delay of our sluggish central nervous system (CNS) that provides an effective match between man and machine. An intuitive response can also free the CNS for more complex cognitive tasks and reduce the overall cognitive workload. However, the effective utilization of this channel and the shortcut between input and output is hindered by a lack of engineering principles, existing sensor and actuator technologies and also some physical limitations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0959651812440070">
<title>Comparison of modalities</title>
<p>The physical limitations of haptics include the power it requires when transmitting a bit of information. A precise comparison depends on many details, but to gain some appreciation of haptics compared with visual and audio interfaces, consider the following measures as indicators.</p>
<p>First, consider communication by way of sound. The signal detectible by the ear is typically related as sound pressure level measured in decibels on a logarithmic scale. It is the result of energy imparted to air requiring a source providing sound power with a given efficiency. Normal speech at a 1m distance generates sound power of about 60 dB or 10<sup>–5</sup> W. The sounds of a refrigerator at 50 dB (10<sup>–7</sup>W) and an excavator at 115dB (0.3W) are other reference points. A signal 15dB above these background noise levels might be realistic for communication. The perceived loudness depends on distance, and the sound pressure level declines with the logarithm of distance, so the power required for cues transmitted via a loudspeaker are hard to predict and must take into account the relatively poor efficiency of the speaker, maybe as low as 1% or as high as 20%. Considering headphones instead, one could expect electrical power demands as low as 0.1 mW or even lower. The theoretical limit of audio transmission of information is extremely high, being dependent on the frequency content of the signal. The processing by a human is much slower rendering the transmission rate in the order of 10 to 20 bits/s requiring power in the milliwatt range.</p>
<p>Higher transmission rates are possible using light. The eye detects light in the range of wavelengths from 400 to 700nm. A single light-emitting diode, perhaps the most efficient form of lighting, requires about 40 mW. This would provide one bit of information which could be switched at a rate greater than the persistence of vision, perhaps 10 times a second, and thus an information transmission rate of 10 bits/s. Liquid crystal display screens are vastly more efficient on a per bit basis. Even more so are E-readers that can use ambient light to display a complete screen of data, 600 × 800 pixels with 16 gray levels and hence 7.68 × 10<sup>6</sup> unique values and requires power only when the data changes. This produces pages with approximately 960 characters, each of which (assuming a 26 character alphabet) carries about 4.7 bits of information for a total of over 4500 bits per page, with a battery advertised as permitting over 7000 page changes. Considering a 1.6A-h lithium ion battery at 3.6 V, this would be over 5.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> bits/W, displayed at an almost arbitrary rate, certainly far beyond human processing capability. As with auditory signals, human decoding of this information is performed much more slowly, measured to be about 40–60 bits/s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959651812440070">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959651812440070">4</xref></sup> In contrast, the reading rate is roughly cut in half for tactual reading such as by Braille.</p>
<p>Haptic sensations require mechanical deformation of the body exterior or motion of limbs or the resistance to motion. Passive resistance, by springs or friction for instance, requires no interface power, but its time response is fixed. Thus, it lacks the ability to provide extensive information about varying conditions of the machine or task. Springs provide some indication of the characteristics of a display one might like to provide in an active manner via motors or vibrators. An example joystick has been measured to have a spring constant of 0.34 N-m/deg which would result in 3.3 N-m of work in moving full range of 20°, or an average of 6.6W if moved in a half a second. Thus, communicating via simple haptics to an operator could be 66 times as consumptive of power as an earphone. Furthermore, a headphone might transmit more information by a factor of 10, given the normal discrimination of an unreferenced force; hence, the power cost of information would be 660 times as high. Power at this level would be of no consequence on some devices, say an excavator, but on a battery-powered device such as a remotely operated vehicle console for improvised explosive device disposal or disaster rescue, this becomes an obstacle. Even powering a vibrator can deplete batteries with a drain of around 250 mW for a small motor with eccentric mass, as used in a cell phone. Why then, would one want to use haptics? For the following two reasons:</p>
<list id="list1-0959651812440070" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>the channel capacity for haptics is to some extent independent of the capacity of other channels, which are overburdened with other information or are corrupted with noise;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the haptic sensation can be conveniently suggestive of the motor response it is intended to stimulate.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Noise is another challenge of haptics and other modalities. Acoustic noise will obscure an aural signal more completely than a haptic signal, but whole body vibration or vigorous motion obscures or masks a haptic signal. Masking has been extensively studied for audible communication but much less so for haptics. Visual distraction can be thought of as a form of noise. Our eyes will be useless for incoming signals if we are concentrating elsewhere, whether that view is task related or a pure distraction. Haptics stimulates us through a channel that nature has endowed with a personal aspect. Touching is intimate and hard to ignore. We tap someone on the shoulder to get their attention when they are absorbed in other matters. We can also utilize the private nature of haptic signals. Hence, the use of a vibrating cell phone which alerts only the wearer of a call and perhaps the caller without disturbing others. Finally, what is the appropriate mapping between signals from relevant sensors without a biological analogy? How should one display a magnetometer or chemical sensor?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959651812440070">
<title>Using haptic interfaces</title>
<p>From a biological point of view, the somatosensory system has been extensively studied. Precise stimulation of the various modalities and measurement of the response has been undertaken in the laboratory. With the expanding technology for stimulation planning (via computers) and delivery (via actuators), the question now emerges of how to engineer this as an effective communication channel. Most research and the resulting publications focus on achieving virtual reality in the sense of touch. The emphasis is on fooling the human so that it seems as if an object which is either non-existent or remote is actually in contact with the human body. Thus, the metrics of performance typically used are that you feel nothing when nothing is intended to be there (called transparency) or that you feel close to what you would feel if some intended virtual object were there (called fidelity). If you are using haptics as a way to improve an operator’s ability to make a machine perform, these metrics are not very helpful. What would be more helpful is communication about the evolving state of the machine and its environment that is clear and evokes a reaction that minimizes the cognitive load, or mental processing, that the operator has to do to proceed with the operation of the machine. If that machine is an excavator, we do not want the operator to feel the soil being moved, but rather to understand how the excavator is performing at moving soil. Numerous examples of good and bad interfaces exist. The resistance experienced in power brakes and steering is one simple example many have experienced. What about the controls of an excavator, backhoe or tree harvester? Again, a human is asked to deal with varying conditions of the machine, the workpiece and the environment where haptics is a natural form of communication. The current approach to improving these user interfaces involves numerous trial-and-error repetitions, used to refine iteratively a presupposed optimum modality: a joystick with non-intuitive connections to joint motion. However, in this case, the real criterion of success is the motion of the tooling at the end of a chain of linkages; therefore, this may not be the most fitting modality. Engineering principles are needed but are presently minimal. Integrated design of an intuitive control input and an intuitive response feedback will certainly open possibilities that an incremental approach will overlook. Interface designs must evolve from those dictated by what was possible with old technology to what is effective with new technology. We use the mouse partially based on historical precedent, but what if the touch screen had been invented before the mouse?</p>
<p>It is possible that operators become addicted to “bad” interfaces. Given that the human is extremely adaptable and a creature of habit, any change in an interface might be temporarily objectionable. Experiences with hydraulic controls exhibit this phenomenon. Direct control of valves was replaced by pilot control of valves and then electronic controls. In each case, manufacturers report some dissatisfaction with the change. Is the new interface inferior or is the learned behavior to work with a bad interface overpowering the advantages of a new design? Only an extensive test with two designs used while individuals progress from novice to expert level will answer that conclusively. This complicates attempts to improve the interface of established devices with legions of experienced operators. The complaint typically involves the “feel” of the interface, i.e. the haptic qualities; the way force and tactile sensations are generated in response to operator input and machine state. It is possible to create a programmable haptic behavior wherein the feel can be synthesized and selected at will by the operator. The “legacy” behavior can then be provided for experienced operators while updated behaviors can be provided for those just learning the business. This would be similar to the selectivity in excavator control formats which exchange the assignment of joints to motions of the joints, particularly exchanging bucket and arm assignments. In some cases, however, the entire format of the interface may be revamped and behavior selection is not possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0959651812440070">
<title>Clues at hand</title>
<p>What is at stake in the battle to upgrade the operator interface, and thus share more effectively a mechanized task between human and machine? Efficiency (of time, fuel and money), safety, feasibility and workforce training could be improved. At Georgia Tech we have studied most extensively operator interfaces for heavy equipment, specifically backhoes and excavators although many conclusions also apply to remote handling of hazardous materials, underwater applications, surgery and micro-scale manipulation. Our studies suggest a novice operator can approach the productivity of an experienced operator in “excavator-like” tasks when using an improved operator interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651812440070">5</xref></sup> They also show that inappropriate motions requiring corrections (usually carried out without drastic consequence) can be reduced. They show double-digit improvements in fuel efficiency and even greater reduction in task times when coordinated controls are used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959651812440070">5</xref></sup> The studies also suggest the possibility of enhancing operator performance with shared control inferring the operator’s intent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959651812440070">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959651812440070">7</xref></sup> They indicate off-vehicle operation can be effectively performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959651812440070">8</xref></sup> They show invisible obstacles to digging can be displayed in a haptic fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959651812440070">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Challenges arise, however, due to “biodynamic feed through,” basically cab reaction to operator input that in turn produces more (undesired) operator input. Challenges such as this yield to alternative hand controller designs and improved controllers that address specifically these interactions. Power limitations may be addressed by “semi-active” or passive actuators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959651812440070">10</xref></sup> Clever and robust designs of sensors, actuators and mechanisms are needed to appropriately interface through the haptic channel for command and feedback.</p>
<p>The most daunting challenge is not purely technical, however. User confidence in effectiveness and safety must be earned. Customer reluctance to move into untested waters presents an enormous challenge. Who will be competent to operate a radically different interface in a traditional industry? Who will accept the challenge? Perhaps it will be those individuals who are currently operating game controllers today. The equipment-rental industry may value an interface more quickly mastered. Mining companies may value remote operation enough to train new equipment operators. The forestry industry already must train operators for years to reach full capabilities; they might value a reduced training time.</p>

<title>The way forward</title>
<p>After <italic>looking</italic> forward, human beings are the <italic>way</italic> forward. An interface is part of a complex biological/mechanical system. Control is the means to subject machines to the will of the operator, and expertise is required of the machine, the control, interface hardware and software and how the user responds to them. If the task is unclear or uncertain before it begins, full automation cannot be implemented. Reverting to a shared responsibility in task management between human and machine is the logical alternative. By research, development, education and cooperation with industry, a more productive and less stressful symbiosis of man and machine can evolve.</p>
