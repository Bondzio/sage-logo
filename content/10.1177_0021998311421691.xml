<abstract>
<p>This study investigated the mechanical and transport properties of the important factors of fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) for the design of durable concrete structures. The fibers that are commonly used in industry, such as 1% steel, 0.5% polypropylene (PP), and 0.75% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers, were evaluated. The addition of PP, PVA, and steel fibers, as they have been known, had little or no effect on compressive and tensile strengths but significantly affected postcracking behaviors and the critical transport mechanisms. The change of the permeable pores seems to depend on the material property of fibers between the fiber and the matrix interface. Among the fiber types used in this study, hook end steel fibers showed the best performance for both the mechanical and transport properties. Generally, as the permeable pore spaces increased, the strength as well as the resistance of transport properties also decreased. However, the effect of the permeable voids on the transport properties was much greater than that of the compressive strength. When the transport properties obtained are employed for the design of durable FRC, major properties such as the permeable voids and absorption by capillary action are important factors to be considered first for resisting movement of harmful substances into concrete.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311421691" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Building structures reinforced with fibers may improve flexural strength and toughness by resisting or controlling the initiation or propagation of cracks due to the bridging effect at the matrix–fiber interface. The fibers that are commonly used in industry are steel and polymer fibers. Throughout the past three decades, a greater number of studies have been published for mechanical properties than for transport properties, the latter of which are important factors in the design of a durable concrete structure. The ingress of deleterious materials, such as chlorides, sulfates, carbon dioxide, and moisture, into the inside of the concrete (resulting from repeated wet/dry, freeze/thaw cycles and corrosion of embedded steel reinforcement), normally degrades concrete structures. Therefore, the mechanism of transport properties as well as mechanical properties from the addition of fibers should be employed to make the structure more durable to environmental conditioning. The transport of water or chemical ions into concrete occurs through the complicated pore systems allowing continuous moisture movement. Although there are various physical and chemical mechanisms governing the accumulation of deleterious chemical ions in concrete, the primary transport mechanisms such as permeability of water, chloride diffusion and absorption, which are widely accepted durability indices, were studied in this investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311421691">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311421691">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aims of this study are to provide information, which can facilitate the effective design of durable concrete structures against various environments by evaluating the critical durability indices from the measurement of transport properties as well as mechanical properties as a result of the addition of fibers.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998311421691"><title>Specimen preparation</title>
<p>The materials used in this study were: (1) AASHTO cement type II, (2) 9.5 mm maximum size coarse aggregate having a bulk specific gravity of 2.28, and (3) fine aggregate having a specific gravity of 2.65 and a fineness modulus of 2.39. The fibers used in this research are polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and hook end steel fiber (steel). The properties of these fibers are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311421691">Table 1</xref>. The PP fiber is a smooth monofilament fiber with a high-quality alkali-, salt-, and acid-resistance. The PVA fiber is also a smooth monofilament fiber with a high-alkali resistance. The steel fibers are smooth and glued in bundles with hook ends for rapid introduction into drum mixers. The fiber volume fractions were as follows: 0.5% PP, 0.75% PVA, and 1% Steel. The control and fiber mix proportions used in the testing program are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311421691">Table 2</xref> and were applicable to bridge deck design (Concrete Class II) specified in the Standard Specification for Road and Bridge Construction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311421691">4</xref></sup> The following steps were used for all mixes. First, coarse and fine aggregate were mixed for approximately 1 min. A total of 50% of water was then added and the mixture was mixed for 1 min to allow absorption by the fine aggregate. Cement and the remaining water containing the set retarder and high-range water-reducing admixture were then added. The mixing was continued for another 2 min. Finally, fibers were added to the mix. Altogether, the mixing time was approximately 3–4 min to assure homogenous fiber distribution and to minimize segregation and fiber balling.

<p>For the mechanical and transport property tests, three cylinders were prepared for control mixtures, while wooden block molds (200 × 350 × 600 mm) were prepared for fiber mixtures to ensure uniform fiber distribution throughout the blocks and these were then cored after curing. In addition, slabs (100 × 500 × 350 mm) were prepared for a bending test and were sliced into smaller slabs (100 × 100 × 350 mm) after curing. The specimens were covered with a plastic sheet for 24 h. After demolding, the specimens were cured in a 100% relative humidity room at a temperature of 23 ± 2°C for 28 days.</p>

<p>A total of 12 cylindrical specimens of 100 × 200 mm were prepared for compressive, splitting, and pressure tensile tests. Compressive strength was measured in accordance with the American Standard Test Method (ASTM) C-39 standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311421691">5</xref></sup> and the splitting tensile test was performed in accordance with the ASTM C-496 standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311421691">6</xref></sup> The pressure tension test developed by the British Research Establishment in the United Kingdom as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311421691">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311421691">2</xref> was used to measure the tensile strength of concrete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421691">7</xref></sup> This test pressurizes the concrete specimen cylinder or core by means of an externally applied gas pressure with a rubber ring between a steel jacket and an end ring to prevent leakage of pressurized nitrogen gas. This applied pressure acts only upon the curved surface of the specimen, which is positioned within a pressure sleeve, since the ends of the cylinder project outside the pressurized area. Provided the specimen is saturated, an internal pore pressure develops in response to this applied pressure, acting equally in all directions. It is generally agreed that the maximum pressure of nitrogen gas is fundamentally equal to the tensile strength, though the failure mechanism is not perfectly understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311421691">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311421691">10</xref></sup> Additionally, percentage permeable pore spaces by ASTM C-642 standards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311421691">11</xref></sup> were measured to evaluate the effect of voids on concrete strength.

<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311421691">Table 3</xref>, it can be seen that the addition of PP and PVA fibers provides a slightly lower compressive strength than that for plain concrete, which is in good agreement with the reported results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311421691">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311421691">13</xref></sup> The reports explain that the nonuniform dispersing of the fibers due to the material property of fibers during the compaction process causes an increase of local porosity, which corresponds well with the results from the measurement of permeable pore spaces in this study. On the other hand, the addition of steel fibers having a slight reduction in permeable pore spaces shows a slight improvement in strength. The splitting and pressure tensile strengths for PP and PVA fiber mixes show a slight decrease by approximately 10–12%, while showing little reduction with the addition of steel fibers. Furthermore, the results of the splitting and pressure tensile tests are well matched with each other, even though the results of the pressure tensile strengths are slightly greater than those of splitting tensile strengths. The reason for this result may be the different surface structure of cored fiber specimens, which requires greater pressurized nitrogen gas to initiate matrix cracking as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311421691">Figure 3</xref>. An irregular failure surface from pressure tensile testing was also observed for all specimens. The slight strength improvement or reduction for fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) may be due to the increased or decreased permeable pore spaces surrounding fibers depending on the interfacial bonding properties between the fibers and the matrix.

<p>The test method specified in ASTM C 1609<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311421691">15</xref></sup> evaluated the flexural performance of FRC using the parameter derived from the load-deflection curve obtained by testing a simply supported beam under third-point loading, though the flexural testing was run in an open-loop control machine. This new test method is intended to replace that in ASTM C 1018-97. While the proposed new test method maintains the procedures for obtaining the flexural load-deflection curve described in C 1018-97, the analysis of the load-deflection curve completely differs.

After reaching peak load, the load gradually decreased. This may be due to the anchoring effect as well as the adhesive effect between the hook end steel fibers and the matrix. On the other hand, a rapid drop in the applied load was observed for PP and PVA specimens due to the instant debonding of the fibers subsequent to matrix cracking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311421691">17</xref></sup> Polyvinyl alcohol fiber-reinforced concrete (PVAFRC) showed an ascending branch during the initial part of the postcracking but at the later part of the loading they showed the pullout of fibers from the embedded matrix following the fiber–matrix debonding. Polypropylene fiber-reinforced concrete (PPFRC) showed significantly different postcracking behavior by carrying constant load up to crack propagation. This may be due to the effect of the fiber bridging showing a relatively high elongation rather than a pullout from the matrix.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311421691">Table 4</xref>, the PPFRC exhibited the lowest ARS compared with those of PVAFRC and SFRC, which are produced for application as structural fibers having relatively high tensile strength and modulus. Among fiber types, hook end steel fibers showed the greatest residual strength. On the other hand, when compared with the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021998311421691">Table 5</xref>, the residual strength and the toughness of PVA fibers at <italic>L</italic>/150 were slightly lower than those of PP fibers. Since the presence of PVA fibers does not provide further bridging stresses to resist the propagation of cracks at the deflection of 1 mm, the pullout of fibers from the matrix starts to induce a rapid fall in the applied load related to a significant drop in both the residual strength and toughness.

<p>Higher transport properties were shown with the addition of PP fibers than with the addition of plain and other fibers. A possible explanation is that the elongated interfacial transition zone resulting from the high permeable pores from the addition of PP fibers, which are relatively thin, long, and hydrophobic in nature, and provide a poor bond in the concrete matrix, acts as a route of ingress for the mass transport of water between the fiber and the matrix interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311421691">22</xref></sup> The high-modulus PVA fibers were reported to have a highly bonding effect in a cementitious matrix because of their effective distribution in the matrix, and because of the lack of deposition of <italic>CH</italic> products that consist of a quite porous layer in the interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311421691">23</xref></sup> However, in the case of coarse aggregate in the mix, unwanted air can be entrapped during mixing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311421691">24</xref></sup> This could be the reason why the addition of PVA fibers indicates relatively good performance of transport properties, even though the PVA fibers slightly increased the permeable pores in the hardened concrete. The addition of hook end steel fibers decreased the permeable voids in hardened concrete, corresponding well with the considerable reduction of transport properties. A possible explanation is that the incorporation of high-modulus hook end steel fibers that were also glued in bundles was well distributed in the final specimen and provided a high surface area for improved bonding in the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311421691">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311421691">26</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311421691">Figure 9</xref> shows that the introduction of PP and PVA fibers compared with plain concrete generally indicates very similar trends throughout the time tested and they have a low surface resistivity, which means high chloride ion permeability at the surface. After reaching peak point around 365 days, the electrical resistivity decreases slowly. The results for the addition of steel fibers are not a good indicator for chloride ion permeability because the electrically conductive materials of steel fibers can cause misleading results. Only plain concrete gradually increases surface resistance to permeability as the concrete surface hardens.

<sec id="sec7-0021998311421691"><title>Discussion of the experimental results</title>
<p>The addition of PP, PVA, and steel fibers, as they have been known, had little or no effect on compressive and tensile strengths but significantly affected postcracking behaviors and the transport mechanisms resulting from the change of the internal microstructure surrounding fibers. The modification of the permeable pore spaces seems to depend on the material properties of the fibers between the fiber and the matrix interface. PP fibers, which are hydrophobic in nature, have a smooth surface, a low tensile strength, and poor bonding in concrete, resulting in relatively high permeable pores, a high absorption rate, high permeability, high ionic diffusion, as well as low compressive, tensile, and flexural strength and toughness. The PVA fibers, which are relatively high tensile and have a high modulus, a rough surface, and good bonding in concrete, showed better performance for mechanical and transport properties compared with that of PP fibers. Hook end steel fibers, which have the highest tensile and modulus, rough surface structure, and good bonding in the matrix, showed the best performance for both mechanical and transport properties. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311421691">Figure 10</xref> shows the volume of permeable voids vs. the compressive strength, absorption rate, coefficients of water permeability, and ion diffusion with modified values in order to observe the effect of voids on material properties. The compressive strength was not noticeably affected by the change of permeable pore spaces. However, the change of the permeable pores in FRC significantly affected the mechanism of chloride ion diffusion as well as absorption by capillary action and permeability by pressurized water as a result of the modification ofthe microstructure surrounding fibers. It can be noticed that generally the effect of the permeable voids on the transport property was much greater than that of the compressive strength.

<p>In this article, the mechanical properties as well as the transport properties for FRC were measured and evaluated to provide valuable information for designing durable concrete structures against various environments. The conclusions based on the experimental results can be summarized as follows:
<list id="list1-0021998311421691" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The results of the splitting and pressure tensile tests are well matched with each other, but the pressure tensile strengths are slightly greater than those of splitting tensile strengths. The different surface structure of cored fiber specimens may require greater pressurized nitrogen gas to initiate matrix cracking.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The addition of PP, PVA, and hook end steel fibers significantly improved postcracking behaviors by developing bridging force in the wake region, such as the residual strength and toughness, and also affected the transport mechanisms due to the change of the internal microstructure in the interfacial zone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The addition of 0.5% PP fibers resulted in relatively high permeable pores, a high absorption rate, high permeability, high ionic diffusion, as well as low compressive, tensile, and flexural strength compared with plain concrete mix.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The addition of 0.75% PVA fibers had relatively good performance in the mechanical and transport properties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The addition of 1% hook end steel fibers had the best performance for postcracking behavior by developing the excellent fiber-bridging pressure against crack propagation as well as transport properties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Generally, as the permeable pore spaces increased, the strength as well as the resistance of transport properties also decreased. When transport properties obtained are employed for the design of durable FRC, the volume of permeable voids and the absorption by capillary action are important factors to be considered for the critical durability indices.</p></list-item>
