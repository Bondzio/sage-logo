<p>‘The ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed the world is ruled by little else.’ Keynes, in his <italic>General Theory</italic> peroration may have overegged the pudding but there can be little doubt that, as regards the short twentieth century, ideas were a potent force; ordering the past, making sense of the present, delineating the trajectory of the future, exciting and inspiring, and leaving many millions of dead at the hands of those who succumbed to their appeal or used them to justify the pursuit of their ends. To make sense of and assess the nature and impact of political ideologies in what Hobsbawm has termed the ‘age of extremes’ is therefore an undertaking as important as it is ambitious.</p>
<p>Thompson’s work is structured around three periods – the ‘age of catastrophe, 1914–45’, the ‘golden years’ of the global economy 1945–73 and the ‘crisis’ years of 1973–91 – and four ideologies – Liberalism, Conservatism, Communism and Fascism. The economic and social contexts are established for each period and the ‘key political ideologies’ discussed with reference to these. The volume is also global in ambition, though, inevitably, some areas receive only cursory attention and, particularly as regards the inter-war period, the emphasis is essentially Eurocentric. Nonetheless it is a bold attempt to provide a wide-ranging survey of the thinkers, as well as the ideas and the movements they inspired, which together helped shape the history of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>However, the main problem with the work is that the broad categories used and the extent of the ideological and geographical ground to be covered militates against any extended or nuanced discussion of particular thinkers or subcategories of the systems of thought being considered. So, for example, ‘social democracy’ is melded with liberalism, having ‘evolved during and immediately following the First World War into … the liberal ideology’s leftwing’, while under the banner of post-war liberalism ‘of the Right’ we have the unlikely grouping of Bell and Crosland, von Mises and Hayek, Isaiah Berlin, Karl Popper, Raymond Aron and Albert Camus. Further, in the same section, <italic>Encounter</italic> sits cheek by jowl with <italic>Readers’ Digest</italic> and Billy Graham, while Irving Kristol and Reinhold Niebuhr keep close company. As to the post-war liberalism ‘of the left’, we have Swedish social democracy’ (half a page), ‘liberalism and colonial nationalism’, ‘liberalism and black liberation’, ‘liberalism and feminism’, ‘liberalism and the cultural revolution’. Similarly, in the section on the putative post-1973 coalescence of Liberalism and Conservatism, postmodernism is sandwiched between the French ‘New Philosophers’ and the ‘Chicago Boys’.</p>
<p>Moreover, leaving aside the issue of strange bedfellows, there is a tendency throughout the work to move jerkily between individual thinkers, the thematic or movement-focused treatment of ideas, and particular geographical locations, leaving the reader both breathless and a little disoriented in the effort to keep pace with the narrative drive. And this does not allow for a sustained treatment of thinkers or ideas, however much it may lend itself to the polemic with which the work is punctuated; a polemic from which none emerge unscathed. For Thompson’s work is certainly premised on the sentiments of the Stranglers: ‘no more heroes anymore’.</p>
<p>By way of illustration, and focusing just on the liberal left: Orwell and Ignazio Silone are ‘snitches’; Sidney Hook, James Burnham, Isaiah Berlin, Andre Malraux, Arthus Schlesinger, Lionel Trilling et al. are all damned for their more or less complicit association with <italic>Encounter</italic>. Crosland’s <italic>Future of Socialism</italic> is ‘short-sighted and complacent’, ‘not even welfare capitalism’; Bell’s <italic>End of Ideology</italic> is a fantasy and an illusion. Swedish social democracy by the early 1960s is ‘ideologically at a loss to define its long-term perspective for Swedish society’. Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement’s ‘degree of eventual ideological incorporation can be indicated by the establishment of a Martin Luther King Day in the US calendar’; while ‘history has demonstrated that neither the sexual revolution, feminism nor black civil rights has been incompatible with liberal regimes’, with ‘their achievements likely to persist [only] as long as the consumer society does’. Given all this it is unsurprising that the author believes there is more than a little mileage in Fukuyama’s <italic>The End of History</italic>. To a greater or lesser extent these statements, or at least some of them, may be defensible. But this kind of litany, sustained throughout the text, is ultimately wearisome, where it is not unhelpful to an understanding of the ideas and thinkers being discussed.</p>
<p>All this is compounded in some sense by the author’s failure to take a position. Of course publishing with Pluto, and the inflections of the discussion throughout, position him on the Left. But it is not immediately apparent what, if any, genre of socialist political economy merits approbation, or has a future. As a whole, therefore, in its tendency to condemn rather than engage, the volume has a distinctly misanthropic tone. But perhaps that is the appropriate trope for the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The work does have value as an introductory text; one clearly aimed at students of twentieth-century history and political thought. It is also a work that will encourage such an audience to read more widely in the history of ideas, conveying as it does the excitement and importance of intellectual history. And that is something to be welcomed. However, it should also be said that such further reading is a necessary adjunct to a work of this kind.</p>
