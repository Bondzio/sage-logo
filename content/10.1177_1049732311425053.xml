<abstract>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coupled with routine Papanicolaou (Pap) tests can prevent pervasive HPV infections causing cervical cancer. However, both HPV vaccination rates and Pap testing rates in Appalachian Kentucky are lower among all age groups than the rest of the United States. We recruited 19 young women residing in Appalachian Kentucky from university-based and rural clinical settings for group and individual interviews. After considering an integrated behavioral framework, we illustrate these women’s perspectives by detailing five themes, including (a) experiential beliefs pose barriers to performing behaviors, (b) three vaccine doses complicate vaccination intention, (c) women have misunderstandings about HPV and the HPV vaccination function, (d) normative influences cue action (and inaction), and (e) specific environmental and contextual barriers exist to performing cervical cancer prevention behaviors in Appalachian Kentucky. These findings related to cervical cancer prevention in Appalachian Kentucky have implications for health-message design and clinical practice.</p>

<p>In 2010, more than 12,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer were diagnosed in the United States (U.S.), and more than 4,200 women are expected to die from the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311425053">American Cancer Society, 2010</xref>). In Kentucky, the cervical cancer incidence rate (9.0 per 100,000 women; 95% confidence interval [CI]) is significantly higher than the U.S. rate (7.9 per 100,000 women; 95% CI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311425053">U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, Appalachian Kentucky has one of the very highest rates of cervical cancer in the country (10.8 per 100,000 women; 95% CI), significantly higher than the rate for the rest of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311425053">Kentucky Cancer Registry, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Persistent infections of high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (types 16 and 18) are recognized as the major cause of cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311425053">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311425053">National Cancer Institute, 2008</xref>). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of two vaccines to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the United States. In 2006, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted unanimously to recommend the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) for women ages 11 to 26 years that protects against four high-risk strains of HPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311425053">Harris, 2006</xref>). Since that time, the ACIP also endorsed the bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) for use against two high-risk strains of the virus.</p>
<p>Although vaccination represents a major advancement in preventing HPV infections, and thereby cervical cancer in women, many women choose not to receive the vaccine or have not completed the three-dose regimen. Vaccine compliance, defined as completing the three-dose regimen, has been in the range of 26.7% (25.2-28.2; 95% CI) according to 2009 National Immunization Survey estimates of female adolescents aged 13 to 17 years in the United States. Vaccination rates are significantly lower in some U.S. populations, with the Kentucky rate at 19.5% (13.8-26.9; 95% CI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311425053">CDC, 2010a</xref>). Moreover, vaccine acceptance and compliance remain lower among young adult women ages 18 to 26 years, who are thought to benefit from a catch-up vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311425053">Crosby, Casey, Vanderpool, Collins, &amp; Moore, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311425053">Moore, Crosby, Young, &amp; Charnigo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311425053">Vanderpool, Casey, &amp; Crosby, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to vaccinating against HPV infections, Papanicolaou (Pap) testing is a tool medical professionals use for the early detection of precancerous cells on the cervix. Despite Pap testing guidelines established by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, many women forego their first Pap tests until later in life, or do not follow up after abnormal Pap test results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311425053">Calle, Flanders, Thun, &amp; Martin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311425053">Eggleston, Coker, Das, Cordray, &amp; Luchok, 2007</xref>). Low Pap testing rates constitute a serious public health concern because the majority of invasive cervical cancer diagnoses occur in women who have not followed the recommended schedule of Pap testing, allowing too much time to lapse since their last tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425053">Hildesheim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311425053">Janerich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311425053">Leyden et al., 2005</xref>). In Kentucky, data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) indicate that 18.3% of women above the age of 18 years have not received a Pap test within the past 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311425053">CDC, 2010c</xref>). In the Appalachian Kentucky region, that rate worsens to 22% in adult women overall and 32% of women residing in the eight-county Kentucky River Area Development District (KR-ADD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311425053">Kentucky Department of Public Health, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Rural Appalachian Kentucky is characterized as a National Institutes of Health medically underserved area in the United States, where health disparities are particularly pronounced and particularly difficult to address in the area’s mountain communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311425053">Behringer &amp; Friedell, 2006</xref>). Twenty-nine counties in this Appalachian Kentucky region are among the 100 poorest counties in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311425053">Appalachian Regional Commission, 2011</xref>). Built environments, in which poor road infrastructure and relative geographic isolation make accessing health services difficult, exacerbate individuals’ economic disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311425053">Vanderpool et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311425053">Behringer et al. (2007)</xref> also identified several cultural characteristics that affect Appalachians’ willingness to engage with the health care system, including “a general lack of assertiveness among Appalachians that influences their health care”; additionally, “programs and services . . . seen as charity are often rejected” (p. 43). Despite these cultural concerns, Appalachian Kentuckians recognize the serious health threats in their communities and desire solutions for these problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425053">Schoenberg, Hatcher, &amp; Dignan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Several aspects of living in Appalachian mountain communities contribute to higher rates of cervical cancer mortality and morbidity compared to other areas of the United States. The sociocultural conditions of relative geographic isolation, poverty, high rates of tobacco use, lack of state-contracted obstetrician or gynecological service providers within a 1-hour drive, and other barriers to high-quality care and treatment services make prevention of cervical cancer because of persistent HPV infections an important strategy to reduce the disparate burden of cervical cancer on the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311425053">Vanderpool et al., 2011</xref>). Young adult women in Appalachian Kentucky are of particular concern to researchers in the fight against cervical cancer, given higher incidence rates, limited awareness of HPV, lower rates of Pap testing, and lower acceptance of the HPV vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425053">Amonkar &amp; Madhavan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425053">Blanchard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311425053">Lengerich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311425053">Vanderpool et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425053">Yabroff et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is imperative that researchers strive to understand the unique perspectives about cervical health expressed by women who live in this area, to encourage ways to reduce this disease burden. For the present study, we sought to understand young adult women’s perceptions of HPV, cervical cancer, the HPV vaccine, and Pap testing by conducting formative research to support a targeted health communication intervention to increase HPV vaccine uptake and regular Pap testing among young women in rural Appalachian Kentucky, with a special focus on the eight-county KR-ADD.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311425053">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>One model that is useful in understanding perceptions, attitudes, and knowledge about health behaviors—and intention to perform these behaviors—is the Integrated Behavioral Model (IBM). The Model was developed by a National Institute of Mental Health working group and derives its main components from overlapping constructs featured in five health behavior change theories: the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), Theory of Interpersonal Behavior, and the Health Belief Model (HBM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311425053">Fishbein et al., 1992</xref>). The IBM offers a synthesis of theoretical constructs thought to be critical antecedents to health behavior and behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311425053">Noar, Chabot, &amp; Zimmerman, 2008</xref>). These constructs include knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, norms, personal agency, environmental constraints, and behavioral intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425053">Montaño &amp; Kasprzyk, 2008</xref>) that are particularly relevant to vaccination and other preventive health behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311425053">Painter et al., 2010</xref>). Scholars have considered how these constructs might have overlapping influences (Noar et al.). For example, limited knowledge about cervical cancer and HPV might shape both behavioral beliefs and attitudes toward HPV vaccination and Pap testing, which contribute to an individual’s behavioral intention. Therefore, given the complexity of the Model, it is useful as an integrative approach to guide formative research assessing antecedents to preventive health behavior (Montaño &amp; Kasprzyk).</p>
<p>Researchers applying the IBM posit that attitudes, perceived norms, and self-efficacy are antecedents to behavioral intention; behavioral intention is situated as the most direct antecedent to actual behavior. The IBM also includes four additional direct antecedents to behavioral intention: skills/abilities to perform the behavior, salience of the behavior, environmental constraints, and habit. Researchers have tested the Model to successfully explain and predict HIV prevention and mammography intention and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311425053">Kasprzyk, Montaño, &amp; Fishbein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311425053">Montaño, Thompson, Taylor, &amp; Mahloch, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the Model helps researchers identify facilitators and constraints to HIV prevention and cancer screening behavior in high-risk populations (Kasprzyk et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311425053">Montaño, Selby, Somkin, Bhat, &amp; Nadel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311425053">Montaño et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311425053">von Haeften, Fishbein, Kasprzyk, &amp; Montaño, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Central to the purpose of this study, we utilized the IBM to guide formative research and message development to ensure that the persuasive health message elements in our intervention addressed four key antecedents to behavioral change. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425053">Montaño and Kasprzyk (2008)</xref> argued that researchers identify four types of critical information: (a) attitudes about performing the behavior, defined as an “individual’s behavioral beliefs about outcomes of performing the behavior weighted by evaluations of those outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311425053">Kasprzyk et al., 1998</xref>, p. 1560); (b) beliefs about performing the behavior, defined as someone’s thoughts on “the likelihood that performance of the behavior will result in certain outcomes” (Montaño &amp; Kasprzyk, p. 72); (c) normative influences, defined as “whether important referent individuals approve or disapprove of performing the behavior, weighted by his or her motivation to comply with those referents” (Montaño &amp; Kasprzyk, p. 71); and (d) contextual and environmental facilitators and barriers to performing the behavior, defined as “facilitating conditions, concerned with characteristics of the individual or the environment that make it easier or more difficult to perform the behavior” (Kasprzyk et al., p. 1561). This model therefore can aid in addressing a gap in the empirical literature with respect to understanding young adult women’s multiple and perhaps conflicting attitudes, beliefs, normative influences, contextual and environmental facilitators, and barriers to performing HPV vaccination and routine Pap testing.</p>
<p>Specifically, the purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of HPV vaccination and Pap testing among a sample of medically underserved rural young women from Appalachian Kentucky to better inform health-message development and clinical practice. To provide patients with culturally sensitive and relevant information that supports informed patient decision making, clinic-based communication tools must be sensitive to the unique informational needs and communicative concerns of medically underserved communities in relation to HPV vaccination and Pap testing. To date, one study included the IBM as a testable framework to gather formative research for a vaccination (influenza) intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311425053">Painter et al., 2010</xref>). However, Painter and colleagues’ research predetermined, in an a priori sense, the relevant measures for operationalizing IBM constructs. In the case of HPV vaccination, especially given its relative novelty, the literature base was insufficient to assume what critical message factors relevant to behavioral adoption would emerge in conversations about HPV vaccination and Pap testing in this 18- to 26-year-old study population.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Following the recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425053">Montaño and Kasprzyk (2008)</xref>, we utilized qualitative methods, including small group and individual interviews, to gather information about HPV vaccination and routine Pap testing from young adult women living or recently residing in Appalachian Kentucky. This qualitative approach to understanding how young women from the region speak about these behaviors in their everyday language was critical to support the broader work of the Rural Cancer Prevention Center (RCPC), a CDC-funded prevention research center, to improve regional cervical cancer prevention efforts. A qualitative approach using the IBM as a sensitizing framework allowed us to identify issues relevant to HPV vaccination and routine Pap testing that shape young women’s attitudes, behavioral beliefs, normative influences, and contextual and environmental influences emergent from informants’ open-ended responses.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732311425053">
<title>Participants and Recruitment</title>
<p>With support from the RCPC staff and two research assistants, we recruited women to participate in seven small group interview sessions. Our recruitment efforts resulted in five small group and two individual interviews (<italic>N</italic> = 19) exploring women’s perceptions of the HPV vaccine and Pap testing, and more generally, HPV and cervical cancer. Participants included a convenience sample of young adult women currently or recently residing in the KR-ADD or adjacent service districts. All participants were White and spoke English as their primary language. Study participants ranged in age from 18 to 26 years, with a median age of 20.</p>
<p>Women were recruited from two locations: the campus of a large state university near the KR-ADD and on site at a KR-ADD medical clinic in Appalachian Kentucky. Eligible participants were women between the ages of 18 and 26 years who had received or had decided not to receive the HPV vaccine, and currently or recently resided in one of 29 eastern Kentucky counties (Bell, Breathitt, Carter, Clay, Elliott, Estill, Floyd, Harlan, Jackson, Johnson, Knott, Knox, Laurel, Lawrence, Lee, Leslie, Letcher, Magoffin, Martin, McCreary, Menifee, Morgan, Owsley, Perry, Pike, Powell, Rockcastle, Whitley, and Wolfe) or received medical care from the large KR-ADD medical clinic (serving the 29 counties). From January to April, 2010, women were recruited for small group interviews using (a) email messages sent to young adult women from the KR-ADD region who met eligibility guidelines and who were enrolled as students at the university (all of whom were eligible for student health services, including HPV vaccination), (b) fliers distributed to a campus organization serving the targeted population area (first-generation college students from the Appalachian Kentucky target region), and (c) personal on-site recruitment strategies in Appalachian Kentucky coordinated by the RCPC’s community liaison, who posted and distributed fliers to potentially eligible young adult women at the local clinic. Young adult women meeting eligibility guidelines were also notified about this study through a general solicitation from the university Department of Communication’s research participant pool (including more than 3,500 students in courses fulfilling general undergraduate studies degree requirements).</p>
<p>The university institutional review board and university public relations approved all recruitment strategies. The recruitment messages generally included the request that women aged 18 to 26 years who had received or decided not to receive the HPV vaccine participate in a study about women’s health (i.e., HPV vaccination, Pap testing, cervical cancer, and HPV), details of the eligibility requirements (if necessary), the potential benefits from participating in this study for their community, and the length of and compensation for the interview. For example, the recruitment flyer used in the Appalachian Kentucky clinic advertised a “Young Women’s Health Research Study” and a bold headline asked, “Would you be interested in being part of a University research study about the HPV vaccine?” The flier included eligibility qualifications, indicated that participants would be compensated, and asked that interested individuals contact the individual at the clinic who was the study’s recruitment coordinator by telephone or email. The local recruitment coordinator then followed up on individual inquiries. A similar approach was used when the study was advertised to the targeted student group on campus.</p>
<p>For recruiting within the student research study online bulletin board system, the study was referred to as the “HPV, Cervical Cancer, and the HPV Vaccine Study,” to distinguish it from the other health studies listed. The recruitment information also included a call for participation in a 1.5- to 2-hour focus group, and indicated, “You will be asked to answer interview questions about women’s health issues, perceptions of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), and the HPV vaccine.” The authors and two research assistants then contacted women who indicated interest in the study through email, phone messages, or within the electronic bulletin board system to schedule an interview session.</p>
<p>The recruitment strategy targeting both vaccinated and unvaccinated women as eligible participants yielded a final sample of 6 unvaccinated women and 13 women who had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Among the vaccinated group, 3 women indicated that they had not returned for the second dose. Women’s past Pap testing behavior was not considered during recruitment; among the 19 participants, 2 women had never received a Pap test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311425053">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Before beginning the research session, all participants signed an informed consent form approved by the university’s institutional review board and received either a $15 gift card (for those participants recruited from the clinic or for student participants who did not need course credit) or course credit (for those student participants enrolled in a university course needing to fulfill the requirement of participating in a research study or alternative research assignment). Interviews lasted between 40 and 90 minutes. We audio recorded the sessions and had the audio tapes professionally transcribed. Pseudonyms were used to facilitate in-vivo quotation identification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311425053">
<title>Protocol</title>
<p>We designed a semistructured group interview protocol for this project, and took turns serving as focus group moderators. The goal of this approach was to extend the Integrated Behavioral Model’s conceptual framework to better understand these young adult women’s perceptions of HPV vaccination and Pap testing. First, we gathered information on basic knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer from each participant in a round-robin approach. Each woman in a group interview was prompted to respond to every question, while at the same time, women often engaged in dialogue with one another, concurring with previous speakers’ stories or offering counter narratives. Questions and probes included, “What words or phrases come to mind when you hear the term cervical cancer? What words or phrases come to mind when you hear the term human papillomavirus or HPV? Tell me what you know about HPV.” After these broad questions were asked, we asked participants targeted questions about critical constructs relevant to IBM extension and application. Recall that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425053">Montaño and Kasprzyk (2008)</xref> argued that four types or categories of information should be gathered in formative research using the IBM. Given that we sought information about two behaviors (HPV vaccination and Pap testing), targeted questions within each of the four IBM categories included (a) attitudes about performing the behavior (e.g., “What concerns do you have about the HPV vaccine?”), (b) beliefs about performing the behavior (e.g., “Why did you decide to get vaccinated or decide not to get vaccinated?”), (c) normative influences (e.g., “Who played a role in your decision to get the HPV vaccine?”), and (d) contextual and environmental facilitators and barriers to performing the behavior (e.g., “What do you think are the main reasons young women living in rural Kentucky would not go to the doctor and get a Pap test? What do you think are the main reasons young women living in rural Kentucky would not get the HPV vaccine?”). We used the same round-robin approach to elicit individual responses and dialogue among group interview participants.</p>
<p>After respondents answered questions designed to identify the range of participant attitudes, beliefs, normative influences, and facilitators or barriers to HPV vaccination and Pap testing, we asked them to respond to preliminary drafts of persuasive health messages designed to improve HPV vaccination and Pap testing schedule adherence in the target population. During this message-testing section of the interview, we asked the participants whether the persuasive health messages addressed their concerns and potential obstacles to HPV vaccination and Pap testing. We also asked the women to think about how they would explain to women like themselves the benefits of the HPV vaccine and routine Pap testing. The data we present in this article derive from the aforementioned set of questions; we presented preliminary findings from the message-testing phase elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311425053">Cohen et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311425053">McGladrey, Cohen, &amp; Head, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732311425053">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed all interview transcripts using a framework analysis methodology, a qualitative method of sequential inductive data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311425053">Ritchie &amp; Spencer, 1994</xref>). First, along with a research assistant, we read transcripts and met to discuss key ideas and recurring themes, and then to develop an organizational model for the themes. Using extant IBM theory and prior research examining antecedents to HPV vaccination and Pap testing, we began by identifying key concepts as initial coding categories. Next, we met to discuss operational definitions for categories from the IBM and whether there were distinct related constructs or IBM subthemes presented from these data. Utilizing these categorical constructs, the first and second authors independently annotated the transcripts by theme. We clarified key focal constructs, and reexamined the annotated transcript together by noting divergent themes or unique findings and how they related to or supplanted the initial IBM framework. Then, the first author placed in-vivo quotations from the interviews into a master outline consisting of framework headings and subheadings (themes). The second author reviewed the charting and, where disagreements were found, negotiated the placement of in-vivo quotations until the authors reached consensus about the primary data-driven themes. Finally, we considered existing theory and research regarding young adult women’s perceptions of the HPV vaccine to identify novel links between IBM concepts and generated themes underlying young adult women’s perceptions concerning the HPV vaccine and Pap testing evident from the interviews.</p>

<p>The results presented in this article are organized around five specific themes which emerged from the data analysis: (a) experiential beliefs pose barriers to performing behaviors, (b) three vaccine doses complicate vaccination intention, (c) women have misunderstandings about HPV and the HPV vaccination function, (d) normative influences cue action (and inaction), and (e) specific environmental and contextual barriers exist to performing cervical cancer prevention behaviors in Appalachian Kentucky. The first three themes generally explained the IBM category or framework of beliefs about performing the behavior. The last two closely paralleled the constructs of normative influences and contextual and environmental facilitators and barriers to performing the behavior relevant to the integrated model of behavior prediction. Participants also voiced their attitudes about HPV vaccination and Pap testing in varied ways, which is especially evident in the depiction of the first theme discussed below. Notably, attitudes evident from participants’ willingness or reticence to receive the HPV vaccine series or Pap testing were embedded in, entangled with, and often subordinated to the thematic beliefs about the benefits/risks to doing so, normative influences from their families and communities, and the contextual and environmental facilitators and barriers to performing the behavior.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732311425053">
<title>Experiential Beliefs Pose Barriers to Performing Behaviors</title>
<p>Participants indicated that past experiences with both the HPV vaccination and Pap testing were serious barriers to performing the behavior again. Four women associated the HPV vaccine with a “bee sting,” two women described the shot as “burning,” and two women believed it was “more painful than a regular shot [injection].” Overall, participants indicated that the pain of the shot made them reticent to return for the remaining two doses. In addition to experiencing the pain of the first shot, some women had heard that the remaining shots (doses two and three) were more painful than the first. Women seemed confused about whether the actual vaccine composition changed from dose to dose, or whether their body’s immune systems reacted differently to each shot. Isabelle said she had heard that “it’s going to be a little bit more painful for the second and third one,” but she believed “you wasted the first one then if you don’t go back and do it.”</p>
<p>Participants also had negative experiential beliefs associated with the Pap test. Two women used the word <italic>awkward</italic> to describe their experiences, 5 women believed it was “very uncomfortable,” and two women identified the procedure as “horrible.” In addition, some participants noted that the limited choice in health care providers was a barrier to receiving a Pap test. Mary said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know at least some places it’s kind of hard to get to a doctor, and if there are doctors, maybe you don’t like them. Maybe you’ve had a bad experience with them or you’re uncomfortable with them or something.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, it seemed that the past experiences of Pap testing were more negative than the past experiences of HPV vaccination. Georgia argued, “It’s one thing to go in and roll up your sleeve, and it’s another thing to pull down your pants.”</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732311425053">
<title>Three Vaccine Doses Complicate Vaccination Intention</title>
<p>In addition to indicating the pain of the shot as a barrier to completing the three doses, some participants spoke about the difficulties in adhering to the three-dose schedule of the HPV vaccine. First, participants expressed confusion about the number of doses they were supposed to get. Wendy said, “I thought, well, maybe with one shot, you know I’ll just [be] a little bit protected from it.” Another participant, Randi, admitted that she “didn’t even know there were three shots involved with it until I came in.” In addition to knowledge about the three-dose regimen, participants described how a lack of time was a constraint. Specific to this age group, participants noted that busy schedules were not always conducive to following up on the vaccine. For example, Wendy said that young adult women in Appalachian Kentucky “probably work and go to school”; Stephanie believed women “have other things to do” than come to the clinic for a follow-up shot. Participants were also unsure about what they should do if they did miss the second and third shots. Olivia asked, “Do you have to start over if you like, wait six months or something?” It was clear that many women did not understand the three-dose regimen of the vaccine, or they experienced significant trouble in following the regimen, complicating their intentions to receive doses two and three.</p>

<sec id="section10-1049732311425053">
<title>Women Misunderstand HPV and the HPV Vaccine Function</title>
<p>Participants did not fully understand the nature of HPV, nor did they fully comprehend the way a vaccination works. Some women believed that HPV is genetic: “Isn’t it like genetic?” (Trisha). Some women knew that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but were unsure how it was spread. It was particularly evident that participants were unaware that HPV can be spread skin-to-skin, as indicated by Brandi, who said, “I thought, you know, it had to be . . . the whole way,” indicating that she believed two people had to have sexual intercourse to transmit HPV. Other women believed that HPV could be both genetic and spread from person to person, as indicated by Isabelle, who said, “Well it’s, some of it’s genetic, but you can also somehow pass it.”</p>
<p>Although some participants had poor knowledge about the nature of HPV, many women indicated poor awareness of HPV as an STI. These participants associated HPV with cervical cancer, completely overlooking the sexually transmitted nature of the disease. When asked about cervical cancer, women said things like, “Yeah, it’s the HPV” (Natalie). One woman, Jenna, said that her “parents talked to [her] about every other STD [sexually transmitted disease],” but not HPV. Hannah believed that people from her community were uneducated about what the vaccine prevented; she said, “Many people see the cervical cancer . . . but they see that and overlook the HPV part of it.” In addition, some women indicated poor awareness of HPV as a disease. Georgia noted, “I didn’t even hear about it until I was in high school.” Another participant, Hannah, said that she did not hear about it until she was in college, when she had “a family class that we talked about it . . . but that was last semester, so I kind of forgot all my knowledge.” Other women indicated that they had not heard about HPV until someone close to them had the infection, as described by Carrie, who said, “I had never heard about it until one of my best friends got it.” Associating HPV with cervical cancer as well as having poor awareness of HPV as a disease led many women to have poor knowledge of HPV as a highly contagious STI.</p>
<p>In addition to not fully understanding the nature of HPV or being aware of the infection as distinct from the vaccination, many women did not understand the role of a vaccination in preventing a disease. Vaccinations must be given before exposure to a disease so that the body can build up an immunity; this is evident in the CDC’s recommendation that “the best way a person can be sure to get the most benefit from HPV vaccination is to complete all three doses before beginning sexual activity” and is why the vaccine is approved for girls as young as 9 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311425053">CDC, 2010b</xref>). Despite this, many participants indicated that they believed (or alternatively, that people in their communities believed) that the vaccine was not needed until beginning sexual activity. For instance, Georgia, who had decided not to receive the vaccine, noted that although every woman should be aware of the vaccine, she believed that only certain women should receive the vaccine because “it’s like, if you’re sexually active.” Trisha said, “Most people like that live up my road are old-fashioned Baptists.” She went on to say that these people’s reaction to young women receiving the vaccine would be, “Well, they don’t need this; they’re not having sex until they’re married.” Misunderstanding HPV as well as misunderstanding how vaccines function posed barriers to vaccination for some women.</p>

<title>Normative Influences Provide Cues to Action (or Inaction)</title>
<p>Women’s decisions to get a Pap test or receive the HPV vaccine were moderated by important others in their social networks. Consistent with prior research, mothers played a key role in young women’s decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311425053">Hopfer &amp; Clippard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311425053">Krieger, Kam, Katz, &amp; Roberto, 2011</xref>). Mothers could play a supportive role: Abby said, “My mom, she’s the one that suggested it,” when discussing her first Pap test. Mothers could also help to alleviate fears associated with Pap testing. For example, Katie recalled, “I remember my first appointment. I was scared to death. I made my mom come in with me.” Even among these young adult women, it was clear that mothers could play a positive role in the vaccination decision, as well. Diane said that her mother “prompted her to receive the vaccine.” Laura remembered that she did not want to receive the vaccine, and said, “If it was my choice, at the time I wouldn’t have gotten it . . . just because I’m terrified of shots and I don’t like needles and stuff like that, but she was very, ‘No, you’re getting it.’”</p>
<p>Alternatively, mothers could hinder vaccination and Pap testing. Some women expressed reticence in telling their parents about wanting a Pap test or getting the vaccination, because they feared their mothers (or both parents) would disapprove. Brandi recalled not telling her mother about her first Pap test in high school, and said, “I think a lot of girls . . . like if they want to go, then they’re afraid to ask. Like they’re afraid that their parents, you know, they’re going to get in trouble if they ask.” These young women believed that their parents would perceive their wanting to get a Pap test as being related to their being sexually active. Some women adopted the story of having an irregular period as an excuse to receive birth control pills, a pelvic examination, or a Pap test. For some women, like Emily, simply asking their mothers if they could make an appointment with a gynecologist was “like coming out and saying, ‘Oh Mom, I’m being sexually active. Let’s go to the gynecologist,’” as opposed to the excuse of irregular periods with which Emily could claim, “That’s like, ‘Oh, well, I’m having pain and irregular periods,’ and she’s like, ‘Okay, let’s go.’” Mothers could also play a negative role in their daughters’ decision to get vaccinated. Olivia said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s sometimes complicated for girls, or uncomfortable to go to their mom and be like, “Hey, I want this vaccine,” . . . like, “I’m not sexually active,” but maybe they [the mothers] don’t believe them [the girls], or they [the girls] think that they [the mothers] won’t believe them.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the role of mothers, participants indicated that close girlfriends played a positive role in deciding to become vaccinated. Mary said, “One of my close friends has HPV . . . and then I got the shot after she had it.” Another woman, Hannah, said that she had not considered getting the vaccine “because nobody I know has it,” but believed that she would get the vaccine “if somebody that I knew got it,” because it would make it more of a reality. These positive and negative normative influences seemed to provide important cues to action or inaction in terms of influencing young women to get a Pap test or become vaccinated against HPV.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732311425053">
<title>Environmental and Contextual Barriers Exist to Performing Behaviors in Appalachian Kentucky</title>
<p>The participants identified two barriers to performing the behaviors (vaccination and Pap testing) that were specific to living in Appalachian Kentucky. First, participants noted that cost played a large role in deciding to have the vaccination or receive a Pap test. The cost constraint was especially evident in communities in which preventive health was not always a priority. Diane said that she would put off going to the doctor because of cost, even if she believed she really needed to go. In addition, many people in the area do not have health insurance. Randi said that women are told, “You know, they need to have a Pap test and stuff,” but said that was not always possible, because, “Well, I can’t pay for that.” Even in state health department clinics that provide Pap testing on a sliding scale, women must pay for laboratory fees, which can be cost-prohibitive. Furthermore, despite state-sponsored follow-up care for cervical cancer, the lack of state-contracted gynecological providers means that women might have to travel between 1 and 3 hours outside of the region to receive follow-up treatment after an abnormal Pap test. Some women had received the vaccine or a Pap test when they were still on their parents’ insurance, but some of the participants noted the difficulty in paying for care once they became independent. Stephanie said, “I was old enough to be off my dad’s insurance. I had no insurance, and I’m sitting there thinking, ‘What am I going to do?’”</p>
<p>Second, participants indicated that Appalachian Kentuckians seriously value their privacy, especially when it comes to matters of sexual health, and that it was difficult to maintain privacy in their small communities. This was especially true when making a visit to a clinic for a reproductive health appointment, which people in the community assume is an indicator of sexual activity. Carrie said, “Like one time I ran into somebody I knew. I just thought I was going to die.” Emily noted that many girls from her home town “would go to like, the next county over to their health department . . . so that no one would see them.” There was a certain stigma associated with visiting the health department clinics that typically focused their services on well-baby visits, contraception, Pap testing, and other STD detection and treatment services that can be provided by nurse case managers.</p>
<p>A unique finding in this study related to the issue of maintaining privacy is the popularity of an online social Web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Topix.com">Topix.com</ext-link>) used by members in the community to spread gossip. For instance, Trisha set up the scenario of a woman walking into a local obstetrics/gynecology clinic and an observer saying, “What was [she] doing in Dr. Smith’s office?”—resulting in a posting on the Web site “ten seconds later.” Immediately in focus groups in which Topix.com was mentioned, women exchanged knowing looks, acknowledging that the site was well known for spreading rumors. The perceived lack of privacy posed a significant barrier for the women, especially younger women, making a trip to the clinic for Pap testing and HPV vaccination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several implications for improving HPV vaccination and Pap testing in Appalachian Kentucky emerged from these five themes. As with any health behavior, the unique perspective of the patient can have an effect on whether she will perform the behavior or, in the case of routine Pap testing and receiving three doses of the HPV vaccine, whether she will continue to perform the behavior. The findings from this study, in which we used the IBM as a framework for gathering information about health behaviors, suggest important implications for both health-communication campaign message design and health care practices in Appalachian Kentucky clinics.</p>
<sec id="section14-1049732311425053">
<title>Implications for Message Design</title>
<p>Three clear message-design implications emerged from findings that respond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425053">Montaño and Kasprzyk’s (2008)</xref> recommendations for collecting information in formative research following the IBM. First, consistent with prior research in Ohio Appalachia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425053">Katz, Wewers, Single, &amp; Paskett, 2007</xref>), this study shows that there are a number of barriers to cervical cancer screening among this medically underserved population. Beyond changes in the sociocultural environment, these findings suggest that improved clinical communication strategies should seek to reduce uncertainty about Pap testing. Women expressed experiential beliefs and uncertainty about the procedure, and felt that the Pap test was uncomfortable and embarrassing. Two message-design strategies are appropriate for attempting to dispel these negative beliefs. One strategy involves incorporating language into messages that describes the procedure in lay terms, because people often fear what they do not know or understand. Messages can describe the procedure in a step-by-step manner to frame Pap tests as simple procedures that health care providers perform every day. Additionally, campaign messages might incorporate messages that point out that, although it might be uncomfortable, a Pap test is not painful and is the best tool health care providers have to determine whether a woman’s cervix is healthy.</p>
<p>Second, to address the findings regarding beliefs about performing vaccination and screening behaviors, intervention messages should stress the importance of the three-dose regimen of the HPV vaccine and improve awareness about HPV as an STI, as well as how an HPV vaccination works. Women need to understand that the same medicine is in each dose of the vaccine, and that they need to return for each dose for full protection. Women also receive conflicting information from providers about the nature and number of HPV vaccine doses. Accurate communication about what to do in the wake of a missed second or third dose is needed, because women fear having to “start over” if they miss receiving the next dose on time. Advanced communication and planning about the vaccine schedule and what to do in the event of a missed dose can help women recognize that although their plans might change over 6 months, it is possible to plan to receive all three doses of the vaccine. Additionally, researchers can use health-communication campaigns to emphasize the need for all three doses. With increased focus on the “three-part vaccine” as opposed to just the “vaccine,” women’s awareness of the three-dose regimen, as well as the importance of receiving all three doses, might improve.</p>
<p>In terms of improving education about HPV, intervention messages should emphasize that HPV is an STI and is quite easily spread, because transmission can occur through skin-to-skin contact. An example would be a message that informs the public that HPV can be spread through oral sex. This is particularly important given the emerging scientific data linking HPV infection to oral/pharyngeal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425053">Ang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311425053">D’Souza et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, some participants believed the HPV vaccine was not needed because they were not sexually active, clearly indicating a misunderstanding of the way in which a vaccine works. Messages need to emphasize that vaccination should occur before becoming sexually active.</p>
<p>Finally, the information gathered in the study about normative influences indicates that future interventions should seek to increase maternal support for both Pap testing and HPV vaccination. Although these findings have been reported in general population studies, the clear implication of these findings about normative influences for message design is that young adult women in this area need to feel supported by their mothers. Participants reported that their mothers often played key roles when they received their first Pap test or the HPV vaccine. Health-communication messages can be targeted toward the mothers of young women in this area, encouraging them to be supportive of the steps their adult daughters take to protect their reproductive health. Furthermore, for young adult women who are independent and do not have strong family support, messages can cue them to talk with other women within their social networks to receive encouragement to protect themselves from cervical cancer by “staying on top of” their reproductive health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732311425053">
<title>Transferable Implications for Clinical Practice</title>
<p>Formative research following the IBM to gather information about contextual and environmental facilitators and barriers to performing the recommended behavior revealed that the health landscape of Appalachian Kentucky posed some serious challenges to women. Specifically, participants noted that a limited choice of providers, cost, and lack of privacy all deterred them from performing vaccination and screening behaviors. Although these findings might be unique to the sociocultural setting of Appalachian Kentucky, there are several transferable lessons that can be of appreciable interest to scholars in other Appalachian areas in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, and perhaps other rural environments.</p>
<p>First, rural populations face a limited choice of providers, which reflects the small size of clinics and limited services offered by health departments in the area. Second, outreach efforts need to consider separate strategies for HPV vaccine promotion and Pap test promotion, given that the former is recommended prior to the onset of sexual activity and the latter is recommended at the onset of sexual activity. Given that reproductive and sexual health is considered a private matter in this population, efforts that make conversations about HPV vaccination and Pap testing with young adult women routine prior to the onset of sexual activity are crucial to changing social norms that constrain people’s inclinations to go to the doctor for preventive health care. Providers in the area might take the time to counsel young women about the Pap test if it seems as though it is the young women’s first time receiving the test, or if they seem reticent to have the procedure.</p>
<p>Third, the lack of privacy in the small, rural towns in Appalachian Kentucky made some women disinclined to make appointments for Pap testing or to get the HPV vaccine. These women did not want to be seen going into a reproductive health clinic by others in the community for fear of social stigma, which is exacerbated by a gossip Web site known for spreading rumors throughout the community about why certain people are at the clinic. Although the small-town obsession with gossip and rumor spreading cannot easily be tackled, clinics can take steps to ensure patients’ privacy. For instance, for women’s health clinics located in buildings that also house other specialties, it might be prudent to have a common waiting room and common entrance to the clinic. If the women’s health clinic is in a separate building, rear or side parking can provide some privacy for patients.</p>
<p>Fourth, many women are unaware that free and low-cost Pap tests and HPV vaccines are available through the state’s new Kentucky Women’s Cancer Screening Program and the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. However, there are significant problems associated with the implementation of these programs. These services are only offered through the local health department, which many women do not visit. Even with the provision of these services by providers willing to wave their fees, the high cost of health care laboratory testing in an area where household incomes are low and many people lack health insurance is a serious barrier to care, and enhances patient reticence to receive preventive health services when other family needs are given priority. In Kentucky, state-level policy change is needed to ensure access to gynecological service providers in rural areas such that providers who are unaffiliated with health departments are reimbursed for providing Pap tests, and to ensure that laboratory testing is affordable to all women, no matter their ability to pay. These barriers to Pap testing can be found in other states and geographically isolated communities where access to health care specialists is a concern.</p>
<p>In the absence of health insurance, clinicians and state and local health departments can also help make young women aware of their ability to enroll in vaccine assistance programs. In fact, Gardasil is one of the vaccines under the Merck Vaccine Patient Assistance Program that offers free vaccines to people aged 19 years and older who cannot afford the vaccine and do not have health insurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311425053">Merck &amp; Co., 2011</xref>). GlaxoSmithKline offers similar free vaccines to adult applicants who meet eligibility requirements through their GSK Vaccine Access Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311425053">GlaxoSmithKline, 2011</xref>). Poverty or lack of income should not be an obstacle for adult applicants to receive HPV vaccines given these types of programs. In fact, because of the extreme poverty and high unemployment rates in Appalachian Kentucky, the RCPC has found that most women in the KR-ADD qualify for one or more free HPV vaccination programs.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section16-1049732311425053">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations of this study to consider. First, we recruited from a population including women who had left Appalachian Kentucky to attend college. Although these women retained connections to their home town communities, it is possible for the campus population to be different from the clinical population. However, transcript analysis did not reveal qualitative differences between the women recruited from the university campus and the women recruited from the Appalachian Kentucky clinic location. Indeed, almost all of the women recruited from campus were participants in a program that affords first-generation college students (without consideration of academic merit) from this region campus support services and scholarship monies. As first-generation college students, there was little difference between these women and women we met in the clinic population who were able to attend one of the many local technical and community colleges.</p>
<p>Additionally, significant time and resources were spent during the recruitment process and, although 31 women initially volunteered, 19 women attended the small group and one-on-one interviews. In fact, we envisioned using all small group interviews, but for two scheduled sessions, only 1 participant attended, resulting in two one-on-one interviews. The study recruitment and retention difficulties also reveal an important finding about women from this area: they are reticent to attend a study about women’s health given their other life priorities and concerns about privacy. Indeed, we decided not to locate this study in a health department clinic in part because we anticipated that it would have enhanced the difficulty of persuading women to return to participate in the study (because of the stigma associated with going to the health department for services). Other researchers recruiting women to participate in cancer-prevention research in Appalachian Kentucky have encountered similar difficulties; they found that more grass-roots recruitment efforts and additional time might be needed to recruit in this region, where people can be reticent to join research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311425053">Leach, Schoenberg, &amp; Hatcher, 2011</xref>). Despite these challenges, the recurring nature of the comments made by women during the interviews suggests that this study did reach theoretical saturation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We conducted this research study to gain a deep understanding of the unique perspectives that young women from Appalachian Kentucky bring to bear on two particular behaviors used to prevent cervical cancer: HPV vaccination and Pap testing. Researchers and practitioners should leverage the five important findings from the IBM framework and their implications for message design and clinical practice to create effective health-communication messages and enact community-level changes to increase HPV vaccination and Pap testing in Appalachian Kentucky and other rural Appalachian areas. To try to reduce cervical cancer rates in Appalachian Kentucky, it is important for researchers and practitioners to be cognizant of women’s perspectives about HPV vaccination and Pap testing, as well as the cultural landscape within which these women live.</p>
