<p>Even though computer crime and victimization is a fast-growing phenomenon, not many scientific studies have been done to explain computer crime and to propose policies to stop individual victimization. In this book, Kyung-shick Choi makes an attempt to understand individual computer-crime victimization within the theoretical frameworks of routine activities and lifestyle-exposure theories.</p>
<p>Kyung-shick argues that the basic tenets of these two theories are the same as they try to explain the victimization. Routine activities theory proposes that crimes take place when three elements—a motivated offender, a suitable target, and a lack of guardianship—converge in the physical space. Lifestyle-exposure theory proposes that criminal victimization is the result of daily living patters of the victims. Although research has found fairly strong support for both of these theories, they are limited in the physical world. The author tries to expand these theories to explain victimization in the cyber world and states, “the main purpose of this study is to assess routine activities theory to determine whether this theory will provide an explanation of computer-crime victimization” (p. 34).</p>
<p>The author first explains the routine activities and lifestyle-exposure theories as they apply in physical world and then discusses how they can be applied in cyber world. For example, lifestyle or daily routine activities in the lifestyle-exposure theory, such as going to work or school and interacting with other people in the society can be equated to online daily activities in the cyber world, such as checking e-mail, seeking information, socializing with friends, and obtaining online entertainment. The author points out that these types of online activities are part of the user’s daily activities; therefore, the propositions of lifestyle-exposure theory can be applied to explain victimization in cyberspace. Borrowing from the routine activities theory, he points out that the most feasible method of preventing computer crime is target-hardening strategy which can be accomplished “in the form of up-to-date, adequate computer security equipment” (p. 27).</p>
<p>Kyung-shick makes the argument that motivated offenders and suitable targets are given conditions in the cyber space. According to him, “In cyberspace, pools of motivated computer criminals can find suitable targets in the form of online users who connect to the Internet without precaution or without equipping adequate computer security” (pp. 26–27). Therefore, victimization takes place when there is a lack of digital guardianship combined with the risky and delinquent behavior of the victim. Digital guardianship is comprised of three things: antivirus, antispyware, and firewall. Kyung-shick hypothesized that an individual is less likely to be victimized if these security programs are installed in the computer. He also hypothesized that “online users who have risky online behaviors and a lack of management in computer security, such as adequately updating already installed computer security programs, combined with extensive hours online, are more likely to be victimized” (p. 36).</p>
<p>To test these and other related hypotheses, Kyung-shick conducted his research in 2007 using a stratified-cluster, random sample design in a sample of 204 undergraduate college students who owned a personal computer or laptop for at least 10 months prior to completing the survey. The research finds support for capable guardian component of routine activities theory and states that equipping computers with “number of computer security software and the duration of the presence of computer security software provide almost an evenly substantial impact on minimizing computer-crime victimization” (p. 93). The research also finds a strong relationship between the online lifestyle and computer-crime victimization, and indicates that those who are involved in online risky and delinquent behavior, as part of their vocational and leisure activities, are more victimized.</p>
<p>The study also attempts to discover any relationship between demographic variables, such as gender, age, race, and fear of crime, and computer crime victimization. The research indicates that although age and race do not have any significant contribution to fear of cyber crime, gender does. Females expressed a significantly greater level of fear of identity thefts and online stalking than males. In terms of victimization, the study reveals that Asian students and older group experienced higher monetary loss than the other racial groups.</p>
<p>There are five chapters in the book. In the first chapter, the author defines computer and cyber crimes and talks about the importance of studying these crimes and victimizations. In the second chapter, he lays out the theoretical and conceptual frameworks of the study and informs the readers how routine activities and lifestyle-exposure theories can explain computer-crime victimization. The third chapter elaborately describes the methodological and measurement aspects of the study including sampling procedures and operationalization of variables. Chapter 4 illustrates the statistical model that is used to analyze data, as well the findings of the research. The last chapter discusses the implications of findings, limitation of research, and recommendations for future study. The book also provides the presurvey guideline and the actual survey in appendix.</p>
<p>This book is based on Kyung-shick’s dissertation research and published by LFB Scholarly Publishing as a part of its Criminal Justice: Recent Scholarship series. The series editors are Marilyn McShane and Frank P. Williams III. It would have been beneficial if an introduction about the series and an editorial about the book were provided to help the readers to understand the background of the series. The book also needs careful proofreading for syntax and other errors. For example, 4th line of second paragraph on page 2 has a sentence (Error! Bookmark not define.) which does not belong there. In many different places—especially in Chapter 2—the author makes the same argument that routine activities and lifestyle-exposure theory are actually one theory. There is no need to remind the readers this over and over again.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the formal criminal justice systems, especially the law enforcement, lack resources and fall short of fighting computer and cyber crimes after they take place, it is very important to prevent computer crime before they are committed. This study is a valuable addition to our limited knowledge base about how to prevent individual computer-crime victimization.</p>
