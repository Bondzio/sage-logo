<p>Why do people commit crime? Notwithstanding access to the generations of rigorous qualitative and quantitative research and sophisticated theoretical work, few criminologists would be so bold as to state that they can easily answer this question. Certainly, if anyone does claim to have the definitive answer, his or her peers would soon find fault with it. Moreover, students new to the annual meetings of the American Society of Criminology and eager to discover the current state of knowledge on the key sources of crime usually encounter competing and conflicting explanations. Additionally, scores of undergraduates view the assortment of theories presented in textbooks as diverse, confusing, and partisan. Indeed, criminology is, as Robert Agnew puts it, “a divided discipline, comprised of theories and perspectives at odds with each other” (p. 191).</p>
<p>What is to be done? Many colleagues contend that intense academic debates are healthy, exciting, and foster intellectual growth. Hence, the answer for them is the status quo because “diversity is the spice of life.” Others, especially critical criminologists, assert that there will never be a theoretical or empirical détente because their contributions are sharply ridiculed by orthodox criminologists who dominate the governance of prestigious journals and leading professional associations. Some readers will take issue with this point, but the fact is that rarely will you find a critical criminological article in widely read and cited outlets such as <italic>Criminology</italic>, the <italic>American Sociological</italic> <italic>Review</italic>, and <italic>Social Forces</italic>. Consider, too, most of the major criminology texts published each year in the United States purport to present a fair and balanced view of the many conflicting criminological theories. None do and perhaps this goal is impossible to achieve. Nevertheless, one area that is routinely given short shrift is critical criminology. As I state elsewhere, some texts simply ignore critical theories. Other books devote an entire chapter but restrict their reviews to old intellectual battles and detailed coverage of dated Marxist or conflict theories. What accounts for this selective inattention is an empirical question that can only be answered empirically. However, what we know for sure is, as Agnew correctly points out, the most prominent division in criminology is “between ‘mainstream’ and ‘critical’ criminologists” (p. 2).</p>
<p>Agnew is a mainstream criminologist, but his thought-provoking offering stands apart from the bulk of orthodox theory books. His main objective is to set the stage for a unified theory of crime, one that embraces the strengths of all major theories, including critical perspectives. In fact, his book constitutes one of the very few sincere attempts by conventional criminologists to meaningfully engage with variants of critical criminological thought. I am sure proponents of other theories at the margins (e.g., biosocial perspectives) will also be impressed by Agnew’s treatment of their work. To be sure, Agnew has a rich understanding and appreciation of multiple ways of knowing about crime, law, and social control, as well as their underlying assumptions.</p>
<p>I am one of the many social scientists who do not foresee a unified criminology and who are uncomfortable embracing certain theories’ underlying assumptions. Still, it is promising to see more and more criminologists from different theoretical backgrounds attempting to theoretically cross-fertilize. Agnew’s book is an essential reading for these scholars. It is also a “must read” for instructors who teach advanced theory courses and for students enrolled in them. In my own case, this book gave me the opportunity to revisit theoretical and empirical material that I was exposed to over 30 years ago and Agnew demonstrates that such work is just as important today as it was in the past. I can honestly state that <italic>Toward a Unified Theory of Crime</italic> has motivated me to think about new ways of teaching my undergraduate sociological theories of crime class.</p>
<p>Agnew reminds us that theory construction and testing are, and should be, part and parcel of criminology. However, North American academic criminology, especially that involving theorizing crime and societal reactions to it, is under siege and there is growing pressure to publish abstracted empiricism (e.g., research divorced from theory). Noted in 1959 by sociologist C. Wright Mills and more recently by Elliott Currie and Jock Young, this approach involves atheoretical, quantitative research on relatively minor issues and presenting the findings in an unintelligible fashion. Abstracted empiricism is also necessary for getting increasingly limited external grants and universities directly and indirectly compel faculty to get such money. This pressure is partially fueled by ongoing government cuts to public education, which seem to get worse every year.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, criminological theory development and critical thinking promoted by Agnew and other like-minded scholars are undermined in classrooms. For example, many North American universities compel criminology programs to prioritize teaching practical skills over theory. Sadly, there is much public support for this pedagogical method and for the marginalization and gutting of the humanities and social sciences. Related to this problem is that aggressively targeting these programs is one of the key reasons why some politicians get elected. Furthermore, scores of people view criminological theories as meaningless, a view shared by many students and supported by conservative, corporate-oriented administrators.</p>
<p>There may never be a unified theory of crime as called for by Agnew. Still, in light of the political economic context briefly described here, his book subtlety suggests that despite their ideological differences, it is time for all types of theorists to form a treaty to collectively struggle to ensure that theory remains a core part of the criminological enterprise. Perhaps, then, criminology will eventually become a less-divided discipline.</p>
