<abstract>
<p>Cryptochromes and photolyases belong to the same family of flavoproteins but, despite being structurally conserved, display distinct functions. Photolyases use visible light to repair ultraviolet-induced DNA damage. Cryptochromes, however, function as blue-light receptors, circadian photoreceptors, or repressors of the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer, the transcription activator controlling the molecular circadian clock. Here, we present evidence that the functional divergence between cryptochromes and photolyases is not so univocal. <italic>Chrysodeixis chalcites</italic> nucleopolyhedrovirus possesses 2 photolyase-like genes: <italic>phr1</italic> and <italic>phr2</italic>. We show that PHR1 and PHR2 are able to bind the CLOCK protein. Only for PHR2, however, the physical interaction with CLOCK represses CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription. This result shows that binding of photolyase per se is not sufficient to inhibit the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer. PHR2, furthermore, affects the oscillation of immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that PHR2 can regulate the molecular circadian clock. These findings are relevant for further understanding the evolution of cryptochromes and photolyases as well as behavioral changes induced in insects by baculoviruses.</p>

<p>Photolyases are DNA damage repair enzymes that lesion-specifically and in a light-dependent manner remove cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) or pyrimidine-(6,4)-pyrimidone photoproducts ((6-4)PP) from ultraviolet (UV)–exposed DNA in a process called photoreactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730411429665">Müller and Carell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411429665">Eker et al., 2009</xref>). Photolyases, together with cryptochromes, belong to the cryptochrome/photolyase family (CPF) of flavoproteins. Cryptochromes were first identified as plant blue-light receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730411429665">Cashmore et al., 1999</xref>). More recently, homologs of cryptochromes were identified in animals, where they act as circadian photoreceptor proteins (e.g., <italic>Drosophila</italic> and zebrafish) or core clock proteins (in mammals and <italic>Xenopus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730411429665">Kume et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411429665">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730411429665">Cashmore, 2003</xref>). Additionally, cryptochromes were shown to be involved in magnetoreception in insects and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730411429665">Gegear et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748730411429665">Ritz et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, human CRY2 was recently shown to be involved in light-mediated magnetoreception in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730411429665">Foley et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Cryptochromes and photolyases share a well-conserved core domain of about 500 amino acids, which binds 2 chromophores: flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and either 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate (MTHF) or 8-hydroxy-7,8-didemethyl-5-deazariboflavin (8-HDF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411429665">Fig. 1</xref>). Cryptochromes lack the nuclear localization signal-containing N-terminal extension characteristic for eukaryotic photolyases and are equipped with a unique C-terminal extension of variable length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730411429665">Daiyasu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411429665">Eker et al., 2009</xref>). It has been proposed that the presence of different (species-specific) C-terminal extensions functionally separates cryptochromes from photolyases and that the unique character of these tails underlies the functional diversity among cryptochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730411429665">Chaves et al., 2011b</xref>). While plant CRYs carry a long C-terminal tail, which is required for light function, <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY has a short tail, which modulates the activity of the core. In the case of mammalian CRYs, it seems that function is dependent on a combined action between core and tail.</p>

<p>Mammalian cryptochromes (<italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>) are indispensable elements of the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748730411429665">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>) that allows most, if not all, organisms to anticipate to the environment by adjusting metabolism, physiology, and behavior to the momentum of the day. Circadian rhythms are generated by a self-sustained molecular clock, which has an intrinsic periodicity of approximately 24 hours and needs to be reset daily to keep pace with the day/night cycle as imposed by the rotation of the earth around its axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748730411429665">Young and Kay, 2001</xref>). Although circadian clocks can respond to various cues (e.g., food availability, DNA damage), the main “zeitgeber” or cue is visible light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730411429665">Dijk et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The circadian clock is based on an autoregulatory molecular oscillator in which a set of clock genes is periodically activated and repressed via interlocked positive and negative transcription/translation feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748730411429665">Reppert and Weaver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748730411429665">Shearman et al., 2000</xref>). In mammals, the main players in this molecular clockwork are the <italic>Clock, Bmal1, Rev-Erb</italic>α, <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>), and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>) genes. The transcription activator heterodimer CLOCK/BMAL1 binds to E-box promoter elements (CACGTG) and turns on expression of the clock genes <italic>Cry, Per</italic>, and <italic>Rev-Erb</italic>α. Once synthesized, the CRY and PER proteins form complexes that inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription. In a second feedback loop, REV-ERBα inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor (ROR)–driven transcription of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730411429665">Preitner et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, posttranslational modification of clock proteins (e.g., phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation) controls the stability and subcellular localization of the clock proteins, thereby fine tuning the period length of the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730411429665">Gallego and Virshup, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748730411429665">Vanselow and Kramer, 2007</xref>). The circadian core oscillator is coupled to rhythmic output pathways via E-box– and ROR-containing clock-controlled genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730411429665">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748730411429665">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The common ancestor of CPF members was likely a photolyase that made organisms more resistant against UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730411429665">Cashmore et al., 1999</xref>). The photoreceptor function is developed later to help organisms sense day-night changes in order to avoid UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730411429665">Gehring and Rosbash, 2003</xref>). From phylogenetic analysis, it was deduced that animal cryptochromes are more closely related to (6-4)PP photolyases, whereas plant cryptochromes presumably evolved from CPD photolyases. This phylogenetic analysis, therefore, suggests that animal and plant cryptochromes arose by 2 independent evolutionary events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730411429665">Cashmore et al., 1999</xref>). Members of the CPF are also encountered in various viruses and phylogenetically cluster with class II CPD photolyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411429665">Eker et al., 2009</xref>). Baculovirus CPD photolyase–like genes were first described in <italic>Chrysodeixis chalcites</italic> nucleopoly-hedrovirus (ChchNPV) and were designated <italic>phr1</italic> and <italic>phr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748730411429665">van Oers et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748730411429665">2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411429665">Fig. 1</xref>). These 2 photolyases belong to class II CPD photolyases (phylogeny in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730411429665">Eker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730411429665">Biernat et al., 2011</xref>). PHR2 can rescue bacteria lacking a UV repair system, whereas PHR1 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730411429665">van Oers et al., 2008</xref>). Further characterization indicated that the <italic>phr2</italic> gene, in contrast to <italic>phr1</italic>, encodes a photolyase with DNA repair activity towards UV-induced CPDs.</p>
<p>The functional diversity and evolution of CPF members, however, are not understood entirely. The identification of photolyases with a dual function (i.e., circadian clock and DNA repair) suggests that these 2 functions are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730411429665">Coesel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730411429665">Heijde et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730411429665">Chaves et al., 2011a</xref>). Insects are known to change their behavior after baculovirus infection, but the underlying mechanisms are still not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730411429665">Goulson, 1997</xref>). Identification of a possible clock regulatory function of PHR1 and/or PHR2 would take us a step further in understanding the baculovirus-induced behavioral changes. We investigated, therefore, whether PHR1 and PHR2 are able to interact with components of the mam-malian molecular clock and, consequently, have a transcription regulation function. We studied also the effect of baculoviral photolyases on the molecular oscillator and examined their possible function in the circadian clock.</p>

<title>Construction of Plasmids</title>
<p>Flag-tagged mouse <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> expression constructs (further referred to as <italic>Bmal1-flag</italic> and <italic>Clock-flag</italic>) and the <italic>HA-mCry1</italic> expression construct (all in pcDNA3) have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730411429665">Chaves et al., 2006</xref>). To express ChchNPV <italic>phr1</italic> and <italic>phr2</italic> in mammalian cells, the complete coding region of both genes was PCR-amplified from genomic ChchNPV DNA using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Vantaa, Finland) and restriction site–flanked primers. The obtained <italic>Hin</italic>dIII-<italic>Bam</italic>H1 <italic>phr1</italic> and <italic>Eco</italic>RI-<italic>Bam</italic>HI <italic>phr2</italic> fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to give pcDNA3.1-phr1 and pcDNA3.1-phr2. Essentially, the same PCR strategy was taken to generate constructs for the expression of C-terminally EGFP-tagged PHR, except that the reverse PCR primers were designed in such a way that the 3′ <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction site replaced the <italic>phr</italic> STOP codon. The obtained <italic>Hin</italic>dIII-<italic>Bam</italic>H1 <italic>phr1</italic> and <italic>Eco</italic>RI-<italic>Bam</italic>HI <italic>phr2</italic> fragments were first cloned into pJET (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and subsequently recloned upstream of the <italic>egfp</italic> coding sequence of pEGFPN3 and pEGFPN1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), respectively.

<p>HEK 293T (human embryonic kidney) and NIH 3T3 (immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast) cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/Ham-F10 medium (1:1; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Lonza), penicillin, and streptomycin. Transient expression of proteins was achieved by transfecting cells with the aforementioned constructs using FuGene reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).</p>

<title>Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>For coimmunoprecipitation studies, HEK 293T cells transiently (co)expressing <italic>phr1-gfp</italic> or <italic>phr2-gfp, Bmal1-flag</italic>, and/or <italic>Clock-flag</italic> were lysed 24 hours after transfection in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer, composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 1 mM EDTA, and supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and sonicated. After centrifugation (20 minutes, 16,000<italic>g</italic>, 4 °C), a small amount of the lysate was stored (input), and the remainder was incubated with an anti-GFP antibody (Roche) for 3 hours at 4 °C under continuous rotation. After addition of G beads (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), incubation was continued for another hour, after which the beads were washed twice with IP wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, and 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). Next, the beads and input samples were boiled in 2x Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 4% to 12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Subsequently, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and visualized using anti-Flag (1:1000 dilution; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or anti-GFP (1:1000 dilution; Roche) primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was used as a secondary antibody, and chemoluminescence was detected using ECL Western Blotting Reagents (GE Healthcare). HEK 293T cells were chosen because of their high efficiency of transfection. The use of NIH 3T3 cells does not allow a good detection of the proteins.</p>

After 24 hours, cells were fixed for 10 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing 3 times with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 5 minutes and washed with PBS. Subsequently, cells were blocked for 10 minutes in PBS, containing 1.5% BSA and 100 mM glycine, and incubated at room temperature with mouse anti-FLAG (1:1000 dilution; Sigma), or rabbit anti-PHR2 (1:500 dilution) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730411429665">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) antibody was performed.

Fluorescence images were taken with a Leica DM-RB microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) using band-pass filter cubes (L5 and TX2). Also, in this case, HEK 293T cells were chosen because of their high efficiency of transfection. Nevertheless, similar results were obtained with NIH 3T3 cells, but the amount of transfected cells was much lower.

The total amount of 1.2 µg DNA per transfection was adjusted by adding pcDNA3 vector. Each transfection was performed in triplicate. After 24 hours, transcriptional activity was assessed with the Dual-Luciferase 10 Reporter Assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) by measuring the ratio of firefly activity to <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity. For statistical analysis, a 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test was used. Also, in this case, HEK 293T cells were chosen because of their high efficiency of transfection.

<title>Real-Time Luminometry</title>
<p>For real-time bioluminescence monitoring of circadian core oscillator performance, NIH 3T3 cells were cotransfected with the <italic>mPer2::luciferase</italic> reporter construct and either pcDNA3.1-phr1, pcDNA3.1-phr1-egfp, or pcDNA3.1-phr2. As a control, we used pcDNA3.1 (empty vector) or pEGFP. Two days after transfection, cells were clock-synchronized by replacing the medium with 2 mL fresh medium containing forskolin (30 µM), luciferin (100 µM), HEPES (25 nM), 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. Dishes were sealed with a glass cover slip and parafilm and placed in a LumiCycle 32-channel automated luminometer (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL) in a dry, temperature-controlled incubator at 37 °C. In a parallel series of experiments, the <italic>Bmal1::luciferase reporter</italic> was used.

Amplitudes were calculated both for baseline subtracted data and raw data (by comparing peak and trough values). The choice of NIH 3T3 cells relies on the oscillatory capacity of these cells. HEK 293T cells, on the other hand, cannot be synchronized and make it impossible to study circadian clock oscillations.</p>

<title>PHR1 and PHR2 Can Physically Interact with CLOCK</title>
<p>Taking into account the structural similarity between cryptochromes and photolyases as well as our recent observation that <italic>Potorous tridactylus</italic> CPD photolyase can replace CRY proteins in the repression of CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730411429665">Chaves et al., 2011a</xref>), the first step in studying whether baculovirus photolyases may potentially exhibit a circadian clock function was to determine whether PHR1 and/or PHR2 can physically interact with CLOCK and BMAL1, the positive elements of the mammalian transcription/translation feedback loop. To this end, we performed pull-down experiments using HEK 293T cells transiently expressing <italic>phr1-egfp</italic> or <italic>phr2-</italic>eg<italic>fp</italic> in combination with either <italic>Flag-Clock</italic> or <italic>Flag-Bmal1</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411429665">Figure 2A</xref>, PHR1 failed to coprecipitate with BMAL1, whereas, interestingly, the protein could be pulled down together with the CLOCK protein. In the absence of the CLOCK protein, PHR1 could not be precipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, showing that the coprecipitation of PHR1 is not an aspecific feature of the antibody used. Similar results were obtained for PHR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730411429665">Fig. 2B</xref>). From these data, we conclude that the PHR1 and PHR2 proteins can physically interact with CLOCK.</p>

To investigate the consequences of the interaction between CLOCK and the PHR proteins on the subcellular localization of CLOCK, we performed an immunofluorescence assay in HEK 293T cells transiently expressing these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411429665">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411429665">3B</xref>). As might be expected on the basis of the predominantly nuclear localization of baculoviral photolyases in insect Sf9 cells and their strong affinity to condensed DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730411429665">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), PHR1 and PHR2 were also found mainly in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411429665">Fig. 3A</xref>). When CLOCK was coexpressed with PHR1 or PHR2, the subcellular localization of CLOCK shifted from cytoplasmic to nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730411429665">Fig. 3B</xref>). This finding not only further illustrates that baculoviral PHR proteins can interact with CLOCK but also suggests that they may affect the performance of the circadian core oscillator.</p>

<title>PHR2 Acts as an Inhibitor of CLOCK/BMAL1-Driven Transcription</title>
<p>In order to test whether the interaction of PHR1 and/or PHR2 with CLOCK affects the transcription activation properties of the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer, we performed an <italic>mPer2::luciferase</italic> reporter gene–based transcription inhibition assay in HEK 293T cells (similar results were obtained in NIH 3T3 cells) (Suppl. Fig. S1). The coexpression of the reporter gene with Clock and Bmal1 caused an increase in the transcription of the reporter gene compared to mPer2::luciferase alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411429665">Fig. 4</xref>). As expected, coexpression of mCRY1 (100 ng) drastically inhibited CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription. When mCRY1 was replaced by PHR1 (200 ng) or PHR2 (200 ng), only the latter protein was capable of consistently and significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) reducing the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411429665">Fig. 4</xref>). In all conditions, the total amount of plasmid DNA was equalized with the empty vector. The difference in the amount of plasmid used for mCRY1 and either phr1 or 2 relies on the fact that mCRY1 is a more efficient repressor than the photolyases. When varying amounts of plasmid were used, we observed a dose-dependent effect on the repression for mCRY1 and PHR2 (Suppl. Fig. S1). This finding suggests that despite the binding of PHR1 to CLOCK, this interaction is not sufficient to inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1.</p>

<title>PHR2 Dampens the Oscillation of Synchronized NIH 3T3 Cells</title>
<p>To obtain insight into the physiological consequences of overexpression of PHR1 or PHR2 on the molecular clock, we next investigated the core oscillator performance in forskolin-synchronized NIH 3T3 cells transiently coexpressing the <italic>Bmal1::Luc</italic> reporter plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730411429665">Fig. 5</xref>). This was done in combination with either <italic>phr1-egfp</italic> or <italic>phr2</italic> expression vectors, using the empty vector (ev) as control. As an additional control, we also monitored oscillations in cells transiently expressing the mCRY1 protein, which, as expected, drastically reduced the amplitude of <italic>Bmal1</italic> rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730411429665">Fig. 5A</xref>). The amount of plasmid DNA transfected for each of the tested constructs was 750 ng, which is at least 3-fold above the necessary amount to obtain repression of CLOCK/BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411429665">Fig. 4</xref>). The overexpression of PHR2 resulted in a significant decrease of approximately 40% (amplitude of 60% ± 12%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) in the amplitude of oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0748730411429665">Fig. 5C</xref>), whereas overexpression of PHR1-EGFP did not significantly influence the bioluminescence rhythm (amplitude of 85% ± 20%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0748730411429665">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrate that the <italic>Chrysodeixis chalcites</italic> nucleopolyhedrovirus PHR1 and PHR2 proteins resemble mammalian cryptochrome proteins in that they can interact with CLOCK, a protein that is characterized as an integral component of the transcription/translation feedback loop of the mammalian circadian clock. Cryptochromes act in the molecular oscillator as repressors of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex by interacting with CLOCK via the core domain and with BMAL1 via the predicted coiled-coil domain of CRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730411429665">Chaves et al., 2006</xref>). As a consequence, the fact that the photolyases studied here bind CLOCK, but not BMAL1, is highly understandable, as the predicted coiled-coil domain, required for interaction with BMAL1, is absent in the baculovirus and other PHR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730411429665">Fig. 1</xref>). Only PHR2, however, is capable of inhibiting CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription, indicating that interaction with CLOCK by itself is not sufficient to inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription. We find, moreover, that overexpressed PHR2 (but not PHR1) affects the molecular oscillation in mammalian cells by decreasing the amplitude of the oscillation in cultured fibroblasts, which is likely due to its capacity to efficiently inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription. This finding is remarkable, bearing in mind the evolutionary distance between mammals and baculoviruses.</p>
<p>The <italic>phr2</italic> gene encodes, in contrast to <italic>phr1</italic>, an active photolyase, which can rescue photolyase-deficient <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and has CPD photolyase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730411429665">van Oers et al., 2008</xref>). Sequence analysis shows that PHR1 differs from other class II CPD photolyases. More importantly, these discrepancies are found in conserved regions of the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748730411429665">van Oers et al., 2008</xref>). In light of this observation, it is not surprising that the nonfunctional photolyase PHR1 does not affect the molecular clock. For photoreactivation and for repression of the CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimer, most likely, the same subdomains in the photolyase-like core domain are required. A remaining question is why ChchNPV would be equipped with 2 photolyase-like genes, especially if one of these, <italic>phr1</italic>, does not seem to have any known function. Further studies are needed to reveal in more detail the properties of PHR1 in ChchNPV and its homologs in other plusiine-infecting baculoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748730411429665">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) to come to a better understanding of PHR1 functions.</p>
<p>Recently, a clock repression function has been reported for <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> (diatom) and <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic> (green alga) (6-4)PP photolyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730411429665">Coesel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730411429665">Heijde et al., 2010</xref>). It has been proposed that this duality of function of photolyases is encountered in the lower specialized organisms, which is supported by our analyses of the baculovirus PHR proteins. The taxonomic position of the organism, however, may not be an appropriate criterion to exclude a circadian role of photolyases, as the <italic>Potoruos tridactylus</italic> CPD photolyase also affects CLOCK/BMAL1-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730411429665">Chaves et al., 2011a</xref>). The functional subdivision of cryptochromes, that is, (circadian) photoreception, core circadian clock, and a role in magnetoreception, is also not entirely understood, and it is becoming evident that the same CRY can display more than one function. Additionally, the lack of a light-driven function for mammalian CRY remains controversial. The recent report by Reppert and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730411429665">Foley et al., 2011</xref>) shows that human CRY2 can also mediate light-dependent magnetoreception in flies, despite the fact that mammalian CRYs have a “dark” function. It is accepted that the evolution of cryptochromes is the result of point mutations in a photolyase ancestor gene, combined (in most organisms) with the acquisition of a C-terminal extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730411429665">Chaves et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748730411429665">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730411429665">Balland et al., 2009</xref>). Domain analyses of PHR1 and PHR2 and in vivo studies with mutant ChchNPVs will further pinpoint differences between the viral PHRs and provide insight into the function and evolution of baculovirus photolyases.</p>
<p>Although over 50 baculovirus genomes have been sequenced so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730411429665">Harrison, 2009</xref>), only few possess a photolyase gene. From an ecological point of view, carrying an active photolyase enzyme would be highly beneficial for the insect virus. It is known that upon infection by a baculovirus, the infected larvae become hypermobile and often climb up to the top of the plant canopy, allowing efficacious spreading of the progeny virus over the foliage and highly facilitating transmission of the virus within the insect population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730411429665">Goulson, 1997</xref>). As a consequence, however, the virus is more exposed to UV light, which could lead to its rapid inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748730411429665">Sun et al., 2004</xref>). To survive such conditions, some insect viruses are equipped with a photolyase with DNA repair activity towards UV-induced lesions. This is also found for the entomopox virus AMEV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730411429665">Nalcacioglu et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we have shown that the role of photolyases in virus-insect host interaction may be much broader then previously thought and may also encompass a circadian clock–related function. It is tempting to speculate about the ecological benefit for baculoviruses to contain a photolyase with a potential clock-related function. Insects were among the first organisms where a master clock was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730411429665">Helfrich-Förster et al., 1998</xref>), and there is a striking similarity between the oscillators in mammals and insects. It is crucial to emphasize that both CLOCK and BMAL1 have their orthologs in insects: CLOCK and CYCLE, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748730411429665">Rosbach, 2009</xref>). We hypothesize that the circadian role of PHR2 (as identified using the mammalian clock system) is not accidental and that this protein might also affect the circadian clock of the insect host. Possibly, the photolyase encoded by the viral genome not only protects against UV light but also might have a role in virus-induced behavioral changes by influencing the host’s circadian clock. This question is still open, and in vivo studies with <italic>phr1</italic> and <italic>phr2</italic> knockout ChchNPVs in <italic>Chrysodeixis chalcytes</italic> larvae are needed to reveal the whole set of functions of the encoded PHR proteins.</p>
