<sec id="section1-0363546512473572">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Stem cell therapy is expected to offer new alternatives to the traditional therapies of rotator cuff tendon tears. In particular, resident, tissue-specific, adult stem cells seem to have a higher regenerative potential for the tissue where they reside.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512473572">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Rotator cuff tendon and long head of the biceps tendon possess a resident stem cell population that, when properly stimulated, may be induced to proliferate, thus being potentially usable for tendon regeneration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512473572">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512473572">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Human tendon samples from the supraspinatus and the long head of the biceps were collected during rotator cuff tendon surgeries from 26 patients, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cut into small pieces, and digested with collagenase type I and dispase. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in appropriate culture medium and plated. Adherent cells were cultured, phenotypically characterized, and then compared with human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), as an example of adult stem cells, and human dermal fibroblasts, as normal proliferating cells with no stem cell properties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512473572">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Two new adult stem cell populations from the supraspinatus and long head of the biceps tendons were isolated, characterized, and cultured in vitro. Cells showed adult stem cell characteristics (ie, they were self-renewing in vitro, clonogenic, and multipotent), as they could be induced to differentiate into different cell types—namely, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and skeletal muscle cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512473572">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>This work demonstrated that human rotator cuff tendon stem cells and human long head of the biceps tendon stem cells can be isolated and possess a high regenerative potential, which is comparable with that of BMSCs. Moreover, comparative analysis of the sphingolipid pattern of isolated cells with that of BMSCs and fibroblasts revealed the possibility of using this class of lipids as new possible markers of the cell differentiation status.</p>

<p>Rotator cuff and long head of the biceps tendons contain a stem cell population that can proliferate in vitro and could constitute an easily accessible stem cell source to develop novel therapies for tendon regeneration.</p>

<p>Rotator cuff tendons are often prone to lesions and full-thickness tears, as 30% to 50% of the population older than 50 years has partial- or full-thickness rotator cuff tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473572">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512473572">27</xref></sup> Although surgical procedures have evolved and improved over the past decades, reruptures are still very common,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512473572">26</xref></sup> and the overall failure rates of surgical repair range from 30% to 94%, which is far from being acceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512473572">13</xref></sup> Several new “biological” approaches have been developed to overcome this issue, including the use of growth factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512473572">25</xref></sup> bone morphogenetic proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512473572">2</xref></sup> and, more recently, stem cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512473572">6</xref></sup> Research on stem cells for tissue engineering has bloomed over the past decade, although a therapeutic application in tendon repair has yet to be fully developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512473572">23</xref></sup> Among adult stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are by far the most studied. However, tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) have also been found in several animal species, including humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512473572">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512473572">19</xref></sup> These results have been recently extensively reviewed, underlying the potential of tendon stem cells in tendon lesions and in tissue engineering applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512473572">19</xref></sup> In fact, it has been demonstrated that tendons have a resident progenitor cell population that possesses several universal characteristics proper of adult stem cells, including clonogenicity, self-renewal, and multipotent differentiation capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512473572">3</xref></sup> Although tenocyte-like cells have been recently isolated and cultured in vitro,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512473572">24</xref></sup> the isolation of a cell population with stem cell characteristics from the human rotator cuff has yet to be reported. Moreover, although BMSCs have been shown to be able to differentiate into several mesenchymal tissues, including tendons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512473572">12</xref></sup> the possibility of isolating tendon-specific stem cells is desirable, as progenitor cells are more prone to differentiate into those cell types that belong to the tissue in which they reside<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512473572">32</xref></sup>: they form stem cell reservoirs, the “niches”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512473572">10</xref></sup> that can regulate the physiological turnover of differentiated cells, also in organs such as the brain and the heart, which have been recently proven to undergo some regeneration during aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512473572">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512473572">33</xref></sup> Along this line, a very recent study reported an in-depth comparison of the phenotype and the regenerative potential of rat TDSCs and BMSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512473572">31</xref></sup> Interestingly, the authors found that TDSCs possess a higher proliferative rate and multilineage differentiation potential than BMSCs, therefore concluding that TDSCs are a very promising stem cell source for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is the isolation and characterization of new adult stem cell populations from the supraspinatus (SS), which is part of the rotator cuff, and from the long head of the biceps (LHB) tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473572">Figure 1, A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473572">C</xref>). To confirm our hypothesis, it has been necessary that these SS and LHB cells could be cultured and expanded and that they showed adult stem cell characteristics (ie, they are self-renewing in vitro, clonogenic, and multipotent), as they could be induced to differentiate in vitro into different cell types, including osteoblasts, adipocytes, and skeletal muscle cells. These new cell populations should be phenotypically characterized and compared with BMSCs and human dermal fibroblasts (DFs). Moreover, as sphingolipids are emerging key regulatory molecules of stem cell proliferation and differentiation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512473572">15</xref></sup> the sphingolipid pattern of all cells should be determined. Finally, the differentiation potential of these new tendon stem cells should be compared with those of bone marrow stem cells and dermal fibroblasts. In fact, as a variety of stem cell sources have become available, it seems desirable and useful to have comparative data to test their differentiation potential toward different cell types, thus clarifying what works best for the regeneration of a specific tissue.</p>

<title>Cell Isolation and Culture</title>
<p>Human tendon samples were collected during arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs as described below. The protocol study was approved by the Hospital Ethical Committee (authorization number 2642; September 19, 2011). Patients were recruited among those electing to undergo an arthroscopic cuff repair. Patients with a rotator cuff tear diagnosed by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and verified by intraoperative evaluation and who gave written informed consent were included in this study. Both chronic and acute tears were included. The exclusion criterion was the presence of unequivocally diagnosed concomitant disorders of the shoulder, including glenohumeral arthritis, fracture, osteonecrosis, instability, or infection. None of the patients had undergone prior surgery on the affected shoulder. Specimens were obtained from 26 consecutive patients during arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. There were 10 male and 16 female patients with a mean ± SD age of 60 ± 7 years. The mean duration of symptoms was 26 months (range, 6-96 months). Intra-articular findings of the rotator cuff were classified according to Snyder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512473572">29</xref></sup> There were 18 complete tears (degree: C1-C4), 4 bursal surface lesions (degree: B2-B4), and 4 articular surface lesions (degree: A2-A3). Partial articular and bursal surface lesions were converted to full-thickness tears. Samples were collected from SS and LHB tendons in 20 and 6 patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473572">Figure 1, A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473572">C</xref>). None of the 2 different tendons were collected from the same patient. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed by the single-row technique with 1 to 3 suture anchors. Before the repair, a single specimen was taken from the residual tendon. The arthroscope was inserted in the glenohumeral joint, and once the cuff tear was identiﬁed, the frayed edge of the tear was debrided until normal tendon ﬁbers were identiﬁed. A margin of 4 to 8 mm was removed from the edge of the torn supraspinatus tendon before surgical repair by use of an arthroscopic basket punch. The LHB tissue specimens were harvested from the midportion of the intra-articular part of the LHB by arthroscopic tenotomy of the damaged tendon. Samples from SS and LHB tendons (4-8 mm wide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473572">Figure 1D</xref>) were collected from 26 patients, kept in HypoThermosol (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, Washington) at 4°C, and processed separately within 24 hours, according to the procedure described below.</p>
<p>Samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cut into small pieces, and digested for 90 minutes with collagenase type I (3 mg/mL; Worthington, Lakewood, New Jersey) and dispase (4 mg/mL; Gibco, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) in PBS (Euroclone, Pero, Italy) at 37°C. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in the following culture medium: α-MEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), embryonic stem cell tested and European Union approved (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria). Cells were then filtered with a cell strainer (70 μM; BD Falcon, San Jose, California) and plated in 150-cm<sup>2</sup> dishes. Adherent cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were isolated from all 26 patients. The number of isolated cells from different patients was generally similar and proportional to the tendon fragment size. In all cases, cells could be expanded to at least passage 6 before showing clear signs of senescence. All experiments were carried out at cell passage 3 from seeding. Cells were seeded at 4000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> density and were passaged when they reached 80% confluence, generally after 48 hours from seeding. Human bone marrow stem cells, obtained from healthy donors, were cultured in low-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin (all reagents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich), and 10% (v/v) defined FBS (HyClone; Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). Human DFs (from ATCC; LGC Standards Srl, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) and the mouse myogenic cell line C2C12 (ATCC; LGC Standards Srl) were maintained in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich).</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546512473572">
<title>Clonogenic Assay</title>
<p>This assay tests the capability of stem cells to form clones starting from single-cell cultures. To this purpose, cells need to be seeded at a very high dilution. Suspensions of 2000 cells (for counts, see below) were plated in 60-mm dishes and cultured for 9 days. Cell colonies were stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512473572">4</xref></sup> Results shown are the average of 6 experiments for each cell type. The DFs and BMSCs were used as controls. We used all 6 different samples of the LHB, as we collected them from 6 patients (3 men and 3 women; average age, 57 years; range, 50-67 years). Therefore, we decided to pick 6 matching samples out of the 20 supraspinatus tendons (3 men and 3 women; average age, 58 years; range, 53-67 years) and tested them separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512473572">
<title>Cell Structure and Growth Curve</title>
<p>For growth curve only, cells were plated at the concentration of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Cell structure was examined daily with a phase-contrast microscope (Axiovert 40 CFL; Zeiss, Arese, Italy). Cells were counted at days 1, 2, 3, and 4 with a Countess Cell Counter (Invitrogen; Life Technologies), and cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546512473572">
<title>Flow Cytometry</title>
<p>Isolated cells were characterized by flow cytometry for the expression of key stem cell markers and to test the level of contamination with other cell types. Cell cycle analysis allowed us to test the proliferation status of all studied cells.</p>
<p>Flow cytometry analysis was performed on 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells. Briefly, cells were stained with a 3-step procedure: (1) incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C with 50% FBS (M-Medical, Cornaredo, Italy) in PBS to block the Fc receptor, (2) incubation with conjugated mouse antihuman antibodies at the optimal concentration (1:20 dilution) in PBS for 10 minutes at 4°C, and (3) 2 washes with PBS at 4°C. Samples were analyzed with a Navios cytofluorimeter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California), and data were processed with Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter). Cell characterization was performed using the following antibodies: αCD9 FITC, αCD73 FITC, αHLA-DR FITC, αCD13 PE, αCD29 PE, αCD45 PE, αCD71 PE, αCD90 PE, αCD105 PE, αPE, α-4 PE, and αCD34 PerCP-eFluor710 (all from eBioscience, San Diego, California); αLineage Cocktail FITC, αCD18 PE, αCD146 PE, and αStro-1 Alexa Fluor 647 (all from BioLegend, San Diego, California); and αCD117 PE (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cell cycle analysis was performed on samples containing 10<sup>6</sup> cells. Briefly, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and kept at 4°C before staining. Cells were then incubated with 10 μg/mL propidium iodide (Propidium Iodide Solution; BioLegend) and diluted in 1 mL PBS, 0.5% Tween 20 (Carlo Erba, Arese, Italy), and 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), adding 20 μg/mL RNAse A (Sigma-Aldrich). Staining was performed overnight at 4°C. Samples were analyzed with a Navios cytofluorimeter (Beckman Coulter), and data were processed with Kaluza software.</p>

<title>Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Expression of key markers involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and homeostasis was tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Total RNA was isolated by a modification of the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (Tri-Reagent; Sigma-Aldrich). Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μL final volume of reaction mix (BioRad, Hercules, California). The mRNA levels of collagen type I and type III (COL-I, COL-III), matrix metalloproteinase 1 and 2 (MMP-1, MMP-2), transforming growth factor−β1 (TGF-β1), N-cadherin (N-cad), and connexin 43 (Cx43) were assessed. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as endogenous control to normalize the differences in the amount of total RNA in each sample.</p>

<title>Slot Blot</title>
<p>Expression of key markers involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and homeostasis was tested by slot blot. The COL-I and MMP-1 protein levels secreted in cell supernatants by BMSCs and tendon stem cells were assessed by slot blot. For this purpose, cell culture media were concentrated 20-fold with Centricon 10 columns (Amicon Y10; Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts). Protein content was determined by a standardized colorimetric assay (DC Protein Assay; BioRad); 100 μg of total protein per sample in a final volume of 200 μL Tris-buffered saline (TBS) was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a Bio-Dot SF apparatus (BioRad). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour with 5% skimmed milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), pH 8, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in a monoclonal antibody to COL-I (1:1000 in TBST; Sigma-Aldrich) or to MMP-1 (1 μg/mL in TBST; Millipore). After washing, membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated rabbit antimouse serum (1:40,000 in TBST; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, 2 new adult stem cell populations from the SS and LHB tendons were isolated, characterized, and cultured in vitro. Cells showed adult stem cell characteristics (ie, they were self-renewing in vitro, clonogenic, and multipotent), as they could be induced to differentiate into different cell types—namely, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and skeletal muscle cells.</p>
<p>Rotator cuff tendon tears still suffer from the lack of reliable alternative approaches to surgery and could greatly benefit from the development of a stem cell–based therapy. In general, tendon progenitor cells may represent a new, endogenous, patient-specific stem cell source for tissue regeneration. Like most other tissue-specific stem cells, they are normally present in small numbers in adult tissues and are in a quiescent state until properly stimulated. With the present investigation, we report that stem cells from the SS can be easily isolated, cultured, and expanded in vitro. We name this family of stem cells <italic>human rotator cuff stem cells</italic> (HRCSCs). Moreover, we also isolated stem cells from the LHB, with a proliferation and differentiation potential almost superimposable to that of SS. We name this family of stem cells <italic>human long head of the biceps stem cells</italic> (HLHBSCs). Thus, the possibility of collecting LHB tendon fragments during rotator cuff surgeries could be envisioned, particularly in those patients in whom the LHB tendon is also damaged and is normally discarded during surgery. This approach represents an alternative to the use of BMSCs, as tendon stem cells could be collected in the same site of injury and at the same time of tendon surgery, without requiring additional invasive procedures in other sites. Moreover, these cells would be the same cells that are endogenously activated after injury and might be induced to differentiate into tenocytes by the inflammatory response. Therefore, they are expected to have a better regenerative potential than other stem cell sources coming from other tissues. This issue was also faced in our investigation with a comparative analysis of the differences at the molecular level among SS and LHB stem cells, BMSCs, and DFs to reveal common and different features. In particular, <italic>tissue-specific</italic> and <italic>stem cell</italic> markers were analyzed by cytofluorimetry, revealing that SS and LHB cells are very similar to each other, but they differ from BMSCs in the expression level of key stem cell markers such as CD106 and Stro-1. How these differences would affect the regenerative potential of these cells is a matter for further investigation. In the search of further characterization of the 2 newly isolated tendon stem cell populations, the sphingolipid patterns of all cell types used were determined and compared. The levels of sphingomyelin, ceramide, glucosylceramide, and lactosylceramide were very similar in all the different cells, whereas Gb3 was markedly more abundant in SS and LHB tendon stem cells as compared with BMSCs and DFs, which exhibited very similar contents. This finding, potentially interesting, requires further investigation. The ganglioside pattern also showed remarkable differences: GD1a level was markedly lower in all stem cells, including SS and LHB stem cells, as compared with proliferating human fibroblasts, whereas GD3 was much more abundant in all stem cells, particularly in LHB cells, as compared with DFs. These novel findings, which deserve more detailed investigations, further corroborate the notion that glycosphingolipids, particularly gangliosides, present on the plasma membrane and often enriched in the lipid rafts, are involved in the regulation of key receptors implicated in cell differentiation and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512473572">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512473572">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512473572">35</xref></sup> These results are also in accordance with other studies reporting the involvement of GD1a in stem cell differentiation, where its increase was necessary for the progression of the process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512473572">36</xref></sup> Overall, increasing evidence seems to support the hypothesis that GD1a levels could be a direct expression of the differentiation stage of a stem cell.</p>
<p>The newly isolated tendon stem cells were also analyzed for their phenotype in relation to their activity in ECM remodeling, since ECM plays a key role in maintaining tendon structure and biomechanical properties. COL-I is the main component of the dense connective tissue of tendons, accounting for 60% to 80% of the dry mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512473572">11</xref></sup> COL-I and COL-III mRNA levels were both upregulated in SS and LHB stem cells, compared with DFs and BMSCs, according to TGF-β1 gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473572">8</xref></sup> It is interesting to note significant differences in COL-I and COL-III expression between SS and LHB. As many factors could influence COL-I and COL-III expression in vitro, including the choice of the culturing medium, understanding the reasons for the observed differential expression will require further investigation. Also, a therapeutic potential was recently suggested for PRGFs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512473572">7</xref></sup> containing many growth factors acting on ECM turnover to enhance the repair of supraspinatus tendon enthesis. Although TGF-β1 is the main growth factor inducing fibroblast proliferation and ECM components synthesis, we cannot speculate on the possible local delivery of TGF-β1 to induce tendon healing for 2 main reasons. First, the intermediate portion of tendons has a structure completely different from the structure of enthesis. Second, the uncontrolled and persistent activity of TGF-β1 could be responsible for the unbalanced deposition of collagen and ECM components in tendons. COL-I and COL-III induction was described as a regenerative and healing response in injured tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512473572">21</xref></sup> Our data showing COL-I and COL-III mRNA level upregulation in SS and LHB tendon stem cells seem to suggest for these cells a greater ability for tendon healing compared with BMSCs. However, this hypothesis was not confirmed by the analysis of COL-I protein levels, the main collagen type in tendons, since the expression of COL-I at the protein level was similar in all the considered cell types. The inconsistency of COL-I mRNA and protein levels in BMSCs and LHB and SS stem cells and the finding of unmodified COL-I protein levels in all cell supernatants suggests a different posttranscription and/or posttransduction regulation of the COL-I gene in tendon stem cells. Collagen content is dependent on the finely regulated dynamic balance between its synthesis and degradation by MMPs. MMP-1 is necessary to begin the collagen degradation pathway since it can cleave the native triple helical region of interstitial collagens into characteristic 3/4- and 1/4-collagen degradation fragments, also known as gelatins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512473572">28</xref></sup> that can be further degraded by less specific proteinases such as MMP-2, leading to complete digestion of the fibrillary collagen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512473572">34</xref></sup> MMP-1 and MMP-2 protein levels and activity were similar in all the considered cell supernatants, as observed for COL-I protein expression. These findings suggest that SS and LHB cells are characterized by increased COL-I mRNA levels compared with DF and BMSC cells but have similar COL-I, MMP-1, and MMP-2 protein expression. We can therefore hypothesize a different regulation for the COL-I gene, possibly occurring at a posttranscription or maturation level. Moreover, as tenocytes are arranged in longitudinal rows between the fiber bundles in mature tendons, they are intimately connected cell to cell with neighboring cells, both with the same cell row and with parallel rows, containing adherens and gap junctions formed by Cx32 and Cx43.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512473572">22</xref></sup> Therefore, N-cad is the transmembrane protein of adherens junctions in mesenchymal cells, supported by the actin cytoskeleton, that contributes to cell-cell interaction and to mechanotransduction mechanisms in response to mechanical load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512473572">14</xref></sup> Analysis of N-cad mRNA levels revealed a higher expression in DFs, which is consistent with an increased cell-cell adhesion or cell-matrix adhesion, as compared with both BMSCs and tendon stem cells. This suggests that adult fibroblasts are involved in maintaining the integrity of the longitudinal tendon rows and monitoring tensile load more than stem cells and that BMSCs and tendon stem cells display a similar phenotype in relation to N-cad expression.</p>
<p>Cx43 allows cell communication both longitudinally and laterally, contributing to the maintenance of tendon ECM homeostasis in response to tendon mechanical loading, allowing coordination of synthetic activity and facilitating strain-induced collagen synthesis. Our results show an increased Cx43 gene expression in BMSCs and SS and LHB tendon stem cells compared with DF. According to a previous study, which showed Cx43 mRNA upregulation in immature tendons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512473572">30</xref></sup> we can hypothesize that tendon stem cells are immature cells having a high Cx43 expression to provide a sustained gap-junction communication that is necessary for the differentiation process.</p>
<p>Overall, our results confirmed that both SSs and LHBs could be efficiently induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and even skeletal muscle cells, where bone marrow stem cells gave poor results. Further studies to test the differentiation potential of SS and LHB stem cells in vivo are now necessary to understand their full potential in regenerative medicine.</p>
