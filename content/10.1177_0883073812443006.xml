<abstract>
<p>The diagnosis of acquired demyelinating syndromes of the central nervous system in children requires exclusion of other acute central nervous system disorders. In a 23-site national demyelinating disease study, standardized clinical, laboratory, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were obtained prospectively from onset, and serially at 3, 6, and 12 months and annually. Twenty of 332 (6%) participants (mean [SD] age, 10.21 [4.32] years; 12 (60%) female) were ultimately diagnosed with vascular disorders (primary or secondary central nervous system vasculitis, vasculopathy, stroke, or migraine, n = 11 children), central nervous system malignancy (n = 3), mitochondrial disease (n = 2), or central nervous system symptoms in the accompaniment of confirmed infection (n = 4). Red flags that may serve to distinguish disorders in the differential of acquired demyelination are described.</p>

<body>
<p>Acquired demyelinating syndromes of the central nervous system can occur as an isolated inflammatory illness or the sentinel attack of multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica. Approximately 25% of children with acquired demyelinating syndromes experience further attacks of central nervous system demyelination leading to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812443006">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Acquired demyelinating syndromes are characterized by acute neurologic deficits and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of focal or multifocal areas of abnormal signal on T2-weighted images in the central nervous system. However, these features are not specific. In adults, “red flags” to assist in the distinction of inflammatory demyelination from other central nervous system disorders have been proposed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812443006">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In a prospective incident cohort of more than 300 children meeting clinical criteria for acquired demyelinating syndromes, we identified 20 children for whom subsequent diagnostic testing confirmed other etiologies. We propose “red flags” that should prompt consideration of such alternative diagnoses in the pediatric population.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812443006" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>Children from birth to age 15 years 11 months meeting criteria for acquired demyelinating syndromes (Supplementary Table 1) were enrolled within 90 days of symptom onset. Site investigators (pediatric neurologists or pediatricians) attended training sessions and used standardized case report forms to record clinical data. Data were entered centrally. On the basis of the neurologic examination without reference to neuroimaging features, a single investigator (BB) used a priori criteria to delineate whether the clinical manifestations of acquired demyelinating syndromes were attributable to a single site within the central nervous system (clinically monofocal acquired demyelinating syndromes), were attributable to multiple sites within the central nervous system (clinically polyfocal acquired demyelinating syndromes), or whether the child met criteria for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (polyfocal deficits plus encephalopathy).</p>

<sup>a</sup>A focused MRI spine study is indicated in all children with neurologic features localized to the spine. The majority of such children experience lesions in the cervical or thoracic spine. MRI imaging of the full spine is helpful to look for evidence of demyelination extrinsic to the brain or to search for spinal root enhancement in children with features of infection or malignancy.</p>

<title>Vascular Inflammatory Central Nervous System Disease</title>
<p>Eleven of the 20 children (12 girls, 60%) were diagnosed with vascular inflammatory central nervous system disease: 4 with biopsy-proven isolated small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system, 1 with presumed small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system (biopsy declined by the parents), and 1 each with basilar stroke, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, migraine, and congenital varicella syndrome vasculopathy with acute decompensation. All 11 presented with acute neurologic deficits, 4 with visual loss consistent with optic neuritis (3 at onset, one 6 months after onset of symptoms), 2 with transverse myelitis, and 7 with polyfocal deficits (4 of whom met international criteria for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812443006">5</xref>
</sup>). One patient, a 12-year-old girl with congenital varicella syndrome, presented with fever, acute encephalopathy, seizures, nystagmus, motor weakness and ataxia, initially attributed to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. MRI revealed multiple abnormal small and large cerebral vessels, areas of remote hemorrhage, and multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions. Although it is possible that she did experience acute disseminated encephalomyelitis superimposed on congenital varicella syndrome, it is plausible that she experienced an intercurrent illness-related decompensation in a vascularly compromised brain.</p>

<p>A 6-year-old girl presented with a 2-week history of fatigue, difficulty with word retrieval, decreased appetite, fever, marked mood disturbance, and a 5-day history of auditory and visual hallucinations. She developed profound encephalopathy and focal seizures. Cerebro spinal fluid analysis revealed a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands. MRI revealed a focal nonenhancing T2-bright lesion in the right frontal cortex and adjacent deep white matter. The presence of encephalopathy and acute neurologic deficits led to a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. A course of intravenous immunoglobulin G (2 g/kg divided over 5 days) did not lead to clinical improvement; corticosteroids were deferred owing to concern for central nervous system herpes infection. She remained encephalopathic, required gastrostomy tube alimentation, and had persistent intermittent hallucinations without further clinical or electrographic seizures. Cerebral angiogram was normal. Brain biopsy 19 days after onset of the frontal lesion confirmed small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812443006">Figure 2A</xref>). Treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone, and monthly cyclophosphamide (6-month course) was commenced. Clinical improvement was gradual and 3 years after onset, she remains stable with mild cognitive impairment.</p>

She denied pain with extraocular movement but had intermittent headache and generalized fatigue. Examination of the right eye revealed a visual acuity of 20/25, swelling of the optic disc, but no relative afferent pupillary defect. Initial topical treatment of corticosteroids and mydriatics for anterior uveitis did not resolve these symptoms. MRI of the brain was normal.

<p>In a national pediatric demyelinating disease program that has recruited 332 children, we identified 20 children for whom clinical, laboratory, and MRI features ultimately led to diagnoses of nondemyelinating disorders.

<p>The most challenging differential of acquired demyelinating syndromes is brain inflammation due to primary or secondary vasculitis. Optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and polyfocal supratentorial and infratentorial neurologic deficits occur in children with small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system and are also hallmarks of demyelination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073812443006">29</xref>
</sup> Persistent headache, rarely observed in multiple sclerosis or in children with transient demyelination, was notable in 4 of the 5 children with small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system in our series and has been reported as a key feature of other central nervous system vasculitis cohorts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073812443006">29</xref>
</sup> Seizures occurred in 4 of the 5 children with small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system in contrast to only 3 of the 301 children (3%) with central nervous system demyelination. Leptomeningeal enhancement, when present, argues against multiple sclerosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073812443006">30</xref>
</sup> and favors either small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system (as reported<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073812443006">31</xref>
</sup> and also noted in one of our patients), an inflammatory disorder with meningeal infiltration such as neurosarcoidosis (as seen in our patient),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883073812443006">32</xref>
</sup> or central nervous system infection.</p>
<p>Vascular disruption due to stroke can also be difficult to distinguish from demyelination, as illustrated by the patient presenting with a brainstem lesion. Although the temporal pace of acute deficits, with maximal severity typically acquired within minutes strongly favor stroke, some patients with vascular dissection or emboli can experience a stuttering or slower evolution of deficit. Diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging is considered a hallmark of ischemia, but is not pathologically specific.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883073812443006">33</xref>
</sup> It could be argued that stroke was not proven in our patient, and conventional angiogram might have provided more definitive evidence of vascular dissection.</p>
<p>Systemic inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus can manifest with central nervous system involvement, including lupus myelitis, optic neuritis, and polyfocal central nervous system lesions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883073812443006">34</xref>
</sup> As highlighted by our patient, the initial manifestation with transverse myelitis did not differ clinically nor radiologically from idiopathic transverse myelitis, but fever, malaise, and rash prompted immediate testing for serum biomarkers for systemic lupus erythematosus. While systemic features of fever and malaise are also experienced by children with periinfectious or postinfectious transverse myelitis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073812443006">24</xref>
</sup> and in children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883073812443006">35</xref>
</sup> we suggest that serum evaluation for features of systemic lupus erythematosus be considered in all children with acquired demyelinating syndromes.</p>
<p>One of the most common acquired demyelinating syndromes presentations is optic neuritis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883073812443006">36</xref>
</sup> and at least 30% of children with optic neuritis will subsequently experience further relapses confirming a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Pain with ocular movement, reduced visual acuity, red-green color desaturation, and central scotoma are the protean features of optic neuritis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883073812443006">37</xref>
</sup> We identified 1 patient with clinical features of optic neuritis but with retinal features consistent with multiple evanescent white dot syndrome. Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome is a rare, sudden-onset retinitis with multifocal white spots throughout the retina.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812443006">8</xref>
</sup> Most patients are female (female-male ratio 5:1), manifest between adolescence and age 50 years, and 50% have a prodromal flu-like illness. Although patients report “visual loss,” detailed interview reveals complaint of multifocal areas of visual obscuration or “gray dots,” which often increase in size or become confluent, leading to increasing visual impairment. Photopsia is a common complaint, while such a “positive” visual phenomenon is rarely seen in optic neuritis. Although optic nerve swelling occurs in multiple evanescent white dot syndromes, the absence of a relative afferent pupillary defect should prompt consideration of a retinal process rather than typical optic neuritis. Retinal imaging is diagnostic of the lesions in white dot syndromes, funduscopic fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine green angiography, giving characteristic hyperfluorescence and hypofluorescence, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812443006">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883073812443006">38</xref>
</sup> Prognosis for patients with multiple evanescent white dot syndrome is excellent, with minor recurrences in some but ultimate complete recovery without subsequent central nervous system inflammation.</p>
<p>Three children with central nervous system malignancy were initially thought to have demyelination. All 3 children manifested with focal seizures in the absence of persistent neurologic deficits in contrast to children with demyelination for whom seizures (if they occur) are associated with clear neurologic deficits consistent with an acute inflammatory process. Tumefactive demyelinating lesions demonstrate many of the neuroimaging features of central nervous system malignancy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0883073812443006">39</xref>
</sup> Lesions greater than 20 mm in cross-sectional diameter are considered “tumefactive” particularly when perilesional edema or local tissue mass effect is present.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0883073812443006">40</xref>
</sup> Multiple lesions of the brain, optic nerve, or spinal cord favor demyelination given the relative rarity of metastatic malignancy in children. More challenging, however, are isolated tumefactive lesions. Persistent lesion enhancement or edema is atypical for demyelination, and increasing size of lesions over time are also “red flags” for an underlying malignant process.</p>
<p>The presence in cerebrospinal fluid of oligoclonal bands has long been associated with multiple sclerosis in children<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0883073812443006">41</xref>
</sup> and adults.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0883073812443006">42</xref>
</sup> Cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands are not specific for multiple sclerosis, however. It is notable that of the 20 children identified in this report, cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands were present in 5 of the 9 children tested (1 each with tumor, Lyme disease, small vessel childhood primary angiitis of the central nervous system, cerebellitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus).</p>
<p>All clinicians involved in the present study were provided with rigorous inclusion criteria, standardized definitions for acquired demyelinating syndromes phenotypes, and participated in in-person training sessions prior to study onset. Thus, even with rigorous case definitions, the diagnosis of acquired demyelinating syndromes remains challenging. Malignant and metabolic disorders may respond transiently to corticosteroid therapy. Serial evaluation is essential. Progressive accrual of disability within the first few years of acquired demyelinating syndromes is not characteristic of demyelination or multiple sclerosis in children,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883073812443006">36</xref>
</sup> and should prompt consideration of metabolic disorders, leukodystrophies or malignancy. With increasing recognition of the clinical, laboratory and MRI features of acquired demyelinating syndromes also comes the responsibility to promptly identify atypical features leading to alternative diagnoses.</p>
