<abstract>
<p>We have recently seen the proliferation of a variety of progressive, democratic social movements across the globe. In the wake of various contradictions and implosions of capitalism, from the meltdown of the US banks to the euro crisis, vast numbers of people have challenged neoliberal globalization. In this article the authors offer a theoretical frame for the analysis of the most recent challenges posed to neoliberal social and economic policies as they were shaped in late capitalism. The authors first note Habermas’s thesis that legitimation crises take place at both the macro and micro levels, and that they foster various understandings as well as emotional reactions. The authors focus on the emotional aspects that are vital to social mobilizations. To do this they draw on theoretical frames from social movement and the sociology of emotion perspectives. More particularly they see the process of ‘emotional liberation’ coined by Flam, as the equivalent of McAdam’s ‘cognitive liberation’ and both as part of the process of subjectivation as put forward by Touraine. These formulations lead to considerations of the emotions that tie people to authorities and/or withdraw legitimacy from authorities, in order to understand which emotions need be mobilized in order to liberate people from their loyalty to authorities. The authors found a constellation of incongruent emotions such as distrust and disrespect for authorities/elites or their perceived agents, indignation and righteous anger, humiliation, and in turn hope for an alternative future. The value of the authors’ proposed structure of argument lies in the powerful combination of macro and micro processes and the combination of cognition and emotions.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>Recientemente hemos visto la proliferación de una variedad de movimientos sociales progresistas y democráticos a lo largo del planeta. En la ola de diversas contradicciones e implosiones del capitalismo, desde la fusión de los bancos americanos a la crisis del euro, un gran número de personas ha desafiado la globalización liberal. En este artículo ofrecemos un marco teórico para el análisis de los desafíos más recientes planteados a las políticas social y económica del neoliberalismo como han sido formuladas en el capitalismo tardío. Señalamos primero la tesis de Habermas de que la crisis de legitimación tiene lugar a nivel macro y micro que favorece diversas interpretaciones y reacciones emocionales. Nos centramos en el aspecto emocional que es vital para las movilizaciones sociales. Para ello nos basamos en los marcos teóricos de los movimientos sociales y la sociología de las emociones. En particular, vemos el proceso de ‘liberación emocional’, acuñado por Flam, como el equivalente al de ‘liberación cognitiva’ de McAdam, y ambos como parte del proceso de subjetivación propuesto por Touraine. Estas formulaciones nos han conducido a tener en cuenta las emociones que vinculan a las personas con las autoridades y/o retiran la legitimidad a las autoridades de cara a entender qué emociones necesitan ser movilizadas para liberar a las personas de su lealtad a las autoridades. Hemos encontrado una constelación no congruente de emociones como desconfianza y falta de respeto a las autoridades o élites o sus agentes, indignación y cólera, humillación y, al revés, esperanza en un futuro alternativo. El valor de la estructura argumentativa propuesta descansa en la fuerte combinación entre procesos macro y micro, y la combinación entre cognición y emociones.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the world we have recently witnessed the proliferation of counter-hegemonic, democratic mobilizations in which vast numbers of people have challenged neoliberal capitalist ideology and practices, and the legitimacy of the elites whose self-interested loyalties to transnational capital have ill served the majorities. Most recently these include Arab Spring, the Spanish M15, the Greek, Portuguese and Israeli summer mobilizations, and the Occupy Wall Street movement, to mention just a number of these mobilizations around the world.</p>
<p>While each of these movements is somewhat unique, each shaped by local cultures, traditions, values, and organizations, they share some common characteristics: namely the adverse impacts of neoliberalism with its growing inequality, growing unemployment, privatization of resources and services, etc., that elicit powerful emotional reactions such as anger, fear, anxiety, and humiliation. The first actors to mobilize in many places were the young adults aged 20–35, the employed, underemployed, underpaid or unemployed members of the ‘precariat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392113479751">Standing, 2011</xref>). Many of the participants have been ordinary tax-paying citizens who have been in one way or another adversely affected by late capitalism neoliberal practices. In many of these mobilizations women are very prominent both among the protestors and the leading figures of these ‘leaderless’ mobilizations. We have also witnessed a proliferation of local and international teams of researchers and early studies of these mobilizations, some of which are still in progress. This research is being presented at a large numbers of local and international conferences. This wave of mobilizations has invigorated the academic study of social movements and has encouraged new empirical studies and a critical reappraisal of our theories and research. Our work is part of this new wave of theoretical and empirical interest.</p>
<p>The thesis that we present here offers a theoretical frame that can be applied to the understanding of both democratic and authoritarian directions in the most recent waves of mobilization. This article, however, is focused on one aspect of the democratic mobilizations. It turns attention to the emotional processes that are an integral aspect of these mobilizations. These processes have not been given enough attention in previous analyses of social movements and protest cycles.</p>
<p>Why is it important to study the emotions of protest and to theorize the role of emotions in oppositional mobilizations? The answer is simple. Even though emotions have been absent from sociological accounts of protest and social movements for decades (mainly due to the traditional duality of emotion vs. rationality in social research), during the past 20 years, with more and more research and theory on the sociology of emotions, it has been recognized that emotions and feelings provide fundamental stances to the world, they are basic to our experiential responses to the ongoing events of the everyday ‘life world,’ and inherent to involvements with that world, relationships to others, and to our very self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392113479751">Barbalet, 2002</xref>), including protests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479751">Jasper, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">2011</xref>). Emotions motivate people to join with others to mobilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479751">Benski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">Flam, 2005</xref>). Emotions are generated through and during protests and mobilizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479751">Benski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">Jasper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011392113479751">Ost, 2004</xref>) and shape the goals of the movement. Emotions can be both a means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011392113479751">Gould, 2002</xref>) and an end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392113479751">Yang, 2000</xref>). As such, the study of emotions is highly instructive for any attempt at understanding both present-day and past mobilizations.</p>
<p>This article has three parts. First we begin with a critical examination of the place of emotions in social movement theory. We then present the general outline of our theoretical argument concerning the place of emotions in the current mobilizations and finally, we present the process of emotional detachment, the withdrawal of feelings of loyalty to authorities. Based on the premise that there is no cognition without emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392113479751">Melucci, 1995</xref>) and following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392113479751">McAdam’s (1982)</xref> ‘cognitive liberation’ concept, we present the notion of ‘emotional liberation’ processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479751">Flam, 1993</xref>), which we further link to processes of subjectivation – the formation of activist identity, whose agency can foster social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392113479751">Touraine, 1995</xref>). It is on the bases of these theoretical arguments concerning emotions and identities that we claim that a process of ‘emotional liberation’ is essential for the most recent mobilizations as it is for any process of mobilization. The content of what one is liberated from might be different in different mobilizations but according to our present theoretical knowledge and reasoning, the principle is the same.</p>

<sec id="section2-0011392113479751">
<title>Rethinking the paradigms: Social movements and emotions</title>
<p>Theorizing social movements first began with the gradual appearance of the Collective Behavior (CB) tradition, leaning heavily on Gustav Le Bon’s conceptualizations depicting the protestors as ‘mass behavior’ which consisted of ‘emotional’ driven ‘irrational’ crowds going berserk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011392113479751">Le Bon, 1960 [1895]</xref>). CB theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011392113479751">Smelser, 1962</xref>) depicted the masses, the dangerous classes, as out of control and/or duped by powerful, unscrupulous leaders. Thus, for a number of reasons, the affective was considered irrational and unworthy of study. This line of thought dominated the social sciences till the 1960s. Since the 1970s and 1980s, thinking about social movements has fallen into two broad camps, Resource Mobilization (RM), and New Social Movement theory (NSM), that attempt to explain the mediation processes between structural conditions and possible mobilizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011392113479751">Klandermans and Tarrow, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>RM theorists have stressed the rationality of activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011392113479751">Zald and McCarthy, 1987</xref>). They depicted social movement leaders as shrewd entrepreneurs, rational actors coolly calculating the costs and benefits of participation, and noted that people were mobilized by incentives rather than by passionate anger or righteous indignation. The cognitive emphasis is visible in the political process theory as well and is articulated in the ‘cognitive liberation’ theme, even though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392113479751">McAdam (1982)</xref> acknowledged the importance of grievances to the development of the definition of the situation as unjust along lines parallel to Turner and Killian’s emergent norm theory of injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011392113479751">1972 [1957]</xref>). But he focused exclusively on the cognitive definition of the situation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cultural turn in the study of social movements that has evolved into the NSM theories in Europe and the framing approaches in the US have retained the cognitive focus (with the notable exception of feminist studies of movements). Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392113479751">Melucci (1995</xref>: 45) incorporated the emotional element in the form of ‘emotional investment’ of participants and stated that ‘there is no cognition without feeling’. Yet beyond ‘investment’ he did not explore the emotions of protest and his view of collective identity emphasizes its cognitive components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392113479751">Goodwin and Jasper, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011392113479751">Gamson (1992</xref>: 32), whose experiments gave a push to framing theories and studies, argued that ‘the righteous anger that puts fire in the belly and iron in the soul’ is a necessary condition for social mobilizing to get started.</p>
<p>Despite these comments by Gamson and Melucci, in the 1990s, ‘culture’ was perceived as made up of ‘customs, beliefs, values, artifacts, symbols, and rituals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011392113479751">Johnston and Klandermans, 1995</xref>: 3), ‘ideas and beliefs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011392113479751">Mueller, 1992</xref>: 13), and ‘ideas, ideology, [and] identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011392113479751">McAdam, 1994</xref>: 36). Thus, culture was perceived as exerting an influence on potential members through shaping their cognitions rather than their emotions.</p>
<p>We hold that both RM and NSM perspectives fail to address the important role of emotions and feelings in precipitance, emergence, and functioning of social movements. We join the efforts of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479751">Flam (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479751">Jasper (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392113479751">Goodwin et al. (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011392113479751">Goodwin and Jasper (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479751">Benski (2011)</xref> in the attempt at readdressing the issue of emotions in analyses of social movements with a particular focus on the most recent mobilizations.</p>

<title>A road map of the analysis of the most recent mobilizations</title>
<p>In this article we argue that understanding the mobilizations of 2011 requires considerations of the macro objective/structural conditions, their contradictions, and their consequences at the micro level. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392113479751">Habermas (1975)</xref> has argued, crises at the objective level, e.g., the economic system and/or the state, and/or the cultural system of legitimating values can and do migrate to the subjective/micro-social levels and aspects of self, identity, and emotions. The neoliberal logic of global capital has led to a growing centralization of wealth and power in the hands of the elites which has fostered greater inequality. Moreover, neoliberalism has encouraged state retrenchments in the allocation of various entitlements, from education and job training to unemployment benefits and retirement pensions. Further, there has been a privatization of government services which has eroded the sociopolitical contract between the state and its citizens and left the individual on his/her own to cope with various adversities. This has in turn had devastating consequences for the careers and life plans for many but this has been especially the case for young adults in the Middle East, in Southern Europe, and the United States, who have increasingly become part of the ‘precariat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392113479751">Standing, 2011</xref>). In some countries like Spain and Greece, half of the young workers are unemployed and for many, their entering into and/or remaining within the middle classes has become problematic.</p>
<p>These macro processes, especially structurally based under- and/or unemployment, have interfered with the ability of the young adult generation to sustain themselves economically and fulfill the modern expectations of financial independence, controlling one’s own life, and the ability to lead a life that is self-sustaining, fulfilling, and productive economically, socially and culturally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011392113479751">Kalleberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011392113479751">Standing, 2011</xref>). Moreover, work generally provides a basis for dignity, recognition, and membership in the community. As a result, many of the economically distressed see themselves politically marginalized and their interests disenfranchised and ignored by elites, and feel humiliated, deprived of the basic requirements for a decent and dignified life.</p>
<p>As a result of these macro- and micro-social aspects of the political economy, legitimation crises and emotional processes have especially impacted those in economically vulnerable social locations who feel angry toward the elites, fearful and anxious about their futures, and especially indignant about being ignored. These emotions prompted many to engage in protests and mobilizations as an expression of contentious politics that become mediated through interpersonal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011392113479751">Melucci, 1996</xref>) and/or access to electronically mediated communication such as the internet and social media that has enabled the rapid flows of information and communication and has enabled the proliferation of new framings of the situation in terms of both the cognitive (new citizenship claims) and affective (anger, humiliation, and pride); eventually they have mobilized in vast numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011392113479751">Langman, 2005</xref>). These claims are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011392113479751">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Legitimation crises – when capitalism hits the fan!</title>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011392113479751">Habermas (1975)</xref> legitimation crises take place when there is a failure of the ‘steering mechanisms’ of advanced capitalism at both the macro and the micro levels. The objective macro-level crises include the economy, the state, and the cultural system. The subjective moments of these macro-level crises infiltrate into the life world of individuals where motivated identities are experienced and performed. Economic crises such as structural problems, contradictions and implosions of the economy that create unemployment or underemployment, sudden price hikes and/or shortages – especially of basic commodities (food, oil, utilities) – retrenchments of entitlements, and so on, that threaten survival or maintenance of living standards, or social status, undermine the legitimacy of political leadership and legitimating ideologies. But at the same time, these macro conditions impact the ‘life world,’ the micro level of feelings, identities, and values.</p>
<p>Legitimation crises lead to crises of meaning (culture). They impact individual ‘life worlds,’ they migrate to and affect motivation and identity. As people withdraw commitments from the social order creating spaces for alternative views and understandings. While Habermas’s analysis shows how system crises elicit crises of motivation/identity, what is overlooked is that these reactions are not only cognitive/evaluative, but when people face threats to their very survival, as well as their dignity, they experience fears, anxieties, and anger; such emotional reactions may act as threats to the very core of one’s self-identity and self-esteem. This migration of system crises into the life world in the form of rising prices, stagnant or declining incomes, or for many, often educated youth, no incomes at all, means individual actors experience distress. And in face of these realities there have been a number of emotional reactions in the form of constellations of anger and fear, anxiety and despair, and often hopelessness of the very viability of the self. In addition to these emotions, the humiliation and degradation that people experience when they are unable to work in ways that provide both substance and dignity, often lead to what Durkheim called ‘fatalistic suicide’ as a last resort, an escape from the pains of living. This is clearly shown by the suicides of rural farmers in India, or the case of Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian college student, turned vegetable peddler who set himself ablaze when harassed by the police. And these are not isolated incidents and these feelings have been fundamental causes of the events that have ignited the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>Accepting Melucci’s warning that we need to remember that ‘there is no cognition without feeling’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011392113479751">Melucci, 1995</xref>: 45), our first and most basic argument is that some of the cognitive processes that we can identify, such as the attribution of blame and envisioning alternatives, are also in effect, emotional. Thoughts, judgments, and perceptions are not only cognitive but also rest on emotional constellations. This assumption underlies our thesis. Thus our article endeavors to locate the emotional processes that accompany the withdrawal of commitment from authorities and indeed anger and indignation toward these same authorities that have generally supported the economic elites – and whose reactions to the implosions have favored elite interests, for example, the embrace of austerity programs at times of growing unemployment. Given Habermas’s claim about system crises migrating to the individual level of an actor’s subjectivity and identity, especially the ways in which work provides adaptation, dignity, and self-esteem, when crises of the economic system lead to massive unemployment/underemployment, there are strong emotional reactions. Crises, especially those that affect people’s everyday lives in ways that often humiliate and denigrate the self, lead to strong emotions of the ‘anger–hate–humiliation’ family which form powerful emotionally based motives to seek amelioration. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392113479751">Scheff (1990)</xref> has long noted, anger is often a way of defending against unconscious shame – and in many cases, people that either lose jobs or cannot find them, notwithstanding the structural basis of such unemployment, nevertheless, often blame themselves. Thus, emotional reactions dispose the person to accepting certain frames of explanation for their circumstances, envisioning alternatives, while the anger and indignation toward the elites may not only motivate joining and participating in social movements, but further protect the self from feelings of shame and humiliation. Meanwhile, joining and participating in social movements can per se provide the actor with a variety of more pleasant gratifications, from a sense of community to a reaffirmation of an individual’s worth and dignity.</p>
<p>Second, we adopt the most recent insight that emotions are amorphous categories, that they tend to merge into each other, and that in many cases, emotions tend to appear as complex structures that include more than one emotion at the same time or in succession in very close temporal proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392113479751">Barbalet, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392113479751">Benski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011392113479751">Collins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">Flam, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011392113479751">Scheff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392113479751">Yang, 2000</xref>). Hence we suggest to adopt the concept of ‘constellations of emotions’ coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479751">Benski (2011)</xref> to deal with the complex nature of the emotional dimension. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479751">Benski (2011)</xref> suggested that complex situations give rise to complex emotional experiences which quite often cannot be adequately accounted for by focusing on a single emotion. She offered a basic distinction between congruent and non-congruent constellation of emotions. Each such case will need to be studied in depth in order to establish its characteristic behavioral responses, motivational direction, and identities that are fostered. Constellations that are composed of <italic>congruent emotions</italic> are constellations in which the different emotions work in a similar direction and thus amplify the basic expected behavioral consequences, like for example disgust, contempt, and outrage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011392113479751">Benski, 2005</xref>). Constellations composed of a mix of <italic>contradictory</italic> or <italic>non-congruent</italic> emotions like the example of the mix of hope and contempt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">Flam, 2005</xref>), or the mixes of fear and anger, and shame and anger, in which again the behavioral consequences were different from the emotion, rule expectations of each of these emotions alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011392113479751">Yang, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011392113479751">Westen (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011392113479751">Lakoff (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011392113479751">Ekman (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392113479751">Barbalet (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">Flam (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479751">Jasper (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">2011</xref>), and others, emotions and feelings dispose a variety of thoughts and actions – and most importantly, emotional considerations help us understand motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011392113479751">Barbalet, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011392113479751">2002</xref>) and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011392113479751">Reger et al., 2008</xref>). Thus we claim that people generally seek positive emotional feelings such as love, dignity, pride, and joy, and seek to avoid unpleasant emotions such as fear, anxiety, anger, shame, disgust, humiliation, or depression. We are not suggesting a rational ‘felicific calculus’ a la Bentham, but rather that most human behavior has an emotional underpinning – that is often not conscious. More specifically, as some biologists and psychologist suggest, people are born with an inherent affect system, but in the course of socialization and development, these affects become socialized and transformed into emotions aroused by social cues and expressed, or suppressed according to social norms. In turn, these are often experienced as feelings. But the events that trigger emotional responses are often symbolic events – we rarely fear attacks by a hippopotamus, but can and do fear the loss of a job – rooted in fears of survival both of our physical being and indeed our very self-identity which requires recognition from others to exist.</p>
<p>For the purposes of understanding the role of emotions in social mobilization, we suggest that there are four basic desires to experience certain emotional states that help us understand the hows and whys of social life. We are not offering a theory of personality as such, but a sociological typology that helps us understand social mobilization. People need:</p>
<list id="list1-0011392113479751" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Attachments to others, a sense of belonging, and attempt to avoid loneliness and the family of sad feelings that accompany loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011392113479751">Berezin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">Jasper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392113479751">Kemper, 2001</xref>). While rooted in the helplessness and dependency of infancy and its fears of abandonment if not annihilation, attachment behavior qua ties to others is the basic way that fears are assuaged.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People need a sense of agency/empowerment, and attempt to avoid helplessness and a feeling of powerlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392113479751">Kemper, 2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People seek recognition and self-esteem, a sense of pride, dignity and worth, to feel good about who one is and what one is doing. Conversely, people attempt to avoid feelings of humiliation, degradation, and worthlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011392113479751">Kemper, 2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>And finally, people seek alleviation of fear – threats to the self and/or one’s attachments and agency; as scholars from Kierkegaard to Freud to Heidegger have shown, emotions such as anxiety and uncertainty tap the deepest, most archaic fears of death and annihilation and in turn, people seek to assuage such feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011392113479751">Becker, 1973</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Every culture, and/or subculture, provides different cues, physical or symbolic, and codes that arouse/evoke certain feelings or perhaps assuage negative feelings. It is clear from a long tradition of research studies going back to the Great Depression that economic and political crises are experienced by many as fears and anxieties that impinge on one’s livelihood, one’s identity, status, and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011392113479751">Elder, 1999</xref>). It is thus the case that in many cases in democratic societies, crises of authority that migrate to the subjective level evoke emotions that people usually try to avoid. Given the anxieties and insecurities of jobs, together with the inequalities caused by neoliberal capitalist practices, people have strong emotional responses – from fear and anxiety about their survival, to feeling humiliated by actions, or non-actions of authorities and/or anger toward the structure of the very society and/or the nature of its leadership.</p>
<p>According to Moghadam (this issue), democracy involves citizens’ obligations but also rights. A more expanded definition of democracy ‘refers to a political regime in which citizens enjoy an array of civil, political, and social/economic rights that are institutionalized, and [they] participate through the formal political process, civil society, and social movements; it also refers to a society or culture governed by the values of tolerance, participation, and solidarity.’ These can be translated to the language of emotions along lines suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011392113479751">Berezin (2002)</xref> as a basic agreement between democratic states and their citizens, within which states are expected to provide security and various services and benefits, in exchange for loyalty and confidence from their citizens. In view of these expectations on the part of the citizens, the adverse effects of neoliberal capitalism, most particularly the increasing inequality, privatization, and the cutback of governments’ services, frustrate expectations that form the foundations of democracy. When these frustrations are framed in terms of governmental corruption or indifference, many law-abiding, tax-paying citizens begin to rethink the nature of the social contract and consider it to have been broken by the government. As they rethink the social contract, they also rethink the nature of citizenship and civil participation that they are practicing – especially as citizenship changes from passive support of the nation, and loyalty and acceptance if not blind obedience to its leaders, to more active critiques, contestations, and mobilizations against elite power. And this can lead to resistance, challenges that would seek to transform nations and change leaders. All this is highly evident in the slogan that was chanted all over the world starting with Tahrir Square, Madrid, the USA, and Israel: ‘The people demand social justice.’ Without entering into an analysis of what kind of ‘social justice’ the ‘people’ demand, it is clear that by demanding ‘social justice,’ the protestors have framed the situation in terms of certain principles of justice, fairness, and equality that have been violated, unjustly – perhaps without the consent of the people – by authorities.</p>

<title>Emotional liberation/detachment processes and their constellations of emotions</title>
<p>As we turn to look for the emotional equivalent of the cognitive process of the withdrawal of commitment from authorities that according to Habermas occurs at times of crises of legitimacy, we need to examine the literature on the cognitive processes that are seen as necessary for social mobilization. McAdam’s political process theory that introduced the idea of ‘cognitive liberation’ seems to be a central concept for starting our inquiry. This line of thought postulates that in order for movements to mobilize and people to become social movement actors, some cognitive changes need to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392113479751">McAdam, 1982</xref>). In his analysis of the civil rights movement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392113479751">McAdam (1982)</xref> suggested that a process of ‘Cognitive Liberation’ was a precondition for mobilization into oppositional movements. He claimed that ‘Before collective protest can get under way, people must collectively define their situation as unjust and subject to change through group action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011392113479751">McAdam, 1982</xref>: 51). These beliefs, based on certain notions of justice and morality, and understandings, were instrumentally employed to interpret cues from authorities to the protesting group. There was no discussion of the meaning of ‘liberation.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392113479751">Goodwin et al. (2001)</xref> claim that whereas the word ‘liberation’ hints at emotion, the word ‘cognitive’ immediately denies it. As noted below, hope is a powerful emotion that can shape our ‘cognitive’ understandings of the world and motivate us to act upon that world, and in the case of progressive movements, envision emancipation as the belief in the ability to change the course of events. But the question of ‘what is one liberated from?’ was not raised and/or dealt with. To deal with this issue of ‘what is one liberated from?’ we turn to Touraine’s thesis <italic>of the subject</italic> (individual and collective) in which self-production is seen as the means to change the future and achieve emancipation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392113479751">Touraine (1995)</xref> claims that in order to become a subject, an agent of change/a social movement in late modernity, individuals and groups have to undergo processes of subjectivation. To become a subject capable of change, to assert agency, individuals and collectivities have to free themselves of constraining social norms and roles; in some measure, they need to de-integrate themselves personally, socially, and culturally. The ability to become a subject thus depends on one’s ability to problematize one’s internalized reality and to inhabit the space at the seam between commitment and non-commitment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is the gesture of refusal, of resistance, that creates the subject. It is the more restricted ability to stand aside from our own social roles, our non-belonging and our need to protest that allows each of us to live as a subject. And subjectivation is always the antithesis of socialization, of adaptation to a social role or status. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392113479751">Touraine, 1995</xref>: 274)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bridging these two different cognitive theoretical formulations, one can claim that ‘cognitive detachment/liberation’ is actually part of this process of subjectivation, it is the prelude to the de-integration spelled out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011392113479751">Touraine (1995)</xref>. In terms of content, it means the liberation of the individual and groups from their total commitment to the social system and the roles and rules that it imposes on them. However, both of these formulations restrict their analyses to cognitive aspects of reality. Yet as Melucci and other scholars of the sociology of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011392113479751">Goodwin et al., 2001</xref>) argued, cognition and emotions are intertwined. Hence it follows that this process of cognitive liberation from roles and commitments is accompanied by a process of ‘emotional liberation/detachment’ as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011392113479751">Flam (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">2005</xref>), which means liberation from emotions that tie us to the system. As Flam puts it, ‘one’s emotional transformation, relaxation and cutting off the old emotional attachments, and the construction of new emotional bonds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">Flam, 2005</xref>: 31–32).</p>
<p>What are the emotions that tie us to the system and why are they so important? To begin with, the system in democratic societies cannot function without inputs from and the support and loyalty of the people. This support forges relationships among the individual, society, and the polity. These are expressed in terms of the social contract which specifies the rights and obligations that are at the basis of trust between the individual and authorities and define their duties and expectations as citizens in a democratic society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479751">Jasper (1998</xref>: 402, 406) discusses trust and respect as examples of basic affects that have important political implications. Both are ‘reflexive’ emotions and according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">Jasper (2011)</xref>, belong to the category of ‘affective loyalties.’ They are attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">Jasper, 2011</xref>), deep tendencies to have faith in the other, in our case, the government, since they are based on ‘an assumption that the government will fix things without public pressure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011392113479751">Jasper, 1998</xref>: 402). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011392113479751">Flam (2005</xref>: 21), following Simmel, discusses loyalty and gratitude as the two emotions that cement and bind people and social relations. Loyalty in particular is considered by Max Weber as the key emotion which links the powerless to the powerful. Trust in and respect for authorities, loyalty to and gratitude toward authorities, all have a dampening effect on protest. But when the expectations involved in trust and respect are not met, then loyalty and gratitude diminish and the counterparts of these emotions tend to appear in the form of disrespect, distrust, anger, and indignation. When people’s expectations are not only frustrated but, as is argued in all the articles in this monograph issue, when people suffer from anxieties about the future, and feel betrayed, then humiliation needs to be added to this constellation. Such a constellation is exactly the type of ‘emotional package’ that people try to avoid and has been discussed earlier in this article.</p>
<p>This can now be linked back to Habermas’s structural/system crises ‘migrating’ to life worlds at the micro level with ‘emotional liberation/detachment’ forming an important manifestation of crises of legitimacy, leading to movement mobilization. Thus, these emotional processes such as fear, anxiety, anger, and indignation can not only weaken commitment to the social order, but as people experience strong emotions in face of system dysfunction, hegemonic ideologies heretofore firmly anchored within collective identities become subject to contestation and renegotiation. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479751">Benski (2011)</xref> and Langman (this issue) have shown, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011392113479751">Ernst Bloch (1986)</xref>, hope is one of the most fundamental human emotions and motives for seeking change. For Bloch, hope was rooted in the Freudian notion of the dream as a wish fulfillment, especially the daydream in which through ‘anticipatory consciousness,’ we can imagine an alternative future free of the adversities of the present. For the various progressive social movements, hope becomes one of the primary motivations for seeking other emotional gratifications when concerted action is envisioned as leading to benevolent social transformations. These may include greater economic justice or dreams of democratic governance that genuinely represents the interests of the majority of citizens rather than the elites. Some may seek a world based upon social equality, toleration of difference, and the inclusion of all within a caring and sharing community. If hope for a better world and better life borders on the utopian – so be it.</p>
<p>In sum, what can be inferred from all of this is that the constellation of emotions that are salient at the first stages of mobilization is what Benski labeled elsewhere the ‘constellation of non-congruent’ emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011392113479751">Benski, 2011</xref>), such as: distrust of and disrespect toward authorities/elites and/or their perceived agents, indignation and righteous anger about conditions, and humiliation and hope for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011392113479751">Jasper, 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, the framing processes that are essential aspects of social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011392113479751">Benford and Snow, 2000</xref>) diagnose the situation and promote moral frames that denote injustice and designate enemies, villains, and the ‘good guys,’ provoke hope for an alternative social order. At each moment of social mobilization, emotions such as humiliation and anger are evoked when one’s very identity is denigrated and/or marginalized by authorities, while indignation and anger are directed toward those deemed responsible for their adversities. People refuse to pay the price for what they believe are irresponsible, unjust government practices and the misconduct of global finance by its agents who are supported by authorities and are designated as ‘greedy capitalist.’ The intensity of their feelings can be seen in the picture taken from a demonstration in Tel-Aviv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0011392113479751">Figure 2</xref>). The man in the picture is holding a sign that says: ‘When the government is against the people, the people are against the government.’</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>The mobilizations of summer 2011 were major news stories for a number of months. In various societies, all over the globe, grassroots mobilizations of vast numbers of people took to the streets to protest what they framed as ‘swinish capitalism,’ ‘government’s neoliberal capitalism,’ demanding ‘social justice.’ In some societies the struggle is still raging (Syria for example). In other societies, we have seen renewed efforts at mobilizing massive demonstrations, but such efforts have failed, for example in Israel. In still other societies we are witnessing a reawakening of activism (Egypt, Greece), but it is not yet certain that these will become a full blown second wave of global protests. Given the fluidity of the scene, in this article we focused on the summer of 2011.</p>
<p>The thesis that we presented here offers a theoretical framework that can be applied to the understanding of both democratic and authoritarian directions in the most recent waves of mobilization. However, we focused on one aspect of the democratic mobilizations, turning attention to the emotional processes that are integral aspects of these mobilizations. These processes have not been given enough attention in previous analyses of social movements and protest cycles. Indeed, both RM and NSM perspectives have failed to address the important role of emotions and feelings as precipitating factors in the emergence, functioning, and course of social movements. Following on the work of many prominent sociologist of social movements and of emotions, the theoretical outline that we sketch in this article rests on the simple premise that cognitive processes always involve emotions. Following this logic we adopted the concept of ‘emotional liberation’ as the emotional aspect of ‘cognitive liberation’ processes as addressed by McAdam, and conceptualized both as aspects of the process of subjectivation offered by Touraine as the route by which individuals and social movements become active social agents of change. Given Habermas’s theory of legitimation crises in which the structural intrudes into the life world, the micro level of self, identity, relationships and values, crises foster the withdrawal of allegiance from authorities and create the conditions for subjectivation. At this point, our analysis has led us to identifying emotions which forge the bond between the individual and society/authorities, and as a result we suggested that there is an emotional constellation in which a number of emotions or affects, that have a unique combination of non-congruent emotions that bring anger and indignation together with ‘hope,’ provide actors with the motivation to mobilize to attain emotionally gratifying liberation from the current forms of distress.</p>
<p>The theoretical arguments presented here go beyond the RM and NSM theories in that the economic factors that are essential for our theoretical formulation have generally been excluded from the analyses of NSM theorists; at the same time, the concerns with identity focus remain crucial, but not simply as the ‘identity politics’ implied by the new social movements’ approach that would valorize the marginalized, without considering the economic basis of marginalization.</p>
<p>While this has been a theoretical presentation, the value of our proposed structure of argumentation is in the powerful combination of macro and micro processes and the combination of cognition and emotions that are both responses to the situations and motivation for social change. It is not enough to simply understand that the situation or actions of authority are unjust. One must be motivated to act, and this motivation usually comes through emotional processes which accompany this cognition, particularly among those who are most adversely affected by the crisis in ways that frustrate one’s basic emotional needs. We contend that this is the initial step toward mobilization; this is what impels joining or participation in a network of refusal, places where people can renegotiate their subjectivities in hopes of realizing a different kind of society.</p>
