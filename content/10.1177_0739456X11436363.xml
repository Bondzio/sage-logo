<p>In a book that is a compilation of his life’s work and experiences, Nabeel Hamdi challenges the reader to rethink what constitutes place, who serves as the placemaker, how one creates place, and whether the lessons of the past can enable us to create sustainable and adaptable communities that nurture and are nurtured by the residents who inhabit them. Throughout the book, Hamdi argues for inclusive definitions of both place and the placemaker, asserting that these conceptualizations can be enhanced through experiential learning. In doing so, he echoes the views of Jane Jacobs and others who have engaged in questioning the motives, knowledge, and capacity of the expert planner. Hamdi begins the book with a powerful and provocative statement. He argues that “the intelligence of place . . . is in the streets of places everywhere, and not in the planning offices of bureaucracy” (p. xviii)—thus enticing the reader to position himself or herself as a placemaker, who is immersed in the community, works backwards, reasons inductively, values pluralism, embraces complexity, and is a reflective pragmatist. The stories and lessons offered in the book extol the power civic discourse, democratic decision making, and bottom-up planning. Hamdi also argues for inclusivity of both place and the placemaker, citing inclusivity as the key to reducing myopia, developing long-term community-based solutions, and generating buy-in and ownership.</p>
<p>While themes of participatory planning permeate nearly every chapter of the book, the book’s core focus is on international planning and development, and urban housing and settlement planning. The author’s case studies, drawn from his fieldwork in India, Sri Lanka, Ecuador, Peru, South Africa, and Thailand, focus primarily on informal settlements and the complexities associated with the placemaker’s interventions in such settlements. The book is organized in four parts. In Part 1, “Place, Time and Clutter: Learning from Practice,” Hamdi takes the reader on a journey through different case examples of what works and what does not work in the practice of settlement planning. Hamdi uses an imaginary informal settlement called Thawra to frame his discussion. He describes Thawra as both a representation of most slums and informal settlements, and a composite of the different projects he has researched. The projects used as examples include housing design, site design, public space design, utility provision and enhancement, enterprise opportunities, micro-credit and lending, health and sanitation, and land tenure. Hamdi uses these projects to implicate key factors leading to their success or demise. He also uses this discussion to address the particular issues that plague the inhabitants of informal settlements everywhere: urban poverty, the politics of governance and decision making, the lack of inclusiveness in planning interventions, income and other inequalities, vulnerability, and the lack of social and economic mobility.</p>
<p>In Part 2, “Placemaking and the Architecture of Opportunity,” Hamdi demonstrates the value of community participation in settlement intervention and planning. The chapters in this section outline several data collection and participation techniques structured around the primary goal of “looking and listening” (p. 71). Likening the role of a placemaker to that of a detective looking for clues or an acupuncturist seeking energy points, Hamdi educates the reader on how to contemplate a site, seek meaningful participation, determine project constraints, maximize participation impact, and harness the momentum of participation for project implementation. He demonstrates the value of reconnaissance, and participation techniques such as talent surveys, thought fountains, cognitive and social maps, murals, street theater, poems and music, picture analysis, site models, and storytelling.</p>
<p>In Part 3, “Placemakers: Responsible Practice and the Question of Scale,” Hamdi discusses whether and how community action planning can be “scaled up” in terms of both the comprehensiveness and longevity of impact. How can small strategic interventions provide coordinated, stable, sustainable, long-term solutions? Hamdi articulates his response in the form of an integrated model called PEAS—Providing, Enabling, the capacity to Adapt, the capacity to Sustain. Hamdi argues that the provision of resources should not be seen as a discrete task, rather as inextricably linked to the process of enabling individuals, creating opportunities, and enhancing their capacity to provide for themselves. When placemakers provide and enable with an eye toward the long term, they increase the likelihood that planning efforts will be sustainable, with opportunities for continuous change, and adaptability to this change through learning. In this section, Hamdi elaborates on his backwards reasoning approach, which is methodologically inductive, and bottom–up in directionality. He also discusses the importance of leveraging constraints to create opportunities, and creating feedback opportunities for reflective learning, and communication.</p>
<p>In Part 4, Teaching, Hamdi revisits Parts 1, 2, and 3 and challenges the reader to think of innovative ways of bringing practice into the classroom. In this section, the focus is on learning by doing, and learning from practice. By providing examples from his own studio courses, Hamdi posits that students should be taught to acknowledge the wicked nature of planning problems, embrace complexities and uncertainties inherent in planning, subscribe to a code of ethics, and develop a skill set that will enable a better transition from classroom to the field.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, the message of Hamdi’s book is as follows: community-based solutions offer lasting immediate and long-term impacts; the ultimate goal of planning is to create transformative solutions; empowerment is key to achieving transformative solutions that are adaptable and sustainable; building resiliency is important in ensuring the longevity of planning solutions; meaningful participation should not be a one-time occurrence but rather a continuous endeavor that is linked to local organization and governance structures; the placemaker is first and foremost a listener and learner who is grounded, and reasons backward, incrementally, and continually; reflecting on one’s experiences is an important component of learning, both in terms of understanding the researcher’s or practitioner’s role in the planning process, and for evaluation, adjustment, and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p>Through reading this book, placemakers everywhere will gain practical lessons on community involvement and participation. Academics will be impressed with the infinite possibilities of service learning and the lessons from pedagogical innovations. Those interested in international planning, housing, and settlement planning will be impressed with the author’s extensive offerings of cases, and examples. In all, the strength of this book is in the creative solutions that were crafted in the author’s cases to empower communities, maximize community assets and resources, and build lasting implementation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Hamdi acknowledges that this book is a compilation of his ideas, field notes, project evaluations, reflections, and lectures accumulated over several years of practice. While the richness of Hamdi’s experiences contributes in many ways to the strength of the book, the wide range of cases results in narratives that are compromised in terms of depth, contextual information, and analytical detail. It would have been well worth it, to track at least a few cases from start to finish—that is, detailing how and why the author was involved in the project, the issues at hand, how data were gathered, the range of public participation techniques used, the results of the data collection and participation exercises, how solutions were created, the types of solutions that were created, organizational and structural changes that were devised for continued implementation, results, reflection, and lessons. No doubt all of these aspects of project development and implementation are present in the book, but offered through different case examples, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand the complexities associated with the examples offered. The author offers several figures and photographs. These could have been better referenced, and explained in text. The transition from micro-level analysis of specific interventions in settlement planning and macro-level statistics was difficult to follow at times, as was the transition from the imaginary Thawra to the actual cases offered in the book. The author’s goal was to present a book that is free of jargon and easy to read. He succeeded in making the book accessible. That said, there were some missed opportunities in terms of explicitly linking planning practice to theory. Those interested in this linkage will find valuable information on the different types of learning, cooperation and collaboration, incremental planning, ethics, and networks. These have not been explicitly and sufficiently rendered, however.</p>
<p>In sum, Hamdi’s book is a fun and interesting read. It will inspire you to strap on your boots, muddle through, and venture out to experience planning in practice.</p>
