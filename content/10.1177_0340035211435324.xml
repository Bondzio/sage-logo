<abstract>
<p>Free government information fuels innovation among all the world's children and has the potential to enhance every aspect of their lives. The Gov Doc Kids Group, located in the United States, was formed to promote the use of government information to children, kindergarten through high school. Members of the Gov Doc Kids Group describe the formation of the group, international and country websites useful for children, and present tried-and-true, effective means of opening the doors of government information to children. The paper will explore ways the group utilizes the web to promote government information to children and provide an in-depth description of how a Government Documents Children’s Collection was formed. Although the examples discussed here are United States-centric projects, these ideas could flourish in almost any country.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Government information is the output of actions, concepts and processes associated with daily, yearly, and era-based government operations at multiple levels, local, provincial, country, and international. It is usually a credible source of data, description, provenance, measurement, and – most importantly – human endeavor. While much government information may be easily recognized and understood by adults, it can be much harder to recognize and understand by children who are still developing their critical thinking skills, particularly those related to information location and evaluation.</p>
<p>Although the examples discussed here are United States-centric projects, these ideas could flourish in almost any country. In the spirit of open access to government information, all countries of the world owe it to their children and young adults to explore, be knowledgeable about and to learn from the wealth of government documents in their home country. This article may serve as a model for achieving that goal.</p>
<p>In order to provide an understanding of agencies and programs that are mentioned throughout this paper, this description is provided. Acting on the fundamental belief that in order to sustain a democracy, the public must have access to information about their government’s activities, in 1813 Congress made available to all Americans information about the work of the three branches of Government. The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) publishes and disseminates government publications to the American public, Federal depository libraries, Congress, and Federal agencies. Identifying libraries as a means to disseminate government information to the public, the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) was established by Congress. Since 1813, the FDLP has provided government information free of charge to depository libraries throughout the country and territories. In turn, these depository libraries provide free access to this information in an impartial environment with professional assistance. Most of this information is free and online, making it available worldwide.</p>
<p>The various segments of this paper seek to provide a forum for discussion as to how various types of government information are defined and made accessible for children. Three segments, Gov Doc Kids Group, FDLP Community and the Gov Doc Kids Group, and How to Create a Government Documents Children’s Collection identify historical facts, structural elements, and group dynamics which illustrate both general government information for children. These concepts are key components of successful child-based government information service strategy and specific Gov Doc Kids Group best practices, which have enabled the group to reach out worldwide to children and educators to promote the use of government information for children.</p>
<p>Other segments will provide specific examples of resources and services which are targeted for children. Joining Hands Around the World: Countries Resources for Children and Teachers and Country Information for Kids/Teens examine worldwide country resources which allow children to learn more about important country-related facts, concepts, and contextual relationships, which influence how they will ultimately participate in a global social, political, economic, and environmental culture. The five sections are introduced here:</p>
<p>
<bold>Gov Doc Kids Group </bold>by Martha Childers discusses the Group’s formation, purpose, and activities. Government information is by and large reliable. As a result, the Gov Doc Kids Group was formed to promote government information in order to engage kindergarten through high school students in learning about history, culture, science, and government through games and other interactive activities. Group members are active and involved, offering presentations, writing articles, and providing children’s programming. Due to the nature of current information dispersal, which is primarily electronic, the Group maintains the following websites: http://community.fdlp.gov/govdockidsgroup, govdocs4children.pbworks.com/, and wikis.ala.org/godort/index.php/Gov_Doc_Kids.</p>
<p>
<bold>FDLP Community and the Gov Doc Kids Group</bold> by Katy Davis discusses the use of the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) Community in promoting the Gov Doc Kids Group and their Constitution Day Poster Contest and on the web by leveraging the tools available on the FDLP Community website. As a result, the FDLP Community site allows the Gov Doc Kids Group to use web technologies available that were previously unavailable to them (e.g. photo gallery to display posters).</p>
<p>
<bold>How to Create a Government Documents Children’s Collection </bold>by John H. Faria explores the establishment of a government documents children’s collection. The Government Documents Department at El Paso (Texas) Public Library was doing outreach to staff with a series of informative workshops on government documents in early 2008. Great interest by the attendees prompted the Children’s Supervisor to offer a section from the Children’s Department to form the Government Documents Children’s Collection.</p>
<p>
<bold>Joining Hands Around the World: Countries Resources for Children and Teachers </bold>by Tom Adamich presents a variety of resources about countries. In the spirit of forming a better understanding of the world today, having good country descriptions and resources enables children to grow in their understanding of other cultures and population groups. Profiled are two such resources working in tandem, the United States Department of State Countries Portal (http://www.state.gov/countries/ /) and the Library of Congress Country Studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/">http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/</ext-link>). Jim and Justine Veatch’s ‘Kids Government Documents Online’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldcat.org/profiles/jveatch/lists/599894">http://www.worldcat.org/profiles/jveatch/lists/599894</ext-link>), a collection of United States government e-resources is also discussed.</p>
<p>
<bold>Country Information for Kids/Teens </bold>by Antoinette W. Satterfield delves into the challenges and opportunities of using the Internet for country research. With so much information being available on the Internet, school children often turn to the web when searching for resources to use when learning about our world. These searches should also include government information. There are maps and educational games regarding the European Union available from the Europa Teacher’s Corner website and information about the United States can be found on Kids.gov. The <italic>World Factbook</italic> available from the United States CIA website gives basic information about all countries around the world that could be useful for both the elementary or high school student.</p>
<p>Together, these five segments present a range of practices and experiences utilized in the United States. They may serve as models for promoting the use of government information in other regions of the world.</p>

<title>Gov Doc Kids Group</title>
<p>The Gov Docs Kids Group was conceived during a summer 2006 meeting of the Kansas (USA) Library Association, Government Documents Roundtable. The group is made up of government information librarians and archivists. Providing credibility, sponsors provide support by publicizing group efforts and by donating prizes for Constitution Day Poster Contest winners.</p>
<p>In order to state the group’s purpose and direction, early in its formation, the group developed this mission statement:<disp-quote>
<p>To promote government information in order to engage K-12 students in learning about history, culture, science, and government through games and other interactive activities; to assist teachers and school librarians with locating teaching aids, lesson plans, and exciting tools to enhance students' learning, and to provide librarians with a collection of free government resources to advance their reference interview and collection development decisions.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The project was conceived as a promotional tool for the value of government documents to K-12 students and teachers in addressing the requirement to integrate Constitution Day into public school curricula. The Group fulfills its mission by making presentations to groups of children and professional organizations, writing articles, creating websites, and organizing an annual Constitution Day Poster Contest.</p>
<p>The group is co-sponsored by the State Library of Kansas (USA), Kansas Library Association Government Documents Roundtable (KLA GODORT), Wichita State University (Kansas, USA), the Kansas State Library, the State Library of Ohio (USA) and the Government Documents Roundtable of Ohio. Corporate sponsors include ConstitutionFacts.com, Naperville, Illinois (USA) and Mannington Mills, Salem, New Jersey (USA). Government partners are the United States Defense Commissary Agency, United States Department of Energy, United States Office of Scientific and Technical Information, and the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Library.</p>
<p>The Gov Doc Kids Group Constitution Day Poster Contest, which started in 2007, is a promotional tool for the value of government information to kindergarten through high school students and teachers in addressing a United States federal mandate requiring primary and elementary schools receiving federal funds to have a program on Constitution Day, September 17 each year.</p>
<p>The group creates a contest form and publicizes the event through the news releases, an e-blast to listservs, an e-blast to organizations, and an e-mail publicity notice that the Kansas State Librarian sends to other state librarians. The e-blast includes a request for individuals and groups to resend the publicity to other listservs, organizations, and individuals. These become viral and provide a wide network of publicity requiring no financial outlay.</p>
<p>ConstitutionFacts.com designs a poster promoting the contest that is distributed to United States Defense Commissary Agency (DCA) around the world. Contest entries are received, sorted, and judged. The contest is supported on the ConstitutionFacts.com website where images of the previous winning posters and the current entry information are provided. Participation has increased each year:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>2007: 161 entries from 8 states and two United States Department of Defense schools in Japan with 10 winners</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>2008: 1,100 entries from 7 states with 14 winners</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>2009: 2,395 entries from 37 states and United States Department of Defense schools in Italy, Japan, and Korea with 13 winners</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>2010: 9,347 entries from 45 states and Department of Defense Schools in Italy, Japan, and South Korea with 13 winners and 9 honorable mentions</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>2011: 31,000 entries from most states and Department of Defense Schools in various countries with 12 winners.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The winners receive two posters, a certificate, and a press release to a local paper of their choice. They receive age appropriate promotional materials from the United States Department of Energy, Office of Scientific and Technical Information, the United States Government Printing Office, and the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Library. The first 100 entrants receive one copy each of the United States Constitution from Oak Hill Publishing Company. Articles about winners have appeared in various newspapers such as the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> and the <italic>Stars and Stripes</italic>. Shown is an image of a 2007 Constitution Day Poster Contest winner by Eui Min Kim, age 16 at the time, Kadena High School, Okinawa, Japan.</p>

</fig>
<p>The group supports four websites. The original wiki is located at http://govdocs4children.pbworks.com/, which provides the greatest wealth of sources about government information for children and those who serve them; such as parents, teachers, and librarians. Links to some of the United States governmental agencies offering information for children can be found here.</p>
<p>ConstitutionFacts.com created a website http://www.constitutionfacts.com/ devoted to the poster contest. Each year the site has been enhanced. Because of its user-friendly name, the group chose to use this website as the primary site for publicity.</p>
<p>The group has been the first to utilize the new Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) Community to develop a presence for government information librarians and has worked closely with the United States Government Printing Office staff to utilize the capabilities of the Community site (http://community.fdlp.gov/groups/viewgroup/14Gov+Doc+Kids+Group.html). This site is of interest due to the availability of space. Even before the site was publicized, it was tapped for documents early in its development. The following segment of this paper describes this project in detail.</p>
<p>The American Library Association Government Documents Round Table (ALA GODORT) continues to support a Group wiki on its site as well (http://wikis.ala.org/godort/index.php/Gov_Doc_Kids); however, space limitations exist on this site.</p>
<p>Group members have published articles in professional publications, including <italic>Library Media Connection</italic>, <italic>OELMA Media Spectrum</italic>, and <italic>DttP: Documents to the People</italic>. The group continues to actively engage in presentations to promote the mission. Group members have presented programs to children as well as professional organizations, such as the American Library Association, Kansas Library Association, and the Kansas City (Missouri, USA) Metropolitan Library &amp; Information Network, and IFLA’s World Library and Information Congress.</p>
<p>New members who are willing to be active, self-directed, and collaborative are welcome to join the Gov Doc Kids Group. To date, the group has been a national group based in the United States, but in today’s electronic world, the potential of becoming an international organization is feasible. Group members are fully aware of the rich government resources available at local, regional, national, foreign, and international levels and look forward to finding ways to more effectively promote this wealth of information to children.</p>

<title>About the FDLP Community site</title>
<p>The FDLP Community (http://community.fdlp.gov) is a site designed to create an online, interactive venue to enhance the world of government documents. Some of the content was created by employees of the US Government Printing Office (GPO); however, the content in this site is primarily created by members. Members are typically Federal documents librarians who participate in the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). Tapping into the knowledge of members, the FDLP Community site can offer relevant, real-world experience, observations, and advice from the contributions of the people who work with government documents on a daily basis. The more members share, the richer a resource the FDLP Community site becomes for those who seek or share relevant information.</p>
<p>The FDLP Community provides a no-cost solution for members from all geographic locations to network and exchange ideas. The site is available 24 hours a day, allowing members to contribute when it is convenient for them as opposed to having to adjust an already crowded schedule.</p>

<sec id="section5-0340035211435324">
<title>Why not just use a free social networking tool already available?</title>
<sec id="section6-0340035211435324">
<title>Technologies</title>
<p>Similar to currently available social networking sites, the FDLP Community gives members multiple channels of communication. A member can create a profile, ‘friend’ associates, comment, blog, upload photos, private message fellow community members, start a group, create web links, upload documents, and search. Each of those functionalities has additional features attached to them as well. GPO is continually researching ways to improve the existing technologies and looking into technologies that can be added to the site in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0340035211435324">
<title>Security</title>
<p>The Community provides members with a safe, private, and secure environment. Privacy concerns matter with GPO and the privacy settings will not arbitrarily be changed. Additionally, there is no outside advertising or behind the scenes harvesting of personal information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0340035211435324">
<title>True community</title>
<p>Federal depository librarians have a very specialized role as people who build, catalog, organize, maintain, and provide public access to government documents. GPO knows that these professionals are a close-knit group and encounter unique challenges. With awareness of this knowledge and as administrators of the FDLP, GPO can insure that the proper tools for communication best suited for librarians are made available, and build an online community that meets their specific needs. GPO conforms to the technological needs of the FDLP librarian, rather than conforming to the somewhat inflexible technologies offered by other free social networking sites. This awareness of the specific needs of the FDLP librarian, along with member participation, will build a stronger community online.</p>

<title>Gov Doc Kids Group and the Constitution Day Poster Contest</title>
<sec id="section10-0340035211435324">
<title>History and Objectives</title>
<p>A representative from the Gov Doc Kids Group contacted the GPO late October/early November in 2009. The group was interested in exploring new technologies for promoting their Constitution Day Poster Contest and expanding awareness about the Gov Doc Kids Group. The group also needed a cost free solution. After a couple of conversations with GPO, it was agreed that the Gov Doc Kids Group could leverage the tools of the FDLP Community to reach out to a targeted audience of government librarians, along with their current audience (teachers, kids, parents, librarians, etc.).</p>
<p>The FDLP Community site enabled:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>collaboration between the Gov Doc Kids group and other members on the site</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>a public online presence</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>access to technologies that FDLP Community had available that other websites the group was using did not</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the ability to leverage tools to share information about their group and the Constitution Day Poster Contest.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0340035211435324">
<title>Implementation</title>
<p>The Gov Doc Kids Group used a number of tools and features on the FDLP Community Site. The following is a list of what they utilized:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Groups.</italic> Gov Doc Kids Group established an online group by forming one on the FDLP Community site. This allowed members of this group to share a mission statement, publish announcements, create and reply to discussions related to the group, create photo albums, and post to a group wall. The group can be found on the FDLP Community here: http://community.fdlp.gov/groups/viewgroup/14-Gov+Doc+Kids+Group.html.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Web links</italic>. The FDLP Community has a tool that allows members to share links to websites they consider helpful or resourceful to other members. Gov Doc Kids Group took advantage of this feature. GPO created their own section under Community Groups where they are able to continually add links as needed. Their section is further organized by categories. The Gov Doc Kids Group links can be found here: http://community.fdlp.gov/weblinks/community-groups/gov-doc-kids-group.html.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>File sharing.</italic> Gov Doc Kids Group utilized the FDLP Community’s file sharing feature to upload and share documents with others. They were able to make their Constitution Day Poster Contest entry form available as a PDF for those who wished to apply to the contest by filling out the form and submitting it along with the original artwork by post. They were also able to make their Press Kit and various flyers available for anyone who wanted to download them. Their documents can be found here: http://community.fdlp.gov/files/cat_view/71-gov-doc-kids-group.html.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Gallery.</italic> Constitution Day Poster Contest winner and runner-up submissions are featured in our Gallery. You can find the top submissions from 2008–2011. All of Gov Doc Kids Group photo albums can be found here: http://community.fdlp.gov/gallery.html.</p>
</list-item>

</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0340035211435324">
<title>Lessons learned and best practices</title>
<p>The collaboration with the Gov Doc Kids Group gave the administrators of the FDLP Community a window into user experience. GPO had the opportunity to see how people are interacting with each other and with the tools made available on the site. The feedback from Gov Doc Kids Group gave GPO an invaluable understanding of needed usability improvements on the Community site. GPO also learned what features this group of members wanted, either through their actions or by direct request.</p>
<p>The main audience is members of FDLP Community, and it is necessary to keep this audience in mind when content is provided from a group. The information that is posted by a group allows other members to respond, share ideas or collaborate with a group. The general public can view most of the information on FDLP Community (unless some privacy features were enacted, e.g. setting a profile to private or making a private group), but the general public does not have access to the tools provided for members.</p>
<p>If a library organization is not in the position of having its own web presence, and the members of the organization are associated with the FDLP, the Community site can be a place to provide it. However, getting an individual web presence is recommended for the following reasons:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Allows a group to provide information clearly targeted to a particular audience. In Gov Doc Kids Group, this would be teachers, kids, and parents.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Gives the administrator of the site the ability to gather customized statistics geared toward the group who owns the site.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Allows the group to drive traffic to one main place giving the group a more unified presence.</p>
</list-item>

<title>How to create a government documents children’s collection</title>
<p>At El Paso (Texas) Public Library several steps were taken to create a Government Documents Children’s Collection, the first of which was outreach to the Main Library staff, the branches staff, and management. During February 2008, library staff attended training given by experts in the State of Texas to go over the latest developments in government documents and to ensure staff was up-to-date on government documents processes and procedures. Then at a Management Team meeting a presentation was made by the Head of Government Documents Department focusing on the resources of the Government Documents Department, both print and online. The branch managers in particular were surprised by the offerings. This was followed by a series of workshops presenting a broad overview of the Government Documents Collection and the Federal Depository Library Program to library staff, first to the Main Library staff, then the branches’ staffs.</p>
<p>As a result, interest was sparked in the Children’s Supervisor and her staff to determine whether government documents were also available for children. Since they are, a staff member was assigned to go through the collection and identify items suitable for the Children’s Department. This is the method used to put together the Government Documents Children’s Collection for the Children’s Department. First, it was observed that many government agencies produce various documents that are geared toward schoolteachers, parents, and children. Some of the documents are curriculum based and class ready. Other documents are full of information on how to help children read, study, etc. Kits and DVDs also contain instructions on how to stay physically healthy and eat the right foods. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Health and Human Services have published puzzles, activity books, and board games. Many children’s books have been written to teach children about numerous subject areas from planting a seed and watching it grow to how and what to eat if they are diabetic. There are even comic books about libraries.</p>
<p>Within the general government documents collection these materials were not used to their full extent. So when the Children’s Supervisor showed interest in these government document materials, the idea was conceived and accepted to identify those materials in the collection that were geared towards children, parents, and teachers and to see if a children’s collection could be put together. Materials are published by a variety of agencies, such as NASA, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior, and the State of Texas. Formats include books, pamphlets, AV kits, DVDs, VHS, puzzles, games, coloring books, and binders. A ‘tree’ in the Children’s Department was chosen to house the collection, which is broken down into three sections, for children, parents, and teachers. The selected items were processed and transferred in a week.</p>

<p>The Government Documents Children’s Collection has been a success. The Children’s Supervisor wants more of these kinds of materials, and this has been accommodated in the selection process. Since these items were placed in the Children’s Department they have seen an increase in usage and circulation. The assignment of these materials has also allowed the Government Documents Department to reach out to children and their parents and make them aware of the government documents resources at the El Paso (Texas) Public Library.</p>

<title>Joining hands around the world: countries resources for children, teachers, and parents</title>
<p>In today’s global arena, as a result of cyber-communication and worldwide virtual access to information via the Internet, the need to identify and use basic information on countries of the world (in reports, cultural exchange, commerce, etc.) has become increasingly important. Additionally, understanding the overall jurisdiction of a country including its dependencies and special areas of sovereignty is also important. Knowing where to find credible and comprehensive countries of the world information and how to use the information is the goal of this discussion.</p>
<sec id="section15-0340035211435324">
<title>US Department of State Country Profiles and Background Notes</title>
<p>The US Department of State Country Profiles Database is a comprehensive database which contains basic information for over 200 countries, territories, and other special areas of sovereignty. Located at http://www.state.gov/p/, the Country Profiles Database is a compilation of information which identifies basic facts about countries which may fall within one or more of the following descriptive categories:</p>

<p>Most of this information is found in the Background Notes section. Each section explores the country’s geographical, economic, cultural, and political composition from both the macro and micro perspectives. According to the website:<disp-quote>
<p>Background Notes include facts about the land, people, history, government, political conditions, economy, and foreign relations of independent states, some dependencies, and areas of special sovereignty. The Background Notes are updated/revised by the Office of Electronic Information and Publications of the Bureau of Public Affairs as they are received from the Department's regional bureaus.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition to current Background Notes entries (which profile over 100 countries and territories), access to an archive of older versions of Background Notes can be found at http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/index.htm. The following example examines the country Austria. According to the resources found at http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3165.htm, Austria’s profile covers the following topics: Geography, People, Government and Economy.</p>
<p>A Department of State Country Profile may also include a link to a Library of Congress Country Study page. This resource explores further various aspects of the country, including its economic policies, laws/legal codes, era/epoch history, sociology, and ecological issues.</p>
<p>Both the Library of Congress <italic>Country Studies</italic> and the US Department of State <italic>Country Profiles</italic> are compiled from the various reports submitted by members of the regional bureaus of the Department of State’s Bureau of Public Policy and Bureau of Affairs for the appropriate geographical location (in this case, the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs).</p>

<italic>Kids Government Documents Online</italic> (http://www.worldcat.org/profiles/jveatch/lists/599894<underline>)</underline> is a collection of United States government e-resources, or those resources accessible only via the Internet. These examples of the rich resources providing country information which are easily accessible online for children and teens illustrate the new frontier created through the Internet. All are available worldwide free of charge to anyone with a computer and Internet connectivity. Most of the resources found in this bibliography are accessible worldwide and profile government information resources available via the United States Government, particularly the United States Forest Service and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>

<title>Country information for kids or teens</title>
<p>There was a time when most school papers were written by finding information in printed encyclopedias and other books and magazines. At that time, we would not have used the term ‘printed encyclopedias’, because all encyclopedias were printed. The dining table or floor would often be covered in such material, and the young child or high school student would have pen or pencil in hand and paper on which to write the information he or she had recently discovered.</p>
<p>However, many children today retrieve their information from the Internet. Realizing the increased dependence on computers for information, governments and various organizations use the Internet to disseminate educational materials. These resources include games, videos, different languages, music, stories, as well as facts and detailed information about individual countries and continents.</p>
<p>Tahiroglu (2007) states, in a study involving Turkish youths, that they are found to use the computer first to play games and second to gather information.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0340035211435324">1</xref> </sup>These findings could most likely be used to describe youth in any country. If youth are spending so much time with the computer, then having information they need for education purposes in the same location is surely a positive attribute.</p>
<p>Also, an article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0340035211435324">Chiang and Lin (2010</xref>) concentrated on a playfulness trait found in adolescents. To hold the attention of adolescents and create an eagerness to continue with an online game, these games must focus on the trait of playfulness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0340035211435324">2</xref>
</sup> Many educational sites focus on this trait by offering interactive maps, games, and puzzles. Others may use cartoon characters, bright colors, and flashing lights. By doing so there is a greater chance of holding a child’s attention for longer spans of time.</p>
<p>For instance, the Public Broadcast Service (PBS) has a site for children titled ‘Africa for Kids’ (http://pbskids.org/africa) with information about life in Africa. Two activities on the PBS site are particularly impressive. One is a link titled My World, which offers pictures and information about the lives of children that attend schools in four different countries in Africa. There are stories and pictures about schools in Accra, Ghana; Wundanyi, Kenya; Winterveldt, South Africa; and Kampala, Uganda. Young people can learn about how these students dress, eat, play, and live. They can easily compare some of the differences and similarities between themselves and those living in these areas and attending these particular schools.</p>
<p>There is also a link here to a site about a traditional African musical instrument titled Thumb Piano Tunes. Here we read that the thumb piano is “simple to make and easy to play” and that it is common in almost all parts of Africa. Users are given the opportunity to virtually play this African musical instrument using the mouse, as well as record the music they create, play it back, and listen to the tune just performed.</p>
<p>For the older child, the World Bank (www.http://worldbank.org) offers a website with basic information on 180 countries. As students dig deeper and deeper into the website, they can find tables with information about any of these countries, such as population numbers, literacy percentages, and mortality rates. Some of these sites are offered in more than one language. There are also reports and publications about economy, industry, agriculture, and other topics.</p>
<p>If just fundamental information is needed, the <italic>World Factbook</italic> is quickly available from the United States Central Intelligence Agency website (http://www.cia.gov). Here the student can find principal information about countries, such as population, currency, military, and structure of their government.</p>
<p>Europa is the official website for the European Union (EU) where students can find information about currency (euro), member countries, and basic information on the structure and function of the European Union. The page with links to kid’s games, quizzes, and competitions (http://europa.eu/quick-links/eu-kids/index_en.htm) has activities that can be played in a multitude of languages. These games offer information about the euro, the appearance of various banknotes, how to count them, and how the currency has changed since the earliest of times. By logging in, the players can each keep up with their scores within each game.</p>
<p>From this page is also a game site titled Europa Go! where students can take quizzes (with noises and cartoon characters to signify whether answers were right or incorrect) about history, geography, language, and even agriculture of the various countries of the EU. Even though it is geared towards children, it can be educational for older students and adults when trying to increase their own knowledge of the global community.</p>
<p>The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia (http://saudiembassy.net/about/) in Washington, DC, offers information in great detail about Saudi Arabia, including ancient history, the birth of Islam, basic laws of governance, procedure before Shari’ah Courts, education, agriculture, and sports, among other topics. Many embassies offer such pages for their countries. Information is just a click away for our computer generation.</p>
<p>Some websites may simply be fun, but they encourage concentration, stimulate the senses for sight and sound, and teach basic computer skills without needing much supervision (content is appropriate for the young). Australia offers one titled ABC for Kids (http://www.abc.net.au/abcforkids) that includes videos, games, televisions shows, pages to print and color, crafts, and recipes. This site utilizes cartoon characters as well as humans.</p>
<p>The US National Security Agency (NSA) publishes a fun website, mostly for older youth, titled America’s CryptoKids (http://www.nsa.gov/kids) that teaches users how to create and decipher codes. Focusing more on the older student, there is a Morse code activity as well as a student resources page giving information about the history of cryptology and the listing of high school and college programs in this field. The games found on this website may encourage youth to consider a future in the fields of math and science.</p>
<p>Many more intricate, authoritative, and useful websites for gathering information for school research papers can be found. Also, even more are just plain fun, with lessons to be learned even when the child does not realize it!</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The world of government documents for children is as yet uncharted. An introduction into this wealth of information has been provided here, providing descriptions of some websites and connections to an active association, the Gov Doc Kids Group, which promotes its use. As this information is by and large reliable and free, individuals, groups, and associations around the world are encouraged to explore and promote this realm for the benefit of children and those who help them.</p>
