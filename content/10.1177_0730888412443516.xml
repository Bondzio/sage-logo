<p>Professor Rhacel Parreñas, a sociologist at the University of Southern California, has produced an extremely well-researched and interesting book on the lives of Filipina women who migrate to Japan to earn money as hostesses in Tokyo’s entertainment districts. Parreñas spent 3 months working in a hostess club and 9 months in Tokyo altogether. While there, she conducted 56 interviews in Filipino, each lasting about 2 hr. With the benefit of fluency in the language and culture, a strong background in research on migration and women’s rights, and a keen eye for human behavior, Parreñas unfolds the inner-workings of Filipino hostess clubs in Japan—how they operate, what is expected of hostesses, how hostesses relate to clients, and how Filipina hostesses and nonhostesses get along. She emphasizes the degree to which hostesses “flirt” but rarely have sex with their clients, as titillation is a Japanese cultural norm. In her view, it is difficult to label hostesses as “trafficked victims” who have been coerced or maltreated. In addition to female hostesses, Parreñas addresses the situation of “Bakla” or transgendered hostesses (male born, functioning as women) who find more acceptance in Japan than in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Parreñas also scrutinizes the migration systems that underwrite the movement of Filipinas to Japan and the threats that accompany those on “entertainer” and “tourist” visas. Her main thesis is that antitrafficking laws and tightened visa regulations and measures have harmed the opportunity of Filipinas to migrate and work peacefully in Japan. The sharp reduction in “entertainer” visas issued to Filipinas as a result of pressure on Japan and other developed countries to reduce human trafficking was a “setback” for women rights, according to Parreñas. She also sees the criminalization of human trafficking a blow to a normal pattern of labor migration among impoverished women who are desperate to earn money to support families at home. Misplaced fears of “human trafficking” have jeopardized the welfare of Filipinas working in Japan and subjected many to deportation.</p>
<p>Parreñas’ window on Filipina hostess-contractors in Tokyo is enlightening and compelling, yet a few policy and organized crime-related questions emerge. Parreñas critiques the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act and presumably also the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons as blunt instruments that deny Filipina hostesses to pursue the economic options they deserve. It is most certainly true that global protocols are not workable mechanisms for every state-signatory. That is why most countries, including the Philippines, have crafted their own national human trafficking laws. It is somewhat surprising that Parreñas did not refer to the Filipino law, passed in 2003, and discuss aspects that could be amended to better meet the needs of its citizens.</p>
<p>Sex work may not mean prostitution, but sex work is not a profession of choice. Numerous studies attest to the psychosocial and physical harm that accompanies “sex work.” Those who seek this work have been sexually abused as children or forced by spouses or others to perform sex work, be it flirtation, masturbation, or intercourse. Its impact on self-worth, trust, and confidence is indisputably bad, particularly for minors.</p>
<p>The thousands of hostesses hankering for visas to Japan may have money as a motivator, but that is not the only reason they are leaving for glorified brothels.</p>
<p>Finally, the <italic>Yakuza</italic>, and more specifically the <italic>Yamaguchi Gumi</italic>, control the commercial sex trade in Japan. To keep new and interesting “human product” available in Roppongi and elsewhere, they intimidate migration officials, influence legislators, infiltrate sex businesses, and create front companies for protecting their criminal operations. According to some estimates, the sex industry accounts for 2% of Japan’s GNP, which is more than its defense budget. The broad and open array of sexual services available in Japan’s entertainment districts speaks to a “culture of tolerance” for commercial sex deeply ingrained and historically accepted. Yakuza members may be kind and generous in a Filipina hostess club, but their violent methods and extraordinary capacity to intimidate the leaders, the government, and control the sex trade will keep the Filipinas coming to Roppongi for many years to come. Perhaps Parreñas could tackle the “demand” side in her next book?</p>
