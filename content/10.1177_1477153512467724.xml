<p>CIE-R<sub>a</sub> is the current CIE colour rendering index (CRI). Over the last 9 years, CIE TC 1-69 has worked to propose a new CIE colour rendering index. The TC was established because CIE-R<sub>a</sub> uses outdated colorimetric tools and underestimates the rendering ability of LED solid-state light sources. In TC 1-69, there has been extensive collaboration between academics and manufacturers.</p>
<p>The outcome of the TC’s work is of two types, different types of indices and different types of experimental data. Four types of colour indices have been developed: Colour fidelity, colour preference, colour discrimination and colour harmony. The first, a single-number colour fidelity index, is strongly desired by the manufacturers. The newly developed colour fidelity indices include nCRI and CRI-CAM02UCS. A colour preference index could be based on memory colours such as the memory colour rendering index (MCRI), or based on the preference of a colour shift for example, higher colourfulness as in the colour quality scale (CQS). A colour discrimination index allows users to have a higher visibility under a light source. A colour harmony index evaluates the change of the overall appearance of a colour scheme when moving from the test source to the reference illuminant. In the experimental work of TC1-69, the latter two indices received less attention than the first two.</p>
<p>As for new data, the results of psychophysical experiments were used to test different CRIs. The data can be separated into three groups: Naturalness, Preference and Fidelity. The first two groups involve asking observers to assess the appearance of natural materials such as fruit, flowers and vegetables in terms of naturalness, and attractiveness/appeal. A combined index, including CIE-R<sub>a</sub> plus a gamut area index (GAI), predicted the Naturalness datasets best. A memory-based index (MCRI) gave the best prediction of the Preference data. The fidelity-based indices gave the worse predictions of these two datasets, as might be expected. For predicting colour fidelity datasets, all the colour fidelity-based indices (CIE-R<sub>a</sub>, CQS, nCRI and CRI-CAM02UCS) outperformed the other types of models such as MCRI, GAI. However, they all gave very similar predictions such that it was difficult to distinguish a ‘best index.’ In conclusion, TC1-69 could not make a recommendation of a single colour fidelity index to replace the CIE-R<sub>a</sub>.</p>
<p>In September 2012, CIE Division 1 established two new TCs to cover the CRI topics. The first TC is entitled ‘Colour Fidelity Index’ with terms of reference ‘to evaluate available indices based on colour fidelity for assessing the colour quality of white-light sources with a goal of recommending a single colour fidelity index for industrial use.’ The second is entitled ‘New Method for Evaluating the Colour Quality of White-Light Sources’ with terms of reference ‘to evaluate available new methods for evaluating the colour quality of white-light sources with a goal of recommending new methods for industrial use. (Methods based on colour fidelity should not be included.)’ It can be seen that although TC1-69 could not recommend a single index, CIE is still committed to serve industry by providing two indices for industrial applications.</p>
