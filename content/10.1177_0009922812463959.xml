<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 10-week-old previously healthy female infant presented to a community hospital after a brief episode of choking and “turning blue” while feeding. Parents reported a 4-day history of poor feeding, weakness, weak cry, and lethargy. The baby was primarily formula fed with some breast milk and taking about 4 ounces every 4 hours, until 4 days prior to admission when, because of her poor suck, parents began spoon-feeding her 1 to 2 ounces of formula every 4 hours.</p>
<p>Review of systems was negative for fever, cough, and diarrhea but notable for 4 days without a bowel movement. Pregnancy was uncomplicated, and prenatal labs, including group B strep, were all negative and/or within normal limits, resulting in the birth of a 3.4 kg infant at 39 weeks’ gestation. Except for a recent diagnosis of oral candidiasis, the baby had no significant past medical history, exposures, sick contacts, or travel. She was being treated with oral nystatin for the candidiasis and had received her 2-month vaccinations.</p>
<p>Vital signs on admission were normal for age; weight was 5.2 kg. On initial neurological exam, the patient showed global hypotonia and physiological deep tendon reflexes with hoarse cry and weak suck, but no signs of respiratory distress. Complete metabolic panel and creatinine kinase were within normal limits. C-reactive protein was slightly elevated at 8.95 mg/L (normal &lt;5 mg/L). Urinalysis was unremarkable. White blood cell count was slightly elevated at 16.2 × 10<sup>3</sup>/µL with 49% neutrophils and 42% lymphocytes. No lumbar puncture was performed; head ultrasound was normal. Blood and urine cultures were negative. She was admitted for dehydration and presumed clinical sepsis, treated with 7 days of ceftriaxone and discharged home with an adaptive nipple.</p>
<p>However, because of persistent weakness and poor feeding, the primary care pediatrician admitted the patient to a different community teaching hospital 14 days after her symptoms began. Further questioning revealed that the constipation and weakening suck were initially accompanied by general lethargy and marked head lag, which progressed to include first upper- and then lower-extremity weakness. Detailed exam included the presence of normoreactive pupils, facial diplegia, diminished/absent gag, muted cry, decreased/absent deep tendon reflexes, and intact anal wink with no tongue fasciculations or ptosis. This combination of progressive peripheral descending hypotonia, facial diplegia, bulbar involvement, and decreased deep tendon reflexes strongly suggested infant botulism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812463959">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812463959">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>After consultation with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH), stool samples were submitted to test for botulinum toxin by mouse bioassay and for <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> organism by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812463959">3</xref></sup> Serum lactate, ammonia, serum carnitine, plasma quantitative amino acids, and urine organic acids were within normal limits. Noncontrast MRI of the brain and spine were normal. The infant was then transferred to our institution for a more extensive neurological evaluation on day 16 of illness.</p>
<sec id="section2-0009922812463959">
<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>In addition to cardiorespiratory monitoring and reflux precautions, the patient’s dysphagia necessitated placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube. Lumbar puncture revealed normal cell counts and protein. Serum acetylcholine receptor antibodies were absent, and EEG was within normal limits. Electromyogram and nerve conduction studies were normal, although repetitive nerve stimulation, which is typically abnormal in botulism, could not be performed on this patient. Physical, occupational, and swallow therapies were initiated.</p>
<p>Initially, the mouse bioassay for botulinum toxin was inconclusive, and DNA PCR for <italic>C botulinum</italic> was negative. Despite these negative initial studies, the clinical picture was still consistent with infantile botulism, so the laboratory reincubated the patient’s stool in a warmed environment for 7 days to amplify organism growth and toxin production and to maximize recovery via “enrichment cultures.”</p>
<p>Serial physical examinations by the same medical team over the first 24 to 36 hours of admission showed clinical improvements, most notably in the patient’s deep tendon reflexes, antigravity movements, and suck. By day 28 of illness, the patient’s strength had improved in both her trunk and extremities. Her feeding progress had plateaued, and swallow video fluoroscopy demonstrated aspiration with all liquids. She was discharged home on NG feeds and continued to improve clinically with outpatient swallow and physical therapies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, repeat testing of enrichment media demonstrated positive PCR for <italic>C botulinum</italic> type B. Repeat mouse bioassay was also positive for botulinum toxin type B on enrichment cultures of stool.</p>
<p>The patient’s tone returned to baseline 6 weeks after the initial onset of symptoms, and she was able to tolerate full oral feeds with no signs of aspiration on repeat video fluoroscopy. The parents and pediatrician were advised to avoid aminoglycoside antibiotics for the next 6 months because of the potential for catastrophic release of remaining gut botulinum toxin.</p>

<p>Brisk and/or persistent reflexes along with comparatively pronounced truncal weakness is suggestive of central hypotonia, which accounts for as much as 80% of hypotonia in infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812463959">7</xref></sup> Other signs supporting central hypotonia are global developmental delay, a history of seizures, microcephaly, and/or dysmorphic features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812463959">7</xref></sup> The most common underlying causes of central hypotonia are hypoxic ischemic injury, hemorrhagic lesions of the brain (including nonaccidental trauma), chromosomal aberrations, congenital syndromes (including inborn errors of metabolism), and brain malformations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812463959">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A neurological exam that reveals both significant peripheral and central weakness as well as decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes and marked head lag is more suggestive of a peripheral etiology. The most specific clinical indicator of peripheral hypotonia is decreased antigravity limb movement or lack of spontaneous lifting of arms or legs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812463959">8</xref></sup> Etiologies of acquired or progressive peripheral hypotonia include various types of spinal muscular atrophy, infant botulism, myotonic dystrophy, congenital or metabolic myopathies, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812463959">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once the distinction has been made between central and peripheral hypotonia, neurological exam and testing help narrow the differential. When central hypotonia is suspected, neuroimaging may be helpful as well as metabolic investigation of blood and urine, cerebral spinal fluid analysis, and EEG. To identify potential and immediately treatable etiologies of peripheral hypotonia, cerebral spinal fluid analysis for Guillain-Barré-type disease and neuroimaging for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or central nervous system lesion and stool studies for botulism should all be performed. Metabolic evaluation should also be done because many, but not all, of the inborn errors of metabolism can be detected on state neonatal screening. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies may be useful in distinguishing among the neuromuscular junction disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812463959">9</xref></sup> DNA-based tests for spinal muscular atrophy, muscular dystrophies, and other specific genetic and metabolic disorders should also be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812463959">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several pathologies can present acutely with hypotonia, lethargy, and poor feeding in infants, including sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, metabolic disorders, poison ingestion, and infant botulism. However, a careful history of a progressive weak suck and symmetric descending weakness, hoarse cry, and constipation in conjunction with physical exam findings of extremity and truncal weakness, marked head lag, and decreased gag reflex are highly suggestive of infant botulism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812463959">9</xref></sup> The majority of botulism cases (75%) do not present with respiratory distress or failure, and only about 50% have absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812463959">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Exposure and geographic history are important factors to consider when the clinical presentation suggests infant botulism. Honey ingestion is the only documented source of infant botulism, but awareness of this association has resulted in decreased infant honey consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812463959">7</xref></sup> Differential toxin recovery from dust and soil by location suggests that proximity to heavy traffic, construction sites, or caretakers with high exposure to these locations may increase the risk of infant botulism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812463959">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once botulism is suspected, clinicians and health departments are urged to contact the on-call clinical specialists at the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program (IBTPP), based at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), for guidance on diagnosis and possible treatment: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.infantbotulism.org">http://www.infantbotulism.org</ext-link>; (510) 231-7600, 24/7/365. The diagnosis of infant botulism is confirmed by the identification of <italic>C botulinum</italic> spores and botulinum toxin in stool samples with PCR and mouse bioassay, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812463959">3</xref></sup> Physicians should also contact their local and state health authorities to report the suspected case and to facilitate and expedite diagnostic testing.</p>
<p>Treatment should not be delayed for confirmatory tests because although infant botulism is one of the most infrequent (80-110 cases annually in the United States) causes of peripheral hypotonia, the course can be reversed if prompt treatment is initiated, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812463959">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812463959">10</xref></sup> The only FDA-approved treatment for infant botulism, Human Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (BabyBIG), is distributed solely by the IBTPP as a public service of the CDPH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812463959">10</xref></sup> BabyBIG is an orphan drug that consists of human-derived botulism antitoxin antibodies and works by neutralizing botulinum toxin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812463959">7</xref></sup> Administering BabyBIG to infants within the first 7 days of hospital admission decreases the severity of illness, duration of mechanical ventilation, and tube or intravenous feedings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812463959">10</xref></sup> Hospital stays are shortened by almost 1 month, resulting in reduction of hospital costs by more than an average of $100 000 per patient (2004 dollars).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812463959">10</xref></sup> The fee for BabyBIG is $45 300 per patient regardless of weight. This high cost results from the need to amortize its production and distribution expenses over the very small average number of US infant botulism cases (80-110 annually).</p>
<p>Other than BabyBIG, infant botulism is managed with supportive care. Patients require close respiratory monitoring and sometimes temporary ventilatory support as well as aspiration precautions, such as upright positioning and NG or nasojejunal feeding. Additionally, regular repositioning and avoidance of catheters prevent skin breakdown and edema secondary to lack of antigravity limb movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812463959">2</xref></sup> Physicians should not use antibiotics, which can potentiate toxin release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812463959">10</xref></sup> Regardless of the degree of respiratory involvement, almost all infants with confirmed botulism and appropriate supportive care recover without neurological or other sequelae. The 2000-2009 US 10-year case-fatality ratio for hospitalized infant botulism patients was 1/995 (0.1%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812463959" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This laboratory-confirmed case of type B infant botulism illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for the disease in any infant presenting with acquired hypotonia, especially those with a history of constipation, lethargy, poor feeding, and lower cranial nerve (bulbar) dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812463959">9</xref></sup> Physicians should initiate treatment on clinical suspicion of botulism rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation because the only definitive treatment, BabyBIG, is most efficacious in the first week following hospital admission. More timely BabyBIG administration in our patient would likely have shortened her NG tube course and cumulative hospital stay (2½ weeks at 3 different hospitals with subsequent home NG monitoring and care). Local health departments and the IBTPP staff and Web site are invaluable resources for evaluation, diagnosis, and management assistance for suspected infant botulism.</p>
