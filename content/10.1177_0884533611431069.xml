<p>This is the third edition of the <italic>Dietitian’s Handbook of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition</italic>, and the content clearly indicates the editor has endeavored to incorporate the latest research, guidelines, and evidence-based nutrition support interventions and protocols researched, developed, tested, and published by highly qualified nutrition support researchers and providers. Although this book is primarily intended for use by registered dietitians in the application and utilization of the nutrition care process (assessment, nutrition diagnosis, intervention, monitoring, and evaluation) of patients and clients receiving nutrition support therapies in a variety of settings, all 21 chapters and 4 appendixes reflect the rapidly growing and changing body of evidence in the appropriateness, use, and composition of enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) support therapies and is a recommended resource for all healthcare disciplines.</p>
<p>The book’s content is structured so that a firm foundation for comprehension of the whats, whys, whens, and hows of nutrition support therapies is first assembled, beginning with the constructs of nutrition screening and assessment, followed by indication for and efficacy of these modalities, and an excellent “Ethics Primer” chapter. Next are independent chapters on energy, macronutrient, micronutrient, and water requirements, the latter of which has a readily understandable introduction on acid-base balance, the grasp of which is often a challenge for registered dietitians because of a lack of adequate training in this area.</p>
<p>The foresight of the editor is evident in the 2 subsequent chapters in that nutrition support at both ends of the age spectrum is discussed (ie, neonates and geriatrics). Both of these populations comprise distinct challenges in the applicability, selection, delivery, and monitoring of nutrition support therapies, and the content of these chapters is a good primer for all practitioners.</p>
<p>The “meat” of this book is skillfully characterized in the sections representing numerous conditions for which nutrition support therapies are most frequently considered, including but not limited to acute and chronic pancreatitis, liver disease, solid organ transplantation, burns, trauma, and the critically ill obese. All of these chapters, as well as the others, are composed of an overview of the condition, nutrition assessment, nutrition intervention options and applicable rationale, monitoring, evaluation, and outcomes and very helpful conclusion statements.</p>
<p>There is one chapter, though, that really stands out in its specificity for registered dietitians, “Nutrition Support in the Acute Care Environment.” The content specific to clinician training and competency assessment, interprofes-sional collaboration, and clinical privileges is a “must read” for every registered dietitian employed in the acute care environment.</p>
<p>Perhaps the one construct of this book’s layout that might seem disjointed to some readers is the location of the chapters introducing, explaining, and detailing the types, components, enteral feeding tubes and parenteral catheters, access and delivery sites, and monitoring and evaluation of EN and PN support therapies. These chapters follow rather than precede the condition-specific chapters previously mentioned and may have had a greater learning and comprehension value if they had been repositioned to an earlier location in the book.</p>
<p>Last, the charts and tables contained within numerous chapters are exceedingly helpful, add noteworthy value to the content, and will be of significant use to the reader, regardless of healthcare discipline and nutrition support therapy experience.</p>
<p>Although targeted to registered dietitians, the third edition of the <italic>Dietitian’s Handbook of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition</italic> is a well-written, well-edited resource for all healthcare disciplines involved in EN and PN support therapies. In addition, it is a recommended resource for educators; dietetic, nursing, medical, and pharmacology students and interns; and a suggested addition to personal, institution, and medical libraries.</p>
