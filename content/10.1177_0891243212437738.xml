<p>While gender inequality at work remains a point of contention within social and political realms, social scientists offer that men and women experience work differently. More specifically, the differing treatment of men and women often leads to unequal outcomes in the workplace. This pattern remains even when women and men share similar skills, attributes, and abilities. However, such analyses include the outcomes of men and women who have received different socialization and lived separate lives, thus contributing to dissimilar work experiences.</p>
<p>Kristen Schilt offers an insightful new perspective on workplace gender inequality by analyzing the workplace accounts of transmen, individuals designated female at birth and raised as girls and women who believe their gender identity is more congruent with that of men. Because transmen have lived both as social women and social men, often within the same work environment, their experiences shed light on how men and women are treated differently (and unequally) at work, even where the individual has the same education, skills, and personality before and after transition. Through interviews with transmen and coworkers, Schilt provides a comprehensive description of how individuals engage in the reproduction of gender inequality within workplaces. She includes questionnaires from transmen and transwomen as well as a content analysis of news stories and legal cases about transgender workers published between 1971 and 2008. By using a variety of methods, Schilt successfully addresses multiple aspects of workplace gender inequality.</p>
<p>Schilt details various social changes transmen experience once they transition from female to male, highlighting the significance of “natural difference schemas” in shaping the workplace as a gendered institution that maintains and reproduces inequality. According to Schilt, natural difference schemas guide human interaction, individual behaviors, and institutional organization. Natural difference schemas purport that men and women are innately <italic>different</italic> from one another and that men are inherently <italic>better than</italic> women. Such beliefs shape how individuals understand, engage in, and organize human behaviors and interactions. Schilt identifies the structural and interactional processes that rely on natural difference schemas to buttress the existing gender order within the workplace.</p>
<p>The bulk of the text focuses on how both open and stealth transmen experience work. When transmen begin living and working as social men, they report an increase in allocation of resources such as respect, authority, and in some cases, financial resources. However, not all transmen reported increases in these areas. Her findings reinforce the notion that while men (and transmen) benefit from the existing workplace gender order, the allocation of such benefits is complicated by race, height, perceived sexuality, and masculine embodiment.</p>
<p>The allocation of resources to transmen is further obscured by the status of transmen <italic>as transmen</italic>. When coworkers and employers learn about the trans-identities of transmen, they tend to either marginalize transmen or protect them. Through marginalization, employers and coworkers police the behavior and appearance of transmen by forcing them to work as women or forcing them out altogether. Incorporation treats transmen as men, situating them within the existing workplace gender order where men are privileged. Unfortunately, neither strategy truly challenges workplace organization or inequality despite the potential of gender transgression of exposure to a coworker who is transgender.</p>
<p>Schilt supplements her analysis on transmen with an in-depth cultural understanding of transgender persons, a description of the consequences of achieving social maleness, and a comparison between the workplace experiences of transwomen and transmen. She argues that the structural organization of the workplace as well as the strategies used to maintain the legitimacy of the current gender order heavily rely on natural difference schemas and a move away from such ideologies is necessary. Ultimately, her data and analyses provide additional support for understanding how gender inequality is maintained and reproduced at work, and subsequently within the larger social order.</p>
<p>The analysis ends with a challenge to gender scholars to produce a scholarship of resistance, one that identifies paths to undoing structural gender inequality and potentially transcending gender. She questions where transgender individuals might fall in a postgender society, highlighting whether or not such a world could exist even if drastic changes are made to the current gender binary. She acknowledges that no real progress will occur unless problematic natural difference schemas are eradicated. Unfortunately, the text is similar to those criticized by the author in that it does not offer any comprehensive suggestions for ways to dismantle natural difference schemas and the gendered ordering of society that ensues.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is both engaging and informative. Schilt convincingly displays the ever-present influence of natural difference schemas on the production and reproduction of gender inequality in the workplace. By understanding how inequality reproduces, we are better suited to deconstruct it. This text would contribute to both undergraduate and graduate courses with emphases on gender, social inequality, and workplace inequalities. While the emphasis is on workplace inequality, the overall argument and findings carry over to other areas of academic scholarship, something the text would have benefited from had those connections been made explicit. For instance, do natural difference schemas function similarly or differently in other contexts, such as within transgender personal relationships or the division of labor at home? Although Schilt never raises these questions, she identifies important processes that men, women, and transpersons engage in that reproduce gender inequality. Understanding how these processes play out enables us to formulate potential strategies to undo those processes as well as the gender system they maintain.</p>
