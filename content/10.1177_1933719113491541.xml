<title>A Functional Artificial Ovary</title>
<p>The loss of ovarian function through either menopause, surgical resection, or ablative therapy and its inherent cessation of sex steroids’ production not only impairs a woman’s reproductive ability but also leads to various pathological conditions ranging from urogenital complications to osteoporosis. Thus, a cell/tissue delivery-based hormone therapy that would provide serum levels of hormones close to the physiological values would certainly be appealing for the treatment of ovarian hormone deprivation.</p>
<p>Appropriately, Sittadjodi et al have recently published in the journal <italic>Biomaterials</italic> (<italic>Biomaterials</italic>. 2013;34(10):2412-2420) their ability to design a functional tissue-engineered endocrine ovary that may be used for a cell/tissue delivery-based hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>Sittadjodi and colleagues used granulosa and theca cells from ovaries of 21-day-old rats and encapsulated them in multilayer alginate microcapsules to recapitulate the native follicular structure. The endocrine function of the multilayer-encapsulated cells was assessed in vitro for a period of 30 days and compared to other schemes of encapsulation that were used as controls to assess the importance of the multilayer structure.</p>
<p>The authors observed that all encapsulated cells showed sustained viability during long-term in vitro culture. However, those cells assembled into a multilayer pattern were able to secrete significantly higher and sustained concentrations of 17 β-estradiol than the other encapsulated cells in response to follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. Additionally, the cells in the multilayer capsules also secreted activin and inhibin in vitro, resembling an in vivo functional ovary. All these characteristics could not be mimicked when the same cells were cultured in 2-dimensional over the same 30-day period.</p>
<p>In sum, Sittadjodi and colleagues have been able to design a multilayer-engineered ovarian tissue capsule that responds to gonadotropins to secrete sex steroids and peptide hormones, recapitulating a native ovarian structure. Although these results are exciting, further research is needed to confirm the functionality and sustainability of this artificial ovary in vivo.</p>

<title>A Potential New Target to Fight Breast Cancer</title>
<p>Breast cancer is a leading cause of women mortality worldwide. Although estrogen and progesterone are essential for breast development and function, they are also known to be deeply involved in breast cancer growth through mechanisms that are still poorly understood in vivo.</p>
<p>Genetic studies have provided evidence that receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, acts as an important paracrine mediator of progesterone-induced proliferation in the adult mouse mammary gland, both in normal mammary development and in mammary carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Since systemic inhibition of RANKL in the mouse-blocked progesterone-induced proliferation of the mammary epithelium, Tanos and colleagues became interested in understanding RANKL’s role in humans to determine its suitability as a drug target for breast cancer treatment. Their findings have recently been published in the journal <italic>Science Translational Medicine</italic> (<italic>Sci Transl Med</italic>. 2013;5(182):1-10).</p>
<p>Tanos et al developed an ex vivo model using breast tissue microstructures isolated from fresh clinical specimens that preserve extensive intercellular contacts and contain multiple cell types that allowed them to conclude that also in humans progesterone induces cell proliferation using RANKL as an essential mediator. The authors observed that RANKL alone was sufficient to trigger cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium as well as it was required for progesterone-induced proliferation.</p>
<p>In addition, Tanos and colleagues verified that in vivo RANKL protein expression in the breast epithelium correlated with serum progesterone levels and that the protein was expressed in a subset of luminal cells that express progesterone receptor.</p>
<p>Thus, the findings by Tanos et al suggest that the pathways that control mammary growth and development are largely conserved between the mouse and the human and that RANKL signaling may provide a new and exciting target for breast cancer treatment and prevention.</p>
