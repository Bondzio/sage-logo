<abstract>
<p>Nursing documentation in advanced home care (AHC) is essential in communication between nurses and interprofessionally for evaluation of patient care. Poor documentation could be a threat to high quality care and patient safety. The aim of this study was to describe documentation of nursing care within AHC. Sixty nursing records from two AHC-units in Sweden were collected and a content analysis was performed. The results revealed documentation from a broad spectrum of advanced nursing care, consisting of both planned and acute care. However, the documentation was often fragmented and information sometimes hard to find. Nursing documentation often described caring needs, but lacked interventions and evaluations. Further development and research on nursing documentation and its connection to evidence-based practice within AHC is needed.</p>

<body>
<p>Accurate documentation of nursing care is an important tool for transferring secure and accurate patient-related information between nurses and other health care professionals. In Sweden, in compliance with regulations on nursing documentation stipulated by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822313490729">1</xref></sup> caregivers are obliged to document patient care to ensure patient safety and provide a basis for the evaluation of results and care. The patient record is required to be easy to access and includes distinct and clear nursing documentation on individual patient needs that describes the planning, implementation, and outcomes of the nursing care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822313490729">1</xref></sup> Aside from laws and regulations, being able to articulate and document nursing care elevates nursing from the duty to only assist physicians to an independent profession.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822313490729">2</xref></sup> The ability to document patient responses to illness and the care performed could therefore be considered a core competence of nursing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822313490729">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is internationally acknowledged that accurate nursing documentation of patient problems, symptoms, complaints, clinical signs, and responses to care are essential in terms of patient safety and well-being. It is also an important part of the nursing profession to manage nursing diagnoses in relation to patients and their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822313490729">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822313490729">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Applying evidence-based nursing facilitates making decisions in daily work according to the best possible evidence, and it can be considered an ongoing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822313490729">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822313490729">6</xref></sup> In cooperation with the patient, these decisions are integrated in deciding nursing interventions. This process aims to constantly reconsider methods and routines in evaluating expected responses and benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822313490729">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822313490729">5</xref></sup> Moreover, quality indicators form an important basis for analyses of quality of care, whereby electronic documentation is a key-factor making it possible to abstract relevant data from patient records in a cost-effective manner. Nursing documentation is considered a quality indicator that needs to be used properly so that other quality indicators retrieved from patient records are considered reliable. However, the use of standardized nursing terminology is still lacking in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822313490729">7</xref></sup> The most frequently used research-based model for nursing documentation in Sweden, the VIPS, was developed to structure the documentation used in nursing care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822313490729">8</xref></sup> VIPS, an acronym formed from the Swedish words for Well-being, Integrity, Prevention and Security, is based on the nursing process and consists of keywords on two levels. The first level follows the nursing process: nursing history, nursing status, nursing diagnoses, nursing goals, nursing interventions, and nursing outcomes, while the second level consists of keywords describing nursing history, nursing status, and nursing interventions. Studies evaluating the VIPS model have shown that nurses’ understanding of the nursing process increased and that it had a positive effect on the quality of nursing documentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822313490729">8</xref></sup> It has also been shown that the VIPS structure has the potential to facilitate nursing and nursing documentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822313490729">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822313490729">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, researchers still identify flaws in nursing documentation. According to Paans, Sermeus, Nieweg Roos, &amp; van der Schans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822313490729">10</xref></sup> the structure of nurses’ documentation is mainly chronological and descriptive, rather than problem-based according to diagnoses and interventions. Törnvall &amp; Wilhelmsson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822313490729">11</xref></sup> report that physicians often need access to nursing documentation for treatment follow-ups but find the information hard to access. Annersten Gershater, Pilhammar, and Alm Roijer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822313490729">12</xref></sup> proved nursing documentation within diabetes home nursing service to be insufficient, which they considered a threat to patient safety in a vulnerable patient group suffering from multiorgan disease and unable to maintain self-care. An earlier Swedish study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822313490729">13</xref></sup> describing how nurses record pedagogical activities concluded that the structure of nursing documentation is often simple and rarely shows nurses’ pedagogical activities. In addition, an ethnographic observational study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822313490729">14</xref></sup> showed that nurses spent more than a third of their time retrieving information, communicating, and documenting. Although nurses had access to computers and electronic documentation, they communicated orally and used personal scraps of paper for documentation of patient information and performing nursing care, resulting in inefficient documentation and sparse interprofessional communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822313490729">14</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1084822313490729">
<title>Context</title>
<p>The organization of health care in Sweden has undergone many changes during recent decades, like in other parts of Europe as well as in North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822313490729">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822313490729"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822313490729"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822313490729">18</xref></sup> One of these changes is rapidly expanding home care, due to many care recipients preferring to be treated at home, a decrease in the number of hospital beds, and technical developments that make it possible to treat severe illness at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084822313490729">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822313490729"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822313490729">21</xref></sup> In Sweden, home care is organized in different ways according to geographical boundaries (municipals) and forms an integral part of health care services within municipalities or county councils. Within the Stockholm county council where this study was performed, there are three different levels of home care: (a) <italic>Simple medical care</italic> performed by a district nurse or an assistant nurse, care that often does not require the attendance of a physician. (b) <italic>Basic medical care</italic>, requiring the participation of a physician, and (c) <italic>Advanced home care (AHC)</italic> requiring a multiprofessional team available at all hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084822313490729">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>AHC nurses work in a multiprofessional team delivering care similar to both community care and clinical care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822313490729">21</xref></sup> The responsibilities of AHC nurses include the continuation of medical treatment, teaching and information, administrative duties, coordination of patient health care, and the assessment of patient situations to evaluate ongoing care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1084822313490729">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1084822313490729">23</xref></sup> Patients admitted to AHC often have multiple medical problems and home care is therefore frequently as technically and medically advanced as in hospital care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822313490729">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1084822313490729">24</xref></sup> In AHC settings, where the patient sometimes is alone and caregivers also often work alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084822313490729">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1084822313490729">25</xref></sup> communication, both between nurses and interprofessionally, is essential for providing patient safety and high quality care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1084822313490729">24</xref></sup> Although Berland, Holm, Gundersen, and Bentsen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1084822313490729">22</xref></sup> in a recent study explored home care nurses’ experiences of patient safety within home care and concluded that poor documentation among other things was a threat to patient safety, there exists limited data concerning nurse documentation within AHC. The aim of the study is to describe documentation of nursing care within AHC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1084822313490729" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This is a descriptive qualitative study of nurse documentation from two AHC-units in the Stockholm area using document analysis with inspiration from content analysis according to Elo and Kyngäs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1084822313490729">26</xref></sup> Since there is little and fragmented knowledge of documentation in AHC, an inductive approach was used.</p>
<sec id="section3-1084822313490729">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>In Sweden, nurses document events and observations in nursing records that are separated from the medical records. The sample consisted of computerized nursing records from 60 patients enrolled at two AHC units. The sample is purposive since these specific AHC units comprise urban, suburban, and even some rural areas of a large city in Sweden. Thirty patient records from each unit were randomly collected, which was estimated to be two thirds of the records from patients admitted to the AHC unit at the time of data collection. The patients had been enrolled in AHC between 25 to 208 days, median 124 days, and mean 122 days. Most patients admitted to AHC suffered from various chronic diseases and the reasons for admittance to AHC, as documented in patient nursing records, varied but were often related to a need for palliative care. Palliative care was often described as support in an advanced stage of disease or support related to mainly cancer treatment, for example, assistance with transportation, control of medical technical devices, and tests prior to chemotherapy. Other reasons for admittance were frequent blood transfusions, nutrition-related problems, ulcer dressings, oxygen treatment, infections, or need for help contacting other health care providers. Of the 60 patients whose records were analyzed, 27 patients had a subcutaneous venous port, 2 patients had a central venous catheter and 12 patients had a PICC line catheter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1084822313490729">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Permission to collect data was obtained from the heads of the AHC units. The secretary of each unit was instructed to randomly select 30 computerized records from currently admitted patients. Names, social security number, and other identification data were removed from the records prior to analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1084822313490729">
<title>Ethical Issues</title>
<p>Consent from an Ethics Committee was not required for this study. An advisory statement was obtained from the regional ethical committee Dnr 20077554-31. An approval from the head of the two units was obtained prior to data collection. The records were anonymous for the researchers and data prepared in a way so that it could not be traced to a specific patient, nurse, or the patient’s family.</p>

<sec id="section6-1084822313490729">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Document analysis with inspiration from content analysis according to Elo and Kyngäs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1084822313490729">26</xref></sup> was used. The analysis process consists of three phases: preparing, organizing, and reporting data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1084822313490729">26</xref></sup> Only the manifest content was analyzed using an inductive approach. The analysis was executed manually. To get an overall picture of the content, all records were read several times. According to the aim of the study, all documentation describing nursing care was extracted from the records and copied verbatim to data coding sheets.</p>
<p>In the organization of data, probable headings or codes were written in the margin in open coding. The text was then organized into categories with similar content. Abstraction of data was performed by searching for suitable headings that represented a higher order.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1084822313490729">26</xref></sup> In this phase the categories were sorted into domains. In the last step of the analysis, the domains were compared and a final sorting of the text was conducted. All authors participated in analyzing the process and a critical revision of the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section7-1084822313490729" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Data analysis of nursing documentation revealed that nurses performed either planned or acute care. The nursing care described in this section is solely based on nurses’ documentation.</p>
<sec id="section8-1084822313490729">
<title>Planned Care</title>
<sec id="section9-1084822313490729">
<title>Predetermined interventions</title>
<p>The most frequently documented nursing care was performed according to a predetermined care plan or by subscription from a physician and consisted mainly of medical technical interventions. Administering intravenous infusions and blood transfusions, sampling, dressing, and bandaging were commonly documented. Several notes in the documentation concerned medical interventions such as administration of nutritional products and management of peripheral and central venous catheters or PICC line catheters needed to be cut or adjusted. Other medical interventions noted were, for example, inserting a urine catheter, dealing with infusion pumps, or delivering various aids related to medication and infusions.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals were often administrated intravenously or subcutaneously. In those cases, the patient had a central venous catheter and the infusions were administrated through the catheter. Blood samples were also drawn from the catheter, which was then flushed. Documentation of medical technical interventions was mostly very brief.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . Finish the infusion and flush the catheter with 40 ml sodium chloride and Heparin<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1084822313490729">i</xref></sup> 100E. (Record No. 43)</p>
<p>Dress the ulcer in sacrum according to the care plan. (Record No. 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, some documentation of planned care followed a path along which the different steps in nursing care could be followed. The notes described a caring problem and according to that problem, the nurses made an assessment followed by planning, intervention, and evaluation. In the assessment it was noted whether nurses implemented care by themselves or if a consultation with other health care professionals or health care providers was needed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The toe looks nice, no infection. Remove the dressing and rub with ointment. Sacrum also looks good . . . Remind the patient to lie on his side sometimes to relieve the back. (Record No. 10)</p>
<p>Check the redness of the leg, which as far as I can see when looking at previous photos and consulting colleagues, is not worse than before. Take a new photo. (Record No. 48)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In many cases nursing documentation described a dialogue with the patient or the patient’s family. The nurse–patient contact often seemed to be by telephone; however, if the dialogue was by phone or otherwise was not always clearly documented. The notes often began with describing patient status and were sometimes followed by an assessment from the nurses. The documentation of dialogue typically consisted of matters concerning medication, pain management, medical technical interventions, and nutrition.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The husband calls . . . the patient is in pain again . . . Give injKetogan<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1084822313490729">ii</xref></sup> 5 mg iv and 5 mg s.c. . . . Maybe it is time for the patient to get an infusion pump with analgesic. Her pain is increasing. (Record No. 25)</p>

We agree that I will call her later that day to evaluate the effect . . . Call the patient as agreed. She has taken a Citodon and the pain in left flank has subsided, but the pain is not completely gone. (Record No. 31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to nursing documentation, appetite problems, nausea, and swollen legs were problems that were documented as assessed, evaluated, and suggested treatment for.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The patient has severe pain from swollen legs. The skin feels tight . . . I recommend the wife buy support stockings at the local pharmacy and give a massage from the feet upwards, as often as possible and to keep the feet in a high position. Diuretics are needed; a prescription shall be arranged for . . . (Record No. 51)</p>
<p>The patient can’t understand why he doesn’t get nutritional infusions. He drinks at least one liter of fluids per day. He isn’t able to eat that much food though . . . He thinks he would feel more alert if he got nutrition infusions. We talk about his fatigue and that it is probably related to his disease. He is aware of that, but still thinks he would have less fatigue if he got nutrition infusions. (Record No. 7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1084822313490729">
<title>Information and education</title>
<p>Some documented dialogues concerned information of different activities aimed at achieving a higher degree of well-being for the patient. Nurses could, in some cases, advise patients to engage in, for example, aquatic training or creative work like painting. Nurses also gave the patient and/or family support in different matters. Documentation also implied that nurses comforted and supported patients who needed someone to listen, so that they could better cope with their present situation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The patient had a nice weekend in . . . together with his mother and sister. The patient feels sad though. It feels better when the days are filled with activities. Otherwise the brooding starts. (Record No. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Documentation showed that nurses sometimes helped the patient to manage and use different pharmaceuticals by explaining different aspects of pain.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The patient indicates pain (VAS 8) . . . when the patient has taken a whole tablet . . . VAS 0. Indicates pain over the right hip and downwards toward the buttocks . . . Instruct the patient not to wait too long before taking another tablet, in order to stop the pain before it gets started. He is admitting that he thought he could skip a tablet now and then, but he has noticed that it doesn’t work. (Record No. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A significant part of nursing documentation concerned education or advice to patients or family members. Documented telephone calls involving a family member who needed advice and/or support with different caring problems were common (e.g., how to avoid weight loss in patient or help with understanding information that had been given by a physician or other health care professionals). Other educational matters concerned, for example, daily injections of antithrombosis, which was carried out under the supervision of a nurse until the patient/family member and the nurse were comfortable that the patient/family member could manage on their own.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Teach the patient and his wife how to administer a Fragmin<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1084822313490729">iv</xref></sup> injection. They want to learn how to administer the injection by themselves, but this week they want AHC to administer it. (Record No. 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Education of patient and family, in relation to medical devices (e.g., oxygen and infusions), were also commonly documented.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Talk to the wife concerning their wish to be able to disconnect an infusion. I tell her that some of my colleagues think that she has to do a little more training before she could do it herself. I also explain to her why that is so. (Record No. 52)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1084822313490729">
<title>Coordination and team work</title>
<p>Nurses’ documentation consisted in many cases of coordination and team work including contacts and cooperation with other professionals concerning the patient (e.g., physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, and social workers). Coordination also included cooperation with other health care providers involved in the patient care. In some documentation, it was stated that the nurse, to carry out the patient care, needed a consultation from another health care provider. According to the documentation, coordination and consultation seemed to have been mainly performed from the office by telephone. Sometimes nurses helped patients to book or check appointments. There was also documentation concerning agreements of care in Europe.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Phoned the dentist concerning the patient’s teeth problems. I am being told that the patient hasn’t shown up at her last three appointments and therefore didn’t get a new call for an appointment. The dentist will call her when he gets back. (Record No. 37)</p>
<p>Call the patient to get information on the Schengen agreement. The patient is going to Germany for treatment . . . (Record No. 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1084822313490729">
<title>Administration</title>
<p>A common administrative task documented was to order a walker or medical aids for the personal bed and bathroom. Nurses also arranged for patients to receive free or subsidized travel service by taxi or other forms of transportation. Sometimes nurses helped patients to apply for and submit applications for travel services, which involved other professions and required an assessment from the nurse prior to further actions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The patient has recently been released from hospital . . . It’s not clear why the patient is still in a wheelchair. A physiotherapist will be contacted for some ground walk training and evaluation of the situation at home. The patient will stay at home provided that the patient gets a walker and that the bathtub is replaced with a shower. The patient will be put on the waiting list for senior housing. (Record No. 34)</p>

<sec id="section13-1084822313490729">
<title>Acute Care</title>
<p>Nursing documentation in AHC revealed that nurses also performed acute care mainly due to emergency calls.</p>
<sec id="section14-1084822313490729">
<title>Emergency calls</title>
<p>The term emergency calls emerged from the nurses’ own documentation. The emergency calls were mostly from patients but also from family members and they were, most of the times, connected to one or several actions or interventions. The most common documented reasons for emergency calls were pain, and unexpected bleeding or fever related to different infections. Quite often there was a noted, standing prescription of medication to take when needed. In other situations a contact with a physician was required (e.g., to discuss changes in medication). In some cases, nurses documented that the problems could not be solved at home and it was decided that the patient had to be admitted to a hospital.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Patient calls 00.45 because she is coughing blood, but no large amount. We are with another patient so I tell her that we will call her when we get back to the office. Call the patient 45 minutes later and the patient sounds a lot calmer; she says that the coughing is less frequent. There are small amounts of fresh blood that comes when she coughs. Advise the patient to take 3 tablets of Cyklokapronv<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1084822313490729">v</xref></sup> 500 milligrams. She will call again if it gets worse. (Record No. 2)</p>

<p>Nurses solved some of the problems by giving instructions to the patient or a family member. Several documented calls were related to family members’ anxiety of being alone with the patient in a troublesome situation.</p>

<p>Wife calls 6.50 in the morning. She is sad and anxious. According to her the patient has been lying in the same position the whole night, and he is still sleeping. She can see that he is breathing but he is very pale. He takes 2 tablets of Propavan<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1084822313490729">vi</xref></sup> in the evening. I tell her that this is probably the explanation. The wife says she is afraid that her husband will die when she is alone with him . . . (Record No. 32)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The documented nursing care in this study comprised two domains, planned care and acute care. Nurses’ documentation consisted to a great extent of predetermined care that mainly contained documentation of medical technical interventions. Although medical interventions were most frequently documented, other interventions that were more or less acute consisted of considerably more text in which the nurses’ assessments and consequent interventions could be followed. This study, as well as another study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1084822313490729">27</xref></sup> showed that nursing documentation often described caring needs, but often lacked interventions and evaluations.</p>
<p>However, we strongly believe that nurses’ work within AHC is more complex and diverse than documented in the analyzed records. In these two AHC-units, nurses’ documentation followed the VIPS model although it seemed nurses interpreted the keywords in the model differently. Quality and content of documentation also differed between nurses. The same information could be found under several headings. Furthermore, some information was sometimes documented over and over again, while other information, concerning care and follow-up of patients was not documented at all. Documentation regarding emergency calls differed from other nursing documentation in that it was directly connected to one or more interventions by the nurse. Documentation of emergency calls was often related to acute bleedings or infections, in which the nurse had documented an assessment followed by one or several interventions. However, judging from the documentation, the emergency calls to AHC were not always what would normally be considered an emergency. In an attempt to speculate, the reasons for this could be numerous (e.g., that nurses were not always close at hand for the patients or their families). Another reason could be that no visit was planned to be undertaken soon and anxious patients or family members perhaps felt a need to get in touch with the nurse right away and therefore called. The documented actions following an emergency call often included nurse cooperation with the AHC team (e.g., physicians or physiotherapists, or other health care units or hospitals).</p>
<p>This article showed documentation concerning cooperation with other health care professionals in and outside the team as well as with other health care units and hospitals. A previous study has shown that physicians need access to nursing documentation for information and treatment follow-ups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822313490729">11</xref></sup> This could prove to be difficult since this study showed that particular information often was hard to find and tracking information from intervention to evaluation was sometimes challenging. Accurate nursing documentation is important for evaluating nursing interventions and securing patient safety. The fact that such information sometimes was hard to find in nursing documentation could be a potential risk for accurate patient care and patient safety.</p>
<p>Documentation revealed that many contacts between nurse and patient were by telephone. However, it was not always evident if nurses actually had visited the patient or if contact had only been by telephone. According to Wahlberg, Cedersund, and Wredling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1084822313490729">28</xref></sup> nurses working with telephone advice emphasized that lack of health care resources and not being able to observe the patient were difficulties faced when making assessments by telephone. With that in mind, the documentation should be clear on whether a contact was by telephone or an actual visit.</p>
<p>Analyzing documents has its advantages. The data are easily accessible and already documented, and there is little risk of influencing the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1084822313490729">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1084822313490729">30</xref></sup> However, the method has its limitations. In this study the quality of documentation varied a lot from nurse to nurse. In the first step of the analysis, data were difficult to sort, since nursing documentation often implied complex situations that involved both interprofessional contacts and family members. Data were frequently fragmented and the process from assessment to intervention was not always possible to follow. Consequently, data showed what the nurse documented and not necessarily what they actually had performed. Sometimes documentation more or less described the patient’s status, followed by a course of events whereby the nurse presumably conducted several actions. This course of events was often difficult to follow since the events were not described in detail. Furthermore, the analyzing process was rendered difficult since the interventions were either very simple or comprised of several components of nursing care.</p>
<p>The reasons for admittance to AHC identified in the patient records analyzed in this study were after analysis compared with the contents of care as reported by AHC units to the National Board of Health and Welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084822313490729">21</xref></sup> The comparison showed a high level of correspondence and confirms the representativeness of patient data for this study. It is not possible to generalize the results as the data represent only two AHC units. However, we presume that the results may be transferable to other AHC units in urban and suburban areas of large cities in Sweden. It is also important to point out that data were analyzed from the perspective of nursing documentation, not according to patient health problems.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Nursing documentation is both a quality indicator and an instrument for achieving high quality patient care and safety. Within AHC, in which nurses and other health care providers visit the patient homes at different times, day and night, it is even more important that information concerning patient status and follow-ups is evident. This study shows that this was not always the case. Documentation was often fragmented and it was hard to find certain information and follow the nursing process. Difficulties in finding accurate patient data could threaten patient safety within AHC, and therefore creating accurate and comprehensive nursing documentation is of utmost importance. To improve nursing documentation and quality of care within AHC, further development and research on nursing documentation and its connection to evidence-based practice is needed.</p>
