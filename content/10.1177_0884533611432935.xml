<abstract>
<p>Patients with upper gastrointestinal obstructions were previously managed with gastric decompression and parenteral feeding. The authors present their experience in 50 patients with obstructions chiefly due to complicated severe acute (n = 31) or chronic cystic pancreatitis (n = 11) using a double-lumen nasogastric decompression and jejunal feeding tube system (NGJ) held in place with a nasal bridle that passes through the obstructed gastroduodenal segments, allowing distal jejunal feeding, and at the same time decompresses the stomach to prevent vomiting and aspiration. The tip of the jejunal tube was placed approximately 40 cm down the jejunum to maintain pancreatic rest. Duration of feeding ranged from 1–145 days (median 25 days); 19 patients were discharged home with tube feeds. Only 1 patient could not tolerate feeding and needed to be converted to parenteral feeding. Average tube life was 14 days, with replacement being needed most commonly for kinking or clogging of the jejunal tube (56%) or accidental dislodgement (24%). The obstruction resolved spontaneously in 60%, allowing resumption of normal eating. Of the patients with severe acute pancreatitis or pancreatic pseudocysts, pancreatic rest resulted in resolution of the disease without surgery in 87%, and need for surgery in the remainder was put off for 31–76 days. Seven patients died predominantly of complications of acute pancreatitis between 1 and 31 days. In conclusion, NGJ feeding provides a relatively safe conservative management for critically ill patients with upper gastrointestinal obstructions, reducing the need for surgery and parenteral feeding.</p>

<body>
<p>Until recently, patients with dysfunction of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum were given parenteral nutrition (PN) to maintain nutrition support until the underlying disease problem could be corrected. It seemed a simple solution, but it soon became apparent that PN, although effective in delivering nutrients, was associated with serious metabolic and septic complications that often worsened outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611432935">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611432935">2</xref></sup> This stimulated intense research into methods of restoring gut function in sick patients.</p>
<p>First, narrow-diameter (6–10 French) soft silicone feeding tubes were designed for nasogastric access and to improve comfort. Recognizing the fact that many critically ill patients have poor gastric emptying, and because of concern about aspiration, longer tubes were designed that could be passed through the pylorus into the more functional duodenum or jejunum. Techniques such as this opened up the possibility of conducting randomized controlled trials between enteral nutrition (EN) and PN in critically ill patients such as these. All showed that EN was safer, cheaper, and more effective,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611432935">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533611432935">5</xref></sup> and their subsequent meta-analysis concluded that infectious and metabolic complications were lower with EN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611432935">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611432935">7</xref></sup> The most recent study in patients with severe acute pancreatitis found that mortality was significantly reduced from 35% to 5.7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611432935">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simple jejunal feeding tubes were, however, often ineffective in patients with gastric outlet obstruction, as secretions would build up in the stomach, leading to vomiting and increased risk of aspiration. Consequently, it was important to maintain gastric decompression while feeding beyond the obstruction into the jejunum. To solve this problem, double-lumen tubes were developed that could decompress the stomach at the same time as feeding distally beyond the obstruction, termed <italic>nasogastric decompression-jejunal feeding</italic>, or NGJ. Our initial experience with this kind of system, reported in 2003, showed that we were able to provide successful enteral feeding in 51 consecutive critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients referred to our nutrition support service for PN because of “ileus” and/or gastric emptying problems. We were able to use the newly designed “ultraslim” endoscope with an external diameter of 5.8 mm to cannulate the nose and the compressed or dysfunctional stomach and duodenum to place a guidewire into the more distal functional part of the intestine. The endoscope was then withdrawn, leaving the guidewire in the jejunum emerging from the nose. The feeding tube system could then be inserted over the guidewire, through the dysfunctional upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and into the functional jejunum.</p>
<p>These advances have revolutionized our nutrition management of critically ill patients; most now receive enteral rather than parenteral feeding. Experience has shown that the earlier enteral feeding is started, the better it is tolerated, as the most effective treatment of ileus is enteral stimulation by slow continuous feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611432935">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611432935">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we present our experience with NGJ feeding in 50 consecutive patients managed by our GI Nutrition Support Service between 2007 and 2008.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0884533611432935">
<title>Feeding Tube Placement</title>
<p>Our protocol for tube placement and management is as follows. For critically ill patients in the ICU, bedside endoscopy is used to place NGJ tubes as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611432935">11</xref></sup> Briefly, transnasal endoscopy with an Olympus 18 French endoscope with conscious sedation is used to place a guidewire (Jagwire, Boston Scientific Corp, Natick, MA) in the jejunum. Despite X-ray evidence of high-grade obstruction of the gastric outlet or duodenum in patients with pancreatitis, it is fairly easy to pass the endoscope through the obstruction and into the “open” intestine below. The guidewire is then passed through the endoscope under direct vision down the intestinal lumen. It is then gently moved beyond vision by probing back and forth, taking care not to double it back on itself. When resistance is met, the wire is left in position, and the endoscope is withdrawn form the upper GI tract and nose. In patients without high gastric outputs, a simple jejunal feeding tube can then be placed, but in patients with gastric outlet obstruction, as in this study, we use a double-lumen NGJ feeding tube (Kendall-Dobbhoff, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) with a 16-French outer stiffer gastric decompression tube and a 9-French inner softer tube that can be fed up to 170 cm through the gastric tube, which usually translates into 40 cm past the ligament of Treitz, which is roughly where you need to feed if you wish to avoid pancreatic stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611432935">12</xref></sup> The procedure is to first place the gastric tube through the pylorus and then, having reinserted the endoscope into the body of the stomach through the alternative nare or mouth, gently feed the jejunal tube through the gastric tube while watching through the endoscope to make sure it does not recoil in the stomach. If the patient is well enough to be transported to the endoscopic suite, then placement can be facilitated by the use of fluoroscopy to place the guidewire as far down the jejunum as possible and to check final tube placement. Finally, we secure the tube with a nasal bridle (AMT Inc, Cleveland, OH).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0884533611432935">
<title>Tube Feeding and Management</title>
<p>Immediately following tube placement, the gastric port is connected to wall suction (low pressure 50 mm Hg, intermittent) and jejunal feeding is commenced at 25 mL/h. In patients with acute or chronic pancreatitis, we use a semi-elemental formula diet (eg, Peptamen AF; Nestle HealthCare Nutrition, Florham Park, NJ) to minimize pancreatic stimulation and because pancreatic secretion, as well as digestion, is commonly impaired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611432935">13</xref></sup> In patients with severe acute pancreatitis and those with ileus, feeds are advanced slowly with increases after 24 hours with tolerance to 50 mL/h and then the next day to goal, which is the volume estimated to provide 25 kcal energy, or 1.5 g protein per kg ideal body weight/d. Initially, in critically ill patients, hydration is maintained by intravenous (IV) infusions, but as the patient stabilizes, additional water can be pumped at a constant rate by piggybacking the infusion into the distal port of the jejunal tube. Bolus hydration &gt;25 mL is avoided as the jejunum has less capacity than the stomach and intolerance will ensue. Both the G- and the J-ports are flushed with 10–20 mL water every 4–6 hours to maintain patency. Drugs in liquid form can be injected down the J-tube provided the tube is immediately flushed afterward with 20 mL water. Crushed medications are never injected into the J-tube. As the outlet obstruction resolves—as shown by the diminution in gastric drainage &lt;500 mL/d—the suction is discontinued, but gastric residuals continue to be checked 6-hourly in case gastric outlet dysfunction recurs. Weaning back onto an oral diet is commenced once gastric outlet obstruction has resolved and the activity of the disease has resolved (assessed by C-reactive protein, white cell count) with return of appetite.</p>

<title>Prevention and Management of Complications</title>
<list id="list1-0884533611432935" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Blocked Tubes:</bold> One of the problems of using a long J-tube is that it may kink back on itself within the intestinal lumen, blocking the infusion. Nursing staff commonly describe this as a “clogged” tube, but the tube is simply bent back on itself within the intestinal lumen. This usually occurs in the distal 10 cm of the jejunal tube because of the series of perforations (perfusion ports) that weaken the tube. Thus, it is imperative to check the position with an abdominal X-ray before replacing or trying to “unclog” the tube. The problem is remedied by attaching a 30- to 50-mL syringe with water to the J-port and applying pressure while slowly pulling the J-tube out 5–10 cm. As the kink straightens, the tube will suddenly flush. If there are no kinks, then the injection of a solution containing pancreatic enzymes may be effective if the cause is congealed feed, but more often than not, the clogging is due to the inadvertent infection of particulate medications down the J-port. Only liquid medications are permitted to be injected down the J-port, and after injection, the tube must be flushed with 20 mL water.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Diarrhea:</bold> The most common cause of diarrhea is disturbance of the gut microbiota by antibiotics and acid suppressants, so the use of prophylactic antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is avoided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611432935">14</xref></sup> A stool sample is sent to the laboratory to exclude <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> colitis. If the diarrhea is &lt;500 mL/d, soluble fiber supplements (eg, Benefiber wheat dextrin; Novartis, Parsippany, NJ) may be injected as boluses down the J-tube in quantities up to 8 g tid and flushed with 20 mL water or added to hydration fluids and piggybacked as a constant infusion into the J-tube. Gut transit can be slowed with liquid loperamide up to 6 mg tid. If diarrhea is &gt;500 mL/d and persists for more than 3 days and no other cause if identified, the tube feeding is held for 24 hours. If the diarrhea resolves, we restart feeding at 25 mL/h and titrate up to goal as tolerated. If diarrhea returns, we switch formulas to full elemental (eg, Vivonex RTF; Nestle HealthCare Nutrition). Only if this fails do we commence parenteral feeding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Hyperglycemia:</bold> This is common in any critically ill patient receiving nutrition support and especially common in pancreatitis patients because of intercurrent pancreatic endocrine damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611432935">15</xref></sup> Blood glucose is monitored closely while advancing tube feed rates. Hyperglycemia &gt;150 mg/dL is covered by sliding-scale insulin injections, in liaison with the endocrinology service.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Aspiration:</bold> Even though aspiration risk is reduced with jejunal feeding and gastric decompression, the head of the bed is set at a 45-degree angle for all tube-fed patients with regular oral suction and mouth care provided to all intubated patients.</p></list-item>

<p>Home enteral feeding has now replaced home parenteral nutrition (HPN) for this group of patients as it is more effective, safer, and less costly. It is particularly useful in delaying or avoiding surgery for patients with pancreatic fluid collections that produce pain and prevent oral intake. NGJ feeding also allows for the discontinuation of IVs, lessening the need for hospitalization. Like HPN, it is important to try to “cycle” the feedings before discharge home so that the tube can be clamped for several hours during the day to facilitate socialization and improve quality of life. However, some patients do not tolerate the higher infusion rates necessary to achieve cycling, and this must be tested in hospital before discharge home. Patients and their family support members must also be educated in cycling methods before discharge to ensure continued tube care and maintenance: this takes at least 2–3 days, and precipitous discharge must be avoided to prevent unnecessary complications at home. Nineteen patients were stable enough to be discharged home with their tube feeding, generally given as cyclical infusions over 14–18 hours. Seven resolved spontaneously and were weaned back onto a normal diet, 5 continued to be obstructed and needed surgical decompression, and 2 were considered poor surgical risk and were given PEG/jejunostomy tubes for long-term feeding at home.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The patients included in this study all suffered from severe critical illness, with an overall mortality of 14%. Until relatively recently, these patients would have been managed with parenteral feeding because all had gastric outlet dysfunction and most had severe acute pancreatitis. Furthermore, most would have been candidates for surgical resection to relieve the obstruction due to pancreatic masses related to pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic pseudocysts, or fluid collections. Bearing this in mind, it is important to note that IV feeding was avoided in 93% of cases and surgery in 84% of cases. Recent analyses have shown that mortality in severe pancreatic necrosis is reduced if surgery can be delayed to allow the necrotic tissue to become organized and walled off, facilitating necrosectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611432935">16</xref></sup> In this series, none of the patients underwent early surgery. Median time to surgery was 5 weeks, and the earliest was operated on 31 days after the onset of acute pancreatitis.</p>
<p>It is not commonly appreciated that to successfully restore enteral feeding in patients with upper GI obstruction, it is not good enough to simply pass a feeding tube through the obstructed segment; you have to also decompress the bowel proximal to the obstruction as gastric and salivary secretions will collect, inducing nausea and vomiting, increasing risk of dislodgment of the jejunal tube and aspiration. For this reason, we always use double-lumen tubes, which can decompress proximally and feed distally, avoiding the use of 2 separate nasal tubes.</p>
<p>Pancreatic rest is one of the cornerstones of managing acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis complicated by obstructing pseudocysts, and pancreatic fistulae as it reduces the flow of proteolytic enzymes and other secretions that contribute to the disease process. Although the best way of maintaining pancreatic rest is to avoid all forms of enteral feeding and use parenteral feeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611432935">13</xref></sup> studies have shown that the benefits of pancreatic rest provided by PN are outweighed by the infective and metabolic complications of PN. Studies of ours in healthy volunteers have shown that enteral feeding can be given while maintaining pancreatic rest if the feeding is delivered &gt;40 cm past the ligament of Treitz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611432935">12</xref></sup> Very few commercially available feeding tubes reach this level, most terminating just past the ligament of Treitz or at best 20 cm past. The jejunal tube contained in our system was especially long, 170 cm, and its final position could be adjusted by feeding more or less through the outer gastric decompression tube so that it could achieve optimal position beyond the compressed upper GI tract. It should be noted, however, that 2 small clinical studies on the comparison of nasogastric to jejunal feeding have been interpreted to demonstrate that pancreatic rest is unimportant in the management of acute pancreatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533611432935">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611432935">18</xref></sup> However, neither study placed their tubes &gt;40 cm past the ligament of Treitz and therefore neither, as discussed above, could evaluate the value of pancreatic rest. It is for this reason that we are currently performing a National Institutes of Health–funded multicenter study to compare outcomes from severe acute pancreatitis in patients fed either our way (pancreatic rest) or directly into the stomach (pancreatic stimulation). From what we know about the pathophysiology of the disease process, we currently recommend that every effort should be made to maintain pancreatic rest until the results of this study are known.</p>
<p>EN using special nasoenteric tube systems is safer, cheaper, and associated with lower complication rates compared to PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611432935">6</xref></sup> However, there is a learning curve for their placement, and once placed, they must be managed carefully by the nutrition team using a protocol such as the one we described above to preserve function and prevent complications. The team needs to provide continuing education to nursing staff on tube maintenance and management. Tubes can be displaced by delirious patients or inadvertently by the hospital staff during bed care or transportation. Tube life has been extended dramatically since the incorporation of the use of a nasal bridle to prevent dislodgement. Use of the bridle, as described here, can be associated with nasal septum injury, but this is surprisingly uncommon, and some of our patients have had the same system in place for months (124 weeks) without obvious injury. The most common reason for tube dysfunction is kinking of the distal end of the jejunal tube as described above. The problem is usually easily corrected by pulling the tube back 5–10 cm as described earlier. Recoil of the tube system into the stomach is extremely rare in our experience, possibly because of our practice of placing the thicker, firmer gastric tube <italic>through</italic> the pylorus, which effectively stents the system in place. Finally, the use of this system has allowed us to discharge many patients home with their tubes, reducing hospital costs and likely improving quality of life. Eventual outcome in this group was good, with only 26% needing late surgery and 40% resolving spontaneously, permitting resumption of normal feeding.</p>
<p>Diarrhea is a common problem in this group of patients, occurring in nearly half the patients. It rarely responds to changes in the enteral feed composition or feeding rate and is often associated with <italic>C difficile</italic> infection, suggesting that microbiota dysbiosis is the root cause. We have recently raised our concern about the overuse of prophylactic antibiotics and gastric acid suppressants, both of which increase the risk of dysbiosis and <italic>C difficile</italic> infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611432935">14</xref></sup> A further concern is our use elemental formula diets, which contain inadequate fiber or residue on which the colonic microbiota depend. Preliminary studies of ours have shown that fiber supplementation is well tolerated and has the potential to increase colonic fermentation and the microbiota production of short-chain fatty acids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533611432935">19</xref></sup> which are essential fuels for the colonic mucosa.</p>
