<title>Network Theory Comes of Age</title>
<p><italic>Social Structures</italic> is the best work yet in network theory. John Levi Martin takes on the problem of how networks change. Since all human society across history has consisted of networks, Martin asks what kinds of networks could grow from small groups into large organizations. The failed candidates, surprisingly, include most of our best-known network structures. A friendship circle or clique will not do, if we mean reciprocal choices among everyone; empirically, complete mutual liking is rare beyond very small numbers. Balance theory (the friend of my friend is my friend) works less and less well the further the links go; the negative version (the enemy of my friend is my enemy) is empirically often violated. Strong ties and balance theory provide a terrible model for politics and change, eliminating flexibility and strategy. How about relaxing the requirement for reciprocity and building on one-way choices? This can produce a popularity tournament (some are more chosen than others); but empirically, popularity rankings tend to be vague in the middle, if clear about who is at top and bottom. The rigid version, a pecking order found in some animal species, does not exist among humans.</p>
<p>So far, neither egalitarian networks among the like-minded nor tight hierarchies provide the path to intentionally coordinated organization. For Martin, this is means transitivity: where something (information, orders, etc.) is propagated successively through the links of a network. What is needed is a network that will not fall apart nor lose its shape as it gets bigger. Martin settles on the wheel-and-hub structure, like the Big Man redistribution network when small kinship-based societies were transforming into chiefdoms. Initially it is voluntary, a prominent individual collecting attention, enthusiasm, and gifts from followers, and recycling them back to them in festive gatherings. The structure becomes political when it aggregates military force; if the coalition conquers others, it has more goods to redistribute. Wheel-and-hub (or patron-client) networks can be combined at higher levels, as each hub can become a spoke in a yet larger wheel (a higher chief) and so on. Martin’s abstract theory fits the phase of history before the rise of strong states. What else was needed? Armies built on patron-client networks do not transmit orders well beyond one link in the chain; the more effective modern army becomes a bureaucracy, with command links from top to bottom. Here Martin meshes with the military-fiscal theory of the modern state; bureaucratic command structures provided a model for tax-extracting and then other administrative and civilian organizations, eventually displacing the patron-client form. Nevertheless, all the earlier structures that Martin shows do not go very far—small friendship cliques (etc.) continue to exist, but in a framework where large bureaucracies are the most enduring, self-replicating networks. Martin also shows the transformations that produced the modern ideological party; if we extend this category to the modern social movement, we have the major structures that contend with bureaucracies.</p>
<p>The main thing Martin leaves out is economic markets, because he has argued that exchange structures could not produce the structures he is looking for, transitive command hierarchies. The gap is filled by Harrison C. White (hereafter HCW), in <italic>Markets from Networks</italic>.</p>
<p>The simplifications of neo-classical economic theory do not begin to grapple with the complexities. It is not just that markets are embedded in other kinds of social networks. Markets themselves are networks. The conventional view of supply and demand assumes a completely connected network: all buyers examine bids from all sellers, then make their choice. HCW remarks that such markets exist only in lawn sales and swap meets, where the goods have already been produced. Goods come from production markets, and these are structured as upstream-to-downstream flows through relatively enduring networks of regular suppliers to regular customers. A certain amount of shopping around may go on in the supply chain, but if this were predominant, most things could not get produced. Restricted networks (i.e., ties as repeated transactions among the same actors) are essential for production markets to exist.</p>
<p>HCW does not assume producers fight it out to capture demand by delivering the lowest price. In the real world, there are a variety of market niches, differing by quality of product (especially as perceived through reputation and branding), and by supply and demand for different volumes. Formulating these dimensions as variables, HCW locates different kinds of markets in a space with four quadrants:</p>
<list id="list1-0094306113477376" list-type="roman-upper">
<list-item>
<p>GRIND, where producers vie for buyers who are inflexible in their demand for volume and unconcerned about quality, relative to what it costs producers (e.g., cement). This is the closest to pure competition, the idealized conventional economics in which there are no differences in quality. More accurately, here big low quality producers drive out higher quality producers.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>TRUST, where there is high demand per volume cost (favoring mass production) but lagging demand for quality relative to its cost of production. Each quadrant has distinctive dynamics over time; this one tends towards cartel-like arrangements (trusts) among firms to divide up markets, or towards conglomerates.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>UNRAVELING, where there is high demand for quality relative to cost of producing it, but lagging demand for volume relative to cost. Low-quality producers undercut others of similar volume, making the market unsustainable unless it moves toward guild structures fixing quality levels and restricting entry.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>NOVEL, even EXPLOSIVE, where the entire market becomes more profitable the bigger it is, through waves of buyer enthusiasm for cutting-edge products. The time-dynamics of such markets depend on further processes that HCW spells out but are omitted here for simplicity; suffice it to say that HCW illuminates the high-tech/personal-computer era better than any other theorist.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Economic action is seeking distinctive market niches, avoiding head-to-head competition and thus making profit. Both start-up entrepreneurs and existing producers monitor their competitors, to see where the demand is, and to judge where they can occupy an adjacent niche, sufficiently dissimilar in volume and quality cost. Production markets are not only upstream-to-downstream networks, they are also horizontal networks of mutually monitoring competitors, who are allies in sustaining an identity for their market. Both kinds of networks make all-out, atomistic competition impossible; empirically, HCW points out, each market settles into an array of a few big firms with a tail of smaller ones. HCW’s four-quadrants model depicts not only where the niches are, but where profits are highest. It is potentially a theory of economic macro-dynamics as well, predicting volume and quality of production over time.</p>
<p>The chief drawback of HCW’s theory is its mathematical complexity, which makes deriving prices much more difficult than in conventional economics. Thus far it is more of a sketch than a fully developed theory. The markets-from-networks approach is a conceptual revolution on a par with Schumpeter and Keynes in the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Stephan Fuchs provides a network-location theory of culture in <italic>Against Essentialism: A Theory of Culture and Society</italic>. What people believe, think, and say is variable, between societies, and within each one. Culture constitutes social entities, but there are no fixed units; all identities and boundaries are temporary crystalizations of networks in flux. This applies alike to organizations, states, groups, and down to individual selves in their essentialist mode as personalities. Whether they are perceived as real entities or fluctuations depends on one’s network location.</p>
<p>First, networks vary between dense, redundantly connected, and bounded; and at the other extreme, complex, full of structural holes where every individual unit is surrounded by a unique configuration. High density networks produce worldviews that are highly conformist, dogmatic, reified, and particularistic; the local network recirculates the same messages so that they are utterly familiar and inescapable. Differentiated, far-flung networks produce views that are relativistic, reflexive, and abstracted from particulars.</p>
<p>On a second dimension, the network being observed can be close to the observer, or on a continuum out to very distant. When the observer is close, they perceive nuanced detail; when the observer regards a distant network, they see essences, natural kinds with sharp borders and rigid alternatives.</p>
<p>Although Fuchs does not explicitly say so, the two dimensions of network location can be combined to give four regions of cultural perception. (1) When the observer is in a dense network but looking at a distant network, they see the other through dogmatic myths, particularistic essences like ethnic or religious stereotypes—a tribalistic viewpoint looking out. (2) When the observer is in a differentiated network looking at it from close by, they see it as complicated, fluctuating, hard to pin down except temporarily and by aid of abstractions recognized as approximations only. This might be called the postmodernist lens. So far we have two opposite cultural experiences; the first resembles Durkheim’s mechanical solidarity, and the second sharpens Durkheim’s unsatisfactory concept, organic solidarity. There are two further combinations.</p>
<p>(3) When the network is dense but the observer is close (i.e., observing one’s own network), rigid essences dissolve into details of local action; the culture is gossipy. (4) When the network location is differentiated but the observer is looking at a distant network, the object becomes rigidified into ideological categories—the sophisticated observer in an essentialist mode.</p>
<p>Officials—those who act as Goffmanian frontstage spokespersons to outsiders—distort the reality of their own organization by presenting it in the language of idealized essences; formality comes at the borders. Fuchs uses evidence of conversational analysis to show that consensus is constructed as a statement to outsiders. Individuals are constructed (in good symbolic interactionist fashion) by their conversations with others and by recirculating conversations with oneself in thought; the individual self adopts the categories in that network’s talk to communicate about oneself. The extent to which people are individuals is a variable outcome of observations made from different locations. A “leader” is a construct that officials use when they want to attribute merit or blame, rather than explaining the complexities of what the entire network actually did. Behind the outward-facing facade, the inner structure of any group is more turbulent, the closer one looks at it.</p>
<p>Fuchs and HCW present an omni-network view of social life. Fuchs grounds his argument more in the sociology of science and interactionist micro-sociology, and HCW in production markets and high culture. If you want to grapple with White’s <italic>Identity and Control</italic>, his most general statement, you might start with Fuchs first.</p>

<title>Classics Advanced</title>
<p><italic>Congedarsi dal mondo: Il suicidio in Occidente e in Oriente</italic> brings Durkheim’s classic work on suicide forward one hundred years, using world-wide data in place of Durkheim’s nineteenth century Europe and pushing the time-scale back to the Middle Ages. Marzio Barbagli continues to find Durkheim’s three kinds of suicides (egoistic, anomic, altruistic) but in different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Egoistic suicide, for Durkheim, indicates weakening solidarity of high density social groups, especially family households. Barbagli points out suicide rates were very low in medieval Christian Europe, but homicides were very high. The church strongly condemned suicide, punishing the survivors by tabooing the place and ritually destroying the suicide’s property. Suicide and homicide rates flipped over around 1600–1700, coinciding with growing state monopolization of force and penetration into society. This explains the falling homicide rate, first in northern European, then in southern and Catholic regions, following the growth of state power. But why did the suicide rate rise? Fortified patrimonial households (the bases for vendettas) were replaced by remote state controls over behavior, setting in motion the long decline of household solidarity that Durkheim saw as a key to egoistic suicide.</p>
<p>Anomic suicide was evidenced, in Durkheim’s view, by outbursts of suicide in times and places where economic growth and political liberalization were suddenly interrupted. It is not static conditions of poverty and oppression that cause suicide, but dramatic reversals for persons who have become used to an expanding horizon of desires. Barbagli supports this pattern, too; there were rapid rises in suicide in the ex-Soviet societies of the 1990s— but also in China, showing that the disruption of socialism was the cause, rather than economic growth or decline per se.</p>
<p>Barbagli vastly elaborates altruistic suicide, using data on Asian societies. For Durkheim, altruistic suicide was chiefly military, in an organization submerging the individual into a collective identity; this not only motivated self-sacrifice for the group, but feelings of honor were so strong that small affronts caused killing oneself. In Durkheim’s data, suicide was largely male, but Durkheim did not have much of a theory of gender. Barbagli emphasizes the predominance of female suicide in India and China. Indian <italic>sati</italic>, widow suicide on her husband’s funeral pyre, was not an old religious tradition, but a movement peaking around 1650 to 1870. <italic>Sati</italic> grew in mass-participation, non-Brahmin Hindu religions of emotional devotion, where it was a way for wealthy but non-elite families to claim higher social status. Widows went along, in part because their lives were meager and in part because <italic>sati</italic> made them the center of ritual attention. And since Muslims prohibited suicide—and were the conquerors of much of India at this time—<italic>sati</italic> was a form of rebellion against the overlords, with women playing the central role.</p>
<p>In early modern China, too, women predominated in suicides. This was done especially to bring shame and vengeance upon a man who dishonored her, sexually or otherwise. Here again state penetration plays a role. Chinese state bureaucracy was mostly content to rely on Confucian rituals to keep order in households, but magistrates would step in when a male head of household appeared to be lax, especially with women servants. Suicide was a weapon of the weak, taking advantage of the ritual liabilities of the strong.</p>
<p>The rise on suicide bombing is a late twentieth century practice, spreading against tradition in Islamic societies, where suicide rates are typically low. But suicide bombing is the most reliable way to cause casualties in guerrilla war, so doctrinal adjustments have been made. Muslim women have found opportunities here, since suicide bombing requires deceptive normalcy and a clandestine approach rather than macho aggressiveness. Again, suicide provides oppressed women with an opportunity for status mobility. Barbagli’s non-Western cases expand Durkheim’s altruistic suicide to conflict and resistance for those who feel themselves oppressed.</p>
<p>Durkheim analyzed suicide as a quantitative index of changes and strains in social structure. Barbagli’s vast extension broadens our picture of such dynamics world-wide. This great book is now being translated by Polity Press.</p>
<p>Weber is here taken in a new direction—Philip Gorski in <italic>The Disciplinary Revolution: Calvinism and the Rise of the State in Early Modern Europe</italic> presents two prototypes of the early modernizing state, both driven by radical Protestantism, enforcing constraint from the outside while inculcating it within. The sixteenth–seventeenth century Dutch are modernization from below, in towns and parishes with their workhouses for the poor, and their church elders disciplining sinners for all manner of misbehavior, denounced by rumor and hearsay. It is republican in the sense of community control, all the tighter for its snoopy intrusiveness. Prussia in the seventeenth–eighteenth centuries is closer to the state-centered model of penetration from above; everyone is inscribed on the rolls of the state through military conscription, compulsory education, and the church as the local level of overseeing bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Gorski calls it a disciplinary revolution, instead of Elias’ civilizing process and Foucault’s regimes of everyday power. Gorski has a better causal mechanism: the state (whether decentralized republic or centralizing bureaucracy) combining with a psychologically penetrating religion. Throwing off the easy-going ritualism of medieval Christianity as it affected the laity, ascetic Protestantism leads the way to modernity. But it is not a linear progression. Gorski’s epoch is an Orwellian horror, combining the most oppressive features of medieval patrimonial hierarchy with modern bureaucratic impersonality. Weber’s iron cage may have been more political than economic; be thankful that later modernity relaxed its icy hand.</p>

<title>State-centered Theory</title>
<p>Miguel Centeno’s <italic>Blood and Debt: War and the Nation-State in Latin America</italic> gives an important negative comparison for the military-fiscal theory of the modern state. Latin American states mostly did not fight external wars. Hence they did not go through the revolution of massive (and expensive) militaries; did not engage in much tax extraction nor build up the bureaucratic apparatus for state penetration. The result has been weak and unmodern states, with lower levels of patriotic identification. And bad results for democracy, too, since the military has mainly been used for domestic factional politics and thus has been divisive rather than unifying. Centeno gives the best explanation of Latin American political development, and a neat confirmation of the effects of the military-fiscal pathway.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing</italic>, Michael Mann, one of the progenitors of the military-fiscal theory of the state (along with Tilly and others) turns his attention to the conditions for genocide. It is a shocker: mass extermination of ethnic aliens is modern, not traditional; and it is especially characteristic of the early expansion of democracy. Traditional autocracies were happy to incorporate ethnic and religious diversity; they lived by divide-and-conquer, practiced indirect rule through local notables, and regarded aliens as so much more labor to exploit. The greater caging of populations in the nation-state demanded more homogeneity; and the populist ideology of rule by the people made those who divide us into enemies, even non-humans to be expelled or exterminated. Particularly aggressive have been settler democracies, on frontiers like the American West or Australia, where native tribes were of no use as labor for pioneering farmers. Mann surveys all the major cases of genocide and gives a multi-factor theory of sequential conditions pushing to the brink, and over. Today’s mature democracies are lucky to have their genocides behind them. Mann’s theorizing is unshrinkingly realistic. Tell it like it is; and learn what sociological lessons we can.</p>

<title>Micro-theory</title>
<p>Emotions are what energize social movements. A good way to show this is not at moments of enthusiasm when membership is rising and contributions come flooding in, but when the movement is failing. In <italic>Laughing Saints and Righteous Heroes: Emotional Rhythms in Social Movement Groups</italic>, Erika Summers-Effler provides ethnographies of two perennially failing organizations to find what keeps them going. An anti-death-penalty movement survives on righteous anger, as small bands of demonstrators face an unsympathetic public who scorns and spits at them. Thrilling risk and solidarity of confrontation makes them stronger; harassing prosecutors and officials give them dangerous peak moments; better a dramatic failure than slow boredom. Their repertoire of evoking righteous heroism is a resource to keep recovering from failures, even though it takes its toll on the core members who do the scut-work at the SMO.</p>
<p>Even more consistently failing is a Catholic Workers house, dedicated to sharing the lot of the urban poor while trying to raise them spiritually and materially. Not only is the house frequently on the brink of starvation, but the derelicts it takes in off the streets steal their supplies, deal drugs from the house, and disrupt the dedicated atmosphere; kicking out the failed rescues is purgatory too, a painful experience because the Catholic Workers know it is against their doctrine of unquestioning acceptance of the poor. Yet they survive their crises: typically when a distraught meeting bursts into contagious laughter, washing away the tensions, re-energizing them, even letting them interpret their scraping-through as divine miracles of Zen-like ineffability. There is organizational tension here too: the full-time Catholic Workers are skeptical of well-meaning volunteers who make donations and come to help. These laughing saints operate at a meta-awareness of emotional rhythms which is their secret of resilience; the volunteers have simpler emotions of sympathy and seriousness that easily burn out. Emotional repertoires, Summers-Effler theorizes, set the speed and tempo of social movements across time. Her work echoes Weber’s two types of innerworldly religion: ascetic (seen in Gorski’s disciplinarians), and mystical, whose survival in non-authoritarian, non-moralistic movements has helped to make the modern world livable.</p>
<p>Löic Wacquant’s <italic>Body and Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer</italic> is perhaps the best yet sociology of the body—its theorizing is less explicit than is the acuteness of the observations. In this south Chicago ghetto gym, everything happens to the three-minute rings of the trainer’s bell: bag-punching, rope-skipping, sit-ups, sparring in the ring. Most of this could be done at home, but it only becomes effectively internalized when the boxer does it in the three-minute collective rhythm; when the number of boxers present in the gym falls too low, the energy doesn’t take off; when the gym is too crowded, the shared rhythm is drowned out. Above all the boxer is training to see with his whole body. Wacquant the novice boxer steps into the ring feeling like a slow-motion astronaut in a space suit; only after months of training does he begin to catch the rhythm shared with his opponent and to see the fist before it hits him. The trainer is adamant that boxing cannot be learned from a book; to even think of moving your feet according to a diagram messes you up. Like learning to speak a foreign language, throwing oneself into the rhythms of social interaction is the only way to real membership. Put another way: membership is in the fluidness of the rhythms.</p>
<p><italic>The Opera Fanatic: Ethnography of an Obsession</italic> liberates us from Bourdieu’s reductionist theory of taste as an internalized sense of parental social position. Claudio Benzecry’s opera fanatics scramble for the cheap seats at the top of the house, scorning the rich patrons whom they view as merely turning money into cultural impressiveness. The opera fanatics receive no prestige for their obsession, attending every performance so they can compare the nuances of the arias—indeed they feel like pariahs. No matter; through gossiping with their co-fanatics, and by attuning their own bodies, they have learned how to resonate their breathing, ears, brain, blood-stream with the vibrating sound waves that make them melt in aesthetic ecstacy. Benzecry is at his best in describing the bodily strategies they have acquired for the production of the peaks of taste experience: although prepared by networks, they close their eyes, get their bodies into the right position, and dive into it alone. Again body, attunement, emotion. Benzecry’s vision of socially prepared solitudes opens a way for sociology to do justice to the things people love.</p>
