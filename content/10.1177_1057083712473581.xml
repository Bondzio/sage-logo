<body>
<p>From their outset, the Society for Music Teacher Education (SMTE) and the <italic>Journal of Music Teacher Education</italic> (<italic>JMTE</italic>) have sought to position the journal as a place for dialogue surrounding the crucial issues facing the profession and its members. In 2013, we find ourselves with a need for continued deep and meaningful discourse, but there seems to be a greater sense of urgency. It seems that the profession of teacher preparation is at a convergence of many reform ideas, policy-changes, difficult economic conditions, political posturing and calls for more accountability, all aimed at improving our schools. Frankly, it is a time that seems ever evolving, making it a challenge to identify as the priority. It seems, however, that the issues we are facing will alter our work with future music educators, and, in turn, the direction of music education for years to come. We are at a crossroads.</p>
<p>This is certainly not the first time that SMTE has found itself in this position. In fact, as Eunice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057083712473581">Boardman (1992)</xref> reminded us, our organization, SMTE, was intended to be a “forum for the identification and solution of common problems among the constituency.” And, if you review the “Notes from the Chair” columns of the <italic>JMTE</italic>, you will find that that has indeed been the case. For example, past chair Randi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712473581">L’Hommedieu (1998)</xref> took time to address the junction of issues facing the time period of the late 1990s. In addition to other concerns, there were apprehensions that the changes to InTASC (Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium) Standards and the PRAXIS exams would have a far-reaching impact on music teacher preparation. He wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>If we do not address these issues proactively with a united front, a strong argument, and a persuasive literature base, we will be swept away in the new currents of educational reform currents that I believe are even stronger than those of the mid-to-late eighties. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057083712473581">L’Hommedieu, 1998</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The concerns L’Hommedieu described did indeed become a reality and SMTE began to dissect these and other items further through its regular meetings and also through <italic>JMTE</italic>. In turn, SMTE became a working group of those interested in sharing and learning more about all of these reforms and their potential impact. As always, the leadership of SMTE recognized the need for strong collaboration and partnerships as the best means to disentangle the meaning and implications of these challenges.</p>
<p>Just more than 10 years ago, past chair Sara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057083712473581">Bidner (2001)</xref> noted, among other concerns, the issues of decreasing credit hours, broadening curriculum to address diversity, and technological applications for music education as key concerns needing SMTE’s attention. By 2003, Bidner also listed music teacher recruitment, music teacher retention, and calls for more hours of field experience as additional areas of anxiety and worry. “Anxiety” was the right word since the constancy and complexity of these reforms left us quite concerned about the directions music teacher training was going.</p>
<p>In 2013, it seems that we find ourselves with the same sense of urgency, albeit under a different set of circumstances. The call for accountability through standardized testing, various teacher evaluation models, the collection and review of various pieces of evidence related to student learning, and new prototypes of measuring the effectiveness of preservice educators are just a few of the issues that require our best contemplation and resolve. With all of this looking, we are indeed at another crossroads.</p>
<p>I have always found the metaphor of a crossroads to be rather interesting. In folk stories and folk rituals, it is a place that is between different worlds or a liminality, if you will. Some people describe it as if you are standing at the very threshold of change. It is a place of discomfort and instability and makes us feel we need to make a very difficult decision about future directions. Determining that course of direction requires us to use our knowledge, skill, resources, and experiences—in other words, we need to navigate our way through this.</p>
<p>In terms of music teacher education, navigating these crossroads may make for a difficult and bumpy journey. But, before you begin any trip, it is important to have a sense of the perils that you may face. In my view, Janet Barrett and Mark Robin Campbell summed up our situation well in their article titled “Does Music Teacher Preparation Make a Difference?” published in the September, 2012 <italic>School Music News</italic> from the New York State School Music Association. They wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>Music teacher education sits at the crossroads of transformation in music education . . . (C)riticisms and competing claims about learning to teach are plentiful, with numerous calls for reform. As music teacher educators, we often find ourselves in the problematic position of sorting through various proposals from our institutions, accrediting bodies, state licensure offices, colleagues in the field, and the public at large. Each group identifies perceived gaps and offers solutions that frequently involve adding new courses or requirements to an already overburdened curriculum. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057083712473581">Campbell &amp; Barrett, 2012</xref>, p. 25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In that spirit, at its most recent retreat, the SMTE board decided on “Navigating Crossroads” as the theme for the 2013 Symposium for Music Teacher Education to be held at the University of North Carolina–Greensboro, September 26-28, 2013. It might surprise our members to learn that despite what seems to be a rather volatile time in our field, the board has a highly optimistic view of our efforts as an organization to meet the challenges and steer our ship toward the proper courses of action. And, with all of that in mind, the board has started to develop a conference program that will stimulate our efforts to meet that end.</p>
<p><italic>JMTE</italic> is abundant with advice and reminders about how we might proceed as an organization to traverse challenging waters. For example, Sara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057083712473581">Bidner (2003)</xref> noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>Accepting the need for change and overcoming the fear of change are two of the greatest barriers among music colleagues when it comes to redesigning music teacher preparation programs . . . All stakeholders in the preparation process must be willing to rethink the pathways through which students become effective and successful teachers. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his 2004 address to the SMTE membership, Jeff Kimpton offered similar advice to our organization. In his summary, Kimpton opined,
<disp-quote>
<p>Solving these problems will require your personal, active engagement at your own level of involvement. I believe that your actions, linked and served by strong leadership from SMTE, will help us to challenge every part of our current ecosystem, reinvest resources, time, ideas and policies in helping new models of research and experimentation in teacher education move forward . . . You are at a crossroads; choose wisely which direction you decide to go, because it will determine far more than we might ever imagine. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057083712473581">Kimpton, 2005</xref>, p. 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As I was searching for the keyword “crossroads” in our literature, I came across an article titled “Music Education at the Crossroads” by one of my favorite music education figures, James L. Mursell. The article was published in the February 1951 <italic>Music Educators Journal</italic> and it was about Mursell’s concern about making general music a more integral part of the school setting rather than a poor “stepchild.” With a few small changes, his charge seems highly relevant to all of us some 60 years later. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057083712473581">Mursell (1951)</xref> suggested,
<disp-quote>
<p>To say that any enterprise stands at the crossroads is no doubt to use a cliché. But this is exactly the position of music education at the present time. We face a choice on which depends the whole future of our work, and it is a choice that cannot be avoided. We may, on the one hand, continue our work essentially on its present basis, accepting familiar patterns, dominated by familiar concepts, utilizing familiar and accepted procedures. Or we may undertake a radical development of our enterprise, making <italic>music</italic> [insert SMTE] a vital and integral element in education–something which has not yet been done, in spite of many and striking past successes. The former pathway will inevitably lead to diminution and weakness, for our current practices and ideas have already reached the limit of their possibilities. But if we choose the latter, we shall find opening before us ever broader vistas of usefulness, strength, effectiveness, and recognition. (p. 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In my reflections about all of this, I am comforted by the astonishing work done by SMTE over the past 31 years—we are indeed, as Mursell requests, “vital and integral” to our field and music education as a whole. The work of our ASPAs (Areas for Strategic Planning and Action), for example, suggests that the dynamic work ethic needed is plentiful amongst our membership, which stands at the ready to advance the kinds of initiatives that will advance our profession. I think of this work as something of concern not only to music teacher education but also to music education and education as a whole—we can see the big picture!</p>
<p>Surely, SMTE will continue to be a place for members to engage in critical and discerning thought about the evolution of music teacher education. But, given the strengths of our members and our parent organization, the National Association for Music Education (NAfME), and our firm connections to partners like CMS (College Music Society) and NASM (National Association of Schools of Music), our next step should be to confidently promote our visions for music teacher preparation outside of our own field and into that of the broader educational context. That is the true crossroads that I believe we have reached, and I will address some ideas of how we might navigate through it in my next column.</p>
