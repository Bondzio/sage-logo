<p>This is the third edition of a work that first appeared in 2003 and has become a standard reference tool in the field. For that reason alone it is never easy to review works like this which have already established their own, justified, reputation.</p>
<p>The book sets out to provide the practising information professional, whether in libraries, archives or information and learning centres, with a fairly detailed introduction to the laws of the UK which may be encountered during professional work. Some of the topics for consideration are fairly obvious but others may require a little reflection before their relevance to the profession becomes clear. In addition, it must be realised that information professionals will also encounter many aspects of the law which are common to any group of employers or managers but which are outside the scope of this particular work. Such topics as employment law, health and safety, trade union relations and salaries are of a general nature regardless of the sector concerned and will not be found in these pages. Having said that, there is quite a lot about employment and employee confidentiality and monitoring, embedded within the chapter on data protection but this does not appear in the index and could easily be missed by the user when scanning quickly through the contents pages.</p>
<p>The work begins with an extensive outline of the UK legal system, describing how both common and civil law works, the court system in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and tribunals. There is also a short piece on EU law and legal concepts and terminology. Pedley then deals with a whole range of legal issues using a structured approach for each so that the user can expect certain elements in the section being consulted. Topics which would be expected to be covered are copyright, legal deposit, contracts and licensing agreements, data protection, freedom of information, the reuse of public sector information, professional liability and disability discrimination. However, the author also gives extensive coverage to breach of confidence, patents, trademarks and design right, human rights, the Information Commissioner, defamation and cybercrime and computer misuse. There is also a kind of ‘wash-up’ chapter at the end which looks at such topics as the police surveillance of libraries, cloud computing, stocking extremist literature, theft, (placed in a somewhat strange place) Public Lending Right and eBooks and statutory duty of local authorities to provide a library service.</p>
<p>The chapters are not equal in length, as might be expected, and some topics get fairly brief treatment. On the other hand, copyright, an area in which Pedley has worked for many years and is well known, receives fairly detailed attention. This chapter covers some 55 pages and is divided into a series of sub-topics such as ownership, economic and morals rights, permitted acts, licensing, digital copyright and copyright clearance. These, in turn, are further sub-divided and each sub-section is numbered for easy reference from the index and this also allows the user to follow the structure of the chapter easily. This layout is used for each chapter. At the other end of the scale some topics such as disability, privacy and the Information Commissioner cover only nine or ten pages. Each chapter contains references to further reading, cases or legislation. Most chapters also contain one or more figures or tables to clarify the points brought out in the text.</p>
<p>The work is completed by the provision of a list of figures and tables, a table of statutes and other legal instruments, abbreviations used in the text, a list of cases and a glossary of terms used. There is also an index which seems adequate if a little sketchy in places. The cases listed are highly selective and should not be considered as a full list of those relevant to any one topic.</p>
<p>The style of the work is a bit ‘wooden’ and formal which some users might find a little daunting but as a first work of reference for legal issues in the profession it is an excellent starter. Users should be aware that the work is not a definitive guide to the law – neither does it set out to be – but rather a very good point from which to begin to look at a wide range of issues from a professional viewpoint. It gives good guidance on how to follow up particular issues in more detail and manages to bring together in one volume a considerable mass of legal material which is invaluable to anyone managing an information service. Given the current move towards decentralisation in (especially public) library services, this work should be readily to hand for consultation by anyone responsible for the operation of any form of information service.</p>
