<abstract>
<p>Organ failure is a severe complication in sepsis for which the pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Recently, the matri-cellular cysteine-rich, angiogenic induced, 61 (<italic>C</italic>yr61/CCN1); connective tissue growth factor (<italic>C</italic>tgf/CCN2); and nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (<italic>N</italic>ov/CCN3) (CCN)-protein family have been attributed organ-protective properties. Their expression is sensitive to mediators of sepsis pathophysiology but a potential role in sepsis remains elusive. To provide an initial assessment, 50 rats were subjected to 18 h of cecal-ligation and puncture or sham operation. Hepatic and pulmonary <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA displayed an average 7.4- and 3.3-fold induction, while its cardiac expression was unchanged. The changes coincided with excessive hepatic and pulmonary inflammatory gene activation and a restricted cardiac inflammation. Furthermore, hepatocytes displayed a dosage-dependent <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA response <italic>in vitro</italic>, supporting a cytokine-mediated CCN1 regulation in sepsis. <italic>CCN2</italic> mRNA was 2.2-fold induced in the liver, while 2.0-fold and 1.4-fold repressed in the heart and lung. Meanwhile, it did not respond to TNF-α exposure <italic>in vitro</italic>, which indicates different means of regulation than for CCN1. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence for multi-organ regulation of CCN1 and CCN2 in early stages of sepsis, and implies the eruption of inflammatory mediators as a potential mechanism behind the observed CCN1 regulation.</p>

<p>Sepsis is a complex disease that results from a harmful host response to severe infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912436764">1</xref></sup> Despite improvements in our understanding of its pathophysiology, mortality remains high. The presence of concurrent organ failure, in particular, is a strong predictor of sepsis-related death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425912436764">2</xref></sup> The pathophysiologic mechanisms behind sepsis-induced multiple organ failure (MOF) are, however, still controversial. Current knowledge implies a role of microvascular, and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as leukocyte-mediated parenchyma disturbances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912436764">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912436764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912436764">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The extra cellular matrix (ECM) has received little attention in sepsis research. However, the identification and investigation of a new family of matri-cellular proteins, termed the CCN-family, suggests a potential role in sepsis-induced MOF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912436764">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912436764">9</xref></sup> The CCN-family is the acronym derived for the first three family members: cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (Cyr61/CCN1); connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf/CCN2); and nephroblastoma overexpressed gene (Nov/CCN3). The family was later expanded to include three additional members (WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1-3; Wisp1-3/CCN4-6); the proteins are now denoted CCN1-CCN6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912436764">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The biologic functions of the CCNs contrast with those of classical ECM proteins, as they serve to modulate cellular responses to environmental disturbances rather than sustaining structural roles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912436764">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912436764">9</xref></sup> Functioning as autocrine and paracrine multi-functional signal integrators, they support the adhesion, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, as well as the proliferation and adhesion of vascular smooth muscle cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and drive angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425912436764">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425912436764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912436764">16</xref></sup> The proteins play a potential role also on the endothelial surface, as they act as adhesion substrates for activated platelets and macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425912436764">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912436764">18</xref></sup> Moreover, they regulate macrophage migration and pro-inflammatory signaling through receptors widely distributed on innate immune cells and promote cytokine and chemokine expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425912436764">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425912436764">20</xref></sup> Lastly, the CCNs engage in regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, thereby affecting another pivotal element of inflammation and potentially interfering with vascular tone control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425912436764">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425912436764"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425912436764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425912436764">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the expression of the CCN proteins is highly susceptible to cytokine and growth factor expression, hypoxia, hyperoxia, ROS and infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425912436764">23</xref></sup> These features are essential parts of the septic environment, as well as involved in the pathophysiologic background of endothelial, mitochondrial and leukocyte dysfunction which is observed in sepsis-induced MOF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912436764">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912436764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912436764">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912436764">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425912436764">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425912436764">27</xref></sup> This provides compelling evidence that the CCN expression might be affected in sepsis and, hence, hints to the potential involvement of CCNs in sepsis and MOF pathophysiology. In fact, renal CCN1 induction has been documented in a mouse model of poly-microbial sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425912436764">28</xref></sup> However, the study presented here is the first multi-organ investigation of CCN expression in experimentally-induced sepsis <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>Fifty male Wistar rats (Taconic, Hudson, NY, USA), weighing between 250 and 300 g, were kept under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water. The animals were randomized to cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) or sham operation as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425912436764">29</xref></sup> Briefly, the cecum was assessed through a midline laparotomy, ligated with 3-0 silk suture and punctured in two places with an 18-G needle. With this injury, approximately 10% mortality was observed within 18 h. The animals received saline (3 ml/100 g) and analgesia (Temgesic 0.05 mg/kg) subcutaneously following surgery, as well as 9 h postoperative. Eighteen hours after surgery a re-laparotomy was preformed and the animals were sacrificed by terminal bleeding from the abdominal aorta, using a 23-G needle and 10-ml syringe. Blood was collected for biochemical analysis and organs (lungs, livers and hearts) were harvested. All animal experiments were approved by the local animal care committee and conducted in accordance with the national animal welfare guidelines.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1753425912436764"><title>Biochemical markers</title>
<p>Levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and troponin-T were measured in heparin anti-coagulated blood by the Department of Clinical Biochemistry (Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Norway), using validated assays for routine patient analysis. Total leukocyte and platelet counts were done on EDTA anti-coagulated blood with assays validated for routine patient analysis. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed on heparin anti-coagulated blood in capillary tubes using an ABL 800 Flex analyzer (Radiometer Medical Aps, Copenhagen, Denmark).</p>

<sec id="sec5-1753425912436764"><title>Gene expression analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissues by means of RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were treated with an RNase free DNase set (Qiagen) to remove genomic contamination. RNA quality was controlled at random using the Experion™ automated electrophoresis system (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was done using a TaqMan RT kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).</p>
<p>RT-PCR was run in triplicates using a relative standard curve approach. <italic>CCN1-CCN6 and RN18S1</italic> (ribosomal protein S18, internal control) were analyzed using pre-inventoried TaqMan assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Cytokine and chemokine expressions were analyzed by SYBR Green technology, using 2× Universal master mix (Applied Biosystems), cDNA template, and 300 mM sense and anti-sense primers. SYBR Green primers were designed to span intron junctions. Specificity of the SYBR Green primers was assessed by melting point analysis. All assays were optimized to CT-value between 20 and 30 cycles. The primers utilized to amplify target genes were: <italic>TNF-α</italic>, forward 5′- ATG GCC CAG ACC CTC ACA CTC A, reverse 5′- CCG CTT GGT GGT TTG CTA CGC; <italic>IL-1β</italic>, forward 5′- GAC CTG TTC TTT GAG GCT GAC A, reverse 5′- CTC ATC TGG ACA GCC CAA GTC; <italic>IL-6</italic>, forward 5′- TAG TCC TTC CTA CCC CAA CTT C, reverse 5′- TTG GTC CTT AGC CAC TCC TTC; <italic>CXCL1</italic> forward 5′- CAA TGA GCT GCG CTG TCA GT, reverse 5′- TTG AAG TGA ATC CCT GCC ACT; <italic>IL-10</italic> forward 5′- AGC TGC GAC GCT GTC ATC GAT, reverse 5′- CAC CTG CTC CAC TGC CTT GCT T.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1753425912436764"><title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Snap-frozen tissue samples were gently homogenized in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) prior to 30 min incubation on ice. The lysates were centrifuged twice at 10000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove insoluble material and the total protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (BioRad). Proteins from randomly selected animals, with mRNA expression close to the average mean, were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Bioscience, Amersham, UK). Blocking was carried out by incubating membranes with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature (20–22°C). Membranes were incubated with primary Abs against mouse-CCN1, mouse-CCN3 (R&amp;D systems, McKinley Place NE, MN, USA), human-CCN2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and β-actin (Cell Signaling technology Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) 18–20 h at 4°C. After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were incubated with a secondary anti-sheep, anti-goat or anti-rabbit Ab (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at room temperature and proteins visualized by LumiGlo (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Displayed images were developed using a Kodak Image station 4000 mm Pro (Kodak, New Haven, CT, USA).</p>

<sec id="sec7-1753425912436764"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Paraffin-embedded pulmonary sections (6 µm) were rehydrated and blocked 1 h prior to incubation with purified anti-CCN2, raised as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425912436764">30</xref></sup> Subsequently, CCN2 staining was performed with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase system, Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

<sec id="sec8-1753425912436764"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>The human hepatocyte carcinoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, UK). The cells were maintained in EMEM (M2279) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 10% FCS, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Cells were sub-cultured twice weekly. For experiments, the cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1.75 million/cells per ml, 2 ml per well, 24 h prior to stimulation with recombinant TNF-α (R&amp;D systems).</p>

<p>Average expression of cardiac and hepatic pro-inflammatory genes revealed similar patterns. In both tissues, <italic>IL-1β</italic> was the most induced gene, while the <italic>TNF-α</italic> and <italic>IL-6</italic> increases were alike. Meanwhile, average hepatic induction of these genes was excessive and cardiac expression only limited, clearly showing differences in the extent of pro-inflammatory activation. Indicative of differences in the pro-inflammatory process, the average pulmonary mRNA expression manifested a vastly induced <italic>IL-6</italic>, followed by medium <italic>TNF-α</italic>, and minimum <italic>IL-1β</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Peak expression of <italic>CXCL1</italic> was observed in the heart, closely followed by lungs, while being less in the liver.

<sec id="sec16-1753425912436764" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study provides novel evidence for simultaneous regulation of the matri-cellular CCNs in different organs as a response to sepsis-induced impairment. It provides clear evidence for a connection between CCN1 regulation and the expression of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as chemokines. The data indicate that this connection is mediated through cytokines and chemokines provoking CCN1 responses. The experiments also demonstrate CCN2 to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner that is adverse in some organs. Furthermore, it also implies that CCN3 is regulated. The underlying mechanisms of CCN2 and CCN3 regulation seem, however, more complicated than for CCN1. Lastly, our pilot study identified all members of the CCN-family, except for CCN6, as potentially affected in the early stages of sepsis-induced organ impairment.</p>
<p>The gene expression profiles of cytokines and chemokines were analyzed to delineate the environment in which we studied CCN expression. In accordance with the notion of a compartmentalized inflammatory response in sepsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1753425912436764">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1753425912436764">33</xref></sup> tissue-specific profiles were observed in the three organs. However, isolated evaluation of the pro-inflammatory genes revealed hepatic and cardiac profiles to be similar, though different in magnitude, while the pulmonary profile was disparate. Similar observations have been made also by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425912436764">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753425912436764">35</xref></sup> and could indicate pulmonary inflammation to be different from the inflammation in other organs. Moreover, the septic rats divided into LI and HI responders, which is likely to reflect different stages of disease progression or inter-individual differences in susceptibility to the infection.</p>
<p>Interestingly, these inflammatory-based LI and HI groups were also seen in hepatic and pulmonary <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA expression. Simultaneously, <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA regulation was not detected in the heart which exhibited limited inflammation. Furthermore, the mRNA levels correlated strongly to tested inflammatory markers in the liver. These observations provide strong evidence for a biological dependency between CCN1 and multiple cyto- and chemokines <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the lungs, however, the correlations were evident only for <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-1β.</italic> However, this may well be explained by a relatively small difference between <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA induction in the pulmonary LI and HI groups. Conversely, the hepatic LI group elicited <italic>CCN1</italic> expression at the level of sham thereby presenting a more substantial difference between the LI and HI groups. That <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA was induced in the lung LI group but not in the liver LI group, was likely caused by the distinct nature of the inflammatory response or tissue differences of <italic>CCN1</italic> susceptibility.</p>
<p>The causal connection between <italic>CCN1</italic> and cytokine/chemokine expressions, as well as the cellular source of the CCN1 responses, remains to be identified. Human peripheral blood monocytes demonstrate increased <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA expression after challenge with endotoxin <italic>in vitro</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753425912436764">36</xref></sup> This, in conjunction with <italic>CCN1</italic> obeying the LI/HI patterns and displaying close associations to inflammatory markers, could indicate the observed <italic>CCN1</italic> response to originate from inflammatory cell types. However, several lines of evidence also support expression of the autocrine and paracrine acting CCNs from other cells-types, both stromal and parenchymal ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912436764">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912436764">9</xref></sup> Our studies clearly demonstrate a <italic>CCN1</italic> mRNA response in hepatocytes upon TNF-α exposure. This implies that the observed CCN1 regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> might partially emerge from parenchyma cells, and that the parenchymal CCN1 regulation can be a consequence of environmental cytokine/chemokine exposure. Hereby, the data implicate a role for CCN1 in the parenchymal response to sepsis.</p>
<p>The observed CCN2 regulation appears to be more complicated. The mRNA levels correlated with few inflammatory markers, the LI/HI division was absent and TNF-α did not elicit a <italic>CCN2</italic> mRNA response in the hepatocytes. This merely excludes cytokines and chemokines as main regulators of <italic>CCN2</italic> in the utilized model. Despite the elusiveness of regulatory factors, an interesting tissue-specific response was observed for CCN2. Such tissue-specific CCN2 responses have also been observed previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425912436764">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425912436764">38</xref></sup> In these studies, TNF-α inhibited CCN2 expression in skin fibroblasts and conversely, induced CCN2 in mesangial cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. As such, the observed tissue-specific differences in CCN2 expression are likely to occur through similar mechanisms and this observation is encouraging further investigations.</p>
<p>The regulation of CCN1 and CCN2 on the protein level revealed a complex pattern. Our experiments uncovered CCN2 but not CCN1 protein regulation in the liver, while both proteins were regulated in the lungs. With a few exceptions, CCN proteins are regulated at the transcriptional level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425912436764">39</xref></sup> Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that CCN2 responds more instantly to TNF-α stimulation than CCN1 does.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425912436764">40</xref></sup> This indicates that the lack of CCN1 protein regulation in the liver is likely a result of a premature time point of analysis. The regulation of CCN1 in one organ and not in the other at 18 h could implicate tissue-specific differences in CCN1 sensitivity to environmental perturbations. Alternatively, it could be caused by tissue-specific differences in inflammatory profiles.</p>
<p>As the functional properties of the CCN proteins are diverse, current knowledge implicates potentially beneficial, as well as adverse, effects of these proteins in sepsis and MOF. CCN1 protects pulmonary epithelial cells from hyperoxia and nutrient deprivation which, in addition to its pro-angiogenic properties, implies a protective role in sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425912436764">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425912436764">41</xref></sup> Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated cardio-protective properties of CCN1 over-expression in a mouse model of infectious myocarditis, promoting an organ-preserving role of CCN1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753425912436764">42</xref></sup> CCN2 is also a pro-angiogenic factor, processing cardio-protective capabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1753425912436764">43</xref></sup> As such, the observed pulmonary and cardiac CCN2 suppression could be part of the vascular damage observed in sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912436764">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912436764">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425912436764">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1753425912436764">44</xref></sup> Meanwhile, neonatal mice, over-expressing CCN2 in type-II epithelial cells, have recently been shown to suffer massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltration of the alveolar space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1753425912436764">45</xref></sup> Hence, the down-regulation of CCN2 may well represent a protective response.</p>
<p>In contrast to these potentially beneficial effects, the CCN proteins exert functions that may be detrimental in sepsis. The support of platelet adhesion to endothelial cells hints to involvement in intravascular clot formation and micro-vascular dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425912436764">17</xref></sup> Moreover, macrophages adhere to distinct CCNs on endothelial cells and some of the proteins induce macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling and chemotaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912436764">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425912436764"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425912436764">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1753425912436764">46</xref></sup> Given the critical role of tissue infiltration with dysfunctional leukocytes, this promotes possible harmful effects of CCN proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425912436764">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425912436764">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425912436764">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study is the first multi-organ description of CCN proteins in sepsis-induced organ-impairment. It provides evidence for CCN1 regulation in early stages of sepsis and implies the eruption of cytokines/chemokines as a potential mechanism. Evidence is also presented for tissue-specific CCN2 regulation and for uniform <italic>CCN3</italic> mRNA regulation but seemingly through different mechanisms than for CCN1. Furthermore, the study indicates a potential regulation of CCN4 and CCN5 in sepsis.
