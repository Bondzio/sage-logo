<abstract>
<p>The authors employ the upper echelons theory and contingency theory in understanding the moderating effect of the chief executive officer (CEO) characteristics on the relationship between recession and research and development (R&amp;D) intensity. The authors selected 2004 (nonrecession) and 2008 (recession) years for the analysis. Evidence was found that during recession, indeed, organizations decreased their R&amp;D spending. The findings supported that CEOs with a shorter career horizon decreased R&amp;D spending more dramatically than CEOs with a longer career horizon during recession. No evidence was found for the moderating effects of CEO tenure and insider status.</p>

<p>Recessions have been studied extensively in the field of economic research. During a recession, studies have shown that research and development (R&amp;D) spending generally decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442966">Barlevy, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442966">Brockhoff &amp; Pearson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812442966">National Science Foundation [NSF], 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442966">Rafferty &amp; Funk, 2008</xref>). Further supporting the evidence that R&amp;D expenditures decline in recession, researchers find support for the procyclicality of R&amp;D growth, which has a positive correlation with overall economic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">Barlevy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442966">Rafferty &amp; Funk, 2008</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442966">Brockhoff and Pearson (1998)</xref> found that budget cuts to R&amp;D spending are the result of deep recessions. Extending the view to long term, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812442966">Morbey and Dugal (1992)</xref> researched corporate R&amp;D spending during recession and found that there are long-term positive effects of R&amp;D spending. Nonetheless, little research has looked at the impact of the economic climate of recessions on empirically studied areas of organizational science.</p>
<p>R&amp;D investments are key decisions made by corporate executives in firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1548051812442966">Jensen &amp; Murphy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1548051812442966">Papadakis &amp; Barwise, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1548051812442966">Srivastava &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>). These decisions about R&amp;D can lead to competitive advantage for a firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051812442966">Brenner &amp; Rushton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051812442966">Connolly &amp; Hirschey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812442966">Hayes &amp; Abernathy, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812442966">Porter 1990</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that play a role in these key judgments. Existing research has found evidence for the significant relationship between manager characteristics and the level of R&amp;D spending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051812442966">Hayes and Abernathy (1980)</xref> initiated the debate of how manager backgrounds (in technology and operations) could affect their disposition toward investing (more) in innovation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1548051812442966">Porter (1990)</xref> argued that managers with scientific or technical backgrounds were more likely to invest in R&amp;D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051812442966">Daellenbach, McCarthy, and Schoenecker (1999)</xref> found that the technical orientation of the chief executive officer (CEO) and top management team had a positive effect on firm R&amp;D intensity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker and Mueller (2002)</xref> investigated and found a significant relationship between certain CEO characteristics and firm R&amp;D spending, that is, CEO age, tenure, career, and educational background. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor (2006)</xref> developed and tested a theory of direct and interaction effects of top management team and board characteristics on R&amp;D intensity. This existing research on manager characteristics and R&amp;D investment intensity varies in the level of management studied, ranging from the singular CEO, to the top management team, and extending to the board of directors.</p>
<p>Following the precedence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker and Mueller (2002)</xref>, we focus our study on the CEO level of management. The role of the CEO is unique in the firm as the CEO position is more influential than the other top management team members, carries more overall responsibility than the functional top management team members, interacts regularly with the board of directors, and is incentivized individually. It is important to increase organizational knowledge through differing types of lenses, and we focus the lens of this study on the CEO. In this article, we explore the potential moderating effect of the CEO characteristics on the relationship between the environmental condition of an economic recession and R&amp;D investment intensity.</p>
<p>It is important that scholars begin to understand the linkages between environmental conditions and upper echelon characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812442966">Chaganti &amp; Sambharya, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker and Mueller (2002)</xref> conducted a study on U.S. firms to empirically examine the relationship between CEO characteristics and R&amp;D spending. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor (2006)</xref> expanded the view of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker and Mueller (2002)</xref> by looking at the relationship between the characteristics of both the top management team and the board of directors with R&amp;D intensity. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker and Mueller (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor (2006)</xref> advanced our understanding of top management characteristics and their relationship to R&amp;D spending, neither of these studies examined the context of recession. Our research will address this gap in the field, posing the following question.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Embedded in recession, how do CEO characteristics influence organizational R&amp;D spending?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Thus far, economic researchers have focused on the impact of recession on R&amp;D spending, whereas the organizational researchers have examined the critical role of CEO characteristics on R&amp;D spending. Therefore, we forge two separate yet important areas of research in our study and examine the moderating role of CEO characteristics during recession. It may be suggested that the lens should be applied such that recession is the moderator; yet we suggest that organizations and CEOs become embedded in this economic situation and what varies across the organizations, at least in our focus, are the characteristics of CEOs. This study highlights the importance of a situation such as recession and opens the door for further expansion of “recession” studies on other empirically studied areas of organization science. This has implications for management practice in advancing understanding toward how to survive and thrive during the challenging economic times of recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051812442966">Gulati, Nohria, &amp; Wohlgezogen, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section2-1548051812442966">
<title>Upper Echelons Theory</title>
<p>Upper echelons theory by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> offers the behavioral perspective that executive demographic characteristics play a partial role in organizational outcomes, such as strategic choices and performance levels. The central premise of upper echelons theory is that executives’ experiences, values, and personalities greatly influence their interpretations of the situations they face and, in turn, affect their choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442966">Hambrick, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> offer a model of strategic choice under conditions of bounded rationality. Bounded rationality is the notion that individuals are limited by the information they have available to them, the cognitive limitations of their mind, and the limitations of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051812442966">Cyert &amp; March, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1548051812442966">March &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>); and these limitations play into the decision-making process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason’s (1984)</xref> model begins with the assumption that each person brings their own individual “cognitive base” and “values” perspective to any decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick &amp; Mason, 1984</xref>, p. 195). They define “values” as “principles for ordering consequences or alternatives according to preference” and “cognitive base” as the knowledge in future events, alternative courses of action, and consequences to those courses of action, which they have built from their own experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick &amp; Mason, 1984</xref>, p. 195). These perspectives act as a filter, narrowing the options they may see as available and ultimately affecting the strategic choice decisions made for the firm.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442966">Hambrick (2007)</xref>, in his update on the upper echelons perspective, acknowledges that the use of executive demographics as proxies for the cognitive framework of the executive has limitations in that the true psychological and social processes that fuel the executive behavior are unknown. However, despite this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051812442966">Hambrick (2007)</xref> points out that researchers have substantiated strong links between executive demographic characteristics, strategy, and performance outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051812442966">Boeker, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051812442966">D’Aveni, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051812442966">Eisenhardt &amp; Schoonhoven, 1990</xref>). In this article, we seek to add to this evidence and embrace the “upper echelons” perspective as we investigate how R&amp;D spending during a recession varies by CEO characteristics of age, tenure, and insider/outsider background.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1548051812442966">
<title>Contingency Theory</title>
<p>We take a multidimensional theoretical perspective combining upper echelons theory with contingency theory. Contingency theory originated with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051812442966">Burns and Stalker (1961)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442966">Lawrence and Lorsch (1967)</xref> and was originally based on the idea that the appropriateness of a firm’s structure is dependent on the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442966">Donaldson, 2001</xref>). This contingency perspective is commonly used to explain organizational structure contingent on the environment, organizational size, and strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051812442966">Donaldson, 2001</xref>) but has also been used to explain a wide variety of organizational variables.</p>
<p>Traditional organizational characteristics explained by contingency theory include leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051812442966">Fiedler, 1967</xref>), human resource management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051812442966">Delery &amp; Doty, 1996</xref>), and strategic decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051812442966">Frederickson, 1984</xref>); and more recent studies include organizational variables such as telecommuting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442966">Mayo, Pastor, Gomez-Mejia, &amp; Cruz, 2009</xref>), top management team composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812442966">Patzelt, Knyphausen-Aufsess, &amp; Nikol, 2008</xref>), and CEO/chief operating officer (COO) duality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812442966">Hambrick &amp; Cannella, 2004</xref>). Telecommuting, for example, was found to be more common in smaller firms and in firms with a high percentage of international employees, especially in these smaller and internationally represented firms where the CEO’s style of leadership follows the contingent reward model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1548051812442966">Mayo et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1548051812442966">Patzelt et al. (2008)</xref> studied the contingency of the business model on the relationship between the top management team composition and firm performance, finding that the business model did moderate the relationship, such that the effect of managers’ pharmaceutical industry experience was more positive on performance for therapeutics than for platform business models. In another example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Cannella (2004)</xref> explore the contingent effects of industry dynamism, extraordinary organizational task demands, and CEO limitations on the appointment of a COO and company performance; finding only partial support for their contingency argument. Furthermore, previous studies have established that the effect of one environmental condition on organizations is contingent on other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1548051812442966">Marquis &amp; Huang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Extending these examples into our realm of research, although previous researchers have established general evidence that R&amp;D expenditures decline during the economic environment of a recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442966">Barlevy, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051812442966">Brockhoff &amp; Pearson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812442966">NSF, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1548051812442966">Rafferty &amp; Funk, 2008</xref>), they have not addressed the critical role that the CEO plays in this process. Additionally, environmental conditions (such as economic recession) can generate considerable task demands on a CEO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1548051812442966">Henderson &amp; Fredrickson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1548051812442966">Lawrence &amp; Lorsch, 1967</xref>). CEOs play a key role in making the R&amp;D expenditure decisions, and as the upper echelon perspective posits that their characteristics influence the decisions they make, these characteristics can create a contingency by which the R&amp;D expenditure decisions during times of recession are influenced. The purpose of this article is to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the contingent effects of CEO characteristics may influence R&amp;D investment intensity during a recession (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548051812442966">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>R&amp;D Spending During Recession</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, there are many studies that show R&amp;D spending generally decreases during a recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051812442966">Barlevy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1548051812442966">NSF, 2010</xref>). The procyclicality of R&amp;D growth during a recession has empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">Barlevy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442966">Griliches, 1990</xref>). In a study on the procyclicality of R&amp;D, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">Barlevy (2007)</xref> measured R&amp;D growth in two ways: (a) the growth rate in the number of full-time scientists and engineers employed in R&amp;D in industry as reported by the NSF annual R&amp;D survey and (b) the Compustat report of weighted average growth of R&amp;D expenditures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">Barlevy (2007)</xref> found that for both measures of R&amp;D, the growth declined during recession. The potential causes of this decline in R&amp;D expenditures during recession are discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">Barlevy (2007)</xref>: first, limitations on funds available to allocate to R&amp;D; second, “recessions do not create the opportunity for intertemporal substitutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051812442966">Barlevy, 2007</xref>, p. 1140); and last, the variations in the labor cycle as during recession, labor is scarce, therefore it is not desirable for firms to draw from production to move to R&amp;D. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051812442966">Griliches (1990)</xref> studied R&amp;D by measuring both the number of patents and R&amp;D expenditures (using NSF data) and also found both to be procyclical.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the decline in R&amp;D spending during a recession is a global phenomenon and some nations even subsidize the R&amp;D spending of private firms during recessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051812442966">Gretz &amp; Highfill, 2010</xref>). For example, both Finland and Korea have emerged from past recessions more competitive as a result of increased spending on innovation and education and structural reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1548051812442966">Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2009</xref>). Finland experienced a very deep recession in the 1990s and counteracted this recession with deep government spending cuts, with the exception of R&amp;D spending. Finland’s countercyclical support of the TEKES (the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation) program played an important role in laying the groundwork for a strong recessionary rebound. Likewise, Korea successfully reacted to the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s with efforts to offset the decrease of R&amp;D spending by corporations with an increase in its R&amp;D budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051812442966">Guellec &amp; Wunsch-Vincent, 2009</xref>). However, there are no supplemental subsidy programs for corporate R&amp;D spending in the United States during recessions; therefore, we expect that our findings will be consistent with the prior research.</p>

<title>CEO Career Horizon and R&amp;D Spending During Recession</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> propose age as an upper echelon characteristic that influences strategic choices; older executives tend to be more conservative, whereas younger executives tend to be more progressive and risky. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> discuss three explanations for the conservative perspective of older executives: (a) the physical and cognitive limitations that occur with an increase in age, (b) increased “psychological commitment to the organizational status quo” (p. 198), and (c) avoidance of risk due to life stage. As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref>, the physical and cognitive limitations that occur with an increase in age are supported by the research both from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051812442966">Child (1972)</xref>, who contends that older executives have decreased physical and mental stamina, which is needed to implement organizational changes; and from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051812442966">Chown (1960)</xref>, who argues from a learning theory perspective that older executives may have more difficulty understanding new ideas and learning new behaviors. In terms of risk propensity in decision making, younger CEOs tend to be more flexible and more likely to engage in riskier behavior; older CEOs may be more concerned with financial and career security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1548051812442966">Rhodes, 1983</xref>) and withdraw from decisions they consider to be uncertain based on the risky signals received from the environment. Additional studies have demonstrated age to be associated with values related to risk propensity in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1548051812442966">MacCrimmon &amp; Wehrung, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1548051812442966">Sitkin &amp; Pablo, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> argue that the life stage of the older executive, nearing retirement, provides an incentive for them to become risk averse, so as to not possibly jeopardize their financial or career security. This view is further supported by research finding that CEOs commonly reduce R&amp;D spending in the years prior to their exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051812442966">Dechow &amp; Sloan, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta and Beamish (2008)</xref> studied the age of the CEO in this life stage context, as the “career horizon” of the CEO. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta and Beamish (2008)</xref> introduced the concept of the career horizon problem as the general risk aversion of CEOs nearing retirement, motivated by the CEO’s “legacy conservation” and “wealth preservation.” “Legacy conservation” is the need for departing CEOs to maintain a positive reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta &amp; Beamish, 2008</xref>). The reputation and perceived human capital of a CEO are often based on the performance of their current firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051812442966">Harris &amp; Helfat, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051812442966">Hayward, Rindova, &amp; Pollock, 2004</xref>). Therefore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta and Beamish (2008)</xref> argue that CEOs who are nearing retirement (i.e., those with a short career horizon) are motivated to maintain successful firm performance in their remaining years and will therefore have myopic risk aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1548051812442966">Kahneman &amp; Lovallo, 1993</xref>) and be less likely to take on risky strategic decisions that may jeopardize their firm performance. In addition to “legacy conservation,” CEOs with a shorter career horizon are also motivated by “wealth preservation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta &amp; Beamish, 2008</xref>). As CEOs are compensated by equity-based incentives that are tied directly to firm performance, CEOs with a shorter career horizon are nearing the point where they will need to cash out, which further motivates them from a personal financial perspective to maintain successful firm performance levels so as to maximize their postretirement financial position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta &amp; Beamish, 2008</xref>). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta and Beamish (2008)</xref> used international acquisitions as their measure of strategic risk and found that the CEOs with longer career horizons were more likely to engage in international acquisitions than the CEOs with shorter career horizons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta and Beamish (2008)</xref> call for further studies that measure other elements of risk such as R&amp;D, capital investment projects, and new product developments in the context of CEO career horizon. Our study answers this call by measuring the possible moderating effect of CEO career horizon on the relationship of recessionary times and R&amp;D intensity.</p>
<p>We expect the environmental condition of a recession to further increase the conservative nature of the CEO with a shorter career horizon. Therefore, we predict the career horizon of the CEO will affect the negative relationship between recessionary times and R&amp;D spending intensity, such that the CEOs with a shorter career horizon will decrease their firm R&amp;D spending even more dramatically than the CEOs with the longer career horizon.</p>

<title>CEO Tenure and R&amp;D Spending During Recession</title>
<p>In today’s boundaryless career environment, individuals are independent of organizations in managing and improving their career competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1548051812442966">Sullivan &amp; Arthur, 2006</xref>); therefore, to effectively manage their career trajectory, individuals often change organizations. Thus, even though career horizon and tenure may appear to be similar constructs, they truly capture different aspects of CEOs career, especially in a boundaryless career world in which individuals frequently change organizations.</p>
<p>The tenure of the CEO in a particular firm influences the CEOs decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1548051812442966">Simsek, 2007</xref>). It has also been found that CEOs tend to make fewer strategy changes as their tenure increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051812442966">Grimm &amp; Smith, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051812442966">Hambrick, Henderson, &amp; Miller, 1999</xref>). The reasons for this decrease in strategic change as CEO tenure increases have been posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Fukutomi (1991)</xref>; first, as CEO tenure increases, the CEOs become more committed to their own strategic agenda or paradigm as to how the firm should be managed; and second, as CEO tenure increases, the novelty of the position wears off and their outside interests increase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor (2006)</xref> argues that managers who are new to the firm are seeking ways to be affiliated with new product successes and will, therefore, push for investment in R&amp;D to increase the likelihood and the speed of a new development, whereas managers with longer tenure in the firm become more powerful with their influence over the board and will prefer more modest levels of R&amp;D investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1548051812442966">Hill &amp; Phan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor (2006)</xref> also argues that managers with past success on new products may want to still “glow in the success” of those past products and are therefore more reluctant to support new projects that may take away from their limelight. From the power perspective, CEO tenure allows time for the CEO to build a top management team of their own choosing, which reduces the likelihood of internal political debates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051812442966">Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1990</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> propose that executives who have been with a firm for a long period of time will eventually develop a restricted view of the world, and this limited perspective will skew them away from innovation. Furthermore, the longer a manager has worked at a company, the more experience they have to draw on when making decisions; therefore, they may be more aware of the potential negative consequences associated with strategic decisions than a younger CEO with less experience at the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1548051812442966">Wiersema &amp; Bantel, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor (2006)</xref> empirically found that higher firm tenure of top executives contributes to lower levels of R&amp;D investment intensity.

Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor (2006)</xref>, we predict that the tenure of the CEO will affect the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity, such that CEOs with longer tenure will have lower R&amp;D spending even more so than new CEOs to the firm.</p>

<title>Internal CEO Status and R&amp;D Spending During Recession</title>
<p>The firm internal/external background status of the CEO was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051812442966">Hambrick and Mason (1984)</xref> as an important factor that influences strategic choices. Analogous to the logic of how longer CEO tenure can lead to more conservativeness with regard to change in the organization, CEOs promoted from within a company are more likely to maintain the status quo in comparison to CEOs from outside the company. Outside CEOs are more likely to “shake things up.” Therefore, CEOs who were hired from outside the firm will be more likely to be riskier and invest in innovation. Research findings suggest that firms that prefer to hire CEOs from outside tend to outperform firms that hire from inside among the growth-oriented organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051812442966">Datta &amp; Guthrie, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1548051812442966">Schuler &amp; Jackson, 1987</xref>). These findings support the idea that insider CEOs tend to be less novel when confronted with new situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1548051812442966">Helmich, 1977</xref>). During recession, most companies reduce their R&amp;D spending; therefore, the insider CEO will be less likely to go against the status quo. We predict that the insider status of the CEO will affect the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity, such that CEOs with insider status will have much lower R&amp;D spending than an outsider CEO.</p>

<p>To detect broader patterns across industries, we collected cross-sectional data from Compustat for all the companies that had R&amp;D spending for the selected recession year, 2008, and for the nonrecession year, 2004. Originally, we had 3,604 observations. However, due to missing data, the matched data for both years provided us with 609 companies across various industries with 1,218 observations.

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section11-1548051812442966">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>Our dependent variable was <italic>R&amp;D Intensity</italic>, measured as R&amp;D expenditure divided by sales. We selected this well-established construct, which has been used by many researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442966">Baysinger &amp; Hoskisson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051812442966">Chen &amp; Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051812442966">Hambrick &amp; MacMillan, 1985</xref>), in obtaining a sound <italic>R&amp;D intensity variable</italic>. Since we were examining the relationship between CEO characteristics and the <italic>R&amp;D intensity</italic> level during a recession year and a nonrecession year, we looked at the <italic>R&amp;D intensity</italic> for the following year. We made the assumption that the CEOs decisions concerning the R&amp;D expenditures would be detectable in the following year; therefore, the 2004 characteristics of the CEO were matched with the R&amp;D intensity for 2005.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1548051812442966">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Our independent variables representing the CEO characteristics included the following: <italic>Career Horizon</italic>, measured as the time to retirement of the CEO in years, calculated as 70 (retirement age plus a few years of service on boards) minus the age of the CEO, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta and Beamish (2008)</xref>; <italic>Tenure</italic>, measured as the length of time since the appointment of the CEO to the position; and <italic>Insider Status</italic>, identified as those CEOs who worked for more than 5 years for the focal firm prior to becoming a CEO, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051812442966">Chaganti and Sambharya (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1548051812442966">Vancil (1987)</xref>. <italic>Recession</italic> was another independent variable, a code of 0 was assigned to year 2004 (nonrecession year) and a code of 1 was assigned to year 2008 (recession year). The recession measured in this study started in December 2007 and ended in June of 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1548051812442966">National Bureau of Economic Research, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it was logical to choose 2008 as a recession year, for the whole year was within the time line of a full recession year, whereas 2007 and 2009 were partial recession years. We selected 2004 as the nonrecession year, as it was the midpoint between the last recession 2001 and the recession starting in 2007.</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Our control variables at the firm level included <italic>Firm Performance</italic> and <italic>Firm Size</italic>. We measured firm performance as return on assets, which is a common method for measuring firm performance; previous research has shown both a positive and a negative relationship between firm performance and R&amp;D intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812442966">Hitt &amp; Tyler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812442966">Hundley, Jacobson, &amp; Park, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1548051812442966">Hundley et al.

<p>We measured the firm size as the number of employees in thousands; due to a skewed distribution, we applied a natural logarithm. Firm size is another variable with varying results in terms of its impact on R&amp;D intensity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051812442966">Baysinger and Hoskisson (1989)</xref> found a positive relationship between firm size and R&amp;D spending, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051812442966">Hansen and Hill (1991)</xref> demonstrated a negative association between the size of the firm and the R&amp;D spending.

<p>In the first regression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442966">Table 2</xref>, Model 1), we entered the control variables first, followed by the independent variables of recession, CEO career horizon, CEO tenure, and CEO insider status. Recession was negatively associated with R&amp;D intensity supported by the beta coefficient (<italic>p</italic> &lt;; .001). Our first hypothesis was fully supported; recession had a negative effect on R&amp;D intensity. In addition, the beta coefficient of the firm performance was significant in predicting a negative association between the firm performance and R&amp;D intensity (<italic>p</italic> &lt;; .001). We also observed that the size of the firm was negatively associated with the firm R&amp;D intensity based on the beta coefficient (<italic>p</italic> = .0579). Our results for the relationship between firm size, firm performance, and R&amp;D intensity support the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1548051812442966">Hitt and Tyler (1991)</xref>, in that both firm performance and firm size have a negative relationship with R&amp;D intensity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker and Mueller (2002)</xref> indicated that managers may have less incentive to invest in innovation to maintain the status quo that is developed by the sheer size and market power of the organization. Our findings lend support to their perspective. Investing in R&amp;D, which is perceived as a potential risk, may shift the balances in the market place. The other variables such as the CEO career horizon, CEO tenure, and CEO’s insider status did not have significant main effect results on R&amp;D intensity.</p>
<p>The next regression model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442966">Table 2</xref>, Model 2) investigated the moderating effect of the CEO career horizon on the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity. The interaction beta coefficient indicated a significant negative result (<italic>p</italic> = .0316); our result as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548051812442966">Figure 2</xref> supports our Hypothesis 2, which asserted that the CEO career horizon intensified the impact of recession on R&amp;D spending. CEOs with a shorter career horizon were more inclined to contract R&amp;D spending, even more so during recession than the CEOs with a longer career horizon. As the figure depicts, the CEOs nearing retirement visibly reduced the R&amp;D spending more so than the longer horizon CEOs, as the external environment signaled a risky external situation: recession.</p>

<p>In our next regression model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442966">Table 2</xref>, Model 3), we looked at the moderating role of CEO tenure on the relationship between R&amp;D intensity and recession. Our hypothesis proposed that CEO tenure would moderate the relationship in a way that it would intensify the negative impact of recession on the R&amp;D intensity. The beta coefficient for the CEO tenure interaction term was insignificant and did not lend support to Hypothesis 3. Even though many studies report that tenure and age (career horizon) are correlated, our lack of finding for tenure interaction contrasts with our significant finding for career horizon interaction, signaling that there are differences between the two constructs.</p>
<p>Our final regression analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051812442966">Table 2</xref>, Model 4) considered the moderating effect of CEO insider status on the negative relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity. Hypothesis 4 was not supported by the beta coefficient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CEO characteristics’ impact on firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051812442966">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1993</xref>) and R&amp;D intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker &amp; Mueller, 2002</xref>), along with top management team and board composition main and interaction effects on R&amp;D investment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor, 2006</xref>), have been widely examined. However, no study has taken into consideration the impact of a strong external uncertainty such as recession in examining the CEO characteristics and its moderating effects on the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity. A more systematic approach to understanding the contingent effects of CEO characteristics allowed us to obtain a better picture about the impact of recession on R&amp;D spending.</p>
<p>First, we established that R&amp;D spending is negatively associated with recession. During recession, organizations tend to contract their R&amp;D spending. In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051812442966">Dugal &amp; Morbey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1548051812442966">Morbey &amp; Dugal, 1992</xref>), we found the same result; during recession R&amp;D intensity decreases. We found evidence that CEO career horizon moderates the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity in such a way that CEO career horizon intensifies the negative relationship. Previous research has established that CEO age is negatively related to R&amp;D spending (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker &amp; Mueller, 2002</xref>). The uncertainty in the environment in the form of recession increases the perceived level of risk that is associated with long-term R&amp;D investment. As previous studies have established, CEOs with shorter career horizons tend to take less risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1548051812442966">Matta &amp; Beamish, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1548051812442966">Rhodes, 1983</xref>). Our study adds to the literature that during a perceived uncertainty such as recession, the career horizon of the CEO interacts with the external situation to intensify its negative impact on R&amp;D intensity. It is rather interesting that we did not observe main effects of career horizon on R&amp;D spending, even though previous studies have observed a negative relationship between the two factors; it is possible that for career horizon to play a significant role in reducing the R&amp;D spending, an environmental dimension such as recession must signal a risky context. Although we hypothesized that CEO tenure and CEO insider status would moderate the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity, our findings did not support these perspectives.</p>
<p>Organizations that want to promote R&amp;D intensity or at least to keep it at the current level during a recession should consider the issue of CEO career horizon; top managers nearing retirement tend to be more risk averse and intensify the negative effect of recession on R&amp;D spending. Moreover, strategic decision makers may use our findings in determining the likelihood of R&amp;D spending of their competitors during a recessionary period using the career horizon of the competitor CEO as a consideration.</p>
<p>Beyond the scope of this study, we looked at the CEO’s total compensation and its moderating effect on the recession’s impact on R&amp;D intensity. Our preliminary finding indicated that CEOs who received better compensation tended to mitigate the impact of recession on R&amp;D intensity. This may suggest that higher paid CEOs take more risks than the lower paid CEOs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1548051812442966">Shijun (2004)</xref> found indication that CEOs with higher compensations tend to invest more in R&amp;D.</p>
<sec id="section16-1548051812442966">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>As with other studies, our study has certain limitations. The first limitation is that we only considered a single recessionary period: 2008. A more comprehensive analysis of multiple recession periods would provide additional evidence. Furthermore, different recessions have varying degrees of intensity; therefore, the impact of recession on the R&amp;D spending and the moderating effects of CEO characteristics may be rather different in different degrees of recession intensity than our study. However, we believe that a temporal and external economic environment approach is beneficial to the study of the organizational theory field.</p>
<p>Future research may, also, consider the characteristics of board of directors in understanding the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity. Board of directors’ ratio of insiders to outsiders, career horizon, gender distribution, and tenure may be interesting variables to consider. Furthermore, we took a general approach and did not look at specific industries; future research may look at the impact of recession on R&amp;D intensity moderated by CEO characteristics in specific industries such as high technology.</p>
<p>Another interesting avenue for research may be the consideration of CEO compensation and its impact on the relationship between recession and R&amp;D intensity. As our post hoc finding suggests, higher paid CEOs may be more inclined to take risks during high-risk periods such as recession. In addition, psychological characteristics of CEOs should be considered in examining the impact of the top manager on R&amp;D intensity of the firm during an external hardship. Finally, future research could consider the combined moderating effects of CEO career horizon and compensation on R&amp;D intensity during a recession.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1548051812442966">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As expected, our study confirmed that recession decreases the R&amp;D intensity in organizations. However, our key finding is the fact that this relationship is further moderated by the career horizon of CEO; CEOs nearing retirement spend less during recession than CEOs with longer career horizons. Previous research has demonstrated that certain characteristics of the CEO have an impact on the R&amp;D intensity of a firm (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051812442966">Barker &amp; Mueller, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1548051812442966">Kor 2006</xref>). However, none of the previous research considered a forceful environmental factor such as recession. Our research indicates the importance of such a backdrop as external economic hardship and incorporates its impact on the firm’s R&amp;D intensity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051812442966">Francois and Lloyd-Ellis (2003)</xref> recommend that businesses should invest in R&amp;D during recession when R&amp;D is in less conflict with production. However, most organizations engage in the reduction of R&amp;D spending in a risky milieu such as the recession. For strategic managers who understand the value of investing and expanding their R&amp;D spending during recession, our findings can be beneficial in terms of finding the right CEO. Finally, we hope that our study encourages other researchers to build on our findings and consider recession as an important context in which they examine top management team characteristics and compensation effects on other organizational outcomes.</p>
