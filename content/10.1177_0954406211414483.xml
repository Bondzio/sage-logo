<abstract>
<p>Recent decades have been fertile in terms of development of vehicle dynamics simulations. But the usual applications dedicated to the train design rarely take into account ground vibrations. In order to assess the influence of vehicle dynamics on track deflection and therefore on ground wave propagation, the vehicle/track system must be studied globally. The track/soil coupling is first investigated, through various track/soil models. From there, a decoupled approach is proposed, which proves valid as far as the soil is sufficiently rigid with respect to the ballast. It works in two stages: the simulation of the vehicle/track subsystem provides in a first step the ground forces, considering the irregularities of the rail as the excitation mechanism. The resulting forces are then applied, in a second step, to the soil subsystem model. Two applications are presented, consisting of the passing of a tram over a local discontinuity and the passing of a high-speed train over a rough track. The results obtained show a good agreement with experimental measurements as well as the importance of the whole vehicle/track/soil dynamics on the level of ground vibration.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211414483"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Nowadays, the modelling and the simulation of rail vehicles is usual for studying and designing new trains. Multibody system (MBS) simulation tools are widely used to assess the dynamic performances of a vehicle, in terms of interior comfort or train stability. With the development of computers and numerical procedures, the dynamics of rail vehicles can be assessed in a realistic manner, including chassis flexibility, tridimensional wheel/rail interactions and complex non-linear suspensions. Railway simulation software packages have been validated through various benchmarks, among which the Manchester Benchmarks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211414483"><bold>1</bold></xref>] are probably the best known.</p>
<p>If vehicle dynamics is now commonly investigated in the railway industry, it is not yet the case for track/soil vibrations, which are rarely treated from the very beginning of the design. Constructors assume that the track, and therefore the soil, are rigid. Certainly, some authors consider a flexible track in their simulations. For example, to study the effect of a vehicle running on bridges, Dietz et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211414483"><bold>2</bold></xref>] propose to analyse the vehicle/track system through co-simulation, considering a finite element model for the track. Zhai and True [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211414483"><bold>3</bold></xref>] have performed a similar simulation based on a home-made simulation package, involving a detailed three–layer model of the track [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211414483"><bold>4</bold></xref>]. For studying resilient pads attached under the sleepers, Johansson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211414483"><bold>5</bold></xref>] have used two numerical prediction models, for train–track and track–subgrade interaction, respectively. Knothe and Grassie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211414483"><bold>6</bold></xref>] have presented an excellent survey of vehicle/track models, classifying the dynamic modelling of railway tracks in function of the studied problem. Unfortunately, ground vibration propagation is scarcely taken into account. The main reason is certainly the different approaches adopted by these methodologies: the vehicle dynamics is the most often simulated in the time domain and the ground wave propagation is usually calculated in the frequency domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211414483"><bold>5</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211414483"><bold>7</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211414483"><bold>8</bold></xref>]. This difference can be explained by the problem of modelling unbounded domains like the track (along its longitudinal direction) and the soil (along the three directions), for which the Fourier analysis offers convenient solutions. For example, it is well established that the wavenumber domain allows to find closed-form solution to the problem of moving loads acting on the soil surface.</p>
<p>In the frequency/wavenumber domain, track/soil models have received considerable attention, showing that it is fully possible to understand some physical phenomena linked to track deflection and their interaction with the subgrade. The best example is certainly the critical speed phenomenon, often associated with soft soil, and well revealed by the high-level vibrations generated by the X–2000 high-speed train (HST) in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211414483"><bold>9</bold></xref>]. With the vehicle speed, the axle loads are pointed out as the main vehicle parameter that influences the vibrations level. However, the train weight is imposed by economical and technical imperatives and is rarely modifiable. Proposed models considering the vehicle as a sequence of axle loads (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211414483"><bold>10</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211414483"><bold>13</bold></xref>] for a constant vehicle speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211414483"><bold>14</bold></xref>], for accelerating trains) cannot help the engineers to evaluate changes in the vehicle for reducing the level of vibrations transmitted to the neighbourhood. For very high quality tracks and wheels, the wheel/axle weight is the major contributor to rail deflection. In reality, the rail profile is inevitably imperfect. Around the quasi-static deflection, fluctuations can appear due to the dynamic wheel/track interaction, which modifies the deflection (dynamic deflection). A random excitation, proposed by some authors (see, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211414483"><bold>15</bold></xref>]), fills the gap in term of vehicle/track dynamics, including the effect of the vertical track irregularities: the rail deflection, initially due to the axle loads, can be modified.</p>
<p>More advanced models have been recently developed, with the aim of integrating the vehicle in the prediction procedure. Sheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211414483"><bold>16</bold></xref>] have presented a theoretical model, integrally including the vehicle, the track, and the soil, and based on an approach in the frequency domain. Validation has been carried out for three sites, through experimental values found in literature. The importance of the vehicle speed was emphasized when it is close to the wave velocity of the surface layer. Garden and Stuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211414483"><bold>17</bold></xref>] convolute the force signal from a vehicle/track model with the impulse response of the soil, performed in the time domain. They conclude that various parameters (soil damping and material properties, meshing, non-reflecting boundary, …) influence the ground vibration levels and shapes. Lombaert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211414483"><bold>18</bold></xref>] applied the flexibility matrix approach to a soil model including the track and the vehicle dynamics, in order to predict the dynamic interaction between the vehicle and the track and therefore the free field vibrations, due to the passing of Thalys and InterCity trains. Auersch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211414483"><bold>19</bold></xref>] has studied the vehicle/track interaction forces using the excitation spectra representation: both vertical rail profile and wheel out-of-roundness are mainly analysed, showing that the train speed has a significant influence on the ground vibrations. In some cases, the vehicle model is simplified to rigid wheelsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211414483"><bold>20</bold></xref>], for specific purposes and high-frequency analysis. All the research studies show that complete models exist with detailed representation of the vehicle, but the influence of the vehicle dynamics is not clearly observable. Recently, Kouroussis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414483"><bold>21</bold></xref>] have presented relevant ground surface simulations based on the tram of Brussels, for which the predicted results between a rigid wheelset model and a detailed dynamic model are significantly different, the latter being closer to experimental data.</p>
<p>In order to include soil vibrations in the vehicle design optimization process, it is necessary to treat the vehicle/track/soil system as a whole. The wheel/rail contact depends both on the vehicle dynamics and the track deflection. Kouroussis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414483"><bold>21</bold></xref>] have proposed a model working in two stages, therefore decoupling the vehicle/track interaction and its effect on the soil. They have shown that the classical finite/infinite element method can be an interesting solution when it is used in time domain solution, which is also more appropriate to study transient dynamic problems like ground vibration wave propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211414483"><bold>22</bold></xref>]. The adopted approach is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211414483">Fig. 1</xref>. In the first step, the vehicle is modelled with the help of a multibody approach, as performed by the train constructors. The track model is added under the vehicle, and accounts for the irregularities of the wheel and rail surfaces. The vehicle/track model has been established in a C++ simulation package using a home-made library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954406211414483"><bold>23</bold></xref>]. The soil motion is the object of the second step. The wave propagation, originating from railway traffic, is characterized by small deformations. In this range of deformation amplitudes, the soil is considered as an isotropic linear viscoelastic medium and is modelled with a finite element software where infinite elements are added at the border of the region of interest (FIEM approach). For both subsystems, the simulation is performed in the time domain, which is especially interesting for non-linear problems (wheel/rail contact) and complex geometries (soil structure). The soil model and the track/soil interaction are described in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414483"><bold>21</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211414483"><bold>24</bold></xref>] and have been validated in low- and high-speed cases, by supposing that the ballast presents soft stiffness properties and the track/soil can be neglected.
<fig id="fig1-0954406211414483" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Description of the proposed prediction model, according to a decoupling between the ballast and the soil</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414483-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The intention of this article is to make the outline of an interesting ground vibration problem approach, based on a two-step procedure and performed in the time domain. Although it has been recently validated in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414483"><bold>21</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211414483"><bold>24</bold></xref>], some elements are here clarified. Particular attention is paid to the conditions for which a ballast/soil decoupling can be valid: various track models are studied in order to quantify the modelling error, whatever the soil flexibility. The influence of the finite length of the track and the soil is also analysed, with the concern of validation. It is shown how the vehicle is modelled and interacts with the track, considering a random unevenness or local defects at its rolling surface. Emphasis is given on the vehicle/track interaction and its influence on track dynamics and therefore on railway ground vibrations. Two practical applications (tramways and high-speed trains) are presented, with different degrees of track quality and by varying them, in order to show its influence on the level of ground vibrations.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954406211414483"><title>2 SLEEPERS COUPLING THROUGH THE SOIL</title>
<p>The study of track/soil coupling and, more precisely, the dynamic coupling between sleepers through the soil, is not recent. Already Sarfield et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211414483"><bold>25</bold></xref>] and Rücker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211414483"><bold>26</bold></xref>] studied the interaction between the sleepers and the soil, in order to define the interest of this coupling in the case of high-speed vehicles. The ballast is not included in this case, making it necessary to link the sleepers and the soil surfaces. The coupling was also investigated by Knothe and Wu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211414483"><bold>27</bold></xref>] with a two–layer model, considering the ballast as an elastic rod. The transfer functions between the sleepers were computed, taking into account a homogeneous elastic soil without material damping. They concluded that the track receptances are different at low frequency when a half-space solution is used to model the soil instead of a Winkler's foundation (assumed to represent the distributed stiffness/damping of the ground).</p>
<p>Three track models are analysed afterwards, with an increasing degree of complexity:

The soil is built with the FIEM approach, according to reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211414483"><bold>22</bold></xref>], and the ballast reactions are applied directly on a rectangular surface representing the sleeper area. The soil is defined with a vertical symmetry plane along the direction of the track.</p></list-item>

</fig></p>
<p>The track is modelled by a flexible rail, discretely supported by the sleepers, modelled as lumped masses. Ballast and railpad behaviour are defined as spring/damper elements on both sides of the sleepers. Euler–Bernoulli finite elements are adopted for the rail.</p>
<p>To determine the Winkler's stiffness <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> and damping <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> of the foundation, Wolf formulas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954406211414483"><bold>28</bold></xref>] are applied, making the link between a viscoelastic half-space (defined by its shear modulus <italic>G</italic>, its density ρ, and its Poisson's ratio ν), and stiffness and dashpot constants

in the case of a normal load applied to the soil through a rectangular surface, with 2<italic>a</italic> and 2<italic>b</italic> dimensions (<italic>b</italic> &lt; <italic>a</italic>). The case of a homogeneous soil is studied considering <italic>a</italic> = 0.13m and <italic>b</italic> = 0.65m. These values correspond to typical concrete railway monoblok sleeper surface.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211414483">Figure 3</xref> compares the vertical direct (excitation on the rail in front of a sleeper) and indirect (excitation on the rail in front of an adjacent sleeper) rail receptances obtained from each track model. The following parameters were used for the numerical analysis: <italic>G</italic> = 62 MN/m<sup>2</sup>, ρ = 1540 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and ν = 0.25 (corresponding to a medium soil) with the track parameters from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211414483">Table 1</xref> (see next section). Differences in low frequency appear clearly, the most significant gap arising for the model with rigid foundation. When a Winkler's stiffness is added to the track model (in series with the ballast stiffness), the gap is attenuated as the difference remains below 2 dB with respect to the homogeneous soil.

<p>In the case of a stiff soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211414483">Fig. 4</xref> — <italic>G</italic> = 300 MN/m<sup>2</sup>), the difference is nearly non-existent (less than 0.5 dB). In fact, if the foundation stiffness <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is sufficient compared to that of the ballast <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0954406211414483"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414483-eq3.tif"/>
</disp-formula>
the coupling between sleepers through the soil is limited. This is not the case of a soft soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414483">Fig. 5</xref> — <italic>G</italic> = 4 MN/m<sup>2</sup>), where the difference is significant (up to 12 dB between rigid and homogeneous soils). Once again a track model with a Winkler's foundation reduces the gap (maximum 5 dB).

<p>It can be concluded that the consideration of a Winkler's foundation is acceptable to establish a vehicle/track model dedicated to the determination of soil vibration, insofar as the soil stiffness is large with respect to that of the ballast. This is often the case in practical situations. Moreover, in most cases, it is not unusual to observe differences up to 10 dB on the experimental receptances, issued from the same points of measurement, so that the modelling error remains below the uncertainty range. (It is well established that ballast has a non-linear behaviour which explains this difference.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211414483"><title>3 TRACK DYNAMICS IN TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS AND GOOD PRACTICE RULES</title>
<p>The chosen model for the track considers rigid sleepers and Euler–Bernoulli beams for the rail, according to reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211414483"><bold>6</bold></xref>]. Models with additional ballast masses are much less common and are not classically used in the study of ground vibration, as they require an unnecessary effort in the track characterization (three supplementary parameters for the ballast). As the vertical track deflection is the main contribution to the ground motion, the simplification of the vehicle/track motion in vertical plane (2D model for the vehicle and the track) is sufficient. Moreover, 3D models are specially used to evaluate stresses in ties or noise emission by wheels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211414483"><bold>6</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>Particular attention must be paid to the finite length <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> of the track, defined by the number <italic>N</italic> of sleepers. It is therefore useful to verify that the effect of a bounded track is negligible. This phenomenon can be easily analysed through the case of a travelling unsprung mass m<sub><italic>w</italic></sub> = 1500 kg representing a wheelset and subjected to the weight of the vehicle through a constant axle load <italic>P</italic> of 21 tonnes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211414483">Fig. 6</xref>).

where <italic>d</italic> is the elastic compression deriving from the relative position of the studied wheel with respect to the rail.

<sec id="sec6-0954406211414483"><title>5.1 Vehicle modelling</title>
<p>Passenger comfort and stability are the leading motive of train builders. Vehicle suspensions are often designed to ensure that the vehicle rigid modes are below 10–15 Hz, leading to an adequate isolation of passengers from vibrations. At these frequencies, the track can be considered as rigid, explaining the fact that train designers take into account only the vehicle in their simulations.</p>
<p>To model the vehicle behaviour, the constructors classically use generic multibody codes. An MBS simulation code allows the assembly of classical elements like bodies (either rigid or flexible), joints and force elements in order to build the model of the considered mechanical system. Eventually, special elements can be foreseen to encounter the peculiarities of the considered application: for example, the wheel/rail contact elements in the railway case.</p>
<p>Many standards for vibration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954406211414483"><bold>32</bold></xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954406211414483"><bold>34</bold></xref>] consider that the low-frequency vibrations, typically under 100 Hz, have the most critical effect on the buildings and on the human exposure. That is the reason why it is preferable to include the vehicle simulation in the ground vibrations problem. For the proposed model, the generalized coordinate approach is adopted to generate the equations of motion. A 2D approach is preferred, considering only the bounce and the pitch motions of the car bodies and bogies, and the bounce for the wheelsets. Since the primary focus in this study is on the ground forces caused by dynamics in the low- and mid-frequency ranges, a more complex model is not necessary in this context: the vertical dynamic loads are the main contribution in the ground waves generation. Nevertheless, the proposed approach is not restrictive and can be extended without any difficulty to 3D vehicle models, including for example the cross-level irregularities (roll motion). The formalism used for the vehicle is the same as for the track. The governing equations of the vehicle can be written in the following form

<sec id="sec7-0954406211414483"><title>5.2 Track irregularity</title>
<p>There are several mechanisms for generating ground vibrations that may contribute to the total ground vibration level in different frequency bands. For very high-quality tracks and wheels, the wheel/axle weight is the principal origin of the ground waves. This deflection comes from the wheelset loads acting on the rail, and is identical to the static deflection if the vehicle speed does not exceed the critical velocity of the track (this deflection is therefore called quasi-static deflection). Other mechanisms may contribute to the track deflection, such as the effect of joints in unwelded rails, the unevenness of wheel or rail, or the dynamic loads due to the vehicle guidance. These mechanisms create a dynamic deflection where the effects of the dynamic wheel/track interaction modify the deflection around its quasi-static value.</p>
<p>The proposed vehicle/track model takes into account the wheel/track interaction. From this, it is possible to verify the effect of the track irregularity. A rough rail is computed with the help of the analytical characterization proposed by Garg and Dukkipati [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954406211414483"><bold>35</bold></xref>]. From various representations found in the literature, the functions proposed by these authors are interesting because they present a wide classification (six classes — from good-to-very bad quality) and are based on the broad range of data collected in the US by the Federal Railway Administration (<italic>FRA</italic>). The proposed <italic>PSD</italic> depends on the spatial frequency ϕ and has the following form

Track parameters, especially ballast and railpad parameters, are related to an updating of numerical track receptance with an experimental one, performed by Kogut et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954406211414483"><bold>36</bold></xref>]. Soil parameters have been obtained using the SASW method directly from impact tests at soil surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211414483"><bold>24</bold></xref>]. Ratio <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> = 0.43 and a track with a Winkler's foundation for the subgrade is sufficiently accurate to estimate the track deflection, since it corresponds to small discrepancies in the track receptance, compared with full track/soil coupling. This trainset consists of 2 locomotives and 18 carriages, with a total length of 394 m. The two locomotives are supported by two bogies. Instead of the conventional bogie configuration of two-to-a-car, the carriage bogies are placed half under one car and half under the next (Jacobs bogies), with the exception of the side carriage bogies near the power car and at the middle of the vehicle. The model of the vehicle is achieved, taking into account only its bounce motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211414483">Fig. 12</xref>). From all the vehicle parameters, only the masses and the suspension properties have been collected. For each wheelset <italic>i</italic>, the equation of motion can be written as follows

In this example, it becomes difficult to observe any vehicle dynamics influence, as the primary and secondary suspensions are designed in order to place the bogie and the car body rigid modes under 10 Hz (car body on-suspension and bogie bounces modes are at about 0.6 Hz and 7 Hz, respectively).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211414483">Figure 14</xref> shows the ground wave propagation and gives a whole view of the free field response. The excitation is complex, due to the successive and discrete loading of the track and due to the high vehicle speed. It is therefore difficult to observe the contribution of each axle load.

<p>Also with high vehicle speeds, the quasi-static deflection has an important influence. Generally, the track irregularity is very low in high-speed lines as it must be confined to acceptable limits, especially for passenger comfort. The preceding results are related to a high quality of track (class 6). In this case, the train weight is the major source of vibrations. The influence of dynamic loads can be predicted by varying the artificial track irregularity, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211414483">Fig. 15</xref>, where a strong sensitivity is observed. With a poor track quality, the vibration level reaches up to four times that of a perfect track.

<p>As a second example, the passing of a tram over local and overall discontinuities is considered. The T2000 LRV tram that runs in Brussels is defined as a multi-car tramway that uses advanced technology like independent rotating wheels and low floor design. The studied tram is composed of three cars: a large one on each end and a small one in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954406211414483">Fig. 16</xref>). It is equipped with three bogies with independent wheels. The central bogie is rigid and has four drive wheels. The two end bogies are articulated and have two guide wheels and two drive wheels. Each bogie comprises rubber primary and air-spring secondary suspensions.
<fig id="fig16-0954406211414483" position="float"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption><p>Tram T2000: configuration and modelling</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414483-fig16.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The bounce motion of all bodies and the pitch motion of bogies only are considered in the model of the vehicle, imposing a number of <italic>dof</italic> equal to 18. Each drive wheel is powered by a motor mounted inside the wheels, strongly increasing the unsprung masses but allowing a low-floor design. It is also equipped with a resilient wheel, characterized by a rubber layer inserted between the web and the tread. The modelling of the driving wheels received particular attention. The web (mass m<sub>m</sub>) is connected to the bogie with classic primary suspension (stiffness <italic>k</italic><sub>m</sub>, damping <italic>d</italic><sub>m</sub>), and to the tread (mass m<sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) by the resilient material with <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> stiffness and <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> damping properties. All track and soil parameters have been obtained with different measurement techniques: modal analysis of the track, static track deflection measurement at various loading, direct–arrival survey for the equivalent homogeneous soil. The complete modelling, as well the experimental tests, can be found in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414483"><bold>21</bold></xref>].</p>

<p>The purpose of this section is to verify the influence of both vehicle dynamics and rail surface quality on the ground vibration, at commercial speed (<italic>v</italic><sub>0</sub> = 50 km/h). A relatively medium quality is assumed for the overall unevenness (class 3). As previously, the frequency content of the track unevenness depends on the vehicle speed, with a upper limit determined by
<disp-formula id="disp-formula19-0954406211414483"><label>(19)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414483-eq19.tif"/>

<p>The vertical profile function is clearly limited to very low frequency and mid- and high-frequency unevenness is not perceived in the results. An important local discontinuity has also been imposed on the rail surface, making it possible to excite the rigid body modes of the vehicle. Due to the difficulty to model classical rail discontinuities like turnouts, rail joints, or crossings, a step discontinuity has been used, the experimental/numerical comparison being easier to establish. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954406211414483">Figure 17</xref> presents the dimension of the stepwise discontinuity (height Δ<italic>h</italic>, located at distance <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>), which depends on the wheel radius <italic>R</italic><sub>wheel</sub> and can take the following form

<p>Waves generated by the tram passing are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954406211414483">Fig. 19</xref>, between the case with a local discontinuity and with a perfect track and can be compared, all other things being equal, to the one related to the Eurostar HST. Each wheelset impact is more easily identifiable. It also appears that the generation and the propagation of vibration waves are completely different between the two variants of rail vertical profile; for example, at time <italic>t</italic> = 2s, the rear wheel of the central bogie is in contact with the local defect, imposing large track/soil forces and high-level soil vibrations during a short duration. On the contrary of vibrations imposed by an overall roughness, the generation of ground waves induced by this local defect has essentially its origin under the sleeper above the defect and the neighbouring sleepers in a less degree. This observation becomes an important point in the case of vibratory nuisance evaluation: only a small portion of the track around the local defect is responsible for the ground vibrations, the contribution of far distant sleepers being negligible. The length of the flexible part of the track is then restricted to a limited number of sleepers around the local defect, releasing consequently the computational burden.

The frequency content is well predicted up to 50 Hz. This range is sufficient for evaluating the human comfort and the structural effects on neighbour building.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The importance of dynamic vehicle/track interaction is also developed in all presented results, showing, as far as the hypothesis of decoupling is verified, the importance of an accurate modelling of the wheel/rail contact, taking into account the track irregularity. Based on the multibody approach for the vehicle, the extension with a track system does not present any difficulty: the whole model naturally adopts the merit of multibody system codes. The finite element method, combined with specific local boundaries, present a robust numerical tool for dynamic problems involving complex geometries, as well as infinite geometries.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The CPU resource required to run the two successive simulations depends on the total number of <italic>dof</italic> in the model. Although the vehicle <italic>dof</italic> is low (18 for the tram, 144 for the Eurostar HST), it is not the case of the track and the soil <italic>dof</italic>. This implies a large memory requirement and an important computational time (for example, the simulation of Eurostar passing need 60 h and 42 h, for the vehicle/track and the soil model, respectively, with a conventional 2.5 GHz quad-core processor PC). Special situations of transition zones along the track structure (tunnels, bridges or viaducts) can be examined by modifying locally the track stiffness and the soil configuration. Notice that the decoupled approach is reserved to ballasted tracks if condition (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211414483">3</xref>) is verified, this being not necessarily true for slab tracks. True three-dimensional (3D) applications can be derived from the methodology presented here, considering a full 3D multibody model for the vehicle and the track. Various phenomena can be analysed as the effect of track alignment or curved tracks, where a complete wheel/rail model must be used and with a detailed mechanical behaviour of track elements in concerned directions (railpads, ballast).</p>

<sec id="sec12-0954406211414483"><title>7 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>Predicting ground vibration generated by railway traffic is a complex problem that requires an overall approach taking into account the vehicle, the track and the soil. The proposed approach is orientated to the constructor's point of view, with the vehicle placed in the forefront: the methodology is presented as an extension of vehicle dynamics modelling by including the track, with a second model for simulation of ground wave propagation. The track and the soil can be decoupled as far as the conditions insuring the decoupling between the soil and the vehicle/track subsystems are fulfilled. Practically, this hypothesis is not valid in the presence of soft soils. This can generate some differences but makes it possible to consider two subsystems that are more easily resolved. The vehicle/track subsystem can be simulated in time domain, according to the philosophy classically adopted by the constructors. An accurate track deflection, and therefore soil loading, can be assessed by a finite length of the track, if a sufficient length of the track finite element model is imposed, in accordance with the evaluation of ground vibrations. For the soil modelling, a FIEM approach is used and offers the possibility to finely describe the soil configuration and layering, with the advantage of non-restrictive conditions in time domain formulation. The track unevenness participates in the generation of ground waves vibrations and the vehicle speed strongly influences the effect of track irregularity on the ground vibration level.</p>
<p>The numerical model was experimentally validated in the case of Eurostar HST, showing a good agreement in the frequency range [0–50 Hz]. A second case, based on the tram of Brussels, is also presented, recently discussed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414483"><bold>21</bold></xref>], with the focus on the ground vibration level for various vertical track profiles. Although it is commonly assumed in literature that the sprung masses and their influence can be neglected, the proposed examples show that, in some cases, the vehicle dynamics has a great influence on the level of vibrations. This article demonstrates that a model working in two stages is able to assess the vibrations induced by the railway traffic. At the same time, this article underlines the real benefit of a more detailed model of the vehicle (and even if a full multibody model is not used), which can describe more faithfully the physical phenomena, than a sequence of axle loads.</p>
