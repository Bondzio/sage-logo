<p>Stem cell research has become one of the hot points in the medical field, including wound healing, repairing, or regeneration medicine, because stem cells have the characteristics of self-renewal and differentiating into multiple types of total specialized cells of the body. The researchers involved in stem cell research hope that they can use this skill to one day create tissues or even organs instead of treating damaged tissues or organs in severe injury or in terminal-stage diseases, thus prolonging the life of patients and improving their quality of the life. But it is still a long way ahead with many difficulties to overcome to realize this dream. In this article, the authors discuss some problems in this special field.</p>

<p>Stem cell (SC) research has become one of the hot points in the medical field, including wound healing, repairing, or regeneration medicine, because SCs have the characteristics of self-renewal and differentiating into multiple types of total specialized cells of the body. The researchers involved in SC research hope that they can use this skill to one day create tissues or even organs instead of treating damaged tissues or organs in severe injury or in terminal-stage diseases, thus prolonging the life of patients and improving their quality of the life. But it is still a long way ahead with many difficulties to overcome to realize this dream because we still do not know how many types of SCs still exist in our body after we leave the womb. Which kind of injury and microenvironment can “home” the SCs and induce them to differentiate into normal tissue cells instead of damaged tissue cells. Nevertheless, SC research has helped mankind to understand how a single cell can grow and develop into tissue and organ and how healthy cells can grow instead of damaged cells in the adult body, which induces us to explore disease treatment at the cell level with repair or regeneration medicine because gene therapies have many unsolved problems.</p>
<p>Some recent experimental results, such as residual undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs, about 15%) remaining in differentiated ESCs induced in vitro from embryoid bodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457035">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612457035">2</xref></sup> have led us to further think and connect and even arouse new questions in our mind. Are there any residual undifferentiated ESCs remaining in our body after the mother’s uterus? The residual undifferentiated ESCs may be one of the evolutionary advantages and also may have one of the most important functions of repairing or regeneration in our body to resist diseases and injury and maintain the metabolic balance of our body. The residual undifferentiated ESCs are the source of adult SCs that exist in our adult organs and tissues, aren’t they? Then, the questions are, “Where are they and when do they maintain “silence” or when are they activated or differentiated?”</p>
<p>We seem to have found out some answers from some scientific results. Kucia et al have identified in the bone marrow (BM) a population of SCs that display a similar morphology and express several markers such as SSEA-1, Oct-4, Nanog, and Rex-1, characteristic of early ESCs. These cells are small (~2-4 µm), with large nuclei surrounded by a narrow rim of cytoplasm, and contain open-type chromatin (euchromatin), which is typical for ESCs. In in vitro cultures, these cells are able to differentiate into all 3 germ-layer lineages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457035">3</xref></sup> Therefore, these cells have been called very small embryonic-like (VSEL) SCs. The number of these cells is higher in young animals, and their number decreases with age. They are barely detectable in 1-year-old mice, which correspond to a 50-year-old human. This age-dependent content of VSELs in BM may explain why the regeneration processes are more efficient in younger individuals. Evidence is provided that during organ damage nonhematopoietic stem cells (including VSELs) are mobilized from the BM into peripheral blood where they circulate in order to, what we believe, “home” the damaged tissues and participate in tissue repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457035">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612457035"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457035"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457035"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457035">7</xref></sup> These cells may efficiently differentiate and regenerate some special tissue cells to replace the damaged cells in injuries. It is well documented that damaged tissues upregulate the expression of several chemoattractants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457035">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612457035"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457035">10</xref></sup> that may participate in the homing and inducing differentiation of VSELs. Then, if these cells are mobilized at the wrong time and migrate to the wrong place, they may contribute to the development of several pathologies, including tumor formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612457035">11</xref></sup> In addition, the SCs with features similar to those of ESCs have been derived from testicular cells in mouse and human.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612457035">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adult SCs are undifferentiated cells existing in the differentiated cells, tissues, and organs of the body, and have the characteristics of self-renewal and differentiating into multiple types all of specialized cells of the body. During differentiation, certain genes become activated, and other genes become inactivated in an intricately regulated fashion. As a result, the differentiated cells develop into specific structures and perform certain functions. Some local adult SCs are differentiated to supply new cells that effectively replace senescent ones or those undergoing apoptosis such as epidermal SCs differentiated and developed into several layers of epidermis in maintaining the normal metabolic condition of our skin. In some injuries such as second-degree burns, some local adult SCs can be differentiated with speed and then proliferated and migrated with still healthy terminated cells to replace the damaged tissue cells in the microenvironment of chemoattractants that may be expressed and secreted by damaged tissue cells and/or healthy cells and restore the damaged tissue to the normal condition. The SCs (including VSELs?) in the BM could be employed as precursors for other SCs necessary for regeneration of various damaged solid tissue cells because there are no healthy tissue cells and structures and even adult SCs in a local area such as in severe burns or third-degree burns. Some studies have shown that many fibroblasts are derived from the blood-delivered cells harvested from the BM in the early stage of granulation of the repairing process in the local severe wound surfaces area. But we are still unclear about the total biological activities or “life style” of the adult SCs.</p>
<p>Recently, the stem cell niche, the hypothesis first proposed by Schofield,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612457035">13</xref></sup> has become the one of the focus areas in SC research, which suggests that SCs are maintained in an environment or microenvironment that prevents their differentiation in several tissues such as the limbal SC niche.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612457035">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612457035">15</xref></sup> Other most important evidence supporting this specific region is that adult SCs are regulated by their niche, that is, a special microenvironment to maintain the adult-specific SCs in an undifferentiated state and regulate their function, consisting of other cellular and extracellular components in the vicinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612457035">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612457035"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612457035">18</xref></sup> Therefore, microenvironmental factors may synergistically act to regulate SCs’ differentiation and nondifferentiation, which include gene expression, cell–cell contacts, cell–matrix interactions, and so on. The niche and surrounding cells may provide a sheltering environment that shields SCs from stimuli that may adversely promote differentiation and apoptosis, threatening SC reserves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612457035">17</xref></sup> In the niche, SCs undergo not only self-renewal but also differentiating processes if the niche or microenvironment gets stimulating signals from outside the niche and then the niche is modified in order to ensure that SC activity parallels the organism’s needs for particular differentiated cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612457035">19</xref></sup> But we are still unclear as to what kinds of signals and the total ways of signal reaction routes that made the SCs undifferentiated or differentiated and how the niche or microenvironment changes fit the biological activities of the SCs. In addition, if the adult SCs are differentiated and/or differentiated cells proliferate and migrate in an improper microenvironment such as defection or without the niche such as “dermal template,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734612457035">20</xref></sup> inordinate repairing will occur, for example, scar formation.</p>
<p>Some investigators have used one of the adult stem cells such as bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as the source of cells seeded onto various scaffolds such as denuded human amniotic membrane (AM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612457035">21</xref></sup> because the BMSCs have been considered a suitable source of cells for transplant, which can be easily and reproducibly isolated from BM aspirates, expanded efficiently in culture, and reintroduced into patients as autografts without serious ethical and technical problems. AM is the innermost layer of fetal membranes, which consists of a single layer of epithelial cells that are attached to a thick basement membrane and an avascular stromal matrix. It not only has been used in a range of surgical procedures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612457035">22</xref></sup> such as skinequivalent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612457035">23</xref></sup> and vaginal reconstructive surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734612457035">24</xref></sup> but it also has been used for human embryonic SC differentiation into neural cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734612457035">25</xref></sup> as well as for supporting chondrocyte proliferation and phenotype maintenance in vitro and the regeneration of osteochondral defect in rabbits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734612457035">26</xref></sup> Other results indicate that the epithelial outgrowth of the limbal explant on AM assumes a phenotype similar to the in vivo limbal epithelium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612457035">27</xref></sup> while the cells tend to differentiate more on collagen. In addition, the amnion-derived cellular cytokine solution can increase the migration of macrophages, the crucial cells in the wound repairing, as compared with controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612457035">28</xref></sup> So the bio-scaffold with appropriate 3-dimensional structure, for example, niche or “dermal template,” and the component of niche or “dermal template,” such as collagen of extracellular matrix, may have a special influence on SC differentiated and undifferentiated or “homing” SC inserted in and differentiated to create a functional tissue or even organ. Nevertheless, it is a pity that we still cannot create the functional scaffold that has the characteristic of the natural microenvironment of our body, because the natural characteristic has been changed in the process of creating the bio-artificial scaffold, for example, the natural 3-dimensional structure and the component have been modified in the process of making acellular dermal matrix and so on. Therefore, the natural microenvironment and its function have been modified in these scaffolds. The mechanism of the modification is still unknown.</p>
<p>In summary, are there any residual undifferentiated ESCs remaining in the adult body? If they exist in our adult body, where are they and when do they create the biological characteristics? VSELs are the only residual undifferentiated ESCs in the adult body, aren’t they? What is the microenvironment or what is the structure and what are the components of niche that is one of the conditions that decides the SC being differentiated or undifferentiated? What is the typical local microenvironment that can “home” and differentiate the stem cells? How can we create “the typical local microenvironment” that is suitable for SC “homing” and differentiation? All of these are the challenges in the SC research and repairing and regeneration medicine!</p>
