<p>This second issue of Volume 18 highlights diversity in the topics, settings and approaches of contemporary accounting history scholarship. Also evident is the international profile of the journal, with contributors to this issue spread throughout the globe: Australia, Belgium, Scotland, South Africa and the USA.</p>
<p>In the lead article, Thomas Lee addresses accountants’ ongoing anxiety about their “professional” status and the origins of that status. In particular, Lee pursues two key themes which shed light on the origins of that anxiety: double-entry bookkeeping and accountancy professionalization. The former is depicted as falling within the domain of public knowledge, in spite of accountants traditionally claiming it to be the cognitive foundation of their occupation. This lack of a distinctive and exclusive knowledge base explains the protracted and often difficult journey towards professional status for accountants. Manifestations of these circumstances are evident in an uneasy relationship between the accountancy profession and the state, the lack of a coherent and consistent theory to underpin practice, and a gap between the interests of accounting researchers and the needs and concerns of accounting practitioners and standard setters.</p>
<p>The professionalization theme continues in the contribution by Verhoef, but within the specific setting of South Africa. This article adds to the growing literature documenting the emergence of national accounting professions – a literature that often has common themes, but which has also highlighted peculiarities that are attributable to distinctive local factors. In the case of South Africa, moves during the late nineteenth century to exploit the region’s rich diamond and gold reserves provided the impetus for local accountants to organize, protect and promote their profession. However, a complex interplay of forces meant that a comprehensive system of professional regulation and registration of public accountants and auditors did not occur until the passing of legislation in 1951.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century Australia is the setting for the study by Bunn and Gilchrist, who focus on the rudiments of public sector audit in the Swan River Colony during the period from 1828 to 1835. While a lack of audit independence from the executive arm of government might have been expected to precipitate a mismanagement of public funds, the authors find that this was not the case. This outcome is attributed to the efficacy of the financial management systems in operation and the competence and ethicality of “a few good men” who served as senior administrators.</p>
<p>Baker provides a comprehensive analysis of administrative and accounting practices in the Byzantine Empire during the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries. At this time, the Byzantine Empire was the dominant political, economic and military power in the European world, yet it is still to attract detailed attention from accounting history scholars around the globe. As Baker demonstrates, accounting procedures were necessarily well developed in order to meet the Empire’s expansive and complex administrative needs. The notion of “governmentality” is advanced as a fruitful theoretical concept to guide the study of accounting practices within the Byzantine Empire and other ancient civilizations.</p>
<p>Nineteenth century South China is the focus of the article by Wissler, who documents his investigations of temple stelae in that region. These stone tablets – often erected at the entrance to a range of Chinese religious temples – feature a variety of commemorative inscriptions. As the author demonstrates, these inscriptions often included accounting related information, including, in some instances, financial statements. As well as their contents being of direct interest to accounting history scholars, the temple stelae testify to a period of change in Chinese society, with growing commercialisation and the acceptance of the importance of money marking the beginnings of some departure from traditional Confucian precepts. The interplay between Chinese religion and accounting development is identified as nascent but potentially fertile area of accounting history research.</p>
<p>In the final article in this issue, Doran investigates the campaign by the USA accounting profession during the early twentieth century to implement the “natural business year” as the preferred financial reporting period. That is, rather than persist with the uniform 31 December year-end – a practice that had largely been carried over from taxation law – the profession favoured companies closing their books at the end of their annual business cycle. As the author demonstrates, this campaign had significant implications for auditing techniques and the manner in which audits were staffed.</p>
