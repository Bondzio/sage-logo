<sec id="sec1-0040571X12457284"><title>Sergius Bulgakov, <bold><italic>Relics and Miracles: Two Theological Essays</italic></bold>, trans. Boris Jakim, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, MI/Cambridge, UK, 2011; 128 pp.: 9780802865311, £16.99 (pbk)</title>
<p>The indefatigable Boris Jakim has again put us in his debt with yet another translation of a couple of short papers by Bulgakov. ‘On Relics’ was written in 1918 (though not published until much later) in reaction to the systematic destruction of holy relics during the Russian Revolution: a desecration, he claimed, that ‘does not have any precedents in the history of Christianity’ (p. 1) (hardly: Henry VIII’s gauleiters caused much havoc and grief in the 1530s in England!). Bulgakov’s grief at this desecration is echoed in his sermons, where, as here, he attempts to meet the distress of his fellow Russian believers: how could these sources of sacred power have fallen victim to the fury of Soviet atheism? Bulgakov develops a theology of relics, relating it to the doctrine of deification, the sacraments and the resurrection of Christ: the destructive power of evil cannot obliterate the power of love to which the relics bear witness. ‘On the Gospel Miracles’ is a longer essay, written and published in 1932. It is of a piece with the way Bulgakov uses Scripture as the basis for his theology in the later trilogy. What is of particular interest is the way in which he sees the Gospel miracles as evidence of the restoration of perfect <italic>humanity</italic> in Christ, rather than evidence of his divinity, and also suggests that the greatest of Christ’s miracles, his resurrection, ushers in the period of the Church, which too will be a time of miracles, the ‘greater things’ of John 14.12.</p>

<p>Personal experience drives these very different books on Christian mortality. Catalysed by his younger brother’s death and the atmosphere of Rome’s Pontifical Gregorian University, Novello’s original dissertation, rooted in the notion of ‘my death as the gift of dying into the death of Christ’, is transformed into book chapters covering ‘The Conquest of Death by Jesus Christ: Real Time for Real Living’, ‘The Proper Role of the Holy Spirit: Ecstatic Gift of Divine Communion’, ‘The Positive Character of My Death as Assumed by Christ’s Death’ and the crucial Chapter 4, ‘Death as Sharing in the Admirable Exchange of Natures in the Person of Jesus Christ’, which leads to the Conclusion where we are ‘Liberated for Total Commitment to the Here and Now’. This exercise in contemporary theology adds Barth, Bonhoeffer, Tillich and Moltmann to classical Catholic scholarship, with the once isolated spirituality of Teilhard de Chardin’s mystical view of love’s cosmic evolution shedding its influence from the wings. Novello stresses his Catholicity while finding traditional elements wanting in funeral liturgy, purgatory and the sense that the living can help the dead in their post mortem status. For him, ‘what takes place in the event of death as a dying into the Lord Jesus Christ is a new embodiment of the whole person by the creative power of the Spirit as the possibility of God’ (p. 109). My death passes immediately into resurrection in Christ, an idea approached through the longstanding theological notion of exchange of attributes (<italic>communicatio idiomatum</italic>). I die into Christ’s death and am ‘resurrected’ into Christ’s life: in our death we receive ‘the gift of “admirable exchange” of natures in the person of Christ’ (p. 70). A strong universalist sympathy argues for God’s grace in salvation and not for human volition in an act of decision over belief. This offsets any religious sense of ‘elitism’ and counteracts ‘the alarming growth’ of fundamentalisms deploying the ‘apocalyptic language of hell’ (p. 225). The dense systematic-theological writing makes this study valuable for technical theologies of death but it is the very brief concluding section on ministering to the dying (pp. 227–31) that many may find appealing. It covers the fear and judgement involved in having to decide for or against God before death which may ignore divine love; the dead being in some void awaiting a final resurrection but leaving relatives to ponder the deceased’s uncertain future; and purgatorial cleansing that ‘could undermine a sense of true joy for the deceased who die in Christ’. His preference for ‘belief in resurrection at death’ has the dead passing immediately into the ‘glory of the risen life’. Though noting how Vatican II wishes funeral rites to express ‘the paschal mystery of Christ’, he thinks that, too, may still ‘make sense only from the earlier view of an immortal soul in the interim state that awaits the general resurrection of the dead at the end of time’ (p. 228). The supplications of the funeral congregation to placate a harsh judge are misplaced. Some readers may find novelty in his idea of the living helping the deceased, not in their other-worldly position but in this-worldly reparation for the wrongs and sins they have left behind them.</p>
<p>In Verhey we enter a different theological world of a Protestant awakened to issues of death and to the poverty of death-awareness in much American religion: ‘Dying well in America is hard work, and American Christianity has not helped much’. Frustration takes him to the Bible and to the skills of dying (<italic>ars moriendi</italic>) of later medieval Christianity, including the illustrated text <italic>Crafte and Knowledge For to Dye Well.</italic> This potent combination highlights the fact that ‘Christians have a story that can nurture and sustain both faith and faithfulness in the face of death’ (p. 259). The ensuing mixed-materials book begins with the familiar material of historian Philippe Ariès, anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer and psychologist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, though the absence of established criticism of her stage-theory of grief will disadvantage uninformed readers (<italic>pace</italic> p. 71). The positive value of medicine is contrasted with the negative over-medicalization of death in a rapid ideological sketch from Hippocrates to Francis Bacon to contemporary issues of ‘natural death’ and the hospice movement. Verhey’s commitments and worries now drive a book that attempts too much. He dislikes the emergence of ‘generic spirituality’ (p. 64) and ideas of death as ‘natural’ (p. 71). He would probably be astonished at the recent rise of ‘spirituality’ as a National Health Service concern in the UK, and by the emergent Natural (Woodland) Burial movement. He discusses contemporary <italic>ars moriendi</italic> in the paradigmatic life and death of Jesus and in membership of Christian communities while assuring us that this is no ‘self-help’ book on dying well (p. 174). A chapter on resurrection offers some biblical-textual analysis of relevant texts. Though the post-mortem intermediate state arouses curiosity we know little of it. Karl Barth’s immediate post-death resurrection ‘out of time’ is rejected for a rather traditional Protestant ‘sleep’ model (p. 206) with Jesus’ words ‘today you will be with me in paradise’ described as a promissory note (p. 240). Throughout, the notion of discrete souls is rejected, as became customary in recent Protestant theology (p. 209). Concerning Christ’s passion, Gethsemane is poorly treated but Verhey is better on Christ’s ‘why hast thou forsaken me?’ seeing value in the role of lament when pondering our death and in funeral services (p. 231). We can hardly contradict the advice that ‘to die well and faithfully is not to take grudges to the grave … it is to forgive’ (p. 235). He is also strong on virtues for dying well, namely, faith, hope, love, patience, humility, letting go/serenity/ generosity, courage. He has a strong sense of the Church as a worshipping and caring community but wishes for the occasional class on mortality and resurrection to encourage a pondering of death and advance directives (pp. 356–7). Verhey wants ‘the occasion of our dying to be a time for the definitive disclosure of our Christian identity’ (p. 225: repeated on p. 250 either as a cut-and-paste error or for emphatic reiteration). I am left wondering whether he offers his own form of believer’s control over death, and whether beliefs may afford their own death denial?</p>

<sec id="sec4-0040571X12457284"><title>Dominic Robinson, <bold><italic>Understanding the ‘Imago Dei’: The Thought of Barth, von Balthasar and Moltmann</italic></bold>, Ashgate: Farnham, 2011; 192 pp.: 9780754667704, £50.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Dominic Robinson, Lecturer in Dogmatic Theology at Heythrop College in London, engages in a thorough investigation into the development of the doctrine of the <italic>imago dei</italic> in the twentieth century through the works of three seminal thinkers: Karl Barth, Hans Urs von Balthasar and Jürgen Moltmann. The book opens with an extensive introductory chapter which elucidates the broader historical trajectories of the doctrine as initially expressed in the biblical materials, through patristic, medieval and finally with conciliar and post-conciliar materials.</p>
<p>Robinson proceeds to the primary task of examining the specific contributions of Karl Barth to the doctrine of the <italic>imago dei</italic>. In particular, Barth’s recovery of a christological locus for the doctrine was paramount for the theologies of the divine image which would develop later in the century. In particular, Barth’s reading of Augustine’s theology of sin and justification displays the Protestant trajectory of what Robinson calls a ‘sombre view’ of humanity. The author is appreciative of Barth’s emphasis on Christology and, in particular, what Robinson calls the ‘descendant’ view which emphasizes Christ’s salvific descent to aid fallen humanity. What is missing, for Robinson, is the ‘ascendant’ pole which provides an account of humanity’s longing and journeying toward God. This pole is found in Balthasar’s development of the doctrine.</p>
<p>Balthasar’s aesthetic and dramatic accounts are seen as at once deeply influenced by Barth and as offering a corrective to Barth through affirming the ascendant pole in addition to the descendant pole in a christological rendering of the divine image. Robinson insightfully notes that the ‘central truth which we might say captures what Balthasar believes is at the core of the God-human dynamic in Christ, [is] namely the mystery of infinite and finite love [being] played out in the drama of finite and infinite freedom’ (p. 85). In maintaining both the descendant and ascendant poles of the prevenient divine love and the human capacity to journey toward God, Robinson is affirmative of Balthasar’s contribution and sees this as the most helpful way forward in future theological discussions.</p>
<p>Robinson’s account of Moltmann is more minimal but illustrates where theology has attempted to move forward with the teaching of the <italic>imago dei</italic> in the latter portions of the last century. Robinson is positive of Moltmann’s desire to cast the doctrine with a keen eye to the reality of human suffering and a desire for justice, but is deeply concerned with what he sees as Moltmann’s conflation of divine and human realities so that, on Robinson’s reading, a distinction between the divine and the human becomes imperceptible. One potential shortcoming of the book is that its author does not engage with discussions of the secondary literature which might be divergent from his own reading of each of the major figures he is in dialogue with, which can give his renderings the appearance of a somewhat truncated view. However, Robinson’s work is an excellent example of ecumenical theology and detailed scholarship occurring at the forefront of theological discussions. His work deserves to be widely read and discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0040571X12457284"><title>Kevin Hector, <bold><italic>Theology without Metaphysics: God, Language and the Spirit of Recognition</italic></bold>, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2011; 312 pp.: 9780521279703, £16.99 (pbk)</title>
<p>The context of Professor Hector’s argument is the modern rebellion against metaphysics as something to be avoided and overcome (pp. 1–2). His problem is the prevalent assumption that metaphysical theology violently ‘shoehorns objects into a predetermined framework’ (p. ix), which could never be rightly applied to God, who is beyond human categories. He disagrees, refusing to reject the topics about which theology tries to speak. Instead of taking the negative route of emphasizing what God is not, he offers a more ‘therapeutic’ way. He hopes to root ideas about God in reality, ‘by explaining that which metaphysics hopes to explain … in terms of ordinary practices and experience’ (p. 291). Is he agreeing with the logical positivists that metaphysics is nonsense, in order to enquire what can be left of the Christian faith without it? Or is he merely setting metaphysics aside, as needlessly risky and presumptuous, in order to attend to everyday Christian language?</p>
<p>An ordinary sense of ‘metaphysical’ is ‘transcending what is physical or natural’. A Christian theologian needs sooner or later, indeed sooner, to try to answer questions which rapidly become metaphysical. Is God a kind of person? Is Jesus God? What did Jesus do about sin? If ‘without metaphysics’ has to mean ‘without other-worldly doctrines’, theology would have to be reduced to an especially uplifting kind of ethics.</p>
<p>Professor Hector’s concern is to show what it means to follow Christ. He writes lucidly and must be an enlightening teacher. Expounding Schleiermacher, he characterizes the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of Christ ‘who enables one to go on in the same way as Christ’, so ‘transforming one into God’s child’ (p. 86). To be ‘conformed to Jesus’ signifies more than merely imitating him. It means that ‘his covenant faithfulness has become one’s own’ (p. 87).</p>
<p>Hector describes the Christian Church as a ‘community of attunement’. People will recognize and pass on its expressions, forming ‘a chain of recognition that stretches back to Christ himself’ (pp. 91–2). The Lord’s teaching was communicated beyond the original disciples, because ‘he recognized them as reliably able to judge what would count as following him, at which point their so following became fully their own’ (p. 89).</p>
<p>The author makes much use of the image of a trajectory linking the generations. (e.g., p. 94). This ‘going on in the same way’ becomes a kind of ‘“apostolic succession” (with a small “a”, as it were)’ (p. 93). He concludes by briefly sketching his hope ‘that by exorcising the ghost of metaphysics one may contribute to social justice’ (p. 293).</p>
<p>It does need to be explained why this long-ago teacher is ‘the truth’. By his obedience, Jesus ‘gets God right’ (p. 231) but what can be said about who Jesus is and who God is? One feels that Professor Hector has seen more than he has yet enabled his readers to see. There could be a more theological discussion of the substance of Christian faith which is trying to get out. Meanwhile a mountain has brought forth a logical and lively mouse.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0040571X12457284"><title>Steven A. Long, <bold><italic>Analogia Entis: On the Analogy of Being, Metaphysics, and the Act of Faith</italic></bold>, University of Notre Dame Press: Notre Dame, 2011; 160 pp.: 9780268034122, $28.00 (pbk)</title>
<p>The basic question Long addresses is how we can speak intelligibly about God, who is infinite, if our words are drawn from finite reality. The answer is by analogy. But by what kind of analogy? There are three candidates. The first is analogy of attribution, in which a predicate is attributed to several things even though it properly belongs to one. We call exercise healthy because it causes health and urine healthy because it indicates health, but, strictly speaking, only a body can be healthy. The second type is analogy by proportion, in which the ratio between two pairs of comparisons is identical. Three is to six as four is to eight, since in each pair the relation of the first number to the second is one-half. The third is analogy by proper proportionality, in which no determined relation of analogates is implied. As light is to the eye, so truth is to the mind. Neither is light truth nor the eye the mind, even though there is something similar about the relation between the members of each pair. Light illuminates sight as truth illuminates the mind. Yet the illumination in the first pair is not identical to the illumination in the second. Illumination applies to the two cases proportionately.</p>
<p>This kind of analogy allows us to speak about God. Yet Long’s more fundamental point is that this type of analogy is precisely the kind that allows us to speak about ‘being’. Underlying the multiplicity of being is the primary division of act and potency. As the frog is to its act of being, so the angel is to its act of being, even though a frog is not an angel, and the frog’s act of being is not the angel’s. Nonetheless, just as the being of the frog makes its essence exist, so the being of the angel makes its essence exist. In both cases, being, as act, makes its corresponding potency to be.</p>
<p>Applied to God, the analogy of proportionality prevents us from falling into univocity and equivocity. Because there is no potentiality in God insofar as he is pure act, we cannot predicate ‘being’ to him and to creatures univocally. Neither can we predicate ‘being’ to him and to creatures equivocally, for creatures resemble, albeit imperfectly, the being of their creator: in short, ‘the creature stands to the things which are its own as God does to those that belong to Him’ (p. 95).</p>
<p>Long spends the rest of the book replying to objections against this foundational notion of analogy, showing that it safeguards the act of faith and underlies Aquinas’s doctrine of <italic>separatio</italic> and <italic>abstractio</italic>. As the book goes on it is progressively geared toward specialists. Long readily admits that only those with a prior training in metaphysics and a familiarity with its terms will benefit fully from the book. Nevertheless, anyone with the patience to read it slowly and ponder the issues deeply has something to gain. For Thomists, it is indispensible.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0040571X12457284"><title>Mark A. Noll, <bold><italic>Jesus Christ and the Life of the Mind</italic></bold>, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, MI/ Cambridge, UK, 2011; 208 pp.: 9780802866370, £16.99/$25.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Mark Noll’s latest book is remarkable. Revisiting the territory of <italic>Scandal of the Evangelical Mind</italic> (1994), this short volume is a measured, persuasive and passionate case for intellectual enquiry rooted in a Christology that draws as deeply on patristic and catholic thinking as it does on protestant evangelicalism. Noll’s agenda, stated in the introduction, is this: ‘that coming to know Christ provides the most basic possible motive for pursuing the tasks of human learning’ (p. ix), and his audience is, first, fellow evangelicals then ‘Catholic, Orthodox, other kinds of Protestants, and representatives of the world’s proliferating indigenous churches’, and finally ‘nonbelievers and believers adhering to other faiths’ (p. x).</p>
<p>If such an agenda and audience seem unlikely under the label ‘evangelical’, Noll quickly convinced this anglo-catholic reader that his endeavour is both credible and worthwhile. Chapter 1 focuses on the common inheritance of the creeds as foundational documents of christological understanding, and could stand alone as an essay on creedal Christology. Chapters 2, ‘Jesus Christ: Motives for Serious Learning’, and 3, ‘Jesus Christ: Guidance for Serious Learning’, form the core of the book, building a Christ-centred, biblically coherent case for theological scholarship as an imperative arising from the reality of incarnation.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter moves the focus from principle to practice, acting as an introduction to the second part of the book. In the light of an understanding of atonement, Noll seeks to ‘consider how the study of history, science, and the Bible itself might be undertaken under a Christological canopy’ (p. 65). Here, he offers a justification for re-evaluation of some evangelical sacred cows in the light of the christological imperative to engage with the reality of the created world. In Chapter 5, he situates historical enquiry in ‘a self-consciously Christian form of chastened realism’ (p. 84), and goes on to consider ‘Providential History’ in a neat matrix which maps the History of Christianity and General History on to Special and General Revelation (pp. 88–95). Chapter 6 squares up to the creationism debate, offering justification for scientific enquiry in the ‘Come and see’ of John 1.46 (pp. 51, 116–21). Chapter 7 explores the vexed question of biblical interpretation, with reference to J. I. Packer, B. B. Warfield and a more recent (and more controversial) evangelical writer, Peter Enns.</p>
<p>A brief concluding chapter highlights Noll’s key arguments, most especially ‘confidence in the ability to gain knowledge about the world because the world was brought into being through Jesus Christ’ and ‘trust that good scholarship and faithful discipleship cannot ultimately conflict’ (p. 149). In a postscript that is addressed more particularly to the state of contemporary evangelicalism, he reviews ten ‘Hopeful Signs’ (p. 154) that evangelical theology is ‘moving in the right direction’ (p. 154).</p>
<p>Noll’s great achievement is to marry uncompromising evangelical values with whole-hearted commitment to intellectual endeavour. His writing embodies qualities the author sees as intrinsic to scholarship: ‘keyed expressly to the person and work of Christ … it will be humble, charitable, self-giving and modest’ (p. 64). Theologians and general readers, evangelical or not, will appreciate this delightful book.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0040571X12457284"><title>Helen Kraus, <bold><italic>Gender Issues in Ancient and Reformation Translations of Genesis 1—4</italic></bold>, Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2011; 256 pp.: 9780199600786, £65.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>What does the Bible have to say about women and the male–female relationship? There is no easy answer to this question as centuries of interpretive tradition and current perspectives on gender so effectively colour our reading of biblical texts. Our interpretations, as such, are not the product of unadulterated study of the Bible, but rather inherently subjective and value laden. In her work on ancient and reformation translations, Helen Kraus extends this insight about biblical interpretation to the work of translation, suggesting that variances in translations on Genesis 1—4 may reflect something of the translator's own gender bias. Insofar as this is true, Kraus surmises that Bible translations themselves have contributed to the promotion of patriarchy and inequality of gender relationships over the centuries.</p>
<p>To demonstrate her argument, Kraus examines five major translations of Genesis 1—4 – the Septuagint (3rd century <sc>bce</sc>), Jerome's Vulgate (late 4th century), Luther's German Bible (1534), the English Authorized Version (1611) and the Dutch State Translation (1619). Each translation is assessed for how faithfully it reflects the Hebrew <italic>Vorlage</italic> (the source text for translation) and for how translation choices mimic or extend the androcentricity and patriarchism of the Hebrew text. Kraus also considers the sociocultural context of each translator/translation to show in what ways prevailing attitudes about women have influenced translation decisions. To this end, she seeks to expose something of the translator’s and, subsequently, the translation’s gender bias.</p>
<p>Kraus is clearly well suited to take up this work. Her command of the languages involved in this project is impressive (Hebrew, Greek, Latin, German, English and Dutch) to say the least. Even so, while the idea of examining and comparing translations for gender bias sounds like a fruitful undertaking, the execution is much more difficult and tedious. Kraus did a wonderful job in identifying how word choices in the various translations affected the nuance and meaning of the text. It was much more difficult for her to isolate the origin of these differences and distinguish gender bias from other influences such as the limitations of the target language itself. Thus, while Kraus was able to make some interesting observations about each of the translations, she was hesitant to draw conclusions from her work. Furthermore, because not all quotations from the translation under discussion were translated into English, it was, at times, challenging to follow her discussion.</p>
<p>These difficulties aside, Kraus’s book contributes a valuable insight into the ways in which Bible translation has and continues to contribute to gender inequality. As her work indicates, translation is not an objective task but involves the translator in decisions and choices that verge on interpretation. Insofar as this is true, translations are contextual, bearing the marks of the beliefs and convictions of the translator and the culture out of which they emerge. We would do well, as readers of Scripture, to remember this.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0040571X12457284"><title>Craig S. Keener, <bold><italic>Miracles: The Credibility of the New Testament Accounts</italic></bold><italic>,</italic> 2 vols, Baker Academic: Grand Rapids, MI, 2011; 1216 pp.: 9780801039522, £32.99 (hbk)</title>
<p>In this substantial pair of volumes Craig Keener sets out to defend two principal theses in support of the credibility of the miracle stories in the Gospels and Acts. The first, which he regards as the one he is particularly concerned to establish, is that it is perfectly possible for eyewitnesses to report accounts of miracles; there is therefore no need to assume that the miracle stories in the New Testament must be later legendary developments rather than early authentic tradition. The second, which he does not regard as being so central to his argument, is that medically inexplicable healings and other seemingly impossible events do sometimes occur and that these are best understood as miracles brought about by divine action.</p>
<p>Keener begins by reviewing the ancient evidence for miracles inside and outside Christianity. He next devotes considerable energy to attacking the unquestioned acceptance of a particular Western world-view, derived from the radical Enlightenment, which rules out the possibility of miracle a priori. The two main prongs of this attack are, first, that the naturalistic world-view in question is very much a minority one and is not widely shared outside the West, or even inside the West outside the culture of sceptical academia; it therefore risks being culturally blinkered to refuse to entertain any other point of view. The second is a sharp criticism of Hume’s argument against miracles, which Keener takes to be the source of this dogmatic naturalistic view. Defenders of Hume (or people who believe Hume’s arguments can be successfully updated in the light of more recent intellectual developments) may feel that Keener hasn’t entirely done justice to all the points Hume raises, but Keener does succeed in identifying at least three serious weaknesses in Hume’s position: Hume’s failure to consider what eyewitnesses should make of miracles they see for themselves; Hume’s failure to consider the cumulative weight of multiple independent witnesses to a miracle; and the inadequacy of Hume’s concept of probability (when it comes to Hume’s key argument about weighing the extreme improbability of a miracle occurring against what Hume regards as the automatically higher probability that any report of a miracle is either mendacious or mistaken). Keener is also right, in my view, to point out the inadequacy of Hume’s definition of miracle (‘a violation of the laws of nature’ (<italic>An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,</italic> Section X, Part I. Para 90)).</p>
<p>Another part of Hume’s case that Keener vigorously attacks is Hume’s contention that there are no reliable reports of miracles (which is necessary for Hume’s case that ‘uniform experience’ is against their occurrence). Keener effectively turns this part of Hume’s case on its head by filling several chapters with accounts of miracles from around the world to show that eyewitnesses can indeed claim to have seen a miracle occur. Keener admits that not all the accounts he reports (or, in most cases, simply summarizes) are necessarily reliable, but they include a great many quite recent ones, including reports from people Keener knows personally or has interviewed and whom he thus has good reason to believe to be reliable sources. Keener’s main point here is that if so many people can report so many miracles (typically but not exclusively medically inexplicable healings) apparently in good faith, then it clearly is possible for eyewitnesses to report miracles they believe themselves to have observed, so that in turn there are no good grounds for ruling out the possibility of eyewitness reports behind the miracle stories in the Gospels and Acts.</p>
<p>From there, Keener goes on to argue that ‘supernatural causation’ (i.e. God’s special action; like Keener I have reservations about the term ‘supernatural’) is the most plausible explanation for many of these miracles, although much of this section of the argument is carried by a further battery of examples. The strongest actual argument Keener offers is that such miracles tend to occur in response to Christian prayer or in situations of Christian missionary expansion, a correlation it would be hard to explain either by chance or by the seemingly inexplicable cures in fact being due to hitherto unknown natural causes.</p>
<p>The book also contains several appendices. The first two, on ancient and modern spirit possession and exorcism, could really constitute an integral part of the book, since they are every bit as centrally relevant to the question of the miracles reported in the New Testament. The remaining three appendices are briefer and less central to the argument, but nevertheless interesting and worthwhile.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is thoroughly researched and engagingly written; the reader is left with the impression of an author who has not only thoroughly mastered his material but also has mastered a most impressive range of material. There are some aspects of his argument one might wish to question. For example, it would be interesting to know whether the evidence that apparently supports the workings of the Christian God behind the miracles reported could be vitiated by sample bias; that is, could scholars writing from different religious traditions find equal support for miracles as evidence of their beliefs? Also, there is a danger that the very impressiveness of the large number of miracles Keener describes threatens to reduce the biblical miracles to comparative insignificance. There are several other points on which this reader would ideally like to engage the arguments presented if he had the space to do so, but the fact that there are points of detail other scholars might like to question or debate is by no means a negative criticism of Keener’s work, and should instead be taken as an indication of the book’s success in stimulating thought and challenging assumptions. The book certainly succeeds in its main aim of demonstrating that eyewitnesses can report miracles, and it certainly deserves to be read by anyone interested in the questions it raises.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0040571X12457284"><title>John Capgrave, <bold><italic>The Life of Saint Katherine of Alexandria</italic></bold>, trans. Karen A. Winstead, University of Notre Dame Press: Notre Dame, IN, 2011; 224 pp.: 9780268044268, $25.00 (pbk)</title>
<p>Capgrave’s <italic>Life of Saint Katherine</italic> is a remarkably entertaining work, written in Middle English in rhyme royal and here translated into lively prose which well conveys the humour, romance and seriousness of the original. The subject is a legendary martyr saint whose cult became hugely popular in medieval Europe. She was believed to have lived in the fourth century, the daughter of a nobleman who became ruler of Alexandria. An ardent scholar of philosophy, Katherine converted to Christianity and was subsequently persecuted by the emperor Maxentius. In the course of her trial she defeated fifty pagan scholars in philosophical debate, as a result of which she was condemned to be tortured to death between spoked wheels (the Katherine wheel). In the course of her execution the horrible device broke down and she had to be beheaded instead. Revered as a bride of Christ, Katherine became the patron saint of young girls, students, nurses, scholars and wheelwrights.</p>
<p>John Capgrave, an Augustinian friar, had already experimented with hagiography, but in this work he produces a stirring narrative set in an exotic ancient world and yet reflecting the spiritual and political concerns of the mid-fifteenth century. Katherine’s journey to sainthood takes place against a backdrop of political instability and the shadow of oppression. It also reflects a fascination with female intelligence, suffering and heroism. There are other legendary females saints who caught the popular imagination, Saint Barbara, for example, whose life was the subject of a parallel work by Capgrave’s contemporary Osbert Bokenham, or the famed, but probably non-existent, Margaret of Antioch. But Katherine’s cult was extraordinarily successful and widespread, probably because its vividness was an inspiration to artists.</p>
<p>Karen Winstead’s translation is scholarly and sure-footed with just enough in the way of a literary introduction and footnotes to inform the reader. The modern English is graceful in the way it delineates the somewhat rambling plot, retaining the conversational and even intimate style of the original. It is so effective that this reader at least was surprised that it was the first modern English translation. It is a delight to read and ponder, not least because it opens up still unresolved questions about the place of female intelligence in a theocratic world. It has been a theme of French literary criticism that women ‘are good to think with’, that the narrative of the sole woman in victorious debate with male scholarship has intrigued the mind from antiquity to the present day. Katherine, as portrayed here, certainly knew the conflict between duty and desire and her extreme choice of marriage to Christ brought her both a magnificent death and a martyr’s crown. However far contemporary women may be from ever having to confront such choices, Capgrave’s <italic>Life of St Katherine</italic>, in this most effective translation, reminds us that the equality of women in the world of religious thought is not yet so secure that it can be taken for granted.</p>

<p>In <italic>Sacred Violence</italic> Brent Shaw continues his career-long exploration of Roman North Africa in late antiquity. This most recent tome turns to the theme of violence in fourth- and fifth-century North Africa between Catholics and Donatists. Having defined <italic>violence</italic> to also include speech and writing, Shaw takes on an ambitious amount of material, which he systematically engages and organizes into chapters exploring violence as it relates to pre-Christian rituals in North Africa, pagan traditions among the upper-class Christian population, the Jews, the term <italic>heresy</italic>, the clergy, sermons, music and the state. Shaw’s point of departure is his thematic and geographic focus, distinguishing his work from others such as Frend’s survey of Donatism (<italic>The Donatist Church</italic>, Clarendon Press, 1952) and Tilley’s exploration of Donatist exegetical method (<italic>The Bible in Christian North Africa</italic>, Fortress Press, 1997). Although similar in methodology, the work’s length, depth and focus upon a particular theme rather than Augustine himself distinguish it from others such as that of Peter Brown on Augustine’s attitude towards religious coercion (<italic>Religion and Society in the Age of Saint Augustine</italic>, Harper &amp; Row, 1972).</p>
<p>One of Shaw’s main arguments is that North Africa was less violent than other parts of the Empire, other than for sporadic instances when state involvement exacerbated sectarian violence. To support this Shaw provides a plenitude of primary evidence, which is the strength of the book. Shaw provides excellent translations of Latin texts, many of which are either much needed updates or appearing in English for the first time, and also masterfully attends to issues related to textual traditions and linguistics, such as his handling of the tradition of the Abitinian martyrs (pp. 573–80) and his exploration of the word <italic>circumcellion</italic> (pp. 633–8).</p>
<p>While exhibiting a command of historical evidence, the work evinces a lack of theological and philosophical nuance. For example, while socio-historical angles, such as violence in traditional North African festivals, are thoroughly explored, the opinions on violence within Platonism and Stoicism, the two most influential philosophical schools of that era, are not considered. Furthermore, throughout the work this lack of nuance manifests itself in a one-dimensional philosophical anthropology that is applied to human intentionality. For example, throughout the work Shaw consistently questions the Augustinian witness (his predominant source) because it was written in the midst of a polemical debate. At one point, Shaw pejoratively refers to a dossier prepared by Augustine as a ‘skein of rhetorical claims’ (p. 243). To be sure, rhetoric is often an essential element to polemic, but Shaw never seems to consider the degree to which polemical texts still reflect reality. Rather, he consistently works from a paradigm where every action is interpreted as driven by the desire to acquire or maintain power. Examples of this include his interpretation of the Catholic motivation to protect Maximianus (p. 340), the motivation behind the actions of local priests (pp. 373–4), Augustine’s mention of the ‘almost attack’ by the Circumcellions in his <italic>Enchiridion</italic> (pp. 523–4), and Augustine’s reason for arguing against Pelagius (pp. 312–13). In this last example, Shaw briefly argues that Augustine was somewhat ‘complicit’ in ‘creating’ Pelagianism as an attempt to achieve relevance throughout the empire (pp. 312–13). Such a contention should include discussion of other possibilities, as well the implications for understanding Augustine’s theology.</p>
<p>Although many of his arguments lack the nuance necessary to recognize the complexity of human intentionality, Shaw’s work is a monumental step forward in our understanding of sectarian violence in Augustine’s North Africa. It is most useful as an aid to better understand the underlying socio-historical world as it related to sectarian violence. The study would have benefited from interaction with other works that analyse such issues with philosophical and theological lenses, but overall <italic>Sacred Violence</italic> offers great value in the many translations that it contains and the incredible amount of primary evidence with which Shaw interacts. The work is best suited for those who already hold a foundational knowledge of Christianity in the fourth and fifth centuries and are interested in Augustine, Donatism, the history of religious views of violence, or the translation and transmission of early Christian documents.</p>

<p>In the twentieth century British missionaries played a political role in the decolonization of Africa, the continent where, arguably, mission work had its greatest impact. During widespread Christianization on the continent, Christianity was enabling Africans to challenge Western imperialism and critique its governance while missionaries prayed for greater self-determination for Africans. Yet missionaries’ concern with a smooth transition from mission to autonomous Church, with African nationalism, urbanism and the spectre of communism did not always permit them to act as confidently or collectively as they may have liked. This book examines the apparent contradictions between hope for a better future for Africans and caution in encouraging the changes Africans were working towards.</p>
<p>John Stuart analyses a number of significant political issues including the ‘colour bar’ in South Africa, the banishment of Seretse Khama after his marriage to Ruth Williams, the creation of a Central African Federation and the Mau Mau crisis in Kenya. He deftly untangles the complex negotiations of a number of Protestant missionary societies, their spokespeople, supporters and detractors over a period of twenty-five years leading to independent rule for much of the continent. He explains the criss-cross of institutional networks and the connections between movements of advocacy, often influenced by personal relations, and demonstrates the influence of policies and expectations in the metropole and in the colonies. He notes historical ironies like that of the developing commitment to ‘partnership’ emerging from the International Missionary Council at Whitby in 1947, whose ideological premises encouraged missionaries to support the Central African Federation even when the majority of Africans rejected it. Missionary focus on Christian internationalism and ideals of multi-racial unity and harmony caused misunderstandings with Africans who feared white dominance like that in South Africa.</p>
<p>‘Ambiguity’ is a word Stuart uses frequently to explain a lack of consensus or co-ordination, or a preference for working behind the scenes for change rather than publically criticizing government, or support for moderate nationalists but deep fear of radicals. He stresses the differences between LMS, Quakers and CMS, between Scottish and English approaches, between outspoken critics like Michael Scott and George McLeod, and those advocating steady change like Max Warren. His investigation is thorough and his portrayal sympathetic to individuals attempting to respond to rapidly changing events. Stuart concludes at a time of transition for mission agencies when numbers declined and aid agencies developed a role in Africa. He considers that, ultimately, missionaries did not adapt well to changing circumstances and few acted in changes of which they were broadly supportive. This book ably uses missionary and colonial archives to comprehend missionary politics but while it mentions relations between missionaries and key African figures in the struggles for independence it does not focus upon them – a study which would greatly complement the present volume.</p>

<p>In <italic>The Missional Church in Perspective</italic>, Craig Van Gelder and Dwight Zscheile, both well qualified in practice and academic knowledge, speak with theological depth and clarity on the important topic of what it means to be a missional church in the twenty-first century. Their purpose in writing this book was to advance the lively and relevant conversation around mission occurring in the Church today. So often this conversation is engaged because of the anxiety experienced in the Church to survive decline, to grow or to be productive in particular ways, encouraging an emphasis on human responsibility and effort. While growth is good, those of us involved in the conversation have sometimes become so consumed with the goal that we have failed to reflect adequately on why we do what we do, and the God who invites us into a common life that is itself missional. Mission can, therefore, be viewed as a programme, a part of church life rather than the whole of it.</p>
<p>Van Gelder and Zscheile carefully map the historical progression of how mission in the Church has been understood, defined and lived out, as well as the impact of the various understandings on congregational life and ecclesiology. Moving the conversation of mission to a more grounded theological level, the authors draw on the Eastern understanding of the Trinity, which has experienced a revival in the West, in order to clarify what it means to be a missional church – as opposed to a church with a mission. God’s desire to draw God-self into closer relationship with humanity through the incarnation of God in Christ means that we are brought – through his life, death and resurrection – into the indwelling, communal life of the Trinity itself, and therefore, its life and mission. We then join God in bringing about a particular future where Christ’s promises are fulfilled. This model, they argue, helps us understand the Church as in communion with the Triune God in a way that is participatory, dynamic, open and relational. We are, as the Church, then, able to understand ourselves as missional in our very essence – just as God is.</p>
<p>In addition to their careful review of the history of mission and theological development, the authors encourage congregations in a process of renewal and examination of both theological and structural life, in the light of this integrated and holistic understanding of missional ecclesiology. The inward focus so prevalent in congregations of ‘doing’ mission programmatically may be transformed into a self-understanding that this is the core of the Church’s identity; in every way knowing itself as missional.</p>
<p>This book is essential reading for congregational clergy and lay leaders discerning missional identity, as well as denominational leaders considering structural changes in hope of organizing their institution for a more generative and prolific missional reality.</p>

<p>This book follows Yong’s earlier examination of theology and disability in his 2007 book <italic>Theology and Down Syndrome: Reimagining Disability in Late Modernity</italic>. However, Yong notes that it differs in two major ways: first, while the earlier book was aimed squarely at academic theologians and religionists, the new volume is suitable for a broader lay audience (and includes study questions to facilitate its use in church or other group sessions). Second, while the first book reflected Yong’s systematic theological interests, this one engages specifically with biblical texts. Yong aims to explore how the <italic>whole</italic> Bible might speak to disability, and how the phenomenon of disability might impact on how the Bible in its entirety is read and interpreted (a ‘disability hermeneutic’).</p>
<p>Unlike John M. Hull, who believes that the Bible inevitably represents able bias because it was produced by (and, implicitly, for) able people, Yong suggests that the problem lies in interpretation. Stigmatizing and marginalizing readings of the Bible, which have excluded and oppressed people with disabilities, require ‘correction’ in the light of Jesus (p. 14). Rather than focusing solely on isolated ‘disability texts’, Yong follows biblical characters (Jacob, Mephibosheth, Job) who might be deemed disabled, and draws on tropes such as lamentation in formulating suggested corporate responses to social injustice.</p>
<p>Yong’s brief but helpful overview of the concepts of ableism and normate bias points to his conviction that disability is, in large part, socially constructed. He resists simplistic ‘all’s well that ends well’ theodicies in which disability will be erased in the eschaton, noting (in an echo of Frances Young) that disabilities – such as those stemming from chromosomal variations – which seem ‘built in’ to those involved or otherwise constitutive of identity could surely not be removed ‘without eliminating the person entirely’ (p. 38). Indeed, life after death, as constructed non-normatively, will still contain impairment: not only Jesus ‘but all those who are resurrected in his train’ (p. 130) will still carry their marks. Disabilities will be redeemed, not eradicated (p. 132).</p>
<p>At the same time, however, Yong insists that resurrection bodies will be discontinuous as well as continuous with earthly ones. As a result, he concludes mysteriously, impairments will be <italic>present</italic> but not necessarily <italic>felt</italic>, ‘because the social shame and disapprobation attached to disability have been exposed and exorcised from the redeemed community of faith in the life to come’ (p. 135).</p>
<p>Yong just teeters on the precipice of failing adequately to explore the problems of pain and suffering caused by impairments themselves rather than social responses to them. His insistence that disability is a problem for whole societies and churches, not just impaired individuals and their carers, is persuasive but sometimes leaves too little space for acknowledging the specific difficulties of impaired life (though Yong’s portrait of his brother Mark, who has Down’s syndrome, goes a long way to remedying this). Nonetheless, the book represents a solid and accessible contribution to debates in disability, theology and the Bible, and provides an introduction to other scholarly literature in the field for readers who would like to go further.</p>

<p>In the various essays in <italic>Transforming Exclusion</italic>, unjust ideas and practices that marginalize and exclude are explored and suggestions made as to how these can be transformed. The book is structured dialogically with an essay, followed by a response, and then a final comment – and, although various important issues are addressed, not to include the important issues of sexual orientation, racism and gender is surprising.</p>
<p>Postmodernism contextualizes the following discussions in Steve Knowles’s essay, ‘a zeitgeist that includes’ fragmentation, diversity and otherness (p. 1). This description may resonate but I would have preferred to begin with an exploration of Trinity and alterity, particularly because aspects of trinitarian theology are explored in many of the essays.</p>
<p>Mohammad Seddon’s suggestion that the early migration (<italic>hijrah</italic>) from Mecca to Abyssinia, where Muslims lived as integrated citizens of a Christian state, provides a way for Islam to legitimate living as a minority in predominantly non-Muslim societies. However, Seddon’s assertion that the rise in Muslim fundamentalism can be traced to the independence struggles of former colonized Muslim lands seems to ignore that Islam has always demonstrated and advocated a complex combination of both tolerant and intolerant, violent attitudes, throughout its history.</p>
<p>Tom Gregg’s essay on providence and his dialogical approach to Barth proved to be surprisingly fruitful. There were also some useful scriptural observations for positive inter-faith work. By contrast, Celia Deane-Drummond’s essay on sustainability was a reminder of the wider net of inter-connectedness with creatures. David Clough’s essay follows from this and, like Deane-Drummond, draws upon Nussbaum. Clough explores the essential ‘capabilities’ required for a dignified life which should include all other creatures.</p>
<p>Hannah Bacon’s article – a theological response to secular dieting and weight loss – reminds us that ‘Christian theology is fundamentally a theology of abundance’ (p. 110), and, although there is much good in this essay, I remained unconvinced about the notion of a corpulent God. Obesity is a pathological condition and can lead to serious health consequences such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders and some cancers. Is this really what is meant by abundance?</p>
<p>Wayne Morris explores Christian theologies of salvation in his article on disability and his challenge to the ‘tyranny of the normal’. Morris reminds us that ‘illness and disability’ and ‘disabled and non-disabled’ are not easily defined, can represent a social construction, and have been one of the ways many people have been marginalized, excluded and dehumanized. Morris states that disabled people ‘must be seen as part of God’s salvation plan’ (p. 128) and he asks what salvation might mean. This is a theology in which ‘the scandal of difference and otherness is embraced’ (p. 138).</p>
<p>The concluding essays by Dot Gosling and Richard Turner focus on the exclusion of young people. Both essayists are experienced youth workers and this strengthens their observations. Gosling’s exploration of the relevance of trinitarian theology is particularly illuminating.</p>
<p>The study of theology and religion is concerned with the transformation of unjust ideas and practices that marginalize and exclude – seeking to shape both thought and practice. This book is a great help in that process and I found both inspiration and guidance for my own work with marginalized and vulnerable communities.</p>

<p>In many parts of our world today, debate rages about the role of religion in public life, and especially on the relationship between religion and politics. This debate is often contentious and polarizing. On the one side are those who advocate the total exclusion of religion from public life and its relegation to the private sphere. Religion, for such advocates, has legitimacy in the home and sacred precinct of the temple, mosque or church, but steps out of its sphere when it becomes active in the political world. On the other side are those who wish to see all aspects of human life, private and public, conform to the teachings of a specific religious tradition. This debate is made even more complicated and difficult by the religious diversity of many nations across our world. Immigration is transforming historically homogenous communities into religiously diverse ones.</p>
<p>This debate is the context for Miroslav Wolf’s, <italic>A Public Faith.</italic> He argues wisely and humbly for a position that he labels as ‘religious political pluralism’ (p. xi). His position is a middle ground between the banishment of religion from public life and the totalitarian rule of a single religion. According to Volf, it is oppressive to exclude religious voices from the public sphere. Religions have visions of the common good and human flourishing that enrich reflection on the meaning of existence and that provide a corrective to our contemporary obsession with experiential satisfaction. Religious totalitarianism, the polar opposite of religious exclusion, according to Volf, leads to coercive and often violent measures to enforce religious obedience and to stamp our alternative ways as being religious. Admitting the many ways that Christianity has malfunctioned, past and present, Volf makes the case for a Christian faith that is ‘neither coercive nor idle’ but ‘engaged in the world in a non-coercive way – offering blessings to our endeavors, effective comfort in our failures, moral guidance in a complex world, and a framework of meaning for our lives and activities’ (p. 54).</p>
<p>Although Volf is writing as a Christian theologian for a Christian reader, the significance of his argument is not limited to Christianity. The predicament that he addresses transcends specific religions and is present, in different ways, in all the world’s religions. As a Hindu theologian, I find Volf’s religious political pluralism eminently reasonable. It requires that we reject coercion in our relationships, that we are attentive to both commonalities and differences, and that we practise a Gandhian-like ‘hermeneutical hospitality’ (p. 136) by entering sympathetically into others’ interpretation and understanding of their traditions. Most importantly, religions must foster a climate for a vigorous public debate on ‘What makes for a life worthy of being called good?’ The reader of any religion will be enriched and challenged by Volf’s constructive and self-critical reflection on his own.</p>

<p>Trevor Beeson is clearly in favour of women’s ministry, including that of the priesthood and episcopate. This book sets out to demonstrate that not only have women always been a part of the Church but also have always exercised ministry within it.</p>
<p>This is an accessible and very readable overview of the place of women in the Church throughout history. Unfortunately, because it attempts to include the entire history of the Church in fewer than three hundred pages, it necessarily lacks depth. The first thousand years of Christianity are covered in the twelve pages of the opening chapter, with Chapter 2 covering the next seven hundred years. It is also focused almost exclusively on the Anglican Church, and the Church of England in particular. This may be the result of Beeson's desire to promote the cause of women bishops in the Church of England, or simply that this is the arena with which he is most familiar, being a retired Anglican priest.</p>
<p>In chapters covering the eighteenth century onwards, the ministry and achievements of individual women are highlighted, as examples of the gifts that women bring to the Church and of wider movements happening in the Church at different periods. These stories are interesting, engaging and inspiring, and do effectively demonstrate that women have always been actively engaged in ministry, even when this was not formally acknowledged by the Church. Because the ordination of women in the Church of England is a recent development, the majority of these stories focus on lay women, and cover a variety of ‘ministries’, from nursing to hymn writing to the work of the Mothers Union, among others.</p>
<p>These stories clearly show that, throughout the history of the Church, women have been called by God and have answered that call with love, commitment and dedication, sometimes in the face of opposition from within the Church. However, if the point of the book is to convince people of the need to have women in ordained ministries, I’m afraid it may be counter-productive. What comes through in chapter after chapter is just how much can be accomplished by lay women driven by their faith to do good works (especially if they are socially and politically well connected).</p>
<p>This is a very enjoyable introduction to the history of women’s ministry. It would have benefited from more in-depth discussion at points, for example, on the impact of hymn writing on the theology of the Church of England in the ninteenth century or developments in theological thinking in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, which would give some context for measuring the impact of women’s contributions in these areas. It is, however, an excellent resource for those wanting a brief account of women’s ministries before their admission to the ordained orders and the inspiration to be gained from their stories.</p>

<p>Durham is fast becoming one of the centres for the study of forgiveness and reconciliation in the UK. Its current bishop, Justin Welby, is a former residentiary canon at Coventry Cathedral whose ministry focused on international reconciliation. Cranmer Hall is to begin teaching an MA module on forgiveness and reconciliation in 2013 and Hatfield College, a college of the University of Durham, hosts an interdepartmental, interdisciplinary forum for the study of forgiveness. Canon Stephen Cherry, a residentiary canon at Durham Cathedral, has now written a thoughtful book on forgiveness that seeks to take an honest look at some of the pastoral issues that forgiveness raises while keeping one eye firmly on some of the underlying academic questions.</p>
<p>Cherry has first degrees in psychology and theology and a doctorate that explored forgiveness. Since completing his doctorate he has been wrestling with how to think in a Christian way and so pastorally about forgiveness.</p>
<p>The book’s starting point is twofold. It was, first, being struck by the enormity of the words of absolution that he said as a priest – yet words that seemed to pass relatively unnoticed by those to whom he spoke them. Secondly, it was being confronted by not knowing what to say to the mother of a murdered boy, who asked Cherry if she had to forgive her son’s murderers. This question came after Cherry had written his doctorate and sparked his search to rethink what he knew and understood about forgiveness. So the fruit of his renewed thinking is this book that explores forgiveness after shattering hurt (‘impossible’ forgiveness).</p>
<p>Forgiveness is an enigma, Cherry says, and an agony – yet an agony that heals. As he so eloquently puts it, ‘real forgiveness … involves embracing not only the chaos out there but also the agony within [and] does have the capacity to heal’ (pp. 179–80). It is a ‘generous and <italic>creative</italic> venture of trust’ (Cherry’s italics) (p. 183).</p>
<p>We are to ‘re-imagine’ forgiveness, according to Cherry, and so he offers us not a process or a programme but what he calls a ‘diagrammatic map’ and a ‘three-phase venture’ (p. 186) that involves recovery and healing, a relationship with the perpetrator and a changed life because of the violation. An important part of becoming a forgiver is what Cherry calls ‘distasteful empathy’ (p. 186) – getting into the mind of the person who violated a victim.</p>
<p>There is nothing slick or easy about this book: Cherry appreciates the depth and complexity of forgiveness and the issues it raises and offers what he calls ‘an appropriate balance of emotional sensitivity, spiritual wisdom and intellectual rigour’ (p. 8). This is a cross-disciplinary book, blending ethical, psychological and theological concerns and so in dialogue with different ways of thinking about forgiveness. The result is a book that is wise, earthed and rich in pastoral insight and practical reflection.</p>
<p>Not everyone will agree with all that Cherry says, and there are points at which he and I diverge. Nevertheless, I cannot imagine anyone (not least those supporting someone in the aftermath of shattering hurt) who will not find Cherry’s pastoral wisdom, sharp insights and creative sensitivity helpful on a journey to re-imagine – and to practise – forgiveness. I warmly commend this book.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0040571X12457284"><title>Elaine A. Heath, <bold><italic>We Were the Least of These: Reading the Bible with Survivors of Sexual Abuse</italic></bold>, Brazos Press: Grand Rapids, MI, 2011; 208 pp.: 9781587432712, £12.00 (pbk)</title>
<p>Headlines. Lawsuits. Despicable stories of sexual misconduct by clergy. Now more than ever the Church is aware of the dangers and consequences of sexual abuse. As a result ministers are subject to background checks and denominational hierarchies worried about lawsuits have implemented safeguarding policies and training for clergy and lay workers. It seems that churches are responding to the problem of sexual abuse: after reading <italic>We Were the Least of These</italic>, however, one realizes how little churches talk about the reality of sexual abuse. How often do ministers interpret the biblical text with attention to themes of sexual violence and the consequences of abuse? Is there more that the Church ought to be doing in our ministry to come alongside those who have suffered abuse and walk with them on a journey of healing?</p>
<p>Author Elaine Heath, Professor of Evangelism at Perkins School of Theology and survivor of sexual abuse, uses a powerful narrative to describe points along her own journey toward healing. In a moment of epiphany as she read Jesus’ words in Matthew 25, ‘As you did unto the least of these …’ she was engulfed by memories of her childhood sexual abuse, but she also had a vision of Jesus there with her, being abused with her. She realized that Jesus did not love her <italic>despite</italic> her victimization. Instead, Jesus, who was himself a victim of physical and sexual abuse, suffered in solidarity with her. Heath contends that the life-giving message of the gospel for survivors of abuse is that they are ‘the least of these’ whom Jesus loves and to whom Jesus is united.</p>
<p>Although Heath carefully explains the development and use of her particular method of biblical interpretation, which is clearly informed by liberation and feminist hermeneutics, the book is not a scholarly tome on the technical aspects of biblical exegesis or hermeneutics. Instead, it serves as a guide for opening Scripture, proclamation and liturgy to those who bear the shame and scars of their abuse. Violence, physical scars, sexual dysfunction, addiction, mental illness, shame and healing are themes in biblical texts that capture the attention of survivors when ministers and teachers relate them to the reality of sexual abuse. Heath also retells the stories of people she has ‘journeyed with’ to illustrate the connection between biblical interpretation from the perspective of the least of these and the movement of survivors toward restoration and healing.</p>
<p>One disappointing aspect of the book is Heath’s treatment of forgiveness, which is a key theological theme within Christianity. Her discussion of forgiveness is related to an autobiographical account in which survivor Heath finds herself the pastor to an abuser she already knows and loves. The situation forces her not to dehumanize and shame him. Although the narrative is powerful, the chapter doesn’t have the same tone of urgency and is much less instructive than the others in the book. Perhaps the lack of emphasis is a recognition that those who journey alongside survivors should not rush to the subject of forgiveness. Indeed, it may not be possible for some survivors to pardon their abusers. Yet, one must wonder if a survivor’s healing is complete without the whole experience of receiving and granting forgiveness.</p>
<p><italic>We Were the Least of These</italic> will be useful for clergy, counsellors, lay visitors, chaplains, educators and any others who journey alongside survivors of sexual abuse. It provides numerous interpretative ideas for sermons and Bible study sessions. With discussion questions at the end of each chapter, one can imagine using the book for a small group study with survivors and those who care about them. The book also contains a plan for a five-day retreat, including outlines for thematic talks and related group activities. <italic>We Were the Least of These</italic> is a timely piece that needs to be in every minister’s collection of pastoral resources.</p>

<sec id="sec20-0040571X12457284"><title>David Dadswell, <bold><italic>Consultancy Skills for Mission and Ministry: A Handbook</italic></bold>, SCM Press: London, 2011; 224 pp.: 9780334043737, £19.99 (pbk)</title>
<p>Vocabulary is a contentious issue in the Church, with words like leadership, consultancy and organizational theory being dismissed as irrelevant management-speak by some and embraced wholeheartedly by others. Dadswell does well to recognize this early on in this very comprehensive book exploring the role of consultancy as applied to the mission and ministry of God’s Church. However, importantly, he makes no apology for the application of this discipline to church leaders and is clear that offering an appropriately professional level of support and development will not only enhance the potential mission of the Church but will also greatly assist those in ministry. His arguments are cogent and convincing.</p>
<p>Dadswell sets out clearly the wide range of facets of consultancy and contrasts it with other ‘helping’ disciplines and allied tasks. I found his separation of the process and content of consultancy, and the need for clarity, particularly helpful. Similarly, it was refreshing to hear him so forthright on a number of issues which are at the heart of his thesis. For example, when discussing vision and purpose, he states categorically that mission is not an activity of the Church but the central purpose of the Church. Later, when talking about the relationship between consultant and ‘consultor’ (his word, which I personally don’t like and find grates through the book – though I admit ‘consultee’ isn’t much better!), Dadswell points out succinctly that one of the issues at stake is that theological students are not taught how to receive consultation (and, by extension, how to use it effectively).</p>
<p>The step-by-step approach that Dadswell takes is clear, painstaking and readable; there is plenty both for the novice in the field and for those with some experience and interest who wish to go further. However, the comprehensiveness also leaves me with a slight concern that he has tried to reach too wide a selection of audiences. He has undoubted experience and wisdom in consultancy and it feels as if he doesn’t want to leave a stone unturned, so it will certainly be a useful handbook for the student of consultancy. However, for the target readership identified by the publisher’s website, ‘leaders as well as for officers in churches such as Archdeacons, Superintendents, Mission Officers, local church and regional development advisers or those involved in continuing professional development’, I suspect that there may be just too much detail. As a director of ministry I found the book really interesting and helpful, but just a bit too detailed for the busy practitioner. However, I will certainly be drawing on much of the wisdom and practical models that are offered and will be pleased to have it on my shelf as a very useful reference point and resource.</p>
<p>Trawling the book for practical wisdom, then, will pay huge dividends. The simple models offered throughout give clarity, such as Dadswell’s three types of consultancy: Expert Advice, Doctor/Diagnosis and Process Consultancy. A key message of this book is the power of clarity.</p>

<p>Pastoral care in the US is conducted differently from in the UK. One of the key features of the American scene is the prevalence of the pastoral counselling movement. McClure’s research, made known through this book, focuses on analysing the theories and practices of mainline Protestant pastoral counselling with a view to seeing how pastoral care might more effectively promote human flourishing, especially for those outside the American middle class.</p>
<p>Pastoral counselling began in the US over fifty years ago and clearly has a focus on care of the individual by individuals. The American Association of Pastoral Counselors, founded in 1963, certifies Pastoral Counselors, accredits pastoral counselling centres, and approves training programs. The counselling offered by practitioners is one-to-one, long-term therapy beyond the support a congregation or the clergy can provide, yet it acknowledges the religious and spiritual dimension of life. Pastoral counsellors and counselling centres often work in partnership with congregations and charge a standard fee for their counselling services, though adjustments are often made according to financial need.</p>
<p>Finding, from the interviews she conducted, that a liberal Protestant notion of deep-seated individualism pervades the field of pastoral counselling, McClure examined the way in which individualism has become institutionalized in pastoral care. For those whose suffering is tied up with social and cultural factors, these social and institutional realities are not only part of the problem but also, she argues, severely limit the effectiveness of help.</p>
<p>Human beings, McClure argues, need to develop as persons and be human together. Change needs to occur in theological, theoretical, practical and organizational areas of care so that engagement and social change can come to the fore as necessary expressions of pastoral care. Pastoral counsellors need to understand the social nature of selfhood and suffering. They need to reconnect with their religious roots and gain a prophetic voice. Churches too must make sure they are not complicit in oppression and recognize that care and counselling is best done by linking inner transformation with outer social reform, for ministry is not about enhancing any one individual but increasing love, justice and ecological partnership.</p>
<p>For pastoral counsellors moving beyond individualism will mean not being over dependent on talking cures which assume that a change of mind in an individual, accomplished within the therapeutic relationship alone, will bring healing. Group therapy, advocacy and action need to be prioritized with social engagement as a goal of the work, rather than personal insight. Being non-judgemental with regard to a client will need to be held alongside the ability to judge, name sin and resist systems of domination, wherever they may be.</p>
<p>For those of us nostalgic for those good old days where the vicar visited everyone, the criticisms McClure makes of the model of pastoral counselling seem obvious. Of course most people can’t pay, and culturally, in the UK, considering going to a counsellor can still be seen as weakness. In an age of austerity with cuts in services – including mental health and counselling, as well as in clergy numbers, we too might consider how effective our pastoral care is and who has no or limited access to it. McClure takes us beyond a sticking plaster approach to pastoral care, whether we are in the UK or the US, inviting us to experience involvement in the world through socially transforming engagement as a sign of health and mode of healing.</p>

<sec id="sec22-0040571X12457284"><title>Thomas G. Long, <bold><italic>What Shall We Say? Evil, Suffering, and the Crisis of Faith</italic></bold>, Eerdmans: Cambridge, 2011; 160 pp.: 9780802865144, £16.99/$25.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Although written principally for pastors, this book on the problem of suffering offers insights which will greatly benefit Christians in all spheres of life. The challenge author Thomas Long sets himself is that of offering a theodicy – a justification of God’s goodness in the face of evil and suffering – ‘that we would want to speak to a sufferer in the depths of loss and grief’ (p. 43). This is a daunting task, and all the more so for the fact that Long rejects as inadequate two of the most influential and well-known theodicies, namely, the idea that evil is ultimately traceable to free human choices and the notion that a world of good mixed with bad is necessary for human character development.</p>
<p>Via a fascinating exposition of the Parable of the Wheat and the Weeds (Matt. 13.24–30), Long’s own answer involves three affirmations: (1) God can and does bring good out of evil, but God does not intend evil in the first place; (2) God is at work battling evil, but ‘not with the power of the sword but with the “weak” power of the crucifixion’ (p. 143); (3) evil will not have the last word over its victims – when Christ returns, true and lasting justice will be done.</p>
<p>As for the origin of evil, it remains largely a mystery in Long’s theodicy, although he does subtly hint at an angelic fall (p. 136). In this sense, I am not sure that Long can be said to have solved the philosophical problem of evil, which demands an explanation of evil’s ultimate cause. But then again, Long rightly suggests that the problem is not likely to be solved if one approaches it the way an impartial spectator watches a defendant being tried in court. This may come as disappointment to those looking to this book for a knockdown argument against atheism. But in the same way that rational argument will probably never convince a firmly opposed person that God exists, nor, Long contends, will answers to the problem of evil be finally persuasive to those who do not take the reality of a loving God as their starting point. Suffering, as Long sees it, is a challenge that must be solved ‘by walking’ (<italic>solvitur ambulando</italic> (p. 115)) – not only in abstract contemplation but also on one’s knees in anguished prayer.</p>
<p>In summary, this book is thoroughly commendable for saying something powerful and pastorally helpful about what is undoubtedly the greatest challenge to Christian faith, all the while staying firmly within the limits of what Scripture offers on the subject. Quoting frequently from first-hand accounts of horrendous loss and heartache, Long faces the challenge of suffering with the utmost honesty and concern for suffer<italic>ers</italic>. In this sense he truly engages with the <italic>experiential</italic> problem of suffering and not merely the philosophical problem – debates about which can sometimes resemble a game of intellectual chess. Lastly, Long has achieved that rare thing of writing a book that is both academically rigorous and widely accessible.</p>

<sec id="sec23-0040571X12457284"><title>Gordon Lynch, <bold><italic>The Sacred in the Modern World: A Cultural Sociological Approach</italic></bold>, Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2012; 192 pp.: 9780199557011, £30.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Lynch outlines a theoretical framework for understanding the sacred in late modern societies. He positions himself firmly in an intellectual tradition from Durkheim through Shils, Bellah and, particularly, cultural sociologist Jeffrey Alexander. The sacred here is not conceived of in an ontological sense, along the lines of thinkers such as Eliade and Otto. Rather, the emphasis is upon historical, social and cultural contingency: ‘The sacred is defined by what people collectively experience as absolute, non-contingent realities which present normative claims over the meanings and conduct of social life. Sacred forms are specific, historically-contingent instances of the sacred’ (p. 29).</p>
<p>Lynch advances productively beyond Durkheim in emphasizing contingency, that groups and individuals can hold multiple sacred identifications within one society and the sacred is not necessarily socially integrative. It involves delineating the profane: that which threatens the sacred, and can lead to othering, violence, suffering and harm. There is also the category of the mundane, which has its own logics, but in which the sacred remains a latent force that can erupt into everyday life.</p>
<p>Following Alexander, Lynch sees cultural sociology as a therapeutic project. Though we cannot transcend them, critical reflection upon the cultural structures shaping social life can be beneficial. The author does not shy away from normativity. He makes explicit the value commitments often implicit in sociological research – to equality, human rights and conflict resolution/reduction – while simultaneously acknowledging his own limitations as a situated researcher.</p>
<p>The framework is then applied in two detailed case-studies. The first is of the scandal of the sustained cover-up of abuse in Catholic industrial schools in Ireland; the second of reaction to the BBC’s decision not to broadcast the DEC appeal for support for those in Gaza suffering as a result of the Israeli 2008–2009 military campaign ‘Cast Lead’. The case-studies vivify the theory and demonstrate how neither could be fully understood apart from cultural structures.</p>
<p>Political expediency is a significant factor in explaining why Ireland’s Department of Education failed to address reports of abuse or to monitor the schools satisfactorily but insufficiently. The Irish Catholic nation was the dominant sacred form and care for children a subjugated sacred form. This balance shifted with societal and cultural change from the 1960s, creating the conditions for the abuse to be exposed via the media. Public media play a central role in representing and reproducing the sacred in the modern world. The BBC covered the suffering and death of children within Gaza, offering its audience a mediated experience of the violation of the sacrality of the child, but then denied the audience its opportunity for symbolic restitution through donation.</p>
<p>This book’s focus is limited to late modern societies, which appear to be co-terminus with nation-states (with the nation being an enduringly powerful sacred form). Yet, in the final chapter Lynch concludes that the sacred ‘generates the idea of human society as a meaningful, moral collective’ (p. 128). The theory opens up opportunities for further application and analysis. For example, of transnational sacred forms, and in the conclusion the possibility of connections between the sacred as a communicative structure and scientific understanding of brain function is raised.</p>
<p>The work shines a light on how there are deeply held commitments, symbols and emotions shaping social spheres, and an absence of membership to an institutional religion does not mean amoral, value-less rationalism. Distinguishing analytically the sacred from the religious, Lynch shows that modern life is far from desacralized. He is optimistic, in this intellectually rigorous and stimulating book, about our capacity to share a civil sphere and discuss in a respectful manner our multiple sacred identifications.</p>

<sec id="sec24-0040571X12457284"><title>Hugh Nicholson, <bold><italic>Comparative Theology and the Problem of Religious Rivalry</italic></bold>, Oxford University Press: New York, 2011; 320 pp.: 9780199772865, £50.00/$74.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Nicholson’s book is one of the first critical evaluations of the discipline of comparative theology that is associated with the names of Francis Clooney, James Fredericks, James Keenan, John Berthong and others. These writers, in brief, suggest that Christian theology of religions has come to an end because of its approaching the religions without actual engagement with the religions. Such an a priori approach is rejected. Instead, they advance a method of close reading of religious texts from ‘other’ traditions alongside texts from one’s own to see how the Christian is called into question, changes their view and understanding, and in the process comes to more closely appreciate both the value of the other as genuinely different and as providing all sorts of illuminating connections and possible bridges.</p>
<p>Nicholson provides a wider narrative for contextualizing the practices of comparative theology and, in so doing, also provides a critique which could enrich rather than displace the discipline. Nicholson studied under Clooney and Clooney writes the preface to this work, although there are hints of interesting ambiguity in Clooney’s affirmation of Nicholson’s approach. What is Nicholson’s approach and what is his wider narrative? Nicholson argues three points in tandem and, while his argument is always rich and provocative, I’m not entirely sure the three strands are tied together rigorously.</p>
<p>Nicholson criticizes liberal theology’s discourse as a concession to rational Enlightenment’s search for a neutral stand point from which to survey the religions. What happens in this process is the generation of a discourse that depoliticizes religion and reifies it. Here Hick and Cantwell Smith are engagingly criticized, while Nicholson acknowledges a penchant for their concerns. Nicholson equally criticizes the response to liberal theology found in neo-liberalism and later post-liberal theology. He argues that theologians such as Lindbeck insulate each religion as some kind of incommensurable unified cultural project. This move equally depoliticizes religions. Drawing on Carl Schmitt and Kathryn Tanner’s work, Nicholson seeks to locate his approach as retrieving the political within the religious and to see that religions constantly define themselves in terms of antagonistic interaction with cultural others. He does not follow Schmitt into violent and imperialist antagonism, but highlights an important political dynamic that is too often excluded in theorizing. Thus, present depoliticized comparative theology is given another string to its bow which can make it a richer significant exercise.</p>
<p>Part II of the book provides a thorough study of Rudolf Otto’s classical comparison between the Christian Miester Eckhart and the Advaitin Hindu, Sankara. This part of the study is rich and well done and Nicholson develops a new reading of the interaction between these two religious thinkers. However, the political element is elusive in Part II and it is unclear whether Nicholson has fully demonstrated what he suggests has been neglected in comparative studies. Nevertheless, Nicholson’s attention to the political in religion is absolutely vital as is his organic sense of how religions actually develop: through conflict and questioning of the other.</p>

<sec id="sec25-0040571X12457284"><title>Férdia J. Stone-Davis, <bold><italic>Musical Beauty: Negotiating the Boundary between Subject and Object</italic></bold>, Cascade Books: Eugene, OR, 2011; 224 pp.: 9781606085578, $25.00 (pbk)</title>
<p><italic>Musical Beauty</italic> explores the meaning and being of music and, ultimately, considers the possible contribution of musical beauty to an understanding of the world and oneself. Férdia Stone-Davis pursues this inquiry though a close reading of Kant’s <italic>Critique of Judgment</italic> and two works by the early medieval writer Boethius – <italic>The Fundamentals of Music</italic> and <italic>The Consolation of Philosophy</italic>.</p>
<p>Boethius believes that music and beauty arise from and give voice to the structure of the cosmos and, indeed, the structure of the human person. For this reason, music provides powerful testimony to the actual shape of the self, the world and the relation between the two. Despite this, for Boethius, music’s epistemic value is diminished by both its indeterminacy (its inability to specify and articulate concepts in the manner of language) and its physicality (its own physical character as well as the fact that it engages us at the level of sense). Kant, in contrast, locates both the musical experience and beauty in the subject. Beauty reveals the shape of human cognition, but doesn’t speak to us about the external world. Kant agrees with Boethius, however, in finding music’s indeterminacy and its physicality problematic. In her constructive proposal Stone-Davis argues that music’s significance is in fact rooted in these two elements that Boethius and Kant find troubling. Musical sound physically inhabits the external world and yet (literally) resonates with one’s own physical being. Similarly, specifically because of its lack of conceptual content (its indeterminacy), musical beauty evokes a <italic>response</italic> – one of wonder. Beauty speaks to us of a world which is other than ourselves and cannot be mastered by our categories. In these ways, Stone-Davis believes, music speaks to us of a mutuality between subject and object. It reveals a reality which is genuinely other, but in which we nevertheless participate profoundly.</p>
<p><italic>Musical Beauty</italic> is a welcome contribution to the philosophy of music. Stone-Davis offers intelligent and thorough readings of two central figures in the philosophy of music. She gives a thoughtful exegesis of Boethius’ work and the place of music within his view of the world. Her analysis of Kant likewise demonstrates an impressive command of the material. Her own exposition, however, often fails to bring additional clarity to Kant’s notoriously dense discussion.</p>
<p>The central virtue of <italic>Musical Beauty</italic> is that it recognizes both the truly <italic>wonder</italic>-full character of music, and its philosophical significance. For just this reason, one wishes more space had been given to Stone-Davis’s constructive proposal. Six of the book’s seven chapters are devoted to her summaries of Boethius and Kant. (Considering the amount of space given to Boethius and Kant, it is also surprising that their work is not mined more thoroughly in developing Stone-Davis’s own conclusions.) As a result, the book’s most interesting suggestions remain suggestions, rather than developing into a more complete account of musical beauty.</p>
