<title>Background:</title>
<p>The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) on admission is a predictor of survival. However, it is not highly discriminating for mid-range scores. ‘PPS Change’ between two time points considers the disease trajectory, and may improve the scale’s utility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216312451613">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>The aim of this study is to determine if a change in PPS scores between two significant time points predicts survival.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216312451613">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>This prospective cohort study examined ‘Change on Admission’, ‘Change at Week 1’, and ‘Change at Week 2’. We followed patients until death or 6 months, whichever was earlier. Cox regressions were used to determine if the Change scores were predictors of survival, adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis category, Charlson Index, and Do-Not-Resuscitate order.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216312451613">
<title>Setting/Participants:</title>
<p>The sample consisted of patients referred to the palliative care service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216312451613">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>All three Change scores were independent predictors of survival. The greater the change, the poorer the prognosis. At week 1, when compared to ‘PPS Change ≤ 10%’, ‘Change 11% –30%’ and ‘Change &gt; 30%’ increased the hazard ratios by 1.70 (95% CI 1.10–2.63) and 3.14 (95% CI 1.77–5.59), respectively. At week 2, when compared to ‘PPS Change ≤ 10%’, ‘Change 11% –30%’ and ‘Change &gt; 30%’ increased the hazard ratios by almost 3- and 8-fold, respectively. The same magnitude of Change scores also has higher hazard ratios as patients’ hospitalization progressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216312451613">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The magnitude of change in PPS score during the disease trajectory is associated with one’s survival and is a potentially useful prognostication tool. Further research is needed to extend on our work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accurate prognostication of terminally ill patients is crucial for making decisions regarding goals of treatment. More importantly, it facilitates optimal care by focusing on alleviating distressing symptoms. Accurate prediction of survival also allows patients and their family the opportunity to prepare for the eventuality of death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312451613">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312451613">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The simplest way to predict survival is to ask the attending physician to estimate the patient’s survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312451613">3</xref></sup> Unfortunately, physicians’ predictions are often inaccurate and tend to be overly optimistic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312451613">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312451613"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312451613">6</xref></sup> This is not surprising given that a patient’s survival is determined by a complex interaction of multiple factors. In a prospective cohort study of 504 terminally ill patients, only 20% of the 365 physicians’ predictions were accurate, while 63% were optimistic by a factor of 5.3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312451613">7</xref></sup> Similarly, in a recent study involving 1835 patients, physicians’ predictions were accurate in only 34% of the cases, while 51% of the predictions were over-estimated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312451613">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>To address the shortcoming of physicians’ predictions, a number of prognostic tools have been developed to aid in the prediction of patients’ survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451613">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312451613"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312451613"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451613">12</xref></sup> The Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP) is one of the better prognostic scales but there are limitations to its clinical utility. Cognitive failure, a known predictor of poor prognosis, is not included in the scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451613">9</xref></sup> The score also requires the collection of blood specimens to measure biochemical parameters which may not be desirable in patients who are dying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312451613">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) uses functional status as a measure to predict survival in patients with terminal illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451613">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312451613">13</xref></sup> It incorporates five observer-rated parameters (ambulation, activity and evidence of disease, self-care, intake, and level of consciousness) to measure performance status, allowing for the evolving physical deterioration of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451613">12</xref></sup> The PPS grades the patient’s general condition on a 10% increment scale from 0 to 100%, where 0 is dead and 100% is ambulatory and healthy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451613">12</xref></sup> The PPS is simple to use and the assessment can be undertaken by either a nurse or physician at any point during the patient’s illness.</p>
<p>Previous studies conducted primarily in patients with cancer from palliative care or hospice care settings found PPS to be a significant predictor of survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451613">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312451613"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451613"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312451613"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451613"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451613">17</xref></sup> Lau et al. reported that PPS on admission was a significant predictor of survival for inpatient palliative care patients in a Canadian province together with sex and age in a cohort of 88.3% cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312451613">15</xref></sup> Head et al. demonstrated an association between PPS scores and survival time in a population from a hospice program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451613">14</xref></sup> Similarly, a study on a cohort of patients referred to a regional palliative care program also reported that PPS predicts survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451613">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although past studies reported that higher scores on the PPS are associated with increased survival time, the tool was not highly discriminating for some PPS categories, namely the mid or higher range scores. Head et al. found that PPS was not discriminating between the 30% to 40% or the 50% and 60% to 70% scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451613">14</xref></sup> Similarly, Lau et al. also reported difficulty in differentiating the effects among PPS 40% and above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451613">16</xref></sup> In a cohort study of terminally ill cancer patients admitted to the palliative care unit, Morita et al. found the lack of differentiation among the 10% and 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% categories, and between the 60% and ≥ 70% categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451613">17</xref></sup> These findings showed that there was ambiguity in discriminating between some PPS categories, and suggested that PPS scores on admission alone may not be a sensitive predictor for certain categories of patients.</p>
<p>As the PPS score only takes into account a patient’s functional status at a particular point in time, documenting the change in PPS scores between two time points helps the physician to appreciate the rate of the patient’s functional decline. For most terminal diseases, it is likely that the higher rate of functional decline corresponds with more rapid deterioration and shorter survival. Hence, the change in PPS scores could aid in survival prediction.</p>
<p>Published studies which reported on the use of change in PPS scores between two time points are scarce. Downing et al. conducted a retrospective study which analyzed sudden functional decline in a cohort of 3328 patients admitted to a palliative care unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312451613">18</xref></sup> Their findings showed that a greater decrement in ‘PPS Change’ or an abrupt decline in function may be associated with shorter survival probabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312451613">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The primary aim of our study was to determine if a change in the PPS scores, specifically, change on admission, at week 1, and at week 2, of hospital stay, could predict survival in terminally ill patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0269216312451613">
<title>Participants and setting</title>
<p>This was a prospective cohort study involving patients with terminal conditions admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital between August 2009 and July 2010. The institution is an acute, 1200-bed hospital in Singapore with 36 clinical and allied health departments. The inclusion criteria were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0269216312451613" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Age 18 years and above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Suffering from either an advanced cancer, end-stage heart, respiratory or renal failure, and referred to the institution’s palliative care service. The criteria used to identify patients with end-stage organ failure followed that as stipulated in the National Healthcare Group Advance Care Programme,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312451613">19</xref></sup> a local home hospice program for patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage heart failure, and end-stage renal failure. Patients recruited under this program had a mean survival time of less than 12 months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Either the patient or their next-of-kin must be able to provide verbal informed consent.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Patients were excluded if they or their next-of-kin were unable to provide information for the PPS scoring, were admitted to the intensive care or high dependency units, or were imminently dying.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216312451613">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>On admission, two research assistants (registered nurses not involved in the care of the patients) approached consecutively eligible patients or their next-of-kin, to obtain informed consent. The research assistants interviewed the patients, next-of-kin or caregivers to determine the patients’ PPS scores on admission (‘PPS Admission’) and 2 weeks before admission (‘PPS Baseline’). Subsequently, patients were followed up weekly for 2 weeks, to determine their PPS scores at weeks 1 and 2 of their hospital stay. PPS scoring was done with the PPS version 2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312451613">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using a structured form, data on the patients’ age, sex, medical diagnosis, the Charlson Co-morbidity Index,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312451613">20</xref></sup> and the presence or absence of the ‘Do-Not-Resuscitate’ (DNR) order, were also documented. As part of the institution policy, terminally ill patients with little prospect of benefiting from aggressive treatment were placed under the ‘DNR’ order after discussion with the patients, or their next-of-kin if the former were deemed mentally incapable of making informed decisions.</p>
<p>We followed the patients’ progress until death or 6 months after study enrolment, depending on which occurred first. We determined the patients’ mortality status by checking the hospital’s medical and death records, and the Singapore’s Birth and Death Registry. Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Singapore National Healthcare Group Domain-Specific Ethics Review Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216312451613">
<title>Sample size</title>
<p>The sample size calculation was based on the statistical ‘rule of thumb’ that when a prognostic regression model is being built, the number of events (i.e. death) in the sample should be at least 10 times the number of potential prognostic variables included in the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216312451613">21</xref></sup> Since we included about 6 prognostic variables in the models, we would require about 60 deaths. Based on an estimated discharge rate of 50% within 2 weeks of hospitalization and a conservative mortality rate of 30% during the 6-month follow-up period, we calculated that 400 patients would need to be recruited for the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216312451613">
<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables were presented as mean (SD) and N (%) for categorical variables. The PPS scores were categorized as 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and ≥ 70%. We combined the results of patients with PPS scores of 70% and higher, as there were few patients with PPS scores higher than 70%. We defined (1) ‘Change on Admission’ as (‘PPS Baseline’ – ‘PPS Admission’) x 100 / (‘PPS Baseline’); (2) ‘Change at Week 1’ as (‘PPS Admission’ – ‘PPS Week 1’) x 100 / (‘PPS Admission’); and (3) ‘Change at Week 2’ as (‘PPS Week 1’ – ‘PPS Week 2’) x 100 / (‘PPS Week 1’). The PPS change scores were grouped as ≤ 10%, 11%–30% and &gt; 30%, to represent no / small, moderate and large functional decline, respectively, based on our clinical judgments. The small number of patients in the last two categories prevented us from dividing these categories further, or to analyze according to the pre-hoc intervals in increment of 10% until 50%.</p>
<p>Age was categorized as &lt; 45, 45–64, 65–74, 75–84, and ≥ 85 years. The diagnosis was broadly divided into cancer and non-cancer. Survival time was computed as the difference between the date of death and the date of hospital admission. As we censored our data at 6 months, patients who were still surviving on day 181 were considered as alive. Survival time was categorized into these five categories: 0–6 days, 7–29 days, 30–90 days, 91–180 days, and &gt; 180 days.</p>
<p>Survival time for the different ‘PPS Admission’ scores and ‘PPS Change’ scores were analyzed and presented using the Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curves. Log-rank tests were used to determine the significant differences between the survival curves. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the relationship between the hazard ratios for survival time with ‘PPS Admission’, and ‘PPS Change’, adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis category (cancer or non-cancer), Charlson scores, and the DNR order. The prediction on admission for Model 1 and Model 2 were generated using the whole cohort of patients. Subjects who were dead or discharged at the end of week 1 of hospitalization were excluded from the analysis at week 1 (Model 3a and Model 3b). Similarly, the prediction for Model 4a and Model 4b excluded those patients who were dead or discharged at end of week 2. Each model was adjusted for all the covariate. Statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18.0.</p>

<title>Participant characteristics</title>
<p>We recruited 400 of the screened 462 patients. Those excluded, either refused to participate or were unable to provide information for the PPS scoring. About 90% of the patients provided the information for the PPS scoring while for 10% of the patients, the PPS scoring was done based on information obtained from the next-of-kin or the caregivers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312451613">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic characteristics of the participants. The majority of them were aged 65 and above, diagnosed with cancer, and not on the DNR order.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PPS ‘Change on Admission’, ‘Change at Week 1’, and ‘Change at Week 2’ were all independent predictors of survival time when adjusted for age, sex, diagnosis category (cancer or non-cancer), Charlson scores, and DNR order. We demonstrated that as the ‘PPS Change’ scores increased, the risk of death also increased correspondingly. These findings were similar to Downing’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312451613">18</xref></sup> where a larger increment in ‘PPS Change’ or an abrupt decline in function was associated with poorer survival probabilities.</p>
<p>The results of our study showed that the same magnitude of change increased the hazard ratios significantly as patients progressed through the hospital stay. For ‘PPS Change scores &gt; 30%’, the risk of death at week 2 was twice that at week 1, which in turn was twice that at admission. This suggests that patients who suffered major functional decline at later onset during their hospital stay have lower survival probabilities, compared to those who declined at the same magnitude at an earlier onset. This could be because those with major functional decline at later weeks consisted of sicker individuals not responding to treatment, while those with major functional decline earlier comprised of those whose condition was yet to be treated.</p>
<p>The results of Model 1 confirmed that PPS scores on admission to an acute healthcare setting is a useful prognostication tool. As the ‘PPS Admission’ scores decreased, the mean survival time decreased while the hazard ratio for death increased significantly. Model 1 also confirmed the shortcomings of PPS as highlighted in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451613">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451613">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312451613">17</xref></sup> The survival curves for patients with mid-range PPS scores of 30%–60% were not highly distinct from one another, as compared to the survival curves of PPS 10%, 20%, and ≥ 70%. This means that PPS is less discriminating among patients with mid-range scores 30%–60%. We believe that this limitation can be partially overcome with the addition of ‘PPS Change’ scores.</p>
<p>PPS is a tool designed to measure a patient’s functional performance, nutritional limitations, and level of consciousness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312451613">12</xref></sup> Since clinicians’ predictions are not very accurate, a valid tool such as the PPS can be used at the bedside quickly and readily to assist in survival estimate prediction. ‘PPS Change’ takes into consideration the disease trajectory, and the rate of decline in functional status. Given that illness trajectories usually change over time as the illness progresses, Change scores which consider scores at an earlier stage in the illness may improve the accuracy of survival prediction. As it is important to provide dying patients with reasonably accurate estimates of their prognosis, ‘PPS Change’ scores could be used together with ‘PPS Admission’ in the clinical setting to provide a rapid, non-invasive method of predicting patients’ survival.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, our study is the first prospective study to report on the usefulness of a new parameter, the ‘PPS Change’, in patient prognostication. The main strength of our study is in its prospective design where we followed patients through at weeks 1 and 2 of their hospital stay. We also reaffirmed the strong association between ‘PPS Admission’ and survival time, in a cohort of patients with life-limiting diseases in an acute care setting, similar to the findings of past studies which were conducted in palliative or hospice settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312451613">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312451613"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312451613">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the limitations of our study is that the ‘PPS Baseline’ scores may be subjected to recall bias as they were collected retrospectively, during admission. Nevertheless, as the time period for recall was relatively recent, it is likely that the recall bias was small. In some of the models, we have relatively few patients in some of the categories. This may be one of the reasons why ‘PPS Admission’ at Week 1 and Week 2 was not significant. Lastly, the findings of our study were based on patients in an acute setting and should be interpreted with care when applied to patients from a different care setting.</p>
<p>Our study yielded interesting results on the utility of ‘PPS Change’ scores in prognosticating survival. Further research is needed to extend on our work in larger samples to determine if change scores are more discriminative than one-point scores, or if a combination of both baseline scores and change scores could improve survival prediction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We demonstrated a strong association between the magnitude of change in PPS score during the disease trajectory and one’s survival. Change in PPS scores between different times is a potentially useful tool in improving survival prediction.</p>
