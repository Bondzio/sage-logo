<abstract>
<p>While mainly based on the use of fluorinated steroids, there is no standard management of anti-Ro/La-related congenital heart block (CHB). This is a report concerning two consecutive cases of anti-Ro/La-related second-degree block treated with betamethasone (4 mg/day), weekly plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs; 1 g/kg) administered every 15 days, a therapy that was begun shortly after CHB was detected and continued until delivery. The newborns were also treated with IVIG (1 g/kg) soon after birth and continued fortnightly until the anti-Ro/La antibody levels became undetectable. In both cases second-degree AV block reverted to a stable sinus rhythm with a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Moreover, there was no recurrence of CHB when therapy was suspended, as confirmed by a 29 month and an eight month follow-up, respectively.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203311430969" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital heart block (CHB), the main feature of neonatal lupus erythematosus, is an autoantibody mediated disorder potentially caused by placental transmission of maternal autoantibodies to 52-kd and 60-kd SSA/Ro and 48-kd SSB/La ribonucleoproteins. There are no standard guidelines for the management of CHB. Its treatment is mainly based on the use of fluorinated steroids such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, which are only partially inactivated by the placental 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase complex and have satisfactory bioavailability to the fetus. The rationale behind this therapy is to diminish the inflammatory component in the fetal conduction system and myocardium, and thus reduce cardiac injury. Some authors have, nevertheless, reported that dexamethasone is unable to prevent the progression from a second- to a third-degree block.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311430969">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The number of alternative treatments is limited and include plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311430969">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311430969">6</xref></sup> Plasmapheresis removes the offending maternal autoantibodies, leading to a partial, transient regression of incomplete CHB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311430969">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311430969">3</xref></sup> IVIG is an established therapy for maternal idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura as well as for neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. Several possible mechanisms of action of IVIG including anti-idiotype regulation, inhibition of placental transport of maternal autoantibodies, accelerated clearance of potentially pathogenic autoantibodies, cytokine modulation, complement neutralization, and modulation of inhibitory signalling on macrophages could explain its role in the treatment of autoimmune CHB. Recently utilized as a preventive therapy for anti-SSA/Ro-associated CHB,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311430969">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311430969">7</xref></sup> IVIG seemed unable to prevent CHB recurrence at the dose and frequency it was used. Some authors have occasionally employed IVIG during pregnancy, but the therapy appeared ineffective in treating CHB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311430969">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311430969">6</xref></sup> David et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311430969">5</xref></sup> reported a case of a 2:1 CHB with intermittent complete block which reverted to long periods of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after three consecutive IVIG infusions, but shortly after birth unfortunately a 2:1 heart block reappeared with occasional periods of complete heart block.</p>
<p>This is a report describing a clinical experience concerning two consecutive cases of anti- SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La-related second-degree CHB. Both fetuses were treated with conventional betamethasone, weekly plasmapheresis, and IVIG at 15 day intervals. The therapy was begun shortly after CHB was detected and was continued until delivery. Moreover, for the first time, as far as we know, the newborns were also treated with IVIG (1 g/kg) soon after birth and continued at 15 day intervals until maternal antibody levels became undetectable.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0961203311430969"><title>Case no.1</title>
<p>A pregnant 32-year-old female was referred to our Rheumatological Centre in January 2009 during the 20th week of her first pregnancy because of fetal bradycardia detected by fetal sonography. The patient had been diagnosed with Sjögren’s syndrome two years earlier. A fetal echocardiography carried out at the time of referral confirmed the finding of a second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block with a mean ventricular rate of 74 beats per minute (bpm) and a mean atrial rate of 142 bpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311430969">Figure 1A</xref>). Fetal cardiac anatomy and function were normal, and no pericardial or pleural effusions or ascites were detected.

At the 20th week, the finding of an second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block with a mean ventricular rate of 74 beats per minute (bpm) and a mean atrial rate of 142 bpm. B. At the 26th week there was a normal sinus rhythm (mean heart rate 160 bpm, PR interval 0.110–0.113 s) after five weeks of betamethasone, five plasmaphereses, and one intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion. a: atrial contraction, v: ventricular contraction.

<p>The University of Padua’s Ethics Committee gave a quick approval supported by the following reasons: 1) the procedures may be considered sufficiently safe both for mother and child; 2) currently there is no alternative validated treatment for this severe cardiac disease. Thus, once the patient was informed about the disease risks and had signed a writen consent form, treatment with betamethasone (4 mg/day) and weekly plasmapheresis sessions was started.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311430969">8</xref></sup> Two weeks later, at the 22nd week, the mean heart rate increased from 74 bpm to 124 bpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203311430969">Figure 2</xref>) and a fetal echocardiography showed episodes of sinus rhythm (mean rate 160 bpm) alternating with a 2:1 second-degree AV block. At the 25th week IVIGs (1 g/kg) were added to the therapy regimen. IVIG infusions (Kedrion, Italy) were scheduled at 15 day intervals rather than on two consecutive days every month, which is the usual scheduling timetable. Just as in a previous protocol the infusions were administered with this timing in an attempt to reduce the amount of IVIG that was removed weekly by the plasmapheresis sessions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311430969">8</xref></sup> Low dose aspirin (100 mg), which was suspended a week before the planned caesarean section, was empirically administered to counteract IVIG-related thrombophilia. A normal sinus rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311430969">Figure 1B</xref>) was recorded by fetal echocardiography at the 26th week. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203311430969">Figure 2</xref>, serial echocardiographies, performed regularly until the time of delivery, confirmed a stable mean heart rate ranging between 148 and 175 bpm and a PR interval ranging from 0.110 to 0.125 seconds. Anti-SSA/Ro antibody (52 and 60 kd) levels in the mother, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Technogenetics, Italy), were 244 and 1264 units/ml, respectively, at baseline and 129 and 296 units/ml, respectively, at the end of pregnancy. Anti-SSB/La antibody levels were 37.9 units/ml at baseline and became undetectable after four plasmapheresis procedures.

<p>A caesarean section was planned at the 35th week of gestation because of a mild growth restriction and a normal male infant weighing 1905 g was delivered. The infant, whose Apgar score was 8 at five minutes, appeared healthy at birth, and no signs of cutaneous lesions were noted after ultraviolet light exposure during the follow-up. His anti-SSA/Ro antibody levels (52 and 60 kd) were 95 and 280 units/ml, respectively, while anti-SSB/La testing was negative. All standard blood tests, including immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels, were normal for his age. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring after birth showed a sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block and a mean heart rate of 158 bpm during the first 19 hours after birth. At that point a variable Mobitz I AV block appeared on ECG monitoring, which was confirmed by an ECG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311430969">Figure 1C</xref>). IVIG therapy (1 g/kg per day on two consecutive days) was immediately administered to the newborn to counteract the effects of passive maternal antibodies and six days later a sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block was recorded by an ECG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311430969">Figure 1D</xref>). This finding was confirmed by a 24-hour Holter ECG. Single IVIG infusions (1 g/kg per day) were scheduled at 15 day intervals rather than on two consecutive days every month. This was done in the attempt to prevent blood viscosity and excessive plasma volume build-up. IVIGs were continued on this time schedule until the infant was four months old, at which time anti-52 kd and 60 kd SSA/Ro antibody levels became undetectable. The final ECG, performed when the infant was 29 months old, revealed a stable sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block, confirmed by an 24-hour Holter ECG. Now 29 months old, the infant is healthy and is not receiving treatment of any kind.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203311430969"><title>Case no. 2</title>
<p>A 33-year-old female was diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease because of dry eyes and the presence of anti-SSA/Ro (52 and 60 kd) and anti-SSB/La antibodies. She was not receiving any kind of therapy. A normal heart rate (162 bpm) and anatomy were recorded during routine fetal sonography performed at the 18th week of gestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203311430969">Figure 3</xref>) of her first pregnancy. At the 20th week a sonography revealed bradycardia, confirmed by a fetal echocardiography which detected a second-degree AV block with a mean ventricular rate of 80 bpm and mean atrial rate of 160 bpm. At that time betamethasone was administered at a dose of 8 mg/day for three days and then continued at 4 mg/day, but it did not achieve any modification in the heart rate, as demonstrated by the six echocardiographies carried out over the next two weeks.

<p>The patient was referred to our Rheumatological Centre in October 2010 during the 22nd week of her pregnancy and a fetal echocardiography confirmed a 2:1 AV block and registered a heart rate of 75–80 bpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203311430969">Figure 3</xref>). The patient was informed about the consequences of the block and possible therapeutic strategies. Written consent was obtained and at the 23rd week of that pregnancy a combination therapy (betamethasone 4 mg/day, weekly plasmapheresis, and IVIG 1 g/kg every 15 days) was begun. The regimen was continued throughout the rest of the pregnancy until delivery. At the 24th week the mean heart rate began increasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203311430969">Figure 3</xref>) and at the 27th week an echocardiography detected a normal sinus rhythm with a mean heart rate of 171 bpm. Serial echocardiographies confirmed the improvement in the fetal heart rate, which continued until the 34th week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203311430969">Figure 3</xref>), when a premature rupture of the membranes occurred and a 2450 g female was delivered by uncomplicated caesarean section. The infant's Apgar score at five minutes was 9. Maternal anti-SSA/Ro (52 and 60 kd) antibody levels determined at baseline by ELISA were 15,860 and 8256 units/ml, respectively, while they were 2813 and 1872 units/ml, respectively at the end of pregnancy. Maternal anti-SSB/La antibody titre was 460 at the beginning and 103 units/ml at the end of pregnancy. The infant appeared healthy at birth and the results of all standard blood tests, including IgG, IgA, and IgM levels, were normal for her age. Anti-52 kd and 60 kd SSA/Ro antibody levels were 559 and 420 units/ml, respectively, while the anti-SSB/La titres were borderline (21.1 units/ml). ECG monitoring showed a sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block. Eighteen hours after birth the infant underwent two consecutive days of IVIG infusions (1 g/kg per day) and from that time until she was four months old, when maternal anti-52 kd and 60 kd SSA/Ro antibodies became undetectable by ELISA, she was administered IVIG at 15-day intervals. Now at eight months she has a stable sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203311430969" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have described two consecutive cases of anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La-related second-degree CHB, both treated, for the first time, with a combination therapy including conventional betamethasone, weekly plasmapheresis, and IVIG at 15-day intervals. The fetal heart rate improved soon after the beginning of this therapy in both patients and there was a significant correlation between mean heart rate increase and weeks of treatment (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203311430969">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961203311430969">3</xref>). There was also a reversion to a sinus rhythm with a first-degree AV block in both infants.</p>
<p>Although in our two consecutive cases the block reversion was chronologically related to the combined treatment, the limited number of treated cases caused us to be prudent in confidently ratifying the positive results. Moreover, we could not have excluded a reversion from a second-degree CHB to a sinus rhythm if we had only used betamethasone as in the PRIDE study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311430969">1</xref></sup> in which reversion occurred in one out of six cases using only dexamethasone.</p>
<p>The possibility of utilizing a combination treatment strategy in the attempt to treat CHB was recently hypothesized by Ostensen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311430969">9</xref></sup> Our decision to treat CHB using a combination therapy was based on a previous experience in managing high risk pregnancies in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome in whom a combined protocol including weekly plasmapheresis and fortnightly IVIG infusions was found to be effective and safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311430969">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The novelty of this strategy was the fact that three therapies were combined to obtain a summation of effects to treat the cardiac injury. In fact, used singularly, steroids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311430969">1</xref></sup> plasmapheresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311430969">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311430969">3</xref></sup> and IVIG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311430969">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311430969">6</xref></sup> do not seem to prevent progression of a second-degree CHB to third-degree CHB, necessitating pacemaker implantation. This combination strategy seems to be a forceful method to neutralize anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies and their effects. It has three objectives: 1) betamethasone is used to reduce inflammation of the fetal conduction system; 2) as demonstrated by the lowering of the maternal antibody levels at the end of pregnancy, plasmapheresis is utilized to remove a large part of the offending autoantibodies from the maternal/fetal circulation systems; and 3) IVIG is thought to counteract the part that remains. Due to the weekly removal of plasmatic Ig by plasmapheresis the IVIG infusions every 15 days were not considered an excessive amount, given their half-life of 21 days. Deciding when to begin therapy is of utmost importance. Presumably the best time to begin combination therapy would be at an early stage when there is only inflammation and before immutable scarring of the cardiac conduction tissue has taken place. Thus, early and serial fetal echocardiographies are needed to discover CHB while it is still incomplete.</p>
<p>Certainly, one of the limits of this combined therapy may be its high cost. However, given the rarity of CHB and the possibility to successfully treat such a devastating disease, even high costs might be justified.</p>
<p>The damage to the heart conduction system occurs during pregnancy, but there is still a risk of progression to a higher degree heart block even in the postnatal period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311430969">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311430969">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311430969">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311430969">10</xref></sup> Moreover, the progression from a sinus rhythm to a variable Mobitz I AV block at 19 hours after birth suggested treating the first newborn with IVIG and, following the positive results, we scheduled the same protocol for the second neonate in order to counteract the potential damage to the neonatal heart conduction system by passive maternal antibodies. IVIG was the chosen therapy soon after birth as it was considered more practicable than plasmapheresis and safer than a corticosteroid. In fact, due to the problems of vascular access, it is very difficult to carry out plasmapheresis in neonates. Furthermore, soon after birth administration of steroid therapy might induce several side effects including damaging neurocognitive development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203311430969">11</xref></sup> There was in both infants no recurrence of CHB when therapy was suspended, as confirmed by a 29-month and an eight-month follow-up, respectively. However, as the mechanism by which in utero damage by antibodies can progress after birth (e.g. late cardiomyopathy and progression of block) is not understood, progression does happen and can happen after a year or more. Thus, the follow-up times of both children are too limited to state with some confidence that the improvement is sustained, especially since first degree block remains. Large-scale studies on incomplete CHB are of course warranted to determine the real benefits and limits of the strategy outlined here.</p></sec>
