<abstract>
<p>We are all very familiar with the miniaturization of technology, but in this article I develop the case for the miniaturization of published information. With the introduction of Gdrive there is a universal infrastructure for the intimate integration of content, accessible as a continuous stream of information delivered to a new generation of tablet devices. The technological revolution is dismantling the old bulk handling of information in files and books into a new micro quantum based on integrating MicroFormats. It demands new thinking and, for those currently working as information professionals, a new metaphor – of Quantum information. Coming with this change is much improved usability, improved scholarship, better information flow and new opportunities for publishers.</p>

<title>Quantum information</title>
<p>The challenge in writing these articles for <italic>Business Information Review</italic> is in spotting the news which defines the emerging information future. Usually these articles are for new products – here the indications come from both sun-setting<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266382112458395">1</xref>
</sup> and new products.<sup>

<title>Sun-setting email</title>
<p>Thunderbird’s 20 million users will in future only get security updates from Mozilla, apparently because people are switching to other messaging technologies and are not bothered with further email innovation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0266382112458395">
<title>Embracing Gdrive</title>
<p>Now look at what Gdrive did to Google Docs. It basically said: there is no such thing as a word processor, or a spreadsheet, or a presentation program. There are only these triggers here that look like file names, locations in virtual space also known as the cloud. When I ‘write’ it goes to the cloud, when I ‘edit’ it comes back from the cloud, when I ‘share’ it is replicated out in multiple similar relationships to the cloud. You could say it is a document that is being worked with, or you could say the idea or the image or the communication or the consensus exists as an object composed of data and metadata about how the object works.</p>
<p>The demise of Thunderbird, typical of many established products, heralds a shift in our information tools – from the old style which handle content discretely as files to the new way of handling information as a quantum continuum. The new product is Google Drive – an announcement that has been long awaited to deliver their ‘version of the local (C:\) drive on the cloud’. For many it is business as usual – but it delivers information in a new form allowing new functions. Together these announcements mark the next shift of information away from information as files to information as waves. The technology is revolutionary but are we?</p>

<title>Metaphors we live by</title>
<p>Since Nicholas Negroponte’s landmark book <italic>Being Digital</italic>,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0266382112458395">3</xref>
</sup> we have been using the metaphor describing the shift from the world of atoms to the world of bits, a good model for the initial digitization of our world. I propose a new metaphor for the coming shift in style – Quantum Information – the shift from files and books (our particles) to sentences, paragraphs and tweets (our waves). Anyone familiar with classical physics will recognize this metaphor and understand the intrigue of the particle wave duality which bamboozled physics at the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable book on Information is Tor Nørretranders’ book <italic>The User Illusion</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0266382112458395">4</xref>
</sup> For anyone interested in a scientific explanation of how we perceive the world this is an inspiring and thought provoking volume. In its many pages lie insights into how we make sense of the information laden ‘booming buzzing confusion’ that constitutes our lives. The book starts with the classical physicists and the confusion with the introduction of quantum physics. The revolution in physics announced the end of certainty – how could matter, hitherto certain and fixed, appear in different places; indeed how could classical physics still operate if the elements of physics were no longer fixed?</p>
<p>Quantum Information cannot be accessed if we think as we have done in the past. Our thinking is too ingrained in a world of paper and books and too constrained by our knowledge as adults. Stafford Beer<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0266382112458395">5</xref>
</sup> expressed the challenge to physics thus:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘an intelligent child could solve the most abstruse problems of modern physics if only they could understand what they are about’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Children are not encumbered with the languages, structure and solutions which their elders ‘know’ – and which actually inhibit their discovery of novelty. This raises a challenge – the child does not know enough about the real life of our world; we for our part do know, but we are constrained by our own experience as well as informed by it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0266382112458395">
<title>Blinded by experience</title>
<p>The trigger for my thinking around Quantum Information stems from the announcement in April of Google Drive. Easily dismissed as the announcement of cloud services for all our information, which we might easily dismiss as more technology taking our PCs further, cheaper and faster. I then read ‘Eat the Document’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0266382112458395">6</xref>
</sup> by Steve Gilmor who starts to describe some of the characteristics of the new technology…</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Gdrive is the kind of disruption that lurks beneath the surface, behind the marketing campaign, irrespective of even Google’s position in the market. It is like Gmail was when it started, a harbinger with real muscle that marks the beginning of something bigger than a single vendor.</p>
<p>First of all, it kills Google Docs by inserting those features as menu items in Gdrive. This is a real dagger in Microsoft’s heart, the first direct evidence of a post-document model. Naturally the anklebiters will say documents are not dead, etc. But they are. Where are documents on the iPad? You can get to them through some circuitous route through iTunes or whatever, but really there is no file system exposed to us except at the export level, via email or iCloud or Bluetooth maybe. I kid because Apple is, or has been, serious about this no-USB thing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This may seem simply hyperbole and techno-enthusiasm but the insight is in the middle of the second paragraph ‘<bold>
<italic>Naturally the anklebiters will say documents are not dead, etc. But they are.</italic>
</bold>’ The document, book or file, so long the staple of our technological lives and the fundamental unit of information currency, is now redundant. This may appear an overblown claim but let us consider stepping forward just a few years in order to look back, in the style of Gulliver’s Travels, to the way we work today:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0266382112458395">
<title>The view from 2016</title>
<p>In the ancient times of 2010 we struggled hard to communicate with each other through our individual machines; these machines were owned individually and could not be shared. The primitive nature of their internal working meant that to use the machine I had to store information in the lumps which were convenient for the machine; we called these files. In order to do anything with these files I had to know what sort of information it was (a picture or text) and had to have a special feature on my machine which could author or alter specific types of files.</p>
<p>I remember being told that this was because the machine was too stupid to know how to deal with specific files. This stupidity generated other problems. I was often limited with what I could do with my information. If I wanted to share something I had to find another special feature called email if my fellow was ‘on’ email, or called Twitter if my fellow was ‘on’ Twitter. More often than not I would fail to share the information either because it was too difficult or because I chose the wrong system.</p>
<p>Recognizing the old metaphors revealed how our information work is encumbered by constant interruptions when crossing technology barriers and how we are forced to make choices as we switch between tools. Contrasting the PC and the tablet is to experience the arcane choices for content filing in the world of Word and Documents and the rich choices for sharing embedded in the world of Tablets and Cloud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266382112458395">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Volume</title>
<p>In 1935, if you wanted to read a good book, you needed either a lot of money or a library card. Cheap paperbacks were available, but their poor production generally tended to mirror the quality between the covers.</p>
<p>Penguin paperbacks were the brainchild of Allen Lane, then a director of The Bodley Head. After a weekend visiting Agatha Christie in Devon, he found himself on a platform at Exeter station searching its bookstall for something to read on his journey back to London, but discovered only popular magazines and reprints of Victorian novels.</p>
<p>Appalled by the selection on offer, Lane decided that good quality contemporary fiction should be made available at an attractive price and sold not just in traditional bookshops, but also in railway stations, tobacconists and chain stores.</p>

<title>Size</title>
<p>In the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0266382112458395">7</xref>
</sup> there is the argument over the size of the iPad, Alan Kay (p 222) recommended then a 7” form factor the size popular with the cheaper Android tablets but eschewed by Jobs himself. This form factor goes back to the origins of printing and the introduction of portable books with the need to store them in the saddlebags whilst travelling. Alan Kay conceived of personal computing as an entirely new medium. In thinking about the computer in this way, he remembered reading about the insight of Aldus Manutius, who some forty years after the invention of the printing press established the dimensions of the modern book by understanding that it must be small enough to fit into a saddlebag.</p>

<title>Structure</title>
<p>The use of citations in science has been incredibly valuable,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0266382112458395">8</xref>
</sup> but for the digital age the style is increasingly destructive. Our current use of citations and references is having the same effect as building over ancient ruins – the overlay conceals the underlying structure with only partial elements revealed to the current generation. We cannot link through to the original sources or read around the favoured ‘one liners’.</p>
<p>For much of scientific literature the original material becomes ‘buried’ by the current literature. In part this is progress, but it is also destructive as the source books and source material migrate first to the archive and then to the skip with the shelves being filled with the latest books and latest editions. Our digital world is currently designed around the physical world with a truncated access to the source material.</p>

<p>The Quantum Information metaphor describes the shift to handling small elemental pieces of information irrespective of their type and devoid of their ‘container’ – the file, the book or the article. It is about mixing and matching writing, images and audio as pieces drawn from the individual’s work and that of others and pulled from books, journals, blogs and tweets. The quantum metaphor suggests a creative mongrel of information synthesized from multiple sources; it recognizes the challenges of ownership and pedigree but is the key to releasing the potential of digital scholarship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0266382112458395">
<title>Reinventing hypertext</title>
<p>The first beneficiary of quantum information will be hypertext. From its origins, the practical boundary of hypertext has been the file. To the pioneers of hypertext there was a stark choice determined by the properties of the information containers – the files, the program and the delivery device. The practical choice was to either choose self-contained snippets as with ‘<italic>it was a dark and stormy night</italic>’ or allow a context jump to another separate document <italic>Lytton, E. B. L. Paul Clifford (G. Routledge and Sons: London; New York, 1880)</italic>. The introduction of the web and the URL revolutionized the addressing of files, an early limitation of hypertext, but the major divide between my content and your content persisted. In the flow of information, the choice was to either maintain control or cede it.</p>
<p>In the quantum world, aided by the technology that underpinned mark-up with its most advanced implementation in MicroFormats – we have the ability to stream and combine material; I can mix my stuff and your stuff without the division of ownership or the discontinuity of files. MicroFormats<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0266382112458395">10</xref>
</sup> are established for other content types. MicroFormats:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Provide a standard way of marking up content that many developers, and tool makers, are already marking up in different ways.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Help enable distributed services such as aggregation and indexing, which would otherwise be extremely difficult or unfeasible to implement, especially for end-user exploitation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Enable seamless interoperability between web-based content use and desktop applications used to author the content.</p>

<title>Big data and small quanta</title>
<p>The recent Wall Street Journal article ‘Your E-Book is Reading You’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0266382112458395">11</xref>
</sup> examines the impact of the new digital formats which transform reading from a largely unmeasured solitary activity ….</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the past, publishers and authors had no way of knowing what happens when a reader sits down with a book. Does the reader quit after three pages, or finish it in a single sitting? Do most readers skip over the introduction, or read it closely, underlining passages and scrawling notes in the margins? Now, e-books are providing a glimpse into the story behind the sales figures, revealing not only how many people buy particular books, but how intensely they read them.</p>
<p>For centuries, reading has largely been a solitary and private act, an intimate exchange between the reader and the words on the page. But the rise of digital books has prompted a profound shift in the way we read, transforming the activity into something measurable and quasi-public.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The significance of this big data thinking is profound but it remains constrained by formats: the concept of the modern book developed by Manutius and refined by Lane but dictated by the underlying technology. We have only just come to terms with web analytics at the file level, so it is hard to imagine the possibilities when we progress from the information containers to the quantum information of their content. There will be greater detail and insights for research and a more accurate personalization for better, and more lucrative, advertising.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0266382112458395">
<title>Quantum collaborations</title>
<p>With the widespread introduction of Google Docs begun, I speculated about a new genre of true collaboration in authoring,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0266382112458395">12</xref>
</sup> anticipating a pedigree checker working in the same way as the spell checker but using the power of Google search and the contemporary plagiarism checkers such as TurnItIn.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0266382112458395">13</xref>
</sup> Then, as you develop content you can evaluate its uniqueness or the options for the development of the paragraph. My favourite example, from the peanut cartoon, begins with ‘<italic>it was a dark and stormy night</italic>…’, imagine that your pedigree checker tracks your writing and suggests how the sentence or paragraph could end, assessing the novelty of your work, or indeed picking up similar or associated content in the published or journal literature. It would make authoring a truly collaborative process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266382112458395">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section16-0266382112458395">
<title>So what does an information quantum look like?</title>
<p>Content snippets are woven in with original content. This requires a link structure developed from the established bibliographic and URL standards but extended for positional disambiguation and content uniqueness. Inspired by Amazon<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0266382112458395">14</xref>
</sup> and shortened for Twitter addressing of the type <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amzn.com/1592245226/">http://amzn.com/1592245226/</ext-link>‘it was a dark and stormy night’/length=200 with ‘it was a dark and stormy night’/length=200 can be replaced by a hashed shortcut such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amzn.com/1592245226/pC0iP">http://amzn.com/1592245226/pC0iP</ext-link>. Expansion within a publishing MicroFormat – yet to be developed – will manage the content, reference and commercial. It is information that is already ready to be consumed on a multitude of devices.</p>
<p>With this referencing scheme supported by online content in full new groups in joint enterprises, groups such as all the theoretical physicists, can combine their writing and reading paths through the full corpus of their field and not just the popularly quoted material. As a community acting collectively their patterns will build – providing a metric for payment or a measure of significance. In the new digital age it will be possible to replace the manual tedium of collecting references endured by every research student with a facility as easy to use as their music on their iPod.</p>
<p>The information quantum also challenges our way of writing. In the book world, the cost of standing on the shoulders of giants is a loss of absolute originality. As the contracts for original material are shaped around the dictates of content formats, perhaps a new formula is required: a new commission would be a new concordat between plagiarism and scholarship – 15 per cent original work 50 per cent mainstream (that &gt;30% would agree with) 35 per cent eclectic mix.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0266382112458395">
<title>The publisher’s future?</title>
<p>In the past I have worked with information professionals whose concerns over copyright and information policy have tried to make ease of use the gateway to policy – ‘<italic>if we put restrictions on use or only provide a few scanners we will make copying difficult and so limit any copyright excesses</italic>’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0266382112458395">15</xref>
</sup> Difficulty of use is not an adequate basis for strategy.</p>
<p>The pdf format has many advantages, but sharing and re-mixing does not feature amongst them. The pdf is a simple reflection of the book and is information presented in the classical format, not the new quantum information required for a file-less, tool agnostic integrated world. The success of Apple demonstrates how real strategies can be developed from attractiveness of use and a compelling attractiveness exists for authors and scholarship towards the publishers who start to make their material available in quantum MicroFormat, open to re-mixing and capable of seamless integration.</p>
<p>The technology is ready, the standards are in place but are we ready? How long will the period of bamboozlement last in the shift of our thinking away from the old information quanta of the book? Will the current professionals emerge first into the new world, or will we have to wait for the next generation of children to enter the workplace?</p>
