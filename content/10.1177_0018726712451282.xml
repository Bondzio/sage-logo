<abstract>
<p>This article examines the work and roles of HR managers in the Irish recession. It tests the validity of three competing views about the future of HR: that the profession needs to become a business partner; that it is knee-deep in a legitimacy crisis; and that it is fragmenting by being unable to cope with the complexity of modern organizational life. Three key findings emerge from the research. First, HR managers have gained greater influence in business decision-making, but much of this influence arises from short-run retrenchment measures. Second, many HR managers remain committed to long established professional values and ideas of good practice. Third, modern HR managers are developing a professional identity that allows them to perform multiple, competing roles. These findings challenge existing arguments about the effects of the current recession. They also speak to ongoing debates about changing HR roles by showing how HR managers remain adept at making pragmatic adaptations to secure their role in organizational life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For some time now two sharply contrasting messages have been transmitting from the HRM literature. One is that the future integrity of HR is tied to the profession getting closer to corporate strategy making, so that HR managers no longer remain the poor cousin of the management family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712451282">Ulrich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712451282">Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712451282">Ulrich et al., 2009</xref>). The other message is that the HR profession is in crisis precisely because it has been too eager to embrace a business partner role, only to have its efforts shunned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712451282">Kochan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712451282">Marchington, 2008</xref>). On this account, the HR function in many organizations has ended up in a no-man’s land, having repudiated its traditional role yet failing to acquire the status of business partner. Of course, not all research on the contemporary evolution of the HR profession is captured by these two contrasting perspectives. A number of studies shy away from making big claims about HR moving decisively towards a more strategic role, but at the same time recognize that important changes are occurring to the HR function in organizations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712451282">Caldwell (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712451282">2003</xref>) finds that efforts at closing the gap between people management and corporate strategy have made it difficult for HR managers to develop shared professional understandings about role performance and role boundaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712451282">Guest and King (2004)</xref> find that many ambiguities and limitations continue to plague managers steeped in the rhetoric of HRM following the transition from personnel management and associated roles. They point in particular to strains that emerge when managers attempt to operate within an HRM framework: formalized administrative processes may be seen to make organizations ‘sclerotic’, while the rhetoric of ‘good HR practice’ may rebound on HR functions seen as incapable of delivering if promises made go unrealized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712451282">Guest and King, 2004</xref>: 420). In similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712451282">Wright (2008)</xref> suggests that the emergence of the business partner/internal consultancy model for HR has fragmented rather than enhanced professional identity or influence.</p>
<p>Other contributions echo this line of reasoning and point to a picture of role conflict both within the HR profession and vis-a-vis other managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712451282">Adams, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712451282">Caldwell and Storey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712451282">Truss, 2008</xref>). Adding to this picture are empirical contributions that portray the work of HR managers as often, in practice, reactive rather than in any meaningful sense aligned with the business or with strategic considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712451282">Adams, 1991</xref>). A number of studies amplify this theme by pointing to the persisting legacy of administratively- and operationally-focused HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712451282">Guest and Bryson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712451282">Guest and King, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712451282">Lawler and Boudreau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712451282">O’Riordan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712451282">Sisson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712451282">Teo and Crawford, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712451282">Truss, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712451282">Truss et al., 2002</xref>). Some of these contributors and others doubt that HR managers possess the competencies that would make them credible business partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712451282">Caldwell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712451282">O’Riordan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712451282">Guest and King, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712451282">Wright et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the literature about the nature of change in the HR function in modern organizations has continued to point in quite different directions. At the same time, we are being told that the profession is nearing its nirvana, on the edge of the abyss or has made pragmatic adaptations that have either led to role ambiguity, if not confusion or to the reproduction of established HR roles in organizations, sometimes compounded by new ambiguities and uncertainties. This corpus of work echoes themes in Karen Legge’s classic study, <italic>Power, Innovation and Problem-Solving in Personnel Management</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712451282">1978</xref>), which predates debates surrounding HRM. Some studies indeed make explicit reference to Legge’s work (see, especially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712451282">Guest and King, 2004</xref>). Anticipating many of the points of contention that subsequently surrounded HRM, Legge’s analysis of personnel management identified a number of ambiguities in personnel roles that gave rise to a series of ‘vicious circles’. First, personnel managers lacking the power to participate in strategic decision-making were confined to reactive actions and crisis management, reinforcing negative perceptions of the function on the part of senior and line managers. Second, lacking clear criteria for judging the success of the function’s activities and programmes, personnel managers took shelter in their adroitness in responding to short-term, reactive concerns, again leading to negative stereotypes being held by other managers. Third, the low status of personnel limited the supply of talent into the function, further limiting the contribution that could be made at a strategic level. Escape from these vicious circles might be found in any of three directions. Personnel managers might seek to leverage social-scientific knowledge to problem-solve by providing expert advice regarding the contingent conditions in which different types of practices were likely to succeed. This, however, seemed to Legge less likely than personnel managers engaging in either ‘conformist’ or ‘deviant’ innovation. Conformist innovation entailed, in essence, narrowing the traditional priorities of personnel by emphasizing support for ‘hard’ utilitarian criteria of organizational and business success. Deviant innovation involved advocacy of different criteria of success, reflecting, for example, the values and preoccupations associated with organizational development or enshrined in legislation granting people employment rights. For Legge, neither of these escape routes appeared likely to transport personnel managers from a professional reality marked out by limited strategic influence, reactive activity and low status.</p>
<p>The business context for most of these discussions was a 20-year period of relative economic stability in the western world that produced the relentless march of globalization, the emergence of shareholder value as the cornerstone of business strategies and rapid technological change. But the current most serious recession since the Great Depression has transformed the business and HR contexts. Getting to grips with austere business times has become the top priority for many organizations. As firms strive to cope with harsh and abiding business conditions, the fallout for the HR function remains unclear and uncertain. Will the economic crisis be used by HR managers to demonstrate their capacity for making sound business decisions, thereby encouraging a more decisive move towards a ‘business partnering model’? Will the responses of firms to the crisis further fragment the HR function by accelerating the outsourcing of ‘transactional’ HR services and neutering any capacity for HR teams to operate in a strategic way? Or will the recession simply lead to different types of improvised adaptations by HR professionals? Will the HR function continue in this sense to be plagued by ambiguities and bogged down in ‘vicious circles’, and, if so, what might these now be?</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to try to shed light on some of these questions by presenting detailed empirical evidence on the effects of the recession on HR managers and the HR function in firms in Ireland – one of the countries most seriously affected by the recession. The article begins by reviewing the literature on how recessions impact on HR functions and how people are managed at work. The next section profiles the Irish recession and its effects on firms. The research methods used to collect the data presented in the study are described next. The article then presents data on the effects of the recession on the HR function obtained from a survey and focus groups of HR managers and from six case studies of firms widely viewed as having undertaken exemplary measures in response to the recession. The final section discusses the implications of the findings for the ongoing debate on the role and future of human resource managers and the HR function.</p>

<sec id="section2-0018726712451282">
<title>What happens to the HR function in recessions?</title>
<p>To get a sense of how the current economic downturn may be having an impact on the HR function, it is useful first to gain an understanding of how the profession has fared during past recessions in Anglo-Saxon economies. Probably the best starting point is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712451282">Legge’s (1987)</xref> review of a wide body of evidence to assess the impact of the UK recession of the early 1980s on the power, role and structure of personnel departments in organizations. Reflecting the preoccupations of Legge’s earlier work, the focus of her investigation was on whether the recession: (i) enhanced the status of the HR function by opening up new opportunities for it to lead organizational change and restructuring; (ii) reduced the need for the HR function by making some its core activities – recruitment and selection, for example – less important to organizations; (iii) caused the HR function to be marginalized by opening up the opportunity for more ‘macho’ management; or (iv) led to no appreciable change to the role or values of the HR function owing to organizations maintaining a business-as-usual stance. After an exhaustive mining of the available evidence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712451282">Legge (1987)</xref> reached the conclusion that while incidences could be found of HR losing power and management becoming more macho, the dominant trends appeared to be HR remaining more or less the same as a result of the recession (labelled ‘business as before’).</p>
<p>A broadly similar conclusion was reached by researchers associated with the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative (SCELI), who found substantial continuity in the way people were managed at work during the 1980s, suggesting that the recession caused no departure from existing HR models pursued by firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712451282">Rubery and Wilkinson, 1994</xref>). At the time, these findings were pretty significant as they tended to pour cold water on fashionable commentary that during the recession senior managers were rushing headlong to make their firm more flexible by marginalizing trade unions, increasing their numbers of precarious employees and reducing their commitments to their established workforces, with significant implications for the roles of personnel managers and departments.</p>
<p>More keenly contested interpretations emerged about the impact of the deep US recession of the early 1980s on the management of employees and on the role of HR. On the one hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712451282">Cappelli (1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712451282">1999b</xref>) argues that this recession triggered a decisive shift towards macho forms of management in the USA, leading to ‘hard’ HR policies and practices being diffused by organizations. Against such a background Cappelli endorsed the view that HR departments no longer performed the same functions as before; were one of the areas of management often considered suitable for outsourcing, and had to battle against business commentary calling for their outright abolition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712451282">Cappelli, 1999a</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712451282">Jacoby (1999)</xref> cautioned against the ‘fallacy of discontinuity’ – the strong temptation to view recession as leading to employees being managed in fundamentally different ways from preceding periods – and pointed instead to continuity in work and employment arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712451282">Jacoby, 1999a</xref>: 133). His overall message was that the recession did little to rupture the long-term trends in people management that were already unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712451282">Jacoby, 1999b</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of the commentary that has emerged about the impact of the current recession on the work of HR managers has been strongly normative and sometimes speculative in character. Striking a very positive note, Ulrich (as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712451282">Brockett, 2010</xref>) views the recession as an opportunity to deepen the ‘business partnering model’ of HR inside organizations. He argues that HR managers should use the recession to demonstrate their capacity for making sound strategic business decisions. An equally upbeat posture is adopted by Cary Cooper, who goes as far as to say that the recession could be the ‘making of HR’ by providing the opportunity for HR managers to take the lead in creating organizational cultures that motivate employees in a period of insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712451282">Cooper, 2009</xref>). Others are less sanguine. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712451282">Pitcher (2008)</xref>, without providing much convincing evidence, it has to be noted, argues that the impact of the recession on the HR function will be wholly negative. He suggests that the numbers working in HR were being reduced more severely than in other management support functions, while ‘transactional’ HR processes were increasingly being relocated to low-cost countries. A similar message is put forward by an international consultancy firm that claimed to have identified a ‘mega-trend’ that involves leading global firms off-shoring HR and other support functions, while imposing hiring freezes and staff cuts in their home countries. The effects of these developments are seen to fall disproportionately on HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712451282">The Hackett Group, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712451282">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, both over time and across countries, the focus has been very much on whether recessions lead to transient changes or cause profound and lasting disjunctures in the ways in which people are managed and HR functions operate in organizations. Contrasting views are evident on this core theme. With respect to the effects of the current recession on HR managers and HR roles, the views that have emerged very much echo the sharper differences that already existed in the literature on the contemporary role and future of the HR function. Given that the literature on the topic continues to point in different directions, this article concentrates on presenting detailed empirical data which permit an assessment of contrasting views regarding the effects of the recession on HR and builds on earlier assessments of the evolution of HR roles in organizations. Before examining the data, the article presents an overview of the Irish recession and outlines the research methods used in the study.</p>

<title>The Irish recession and its impact on firms</title>
<p>Ireland was the poster child of international capitalism for much of the 1990s and early 2000s when the country’s economic and labour market performance were the envy of many developed economies. The economic recession, which commenced in 2008 in the wake of the credit crunch and the international financial crisis, is the most serious in Ireland’s history as an independent country, and the Irish crisis is among the worst of all developed economies. Between 2007 and 2009, GDP collapsed by nearly 11 per cent and the economy has virtually stagnated since then. The volume of retail sales – an indicator of consumer confidence – declined by nearly 17 per cent between 2008 and 2010. The incidence of company insolvencies rose by 80 per cent over the two years to 2010. Average earnings fell in the private sector and even more so in the public services, where unilateral pay cuts have been imposed by the Government.</p>
<p>The collapse of Irish banks was warded off by the virtual nationalization of Ireland’s financial system and extensive recapitalization by the taxpayer. The result was the transformation of a financial crisis into a sovereign debt crisis, which the Irish Government found difficult to manage on its own. In November 2010 Ireland had no alternative but to accept an EU/European Central Bank/IMF rescue package, resulting in an austerity programme that has involved deep cuts in public spending, coupled with tax increases. The economy continues to be knee-deep in trouble. Ireland’s debt/GDP ratio rose to 100 per cent in 2011. While the exporting sector of the economy, dominated by high-technology, foreign-owned multinationals, has shown resilience and signs of recovery, the domestic sector remains sluggish. Unemployment rose from 4.6 per cent in 2007 to 14.4 per cent in 2011, and net emigration, running at −67,000 in 2007, changed dramatically to +34,500 in 2010.</p>
<p>Given the severity and length of the Irish recession and the severe effects of declining economic activity and austerity on businesses, Ireland represents a ‘critical case’ in which to examine systematically the effects of the recession on the work of HR managers and HR roles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0018726712451282" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research methods</title>
<p>The data reported in this article were obtained from a study of the effects of the Irish recession on the conduct of human resource management in the private and commercial state-owned sectors. Data were collected using three methods. First, focus groups were conducted involving 30 senior human resource managers. In all, five focus groups were undertaken: three in Dublin and one each in Cork and Galway. Participants were chosen for invitation in accordance with a protocol drawn up by the authors and a range of professional and statutory bodies, and were drawn from diverse backgrounds, which included people from large and small firms, from unionized and non-unionized companies, from foreign-owned MNCs and Irish-owned firms and from firms located across a broad range of manufacturing and service industries, both high- and low-tech. Three of the focus groups were mixed. The final two were restricted to non-unionized companies and to Irish-owned companies, respectively. These were undertaken to ensure that all reasonable steps had been taken to obtain a profile of views and experiences across the widest possible business spectrum. Focus group discussions, conducted under the ‘Chatham House Rule’, covered managers’ experiences during the recession and the ways in which they had sought to conduct HR management and organize the HR function. Focus group interviews were recorded and transcribed.</p>
<p>The focus groups and themes in the literature guided the design of a survey of managers responsible for the conduct of HRM. The sampling strategy was devised in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). The survey was piloted and revised in light of feedback on the piloted survey instrument. Revised questionnaires were distributed by the research team. The sampling strategy involved the distribution of questionnaires to managers responsible for human resources in all firms in the private and commercial state-owned sectors in the Irish Republic (excluding agriculture) employing 50 or more staff. Questionnaires were distributed in two waves. The first mailing occurred during late spring and early to midsummer 2010. The survey was repeated in the case of non-respondents during September 2011. All recommended measures to encourage responses were undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712451282">Baruch and Holtom, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The survey yielded 444 useable responses, representing a response rate of 17.2 per cent. This is satisfactory, especially considering the deep and persisting commercial pressures affecting many firms at the time of the survey, and the response rate is in line with both Irish and international experience with surveys of businesses. Standard tests for non-response bias suggested that the pattern of non-response was random.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726712451282">1</xref></sup> The survey data were re-weighted to be representative of the population of firms of 50 or more employees in the sectors surveyed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0018726712451282">2</xref></sup> As different views pertaining to the effects of the recession focus in the main on the work and roles of specialist HR managers, the analysis presented in the article is confined to firms where specialist HR managers and HR departments exist. These comprise 66 per cent of all responding firms (unweighted, <italic>N</italic> = 295).</p>
<p>The third data source comprises detailed case studies of firms widely regarded as having responded to the recession effectively. A list of 20 potential cases was constructed from multiple sources, including newspapers, professional periodicals, specialist journalists and HR professionals. The list contained diverse cases, and so was stratified in terms of the types of recessionary pressures to which firms had responded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0018726712451282">3</xref></sup> Six targeted cases agreed to participate and consented to their proper names being used in research reports. Interviews were held in each firm with senior HR managers. In the unionized case study firms, interviews were also conducted with one or more (sometimes up to three) trade union officials. In several instances general managers were also interviewed. In total, six HR managers, seven trade union officials and two general managers were interviewed. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The firms studied are widely viewed as ‘leading-edge’ exemplars of effective HR responses to the recession. Details of the case companies are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712451282">Table 1</xref>. The firms involved were a financial services firm, Irish Life &amp; Permanent (IL&amp;P), an estate agent, Sherry FitzGerald, a commercial state-owned company responsible for operating the main Irish airports, the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), a leading Irish supermarket chain, Superquinn, a US healthcare devices manufacturer, Medtronic, and a global ICT firm, Ericsson. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712451282">Table 1</xref> summarizes the main features of the case study firms, the commercial pressures they experienced, the HR measures they implemented during the recession and the activities and roles of their HR functions. All were affected by the Irish and/or international recession, albeit to various degrees and – consistent with the case study design strategy adopted – in different ways. IL&amp;P, Sherry FitzGerald and DAA were focused in the main on reducing payroll costs, avowedly to preserve the maximum number of jobs. Superquinn sought to gain the agreement of the firm’s trade unions on a survival plan. Medtronic sought to win the support of its workforce and unions for a series of measures to secure the Irish plant’s mandate within the parent multinational firm, and Ericsson sought to rationalize its Irish operations in the context of an ongoing worldwide restructuring programme.</p>

As a leading firm committed to high value and expertise-based trading, the collapse of the property market impacts severely on its business.</td>
<td>Employment protection initially identified as major priority. Salary cuts implemented in two rounds, with higher cuts at the upper end of the pay system and lower-paid staff initially excluded from cuts. Reduced work weeks and career-breaks offered to staff. As trading conditions worsened, compulsory redundancies introduced. Intensive communications used throughout response programme. A pre-recession strategic review of HR in the firm needed to be shelved to permit attention to be devoted to managing the impact of the recession on the business.</td>
<td>A small group-level HR function, staffed by HR generalists. As conditions in sector changed in 2007, HR began to focus on medium-term HR changes to support new business conditions. As effects of recession worsened, these activities gave way to development and implementation of a retrenchment programme, as HR acted in partnership with senior management group, through the aegis of a general manager to whom HR reported. HR was committed to return to medium-term strategy concerns as the firm coped with the effects of the recession.</td>

Profits fell by over 50 per cent at a time when the DAA had borrowed heavily to construct a new terminal (T2) at Dublin Airport. The operation of the new T2 at Dublin airport was to be made subject to commercial tender and operating costs were understood to be an important determinant of success in the competition for the contract to operate T2.</td>
<td>A Cost Recovery Programme (CRP) launched, that included 400 job losses through voluntary redundancy, pay freezes and changes to overtime and premium payments. As commercial conditions worsened, higher payroll savings sought in negotiations with unions. Unions’ financial adviser accorded access to financial information. The parties agreed an Employee Recovery Investment Contribution (ERIC), which involved tiered pay cuts, of increasing scale at higher salary levels, instituted the creation of a financial participation scheme, and agreed changes in working practices and a new conflict resolution mechanism. Under the ERIC, pay levels are to be restored when agreed business targets are attained. An agreement on the operation of T2, which involves a new grading structure, work practices and revised pay scales assists the firm to gain the contract to operate T2.</td>
<td>HR function had lost influence in company during 1990s and 2000s. Influence regained by a new senior HR team, which was central to the DAA’s response to the recession. In the main, HR strategy sought to cut costs without major changes to established practices across the organization, other than innovation in conflict resolution. Major changes were introduced in T2 in response to regulatory stipulations associated with the award of the contract to operate the new terminal. In 2011 the DAA was reported to be planning closer alignment between work roles in T2 and T1, while unions withdrew from CRP and threatened industrial action in response to a series of grievances, including the creation of new work roles without consultation and over pay rates for new entrants to T1 jobs.</td>

As a major firm in the quality/service segment of the grocery market, the business was severely affected by this trend, as well as by consumers switching from premium brands, shopping around and spending less per visit to the supermarket. Superquinn’s market share slipped from 9 to 6 per cent, while the viability of the firm became increasingly encumbered by the property debts of its owner. In July 2011 the firm was placed in receivership by a number of banks seeking the repayment of property loans. Superquinn was immediately bought from receivership as a going concern by Musgrave’s.</td>
<td>Firm negotiated a survival plan agreement with unions, involving cost-cutting measures, including a pay pause and voluntary redundancies. The deal included ‘banded hours’ contracts that provided a degree of predictability and earnings stability to staff regarding working hours and the introduction of annualized hours. Union experts accorded access to financial information. Agreement was also reached on a multi-level partnership arrangement. Continuing trading difficulties led to an agreement regarding the pausing of contributions to the staff pension scheme for a fixed period in lieu of pay cuts.</td>
<td>Classically-structured HR function. Introduction of partnership agreement in context of the firm’s survival plan and new law on information and consultation built on Superquinn’s legacy of positive arms-length industrial relations and a largely paternalistic HR tradition, which had emphasized direct employee involvement in in-store problem solving.

<p>The three data sources used in the study are complementary and permit a significant degree of ‘triangulation’ with respect to themes and research findings. The survey provides a profile of relevant aspects of the work of HR functions and HR managers in the recession. The focus groups allow access to the experience, thinking and priorities of senior HR managers involved in handling the effects of the recession. An obvious methodological concern is that the data are heavily reliant on HR managers’ self-reports, especially in a focus group context, and that HR managers may have been tempted to ‘talk themselves (and their roles) up’ and put a positive gloss on their influence. In order to counter this, as outlined, the focus groups were conducted under Chatham House rules, and participants were informed that our primary research interest was in their direct experiences and that a frank and open discussion was our objective. We also probed or ‘interrogated’ comments and often sought examples and illustrations of points being made. In fact, what struck us in respect of the focus groups was the extent to which our HR interlocutors were prepared to ‘talk themselves down’ in often providing unvarnished accounts of their work activities, their roles and often their limited and circumscribed influence over aspects of firms’ responses to the recession. Finally, providing an additional counter-balance against possible bias in data generated from HR specialists, the case studies combined HR views and experiences with those of trade union officials and sometimes general managers. These cases also allowed us directly to observe HR managers’ activities and to draw on external reportage and internal documentation in profiling the work of HR managers in the recession.</p>
<p>In presenting our research results we frame our analysis around the central themes at issue between different interpretations of changing HR roles and influence in the context of recession and also seek to address abiding debates about changes in HR roles. These themes are:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726712451282" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The resourcing and configuration of the HR function.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The influence of HR managers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The balance that exists during the recession between strategic/transformational HR roles and operational/transactional HR activities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Whether the boundaries between the work domains of HR specialists and other managers have been affected by the recession and whether the recession has affected the professional values of HR managers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The implications of the empirical findings for long-running debates about changing HR roles, in particular the scenarios marked out by Karen Legge, whose work presaged much of the subsequent discussion.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Survey data are drawn upon to profile the resourcing, organization and priorities of the HR function and the influence of HR managers in the recession. Focus group and case study data are used to extend the analysis of these themes and to examine the other themes around which the analysis is organized. The concluding section returns to the import of the findings for abiding meta-narratives about the evolution of HR roles in advanced economies.</p>

<title>The resourcing and configuration of the HR function</title>
<p>Mirroring the macro-economic profile of the effects of the Irish recession presented above, nearly eight out of 10 firms in the survey assessed the effects of the recession on their business as either ‘severe’ or ‘very severe’. Only 11 per cent of firms, employing 21 per cent of employees, had awarded pay increases to some or all employees since the onset of the recession. Many firms had been forced to introduce ‘cocktails’ of measures comprising pay freezes or cuts, headcount reductions, curbs on overtime or short-time working, to adjust to the downturn. Other firms had relied mainly on pay freezes to navigate their way through the recession. So the experience of firms and of their HR managers has been very much one of retrenchment – sometimes even severe retrenchment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712451282">Table 2</xref> examines views on the organization and resourcing of the HR function during the recession. Less than 15 per cent of HR departments were restructured during the recession, although just more than one in three experienced reductions in staffing. Twenty-three per cent reported having reduced the costs of HR processes and policies. More than half reduced their use of external HR consultants or service providers. To put some of these data in context, 70 per cent of firms in the survey reported some level of retrenchment in overall headcount since the onset of the recession and 64 per cent of firms reported that they had in some way restructured aspects of their business. HR functions thus emerge as having escaped relatively lightly as compared with levels of retrenchment and reorganization within their host firms.</p>

<p>There is little evidence here of the cataclysm predicted by some recent commentaries on HR during the recession. For the most part, firms have not seized the opportunity radically to reorganize the HR function. The survey results overall suggest a picture of not uncommonly leaner HR functions that had not undergone any significant level of reorganization or reconfiguration. Only a minority appeared to be under pressure to reduce the cost of HR services and transactional activities, although many made less use of HR consultants for advice or for delivering HR services.</p>

<title>The influence of HR managers</title>
<p>What of the influence of HR functions during the recession? <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712451282">Table 3</xref> presents data on a series of relevant indicators. More than seven out of 10 HR managers agree or strongly agree that the business role of HR had strengthened during the recession. There is a divergence of opinion regarding the manner in which HR had influenced the measures chosen by firms to adapt to the recession. Just over three out of 10 were of the view that the influence of HR had been restricted to the implementation of response measures adopted by businesses. Nearly four out of 10 disagreed that this has been the case, and the rest reported no view either way. Fifty-seven per cent were of the view that HR managers had to learn new skills to address the challenges posed by the recession. Thus most HR managers believed that HR had gained more influence during the recession, but opinion was more divided as to whether that influence was restricted to the implementation of firms’ responses. To extend our analysis of the role and influence of HR managers, we turn to the focus group and case study data.</p>

<p>The HR focus group findings are compatible with the survey but provide a more nuanced and variegated picture of the work of HR managers and the activities of HR functions during the recession. The main work activities of HR managers during the recession concerned detailed transactional work surrounding the design, introduction and management of retrenchment programmes. Cuts in payroll budgets were widely remarked upon. Pay freezes and freezes on pay increments, on progression through salary bands and on promotions had been implemented by many focus group participants. In addition, bonus earnings had been heavily curtailed in some cases. Cases were also reported where lower pay rates or salary levels had been introduced for new recruits. Headcount reductions were widespread and often acute – in some instances involving up to a third or more of the workforce - and these were achieved through a variety of measures.</p>
<p>Freezes on recruitment were widely used, accompanied in some cases, where controls on recruitment were ‘very stringent’, by more use of temporary or contract employment. Voluntary redundancy programmes had been widely implemented. HR managers in some firms believed that they had no alternative to what one described as the ‘nuclear option’ of immediate sizeable compulsory redundancies. Cycles of retrenchment activity were commonly identified, where firms had hoped that initial freezes on pay or voluntary redundancies might have been sufficient to stabilize businesses, only to discover that further and more painful programmes involving pay cuts and compulsory redundancies had become necessary. Disciplinary procedures, time-keeping and performance management systems had also been more rigorously managed in some firms to improve productivity. Measures focused directly on reducing payroll costs were commonly accompanied by measures that sought as far as possible to maintain motivation and commitment. In particular, communication mechanisms were often used more intensively to persuade employees and unions of the need for retrenchment. Measures to promote employee engagement or reengagement were also reported, such as communications on new plans, practices and processes following the implementation of a redundancy programme, ‘celebrating success’ in a difficult environment, and using focus groups, surveys and newsletters to ascertain and report back employees’ attitudes.</p>
<p>HR managers in general believed that HR had become significantly more central to, and more influential in, business decision-making as a consequence of the recession. Focus group participants portrayed HR functions during the Irish boom from 1994 to 2007 as being concentrated on recruitment and retention – HR being portrayed by one participant as a ‘recruitment agency’. The predominant view of participants was that HR managers now commonly focused on what one participant called ‘getting the business back in shape’. This change of focus had brought HR into the mainstream of business decision-making – a view articulated by participants in terms of HR managers’ new role as ‘business partners’. The common perception was of the new influence achieved by HR now that the concern was with bottom-line business concerns like pay, headcount and restructuring. The general view was reflected in the comment that the ‘stock-in-trade of HR people had risen as a result of the recession’.</p>
<p>Most focus group participants believed that the influence of HR extended beyond simple involvement in how retrenchment measures would be implemented to key decisions on how firms should respond to the recession. The HR manager of a professional services firm believed that he had been ‘pretty central very early, right through from the design to the execution’ of the company’s response. The HR manager of a contract cleaning firm put forward a similar view, seeing the role adopted as ‘central; leading, whatever way you want to look at it; but a different kind of role’. The HR manager in a distribution company said that her experience was that ‘no decisions will be made unless a senior manager will come to the HR manager and sit down and discuss what’s going to happen’. The HR manager of a retailing firm was also emphatic that ‘we were involved from the start with other managers, particularly [in] operations’.</p>
<p>The case studies illustrated how HR managers could sometimes play a central role in strategic decisions on responding to the recession. In the DAA the senior HR director participated in a top-level management committee that included the company’s chief executive and that met regularly during the retrenchment programme to guide the development of the measures being undertaken and to review negotiations with the unions. In IL&amp;P, HR was also central to the process of devising the measures adopted by the firm to respond to the deepening crisis in the financial sector.</p>
<p>Some focus group participants believed that their influence within senior management was restricted to implementing business decisions largely determined beyond their reach. The HR manager for a distribution firm was categorical that the key decisions affecting HR were even taken beyond the boundaries of the firm for whom she worked, by the major retailer on which the firm had a strong commercial dependence: they ‘called the shots; they’re not paying their staff [any pay rises], so you can’t pay yours’. In a long established Irish firm, ‘management made the decisions and HR was involved in implementation’. The HR manager of a hospital saw the situation in his organization in very stark terms: ‘the government decided’. The case studies again illustrate how the influence of HR was sometimes subsidiary to higher levels of management within firms or even to higher levels of HR management within parent multinationals. In the retail multiple Superquinn, the broad parameters of business strategy were devised within the parent private equity firm, although HR played a key role in highlighting options arising from earlier agreements on consultation with the firm’s unions that had not been activated prior to the onset of the recession. In the estate agent, Sherry FitzGerald, HR reported to a senior general manager who had primary involvement in strategic decisions on pay cuts and redundancies. In the two multinationals, Medtronic and Ericsson, local HR decisions were subject to agreement in higher forums in line with the co-ordinated decentralized approaches to HR management prevailing in both firms.</p>
<p>The HR managers in the focus groups were clear as to the source of their often new-found influence: it had arisen from firms’ dependence on HR for the knowledge and expertise required to chart a course through the recession and even to secure firms’ very survival. Typical were the responses of three HR managers, one of whom claimed that ‘we’ve gone from being a service provider to the business to the business being completely dependent on us’. Another emphasized that ‘we’ve been seen as being incredibly integral to some of the things that had to be done’ [during the recession]. A third manager claimed that ‘a lot of changes [were] being forced on companies, mostly staff changes, cut-backs on staff, reorganizing, and there are processes to be gone through and most management, other than HR people, don’t have the knowledge of those processes’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0018726712451282">
<title>The balance between strategic and operational HR activities</title>
<p>It is clear from both the focus groups and the case studies that HR had gained influence through the immediacy of the commercial threats posed by the recession to the activities and even survival of firms and had become central to devising and implementing short-term response measures – sometimes shaping how the measures required to support commercial strategy and sometimes implementing measures adopted by firms at higher levels of management. In these circumstances HR managers had, as they saw it, commonly been accepted as ‘business partners’ in the core operations of firms. HR managers also devoted a good deal of their time to managing the implementation of these measures – that is to ‘working the pumps’ to keep businesses afloat and on track. Their new-found influence was rooted in firms’ dependence on HR expertise and knowledge. But had the new influence gained by HR extended beyond short-term measures – beyond ‘working the pumps’ – to more medium- or long-term strategic concerns with positioning firms and their human capital for recovery and growth? There is little evidence in either the focus groups or case studies that this has often been the case.</p>
<p>Most revealing here were the case study firms, remembering that these were widely viewed as exemplars of good practice by the HR profession and by expert commentators. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712451282">Table 1</xref> summarizes the HR measures these firms implemented during the recession and the activities and roles of their HR functions. HR managers in all case study firms were heavily occupied with implementing the kinds of HR retrenchment measures identified in the focus groups and all had significant, if varying, degrees of influence over decisions of senior management teams with respect to the short-term measures introduced to preserve the commercial viability of firms. The key issue to consider is whether the recession had in any other ways altered, or showed signs of altering, the strategic capability, direction or even configuration of HR.</p>
<p>There is little evidence in the case studies of HR engaged in ‘positioning for the long-term’ or operating ‘at the forefront of recovery’, or otherwise using the influence obtained in the recession to refocus, accelerate, reverse or otherwise transform HR strategy. The picture that emerges, rather, is of HR functions most frequently focused on short-run concerns, and sometimes even putting longer-term considerations on hold, and disinclined or unable to address the basic configuration of the HR function itself, or to consider how HR should operate into the future. In IL&amp;P the pre-recession objective of reconfiguring the HR function in line with the model advocated by Ulrich had been eclipsed by the pressures of the recession, although an agreement with unions spanning the company’s two main business divisions – one aspect of a more integrated HR approach – had been achieved. In Sherry FitzGerald, work on a medium-term HR strategy to address a slowing down of the real estate market had been displaced by the short-term measure needed to secure the business. HR intended to resume this work when possible. In the DAA, HR was pivotal to a cost-reduction programme that largely sought to work within the practices and processes associated with prevailing HR and IR arrangements and practices. In one area of the DAA’s activity, planning for Terminal 2 (T2) at Dublin airport, HR had developed a new pay and grading structure, allied to new work practices. But the trigger of this change of strategy had not been the pressures associated with the sharp drop in passenger traffic through the airport, but rather the insistence of the Aviation Regulator that operating costs for T2 had to be reduced as a condition of awarding the contract to the DAA for managing the new terminal. In other words, highly contingent conditions had triggered a new strategy in part of the company. At Superquinn, HR’s advocacy of a partnership approach in the context of a survival plan owed much to a legacy of constructive IR and paternalistic HR, combined with a strong emphasis on in-store problem solving at the firm. At Medtronic, co-ordinated decentralization in the parent firm’s approach to the conduct of HR continued during the recession, and HR at the local plant sought to focus its activities around securing the subsidiary’s mandate. No change in the direction or tempo of overall HR strategy was evident, nor any reconfiguration of the function. In Ericsson, regionally co-ordinated decentralization of aspects of HR, combined with the application of core corporate HR systems, especially in the area of competency management, continued into the recession and incorporated a competitiveness programme focused on cost reduction. Of all the case study firms, the HR function in Ericsson seemed to be best aligned in support of medium-term business strategy, but this posture had preceded the recession and had been largely unaffected by it.</p>
<p>Considering the case study companies as a whole, what remains striking is that so few significant changes emerge in the disposition, alignment or configuration of HR other than a focus on responding to short-term pressures. In responding to short-term pressures, primacy was attributed to maintaining pre-existing strategies and HR roles to the greatest degree possible. These findings mirror those of the focus groups, where few changes in the strategic direction of HR or few initiatives concerned to reconfigure the HR function came to light.</p>

<sec id="section8-0018726712451282">
<title>The professional boundaries and values of HR specialists</title>
<p>Could HR managers have become more vulnerable during the recession to forays by other managers into HR ‘terrain’? Forays into the domain of HR managers might have been spurred by the immediacy of commercial threats and the search for swift and definitive measures to defend firms against serious crisis or even extinction. Arising from their willingness to adopt the role of businesses partner and to exploit the professional opportunities presented by the recession, might HR managers have diluted their traditional professional values and ethical principles? These questions are answered in this section by drawing, in the main, on focus group data.</p>
<p>Focus group participants were asked to consider whether the recession had affected the balance of power between them and other management functions and levels. The predominant view was that HR’s area of activity or authority had not been encroached upon to any significant degree by other managers or by higher levels of management as firms struggled to cope with the effects of the recession. In firms where decisions had always been taken collectively by senior management teams that included HR managers, this had remained the case in the recession. In such instances it was noted that more time was probably now being devoted to HR issues in business meetings because HR issues were to the fore.</p>
<p>Some changes spurred by the recession brought in their train a higher level of accountability for HR managers. Where business management in general or HR management had undergone centralization, new pressures had sometimes arisen. Prominent here was the creation within some multinationals of HR ‘centres of excellence’, for example, in performance or talent management. Such developments reflected ongoing processes of corporate restructuring and development rather than the specific effects of the recession. However, new centres of excellence interacted with the effects of the recession to subject HR management to greater levels of transparency and accountability, as the costs and outcomes associated with HR practices in different locations had become clearer and more amenable to benchmarking. HR centres of excellence might also bring with them more involvement and influence from corporate levels in firms. In firms not affected by these kinds of restructuring, experiences varied. In one multinational company, corporate headquarters in the past had involved itself little in the business or in the HR of its Irish subsidiary. In the recession this had changed as a corporation-wide hiring freeze was instituted – though not, it appears, rigorously policed.</p>
<p>The interface between HR managers and line managers was also considered in the focus groups. In firms where line managers were formally recognized as the primary managers of human resources, HR continued to support line managers during the recession. Some HR managers reported that line managers had become more dependent on HR in the recession because they had little experience of managing in a downturn and now looked for advice and coaching from HR. An important aspect of the new role of HR was to provide advice and mentoring to managers dealing with the implications of retrenchment measures. Where significant changes were in play, there had been more requests for advice from line management. In one ICT firm HR sought to continue building the capability of line managers in creating a ‘line-led’ HR model. Coaching and ‘hand-holding’, sometimes of very senior executives, had been necessary in other cases, given the virtually unprecedented changes introduced:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was very involved … in ‘hand-holding’ a lot of people, through some very difficult conversations and giving them a sense of confidence, reassurance, the tools; and coaching them through some very difficult situations; trying to build their capability … bearing in mind that they hadn’t been through this for quite some time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One HR manager believed that the recession had heightened a dilemma associated with the welcome advent of business partnering, combined with the devolution of HR to line managers:
<disp-quote>
<p>We haven’t enacted [the business partner model] fully because we’re nervous. The corporation are saying to us, the HR people should be letting the line managers do their own discipline, do their own dismissals and stuff like that. But we know that on more occasions than one they would get it wrong and we’d be left picking up the pieces and have twice the work. So we’re staying very active in it to be honest.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Where firms had sought to tighten up the management of disciplinary procedures, it was claimed that line managers who had avoided confronting discipline problems in the past now needed to be trained to manage discipline and dismissal more effectively. In one firm an agreement with unions on new performance standards posed challenges for team managers, many of whom were viewed as effective operational managers but poor people managers:
<disp-quote>
<p>So I have to make sure it’s kind of as black and white as it can be and there is no grey. … The buck stops with me at the end of the day and I have to make sure that the managers are consistent in the way they’re applying the procedures.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, what is striking in the focus groups and also clear in the case studies is how little change appeared to have occurred in the interface between HR and other groups of managers. HR managers had sometimes become more accountable and found themselves engaged in more essentially transactional activities in their dealing with line managers (providing advice, policing policies etc.), but they appear not to have faced any significant level of encroachment on their role or terrain as a result of other managers’ seeking to exercise greater control or professional leverage as a result of the recession.</p>
<p>To what degree might HR managers have diluted their own professional values and ethical concerns in their enthusiasm to act as ‘business partners’ and to be seen as central to the management of firms in the recession? The picture that emerges from the focus groups is one of HR managers continuing to grapple with classical ethical dilemmas and tensions, without in any evident sense altering their professional identities to make themselves more palatable to other managers, who possibly had fewer ethical scruples. Some HR managers did wish to underscore what they saw as the continuing importance of acting in a professional way during the recession and of the dilemmas that might arise in that context. While the HR managers enthusiastically attested to the importance of engaging with business concerns and priorities, the importance of acting in a fair and consistent way and of continuing to be guided by values and principles was also emphasized. The survey asked HR managers whether they had gained more influence at the expense of a dilution of HR’s core concern with fairness. Seventy-two per cent disagreed that this had been the case. This finding was consistent with comments on the themes of fairness and consistency in the focus groups, which continued to be treated as important professional imperatives, even in the face of acute commercial pressures. In some firms fairness was seen to equate to higher paid staff being expected to bear a greater part of the burden of commercial adjustment than other staff. Though this was far from common, in two of the case study firms, the estate agent, Sherry FitzGerald, and the DAA, higher proportionate pay cuts were introduced for higher-paid staff to give expression to ‘fairness’ as a key principle.</p>
<p>One HR manager felt it incumbent on him to defend the established policy of no compulsory redundancies when this had come under pressure in senior management meetings:
<disp-quote>
<p>Someone says, ‘look I’ve got surplus people here that don’t meet your needs over there; they haven’t got the skills you need. Why don’t we just let these people go, hire in the people we need … because it will take too long to train them’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sometimes the principal challenges to values and policies HR sought to uphold came from line managers. Where downsizing had to be undertaken, the challenge could involve ‘trying to get control over line managers running away with themselves’. Line managers had sometimes sought to use downsizing as a means of addressing poor performance, leading to what was variously described as ‘convenient selection [decisions] justified under the guise of other processes’. As one HR manager saw it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some [line managers] were of the view … ‘why waste a good recession’ to [justify] parting company with people who had been a thorn in their side.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While HR managers might perhaps be expected forensically to avow professional values and principles, what was also striking in the focus groups and case studies was the degree to which an essentially traditional guiding image of ‘good human resource management’ continued to hold sway in the recession. A significant shift, or even imminent shift, in professional priorities and identity might be expected to involve a newly articulated set of guiding principles as to how ‘good HRM’ might now be given expression. However, both the focus groups and case studies pointed to the continuing influence of essentially traditional ideas of good practice as being about communicating well, engaging with unions (albeit more expeditiously than in the past), upholding HR policies and having regard to fairness in dealings with unions and staff.</p>

<title>Conclusions and discussion</title>
<p>The literature on the HR function is marked by continuing debate about continuity and change in HR roles, and some work on past recessions has informed this debate. This study presents for the first time quantitative and qualitative research data on the work of HR managers and the activities of HR functions during the current recession, drawing on the case of Ireland, where the recession has been both deep and enduring. The main findings can be summarized briefly. Some of the results that emerge from the research speak to the ongoing contemporary debates about the work of HR managers and changes in HR roles in organizations. First of all, while HR functions have commonly become ‘leaner’ during the recession and job losses have also occurred, the changes evident in resources, staff and in how the function is configured appear anything but cataclysmic. Second, the study found that HR managers have gained influence in decision-making in many organizations during the recession. For the most part, this new-found status is the result of firms being dependent on HR knowledge and expertise with respect to designing and implementing retrenchment programmes. Thus, HR managers have acquired the mantle of business partners owing to the knowledge they command in current circumstances: HR can make an authoritative claim on management decision-making owing to its recognized unique competences in helping firms navigate the rough seas of an economic recession. In many circumstances, their role has been constrained to developing and implementing short-term measures to keep businesses afloat. Thus, while HR managers have become ‘businesses partners’, they are also ‘working the pumps’ as businesses have struggled to survive. For the most part, the new business partner role of HR has not become strategically oriented or organizationally embedded in any reconfiguration of HR functions or how they align with businesses. The recession has not presented HR managers with opportunities to position the firm for the future, or to operate at the forefront of recovery. Thus, the big organizational realignment processes often considered necessary to allow HR to cement a strategic role have not happened. This research hints at an alternative way to view HR influence and status inside organizations. In particular, it may be more appropriate to view the firm as a repository of different forms of knowledge – embodied in different occupations, professional groups and departments – that wax and wane in importance over time and across different sets of organizational circumstances. From this perspective, the HR function is unlikely to acquire the status of business partner in some immutable way inside organizations, but may likely see its role and influence increase or decrease in importance accordingly to events.</p>
<p>As regards the import of the findings for debates about HR roles in the recession, discussed earlier, the following conclusions can be offered. The findings that emerge from this study sit uneasily with the claims of the literature on the effects of the recession on HR functions. Hardly a morsel of evidence was found to support the view advanced by some commentators that the recession provides the opportunity for the HR function to recast itself according to the principles of the much vaunted business partner model, wherein the capacity to contribute to strategy or to be a strategic HR champion is seen as pivotal. Nor has the recession had cataclysmic effects on jobs or resources or on the manner in which functions are configured. The picture appears to be more one of ongoing adaptation to changed circumstances than of disjuncture or radical reconfiguration or new strategic remit. Thus, it appears that the HR function will escape the abyss but it will not be entering nirvana. In general, HR managers remain capable of adapting to their new circumstances and securing an important role for themselves in organizations.</p>
<p>Some of the results that emerge from the research speak to ongoing debates about the work of HR managers and changes in HR roles in organizations that range beyond the effects of recessions. First, while HR managers have gained influence during the recession, this new level of influence has not in the main involved any significant change in the strategic influence of HR within organizations. Influence in management decision-making and influence in developing strategy are commonly viewed in the literature on HR as being intertwined, when, in fact, the research reported here suggests that they may be more ‘orthogonal’ – at least in recessionary conditions. It is clear that HR managers have never before been relied upon to such a degree by their managerial colleagues to help address business conditions, but it is equally apparent that this influence has been confined in the main to formulating and implementing sets of short-term and even reactive measures.</p>
<p>A second important insight from the research is that in grappling with multiple retrenchment measures HR managers have not been solely preoccupied with implementing a narrow set of technical practices. When hand-holding, counselling and problem solving to ensure the viability of the business, they have been guided by abiding and widely shared values about the appropriate actions to follow in recessionary times. These values, forged and rooted in the profession over the years, emphasize the importance of communication and information closure, of treating employees fairly, with dignity and respect, and of managers acting with probity and honesty. To be sure, one could quibble with the ‘depth’ of the policies being pursued in these ‘soft’ areas, but all aspects of the research indicated that HR managers continue to strive to act with decency and integrity. This finding sits uneasily with the argument that the HR profession is facing a legitimacy crisis as a result of it focusing too much on business priorities and organizational performance. This is not to say that modern HR managers are simply old-style personnel managers in ‘new garb’. Time and again in focus groups it emerged that HR managers are satisfied and even enthusiastic about their new-found role as business partners, but many wanted to emphasize that this new dispensation has not involved and should not involve any dilution in adherence to professional values or codes, or compromise their professional obligation to advocate what they feel is right and fair in the ways employees are treated. In other words, many HR managers were at ease blending a business partner role with a more traditional employee advocacy role.</p>
<p>Little evidence was found to support contentions that HR had fragmented as a professional field because HR managers were becoming unsure and uncertain about role performance and role boundaries. Most HR managers continued to be focused and assured amidst the organizational tumult triggered by the recession – many defined their remit as ensuring that the organization adjusted to the adverse business conditions in a manner that preserved HR and even IR legacies. Few indications emerged of a profession in the throes of an internal implosion brought about by having to perform a series of competing roles. If anything, HR managers were either relaxed or resigned to having to sustain multiple professional identities. Of course, it is important not to paint too positive a picture. Most HR managers found the situation they faced extremely demanding. Many experienced limits on influence, tensions, contradictions and sometimes professional shortcomings as they sought to limit retrenchment policies. Nevertheless, the evidence overall suggests that HR managers are not in a vortex of role ambiguity and confusion, heightened by the pressures of the recession.</p>
<p>The results of the study also speak to the important meta-narrative on changing roles that emerged from Legge’s seminal contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712451282">1978</xref>), which presaged so many of the ensuing debate on the evolution of the HR function. HR managers have responded to the pressures of the recession mainly in terms of what Legge would understand as ‘conformist innovation’: prioritizing short-run HR measures to support new business imperatives and even basic survival, albeit with continuing concern for engagement, motivation and commitment and without jettisoning traditional professional values. ‘Deviant innovation’ is hardly in evidence, either in the direction of advocacy of people-led business strategies favoured implicitly by exponents of strategic partnership and associated ways of configuring HR, or in the direction of the radical and essentially minimalist conceptions of the role and contribution of HR specialists canvassed in the work of other contributors on HR in recessions. Conformist innovation, as Legge well understood, continues to embroil HR managers in manageable ambiguities, strains and contradictions, while curtailing their power and limiting their influence over strategy. So the picture remains one of HR managers neither destined for hell nor heaven but confined still to purgatory as business partners ‘working the pumps’.</p>

<p>Time-trend extrapolation tests (Armstrong and Overton, 1977) were undertaken by comparing the pattern of responses on key variables for first-wave or early respondents with responses obtained in a second wave of survey fieldwork. The assumption is that later respondents are closest to the profile of non-respondents, given that they had responded to the survey following more reminders and further encouragement. <italic>T</italic>-tests for differences in scale means were also undertaken comparing first and second wave respondents for items measuring assessments of features of the HR function examined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712451282">Table 1</xref>. Only one item emerges as significantly different among early and later respondents. Chi<sup>2</sup> tests were undertaken comparing four features of the HR function examined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712451282">Table 1</xref> among first and second wave respondents. Only one item emerged as significantly different among early and later respondents. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that systematic non-response bias is not a significant problem in interpreting the results of the survey.</p>

<p>This strategy provided four groupings or ‘clusters’ of cases. The first cluster, comprising the largest number of cases, involved firms that had reduced pay-bill costs, avowedly to retain the maximum number of jobs. The second cluster involved cases where firms had sought to develop and implement survival plans. The third cluster involved instances where the subsidiaries of foreign-owned multinationals sought to renew their mandates within parent firms and needed to adjust to recessionary conditions to achieve this outcome. The fourth cluster involved leading multinationals in the process of global restructuring that had become linked in one way or other to the recession. These firms were also often known for implementing classical high-commitment work and employment practices. A final cluster, involving a small number (two) of cases, involved firms that sought to cut costs by involving their employees and sometimes their unions in measures that ring-fenced the pay bill. One case in this cluster (a non-unionised company) declined to become involved as a case study, and the other (Aughinish Alumina) was already well documented in the literature as a partnership company, and had managed to maintain partnership in the recession. As such, we dropped this cluster from the study, preferring to examine cases less well documented and understood. Cases were selected for study from these strata or clusters on the grounds that they seemed in broad terms typical of firms in these different circumstances and with a view to achieving a wide measure of variation by sector, scale and ownership and status with respect to union recognition.</p>
