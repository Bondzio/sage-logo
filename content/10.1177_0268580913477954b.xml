<p>There was a time in the United States when even live-and-let-live social liberals feared to get on a plane with anyone who looked Middle Eastern. To borrow from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913477954">Collins (2004)</xref>, this was the Hysteria Zone, which started when the second plane hit the second tower at 09:03 on 11 September 2001 and Americans of every stripe feared the worst. When the Hysteria Zone ended is unclear, but its impact was tremendous: the launch of two wars in the Middle East and a Global War on Terror, unprecedented expansion of the US foreign and domestic spying apparatus and, for Arab and Muslim Americans, a social status that worsened dramatically. Louise Cainkar’s <italic>Homeland Insecurity</italic> combines in-depth interviews with 102 Arab Muslims in the metropolitan Chicago area conducted between 2002 and 2005 – when America’s paranoia was at its peak – with media, policy and event analyses to document the vulnerable lives of Arabs and Muslims in early post-9/11 America.</p>
<p>Cainkar’s main thesis is that pre-9/11 history explains post-9/11 behaviour. Arab twentieth-century immigration to the US was marked by success and stereotypes. On average, and owing to some early selective immigration policies, Arabs had higher socioeconomic status and upward mobility than other immigrant groups and the population at large. At the same time, Arabs were subject to negative Orientalist stereotypes, such as them being ruled by a fatal combination of tribes, feuds, emotionalism and inherent brutality, united only in their hatred of the West. Like most ethnic groups, immigrant Arabs settled in neighbourhood enclaves, slowly assimilating while using the business, cultural and educational opportunities America provides to better the lives of their families, their communities and their country. Being a small minority, most Americans have little direct, interpersonal experience with the wide variety of Egyptian, Iraqi, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian and Yemeni Arabs, and to them Arab equals Muslim. In five moving oral histories (Chapter 2), we catch a glimpse of how first and second generation Arab and Muslim Americans, in an almost generic ethnic American experience, grapple with the issues common to all: finding faith, sharing love, rearing children, growing up, growing old and moving on.</p>
<p>After 9/11, Arabs and Muslims were accused of being terrorists, or of silently supporting the terrorists Americans believed were hiding in plain sight. In their shock and bewilderment, and in their long-standing ignorance of Arab and Muslim cultures, government, media and members of the public portrayed Arab and Muslim Americans as subversive outsiders. Chapter 4 catalogues the official government over-reaction: nationally, about 1200 Arab and Muslim males were immediately arrested and detained without charge (none of whom was found to be a terrorist), over 180,000 non-immigrant Arabs were subject to special registration, and untold thousands were visited and questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Cainkar harshly criticizes President George W Bush’s administration for sending a distorted message comprised of well-meaning speeches on why Arab and Muslim Americans are not the enemy and an all-out declaration of war on the Arab and Muslim enemy in America’s midst. As Attorney General Ashcroft vowed to defend American civilization, government rhetoric became a weapon of mass suspicion: it invited neighbour to spy on neighbour and allowed fears of ‘sleeper cells’ to move from bombastic spy novels to the evening news. A post-Cold War enemy was born.</p>
<p>Government rhetoric and policy, media coverage of the War on Terror and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim discrimination in public places created a ‘harassment climate’ which left Arab and Muslim Americans feeling that the government was out to get them and that the rule of law had disappeared. Almost half of the interviewees reported verbal harassment and over half reported discrimination. Incidences of physical assault were rare, a finding that matches the national experience. The combination of personal and collective experiences – they knew someone who knew someone whose <italic>hijab</italic> was pulled off at the shopping mall – heightened their sense of fear. Chapters 4 and 5 present individual accounts that highlight Arabs and Muslims’ precarious position as a vulnerable, stereotyped enemy of the state. The episodes occur in every area of social life, and the consequences are often humiliation, anger and fear that what happened to the Japanese during the Second World War would now happen to them. Chapters 6 and 7 turn to urban sociology to analyse the experiences of Arab and Muslim neighbourhoods in Chicago, including the tense situation of an anti-Arab/Muslim mob that had descended on a mosque, and the community response that repelled it. Cainkar finds that neighbourhoods that were active and socially well-integrated before 9/11 were the best prepared to withstand post-9/11 anti-ethnic behaviour. In the southwest suburbs of Chicago, however, where Arabs and Muslims were rather isolated, 9/11 was but a trigger for unleashing pre-existing anti-ethnic, nativist anger.</p>
<p>Cainkar does an especially good job of showing how anti-Arab/Muslim behaviour breaks along gender lines (Chapter 7). Males, considered the national security threat, were deported on minor visa violations or thrown in jail. Women were the cultural threat: some Americans saw the head-covering called <italic>hijab</italic> as a defiant difference and a sign of Muslim women’s submission to men and patriarchy that endangers American values of equality and freedom. As a consequence, <italic>hijab</italic>-wearing women were often subject to public acts of cruelty, such as being called ethnic epithets and yelled at to ‘go home’. Cainkar marvels at this strange mind-game: on the one hand, Americans value religious freedom, and on the other, some wish to deny this freedom to American Muslims.</p>
<p>Cainkar offers a warning: the overly aggressive and culturally insensitive government policies, born out of their acknowledged ignorance of Arab and Muslim culture, push Arab and Muslim Americans away from government and civil society and hinder the ability of local law enforcement to meaningfully engage with the communities they serve. These policies fail to make Americans safer.</p>
<p>In the midst of all the bad things following 9/11, good things also emerged (Chapter 8). Many Americans from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds did not verbally harass or discriminate against Arabs and Muslims; in fact, stories abound of how neighbours and strangers reached out to offer words of comfort and encouragement. The US proved to have a robust civil society that benefited many, as disparate non-governmental organizations banded together to fight the quasi-legal hell-hole Arab and Muslim Americans suddenly found themselves in. Most important of all, far from retreating, most Arab Muslims of this study bravely used the post-9/11 world to explore their religious identity, vocally oppose their plight and build bridges between them and the larger society. After 9/11, many women decided to wear the <italic>hijab</italic>, which paradoxically became both a target symbol and a means to religious liberation. Towards the end of the interview collection phase, most Arab Muslims reported a decrease in acts of public discrimination.</p>
<p><italic>Homeland Insecurity</italic> has flaws. It is unjustifiably repetitive, as it often offers the same information about Arab and Muslim mistreatment in repackaged phrases. For example, pages 71–73 are a virtual repeat of pages 64–67, and within a span of 40 pages Cainkar presents the statistic that ‘46 percent of interviewees experienced verbal assault after 9/11’ three times. The discussion of the special registration programme (pp. 128–141), which arguably impacted more Arabs and Muslims than any other and is a prominent example of post-9/11 government paranoia, is frustratingly unclear and disorganized, especially with regard to the programme’s history and its ties to related immigration policies, past and present. The media analysis is scant, often cherry-picking the worst, most overt, examples from the usual shock-jock suspects. Cainkar’s explanations are at points less compelling than the evidence she presents: the theory of how Arabs were ‘racialized’ (pp. 64–68) is not necessary to explain changes in Arab and Muslim social status; the theory that America’s support for Israel during the June 1967 war was a major negative turning point for the daily life of Arab and Muslim Americans is underdeveloped, and in any case does not help to explain their insecurity after 9/11 (after p. 86, the theory is not invoked).</p>
<p><italic>Homeland Insecurity</italic>, nevertheless, stands as an invaluable and durable document of Arab and Muslim life in early twenty-first-century America. Cainkar writes clearly, and despite the occasional foray into standard academic prose, it is a very accessible book for college-educated readers. It meaningfully integrates social science disciplines, especially ethnic and urban studies. Most importantly, it is a great resource for 9/11 studies. As we continue to memorialize 9/11, the conventional wisdom is that ‘everything changed’. What most scholars have not seriously asked is: What changed? How radical were those changes? And how long did those changes last? <italic>Homeland Insecurity</italic> goes a long way towards answering those questions for one of post-9/11 America’s most visible and vulnerable ethnic minority.</p>
