<abstract>
<p>As the Latino population in the United States experiences rapid growth, the well-being of Latino adolescents is a growing concern because of their high rates of mental health problems. Latino adolescents have higher rates of mental health problems than their peers, including depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, and violence. Sophisticated, realistic health promotion efforts are needed to reduce these risk behaviors and enhance protective factors. Parents and schools can be key protective factors, or assets, in adolescents’ lives. This article details the steps undertaken to develop Project Wings Home Visits, a collaborative school-based, community-linked mental health promotion intervention for Latino adolescents and their families. Core to the intervention is the use of a community health worker model to provide home-based outreach and education to parents of Latino adolescents. The intervention was developed using a community-based participatory research approach that involved the cooperation of a community health care system, a public high school, and a university. Our process demonstrates the benefits, strengths, and challenges of using community-based participatory research in creating and implementing health promotion interventions.</p>

<p>Although community-based participatory research (CBPR) is infused with philosophical values and principles that facilitate successful partnerships, few examples of long-term community/academic partnerships have been described in the health promotion literature (see, for two exemplars of successful long-term partnerships, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911404224">Israel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911404224">Lantz, Viruell-Fuentes, Israel, Softley, &amp; Guzman, 2001</xref>). Partners in sustained CBPR projects continuously negotiate shared decision making within and across their respective project responsibilities, politics, and pressures. This level and scope of collaboration requires substantial commitment from partners.</p>
<p>In this article, we seek to advance the science of participatory health promotion research addressing health disparities by describing the CBPR process undertaken to develop Project Wings Home Visits, a school-based health promotion intervention to address the common barriers Latino parents experience in supporting the mental health and academic success of their adolescents.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839911404224">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Latinos in the United States are expected to account for 25% of the U.S. population by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839911404224">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008b</xref>). By 2020, one in five U.S. teens will be Latino, representing a 60% growth since 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839911404224">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008a</xref>). Examination of Latino adolescent risk behaviors is sobering amid these demographic predictions. Latino adolescent females (Latinas) report high rates of suicidal attempts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009) and ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911404224">Garcia, Skay, Sieving, Naughton, &amp; Bearinger, 2008</xref>) compared with their peers; they also report very high rates of depressive symptoms, at twice the rate of their peers (40% of Latina adolescents compared with one in five teens overall; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911404224">Garcia, Skay, et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, Latino adolescents are more likely than their non-Latino counterparts to drop out of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911404224">Fry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839911404224">Pew Hispanic Center, 2004</xref>) and have higher rates of teen pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839911404224">U.S. Census, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1524839911404224">
<title>Barriers to Care</title>
<p>Health insurance coverage is a necessary conduit to accessing and receiving timely health care in the United States, yet Latino adolescents are the least likely among their peers to have health insurance coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911404224">Callahan &amp; Cooper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911404224">Kataoka, Zhang, &amp; Wells, 2002</xref>;). Latino youth are also the least likely to seek mental health care or to be cared for by a mental health specialist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911404224">Davalos, Chavez, &amp; Guardiola, 2005</xref>; Kataoka et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839911404224">Rawal, Romansky, Jenuwine, &amp; Lyons, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Latino parents may be hesitant to access mental health services for their youth because of limited language abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911404224">Kouyoumdjian, Zamboanga, &amp; Hansen, 2003</xref>), distrust in the Western medical care system, fear among those without legal immigration paperwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911404224">Cavazos Rehg, Zayas, &amp; Spitznagel, 2007</xref>), perceived stigma associated with mental health help seeking, and limited ability to recognize signs or symptoms of mental health problems that require intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911404224">Ho, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Addressing the Problem</title>
<p>The use of a community health worker health promotion intervention model to provide support, education, and outreach is recognized as a culturally relevant and engaging approach to addressing health disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911404224">Foster &amp; Stanek, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839911404224">Mack, Uken, &amp; Powers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911404224">Martin, Hernandez, Naureckas, &amp; Lantos, 2005</xref>). A community health worker is a paraprofessional who serves as a bridge between individuals or families within a particular community and resources such as counseling and social support, health education, advocacy, capacity building, and direct care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839911404224">Swider, 2002</xref>). Community health workers build a trusting, genuine relationship with those they serve, based on cultural, linguistic, or experiential commonalities; the benefits of this role in delivering health promotion interventions have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839911404224">Swider, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911404224">Whitley, Everhart, &amp; Wright, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The successes of community health worker initiatives have been demonstrated throughout the United States and Latin American countries in health promotion projects addressing diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911404224">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2005</xref>), tobacco use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839911404224">Martinez Bristow, Sias, Urquidi, &amp; Feng, 2006</xref>), cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911404224">Balcazar, Alvarado, Fulwood, Pedregon, &amp; Cantu, 2009</xref>), breast and cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911404224">Fernández et al., 2009</xref>), asthma management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911404224">Martin et al., 2005</xref>), and HIV/AIDS prevention (Katula et al., 2009). Recognizing the mental health problems experienced by Latino adolescents, the high rates of high school drop-out and minimal professional help seeking, and the successes of community health worker models, our collaborative team sought to develop an outreach health promotion intervention that would support Latino parents in encouraging the mental well-being and school success of their youth.</p>

<title>Multiagency Collaboration</title>
<p>Individuals from three distinct agencies—Saint Paul Public Schools, the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, and West Side Community Health Services—partnered to address mutual concerns about Latino adolescent mental health, school success, and access to care. The goal was to build on the strengths and values of Latino families through outreach to Latino parents in an effort to enhance their ability to identify mental health problems in their adolescents and to seek care when it is needed.</p>
<p>We discussed the limitations and constraints of the current systems available to Latino youth and their parents. Topics included lack of awareness of services, ideas for promoting youth health, and provision of resource and referral information. In these initial conversations, linking the school system with the community-based health care center using a community health worker outreach model emerged as a priority. Our discussions informed grant-seeking efforts to support developing and piloting the intervention; these efforts yielded two successful grants. Community partners contributed experience and anecdotal evidence; university partners offered insights grounded in health promotion theory and evidence in the literature. Using the core CBPR principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911404224">Israel, Eng, Schulz, &amp; Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839911404224">Wallerstein &amp; Duran, 2006</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839911404224">Figure 1</xref>), we describe our process below.</p>

<title>Development of a School-Based, Home-Visiting Outreach Model</title>
<sec id="section7-1524839911404224">
<title>Principle 1: Sees the Community as a Unit of Identity</title>
<p>Our collaboration focused on and identified the “community” surrounding Latino adolescents; namely, their families, schools, and broader community. To this end, the research team comprised individuals within the school setting (counselors, nurses, teachers, social workers), the community-based clinic (clinic manager, social worker), the family (parents, guardians), and the university (researcher, research assistants, community health workers). In total, 12 individuals contributed to development of Project Wings Home Visits; a subgroup of five constituted the project leadership team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839911404224">
<title>Principle 2: Builds on Strengths and Resources in the Community</title>
<p>In our early meetings, conversations ensued regarding the strengths and resources available to Latino parents and adolescents. For example, a school-based clinic is located within the selected public high school and offers a range of health and mental health resources. Clinic nurses collaborate with the school nurses to provide health care and are frequently the primary care providers for these youth. The school-based clinic does not directly outreach to parents; their mission focuses on caring for the adolescent in the school environment. These limitations informed development of our community-based outreach model to provide parents with support, education, and resources beyond those available through the traditional school-based mechanisms (e.g., counselors, social workers).</p>
<p>Additionally, the community clinic system is a Federally Qualified Health Center and has a history of successfully serving the Latino community in St. Paul for more than 40 years. The clinic sites are in close proximity to Latino communities, and they employ bilingual, bicultural staff in a variety of clinical and health promotion activities.</p>
<p>Finally, within the local public school system there is a unique state-legislated mandate that provides funding to support Latino student success through culturally relevant initiatives. A regular service offered is a monthly forum in which Latino parents, representatives of community-based organizations, and public school personnel can express concerns and recommendations pertaining to the education of Latino students. The leadership of this department garnered support from their Latino parent advisory board for Project Wings Home Visits, which was a significant asset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839911404224">
<title>Principle 3: Facilitates Collaborative, Equitable Partnerships in All Phases of Research</title>
<p>Equitable partnerships can be accomplished but require purposeful effort and commitment. School settings are often sought by researchers because the schools are convenient sites for recruiting potential research subjects and undertaking diverse research projects. School leadership and staff recognize this unilateral approach and often facilitate the research yet are not engaged partners in the process. These relationships often lack a foundation of mutual trust and motivation to collaborate, and valuable energy and resources are then expended in efforts to clarify roles, responsibilities, and power. From the onset, our partnership facilitated efficient and effective decisions about funding allocations and responsibilities. Educators, counselors, school nurses, social workers, and administrators participated in developing Project Wings Home Visits and a strategy for implementation.</p>
<p>Both a community and a university coinvestigator were identified on the grants we submitted, and funds were appropriately subcontracted to each community partnering agency to support staff effort and participation. Even in seemingly equitable collaborations, the allocation of funding to the university partner can establish perceptions of power imbalance. In our project, all collaborators discussed the requirements of the granting agencies in consideration of the needs and desires of our partnership prior to determining which agency should be the recipient. Ultimately, the decision to funnel funds through the university was made only after each community partner explored the possibilities of their agency being the financially responsible entity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839911404224">
<title>Principle 4: Promotes Colearning and Capacity Building Among All Partners</title>
<p>The planning process for this project has offered opportunities for all partners to build capacities. Through the development process, the entire team met weekly initially and then monthly. The early intensity of meetings promoted team building and gave opportunity to learn the intricacies of each agency and to promote unique strengths. Specific examples of colearning and capacity building include developing study paperwork/forms, completing required ethical protection of study participant training for team members, establishing the hiring process for community health workers, conducting mental health training for school staff and community health workers, and offering a mental health workshop for Latino parents in the school district.</p>
<sec id="section11-1524839911404224">
<title>Development of study paperwork</title>
<p>There were various challenges faced by the partners, including addressing university and school ethical requirements and ensuring that all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act guidelines were met. Because of the three specific agencies involved in this project, a new release of information form was prepared, finalized, and approved at the highest department levels of the respective agencies.</p>
<p>Community partners reported a wide range of experience with the research process, and for those with less experience, the process of creating the forms and determining questionnaire content to evaluate program outcomes was useful and informative. In addition, through multiple changes on the consent and questionnaire documents, the university-based researchers were able to respect the immediate research interests of the community partners and worked to ensure those data would be collected (e.g., youth school performance outcomes were of interest to school-based partners and included alongside measures of accessing care and mental health well-being).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839911404224">
<title>Protection of research study participants</title>
<p>Community-based team members needed to complete institutional review board requirements regarding the protection of study participants. This, too, provided for capacity building as community members gained insights and knowledge regarding the safe, ethical, and responsible conducting of research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524839911404224">
<title>Hiring process for community health workers</title>
<p>The partners agreed to have a community and a university partner involved in the hiring process for the community health workers. This created a mutual capacity-building opportunity, as each learned from the other in these processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1524839911404224">
<title>Conducting mental health training for school staff and community health workers</title>
<p>As part of the grant-funded project, a mental health training workshop was collaboratively developed and offered, not only to the staff hired to pilot Project Wings Home Visits but also to community health workers across the state. Community health workers were invited to attend the 1-day training and more than 50 individuals participated, representing various community organizations including schools, clinics, nonprofits, and social service agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1524839911404224">
<title>Offering a mental health workshop for Latino parents in the public school system</title>
<p>In addition, an educational workshop for Latino parents was conducted during one of the regular school system monthly outreach meetings. More than 60 parents attended, with more than 90 youth (i.e., adolescents in addition to children simply accompanying parents and requiring child care). The workshop, cofacilitated by a university researcher and a school staff member, provided parents with an overview about adolescent mental health and school-based resources and concluded with small group discussions. The majority of parents expressed a desire for more support and indicated they would like to be more connected to their adolescents’ schools.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1524839911404224">
<title>Principle 5: Integrates and Achieves a Balance Between Research and Action for the Benefit of All Partners</title>
<p>This principle has been best demonstrated in our planning process, specifically in participant recruitment and piloting of the program. Negotiating the process for study enrollment and identification of eligible families resulted in a strategy that meets the school district’s data privacy requirements and is reasonable for the university ethics review board.</p>
<p>Also, with respect to the content provided to parents in the home visits, steps were taken to ensure balance and agreement among the partners. The university partner sought expert input regarding topic areas for the home visits and brought this information back to the team. The team evaluated the topics, and school-based partners contributed additional topics they felt were critical and beneficial to the Latino families they serve, specifically school success, expectations, and attendance. At a team meeting, partners discussed this process and concurred that it was effective and successful in yielding relevant topics to cover with Latino parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1524839911404224">
<title>Principle 6: Emphasizes Local Relevance of Public Health Problems and Ecological Perspectives That Recognize and Attend to the Multiple Determinants of Health and Disease</title>
<p>This project was undertaken because partners realized the impact of mental health problems on the school success and well-being of Latino adolescents. The team also understood that these challenges reside within a context of stressors, risk and protective factors, and system-level barriers to educational attainment and wellness. Our strategy was purposeful, realizing that without a comprehensive level of partnership and intervention, the parents and adolescents would not be served in an effective, meaningful and holistic manner. For example, the linkage to a community health center provides the school-based community health workers with immediate resources that can be offered to parents. This is an ethical challenge faced by many who try to address the mental health needs in a community; if resources are not available, then the efforts to identify needs are arguably unethical and could cause more harm than benefit. For example, if a Latino adolescent needs counseling for a mental health problem and the school staff are unable to identify a bilingual resource for the family (possibly at the family’s request), the family may feel unattended or dissatisfied and may withdraw from seeing the school as a reliable resource. In this scenario, the youth may not receive needed care, and for future needs, the family may be hesitant to approach the school for assistance.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this project has been guided by an ecological model and complexity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839911404224">Resnicow &amp; Page, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911404224">Bronfenbrenner’s (1979)</xref> ecological model encourages awareness of multiple layers of influencing systems in the life of an adolescent, including schools, families, and broader societal contexts such as immigration policies. Complexity theory is valuable in understanding the challenges faced when undertaking preventive interventions addressing complex public health problems. Realizing that health behavior change is by nature difficult to predict and oftentimes the result of a unique co-occurrence of factors, complexity theory supports the notion of sustained interventions that provide regular doses of “x” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839911404224">Resnicow &amp; Page, 2008</xref>). Over time, personal and environmental factors will converge into a moment amenable to change; ideally, in this moment “x” is recalled or made available so that “y” behavior change occurs. In our program, we are providing Latino parents with resources and education not simply at one point in time but through multiple home visits during the school year. Complexity theory supports a reinforcing intervention approach, and we anticipate that this strategy will result in parents recalling and using resources when needs arise. For example, if a daughter demonstrates signs of depression, a mother may recall content from prior home visit conversations with the community health worker and be able to identify an agency or resource she can access to help her daughter. Furthermore, there are deeper potential behavior changes that may result from the education and modeling received in the home visits. Specifically, as parents learn more about normative adolescent behaviors, they may act in increasingly supportive and understanding ways toward their adolescents. This may increase adolescent willingness to seek help, and may also increase parental awareness of scenarios in which intervention is indicated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1524839911404224">
<title>Principle 7: Involves a Cyclical and Iterative Process</title>
<p>A specific example of our iterative process is the careful reassessment of how the success of the intervention would be evaluated. The original strategy was primarily focused on administering a self-report survey to the parents receiving the home visit program. The survey was modeled on a prior survey used with Latino adults to assess mental health knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911404224">Garcia, Gilchrist, et al., 2008</xref>). Included items ranged from knowledge of local mental health resources for adolescents and willingness to seek care for an adolescent to culturally based beliefs regarding adolescent mental health. Partners were in agreement that this self-report mechanism was important to gain insights on some outcomes of participating in Project Wings Home Visits. Importantly, the school-based partners articulated a desire to also obtain data from the adolescents themselves. Although adolescents were not the direct “recipients” of the program, all partners acknowledged, and hoped, that they would experience changes as a result of their parents receiving the program education, resources, and support. Subsequently, all partners participated in revising the plan for obtaining outcome data to include data from parents and from adolescents. The adolescent self-report survey included measures assessing individual- and social-level factors associated with mental well-being, such as depressive symptoms, coping, perceived stress, and connectedness to school, family, and parents (outcome data not presented in this article).</p>
<p>The original plan for evaluating program success also included assessing the process of the intervention, specifically the acceptability of Project Wings Home Visits. To accomplish this, the team chose to use a focus group strategy. Originally, the design included “selection” of parents to participate, but discussions during the study changed this course so that we invited every parent who had received a home visit to participate in a focus group. The focus group approach enabled parents to collectively reflect on the benefits and challenges associated with participating in this home visit program. Although program process data are beyond the scope of this article, they do, in part, demonstrate the value of the iterative process our team used. The parents in the focus group spoke positively about receiving the home visits; the protocol for the visits originally regimented the frequency of the visits (i.e., monthly), but this was adjusted during our program to enable the community health workers to conduct more frequent visits to meet parents’ needs. Regular team meetings enabled this iterative program development, which in part, contributed to parents reporting that they felt listened to and emphasizing how much they grew to trust the community health worker visiting their home.</p>
<p>Finally, this principle is demonstrated in the commitment of the team to regular and frequent meetings assessing and troubleshooting the implementation of the program. Specifically, these meetings facilitated timely examination of implementation progress, challenges, and successes. During these meetings, the partners routinely assessed our process by asking and answering key reflective questions (e.g., What is working well in the way we conduct our meetings?” “What changes are needed to improve our process?”). An example of how this assessment yielded stronger processes is the flexibility of the team meeting schedule such that partner meetings were very frequent during the development of the program and were less frequent during the implementation phase. Rather than adhere to a rigid routine, the partners recognized and committed to a meeting schedule that included periods of greater intensity. A cyclical process facilitates responsiveness to the demands of the program itself and the involved partners.</p>

<title>Principle 8: Disseminates Findings and Knowledge Gained to All Partners and Involves All Partners in Dissemination Process</title>
<p>This article highlights the collaborative process through which the partners developed the intervention and implemented the program throughout the 2009-2010 academic year. Active dissemination began in Spring 2010 and is ongoing. Researchers, school staff, and community health workers have presented to a statewide audience of mental health providers the challenges and successes of the home visit outreach model. Collaborators recently presented several papers at a national public health conference. Shared authorship of this article is a simple yet clear indication and demonstration of collaboration and capacity building of the partners.</p>

<title>Principle 9: Involves a Long-Term Process and Commitment</title>
<p>Previous dyad relationships between partners that had been nurtured over the years contributed to the development of the triad model of collaboration. School-based partners realized the importance of addressing mental health needs of their students to promote school successes. Community-based partners realized the schools are ideal places to reach many families who may not independently seek out services from a clinic setting. University-based partners understood the need for community-engaged projects that yield evaluation data so that sustainability and broader implementation can occur. The vested interest and mutual commitment of all partner organizations in the goals of the project resulted in a very successful process in which it was much easier to commit on all sides to work through challenges rather than to create barriers to success.</p>
<p>Looking forward, all are committed to long-term investment and effort. Community partners have grown to trust the university partner because they have worked with her on multiple projects and have observed her commitment to them and to the families being served. The university partner actively engages in the community and although this may not be possible for every researcher, it is critical for researchers endeavoring to conduct community-based participatory health promotion research projects. In addition, school-based staff partners have expressed a high level of satisfaction with Project Wings Home Visits and specifically appreciated the increased linkages between families and school and community resources that the intervention provided. There is desire to continue and expand the Project Wings Home Visits health promotion program, which bodes well for the sustainability and future examination of effectiveness.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Successful community–university partnered efforts incorporate core principles assuring commitment, equity, mutual benefit, capacity building, relevance, and focus. The complexity of contributing factors to the mental health problems experienced by Latino adolescents and their families necessitates equally complex health promotion intervention strategies. These types of strategies cannot be easily undertaken or achieved by one agency; they require collaborative efforts undertaken on a foundation of relationship and trust.</p>
<p>Our collaboration presented an opportunity to develop Project Wings Home Visits, an intervention that is grounded theoretically, scientifically, and experientially. Also, the real-world context gives credence to the intervention in terms of sustainability and practicality. The involvement of a university research partner contributes an element of rigor and expertise that can be lacking for community-only projects, and community programs benefited from high-quality data or “evidence” of their successes. The budgetary issues our team addressed helped identify systemic challenges that can get in the way of even the best efforts to share power and equity. Issues we encountered were addressed cooperatively and agreeably.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by the growing popularity of CBPR and suggest that careful attention to core CBPR principles will enhance population health, community–university partnerships, and the science of health promotion. We look forward to disseminating outcome findings from this program and hope to see additional examples of successful collaborations in the health promotion literature.</p>
