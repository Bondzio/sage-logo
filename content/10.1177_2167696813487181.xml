<abstract>
<p>Casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) such as hookups, one-night stands, friends with benefits relationships, and booty calls have received increasing attention in the past decade. This review examines the role of CSREs during emerging adulthood, as well as similarities and differences among the different types of CSREs. Furthermore, we examine the predictors and positive and negative consequences of engaging in CSREs. While research in the area of CSREs has provided important information about the development and course of these relationships/experiences, future research should focus on exploring these relationships/experiences using an integrated theoretical perspective and longitudinal methods, in diverse, noncollege samples.</p>

<body>
<p>While casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) are not an entirely new phenomenon (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2167696813487181">Fisher &amp; Byrne, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2167696813487181">Sonenschein, 1968</xref>), investigations in recent decades have established that most young adults experience—at some point—intimacy and/or sexuality outside of committed romantic relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813487181">Garcia, Reiber, Massey, &amp; Merriwether, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>). These uncommitted relationships/experiences are often defined specifically in contrast to committed relationships. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2167696813487181">Furman and Collins (2009)</xref> define romantic relationships as “mutually acknowledged, ongoing voluntary interactions; in comparison to most other peer relationships, romantic ones typically have a distinctive intensity that is usually marked by expressions of affection and current or anticipated sexual behavior” (pp. 341–342). They define anything outside of the context of romantic relationships, including dates, crushes, and hookups, as “romantic experiences.” Other researchers have termed these noncommitted relationships <italic>casual relationships</italic>, <italic>casual sex</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167696813487181">Grello, Welsh, &amp; Harper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2167696813487181">Hatfield, Hutchison, Bensman, Young, &amp; Rapson, 2012</xref>), and <italic>hookups</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813487181">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2167696813487181">Stinson, 2010</xref> for reviews). We use the term <italic>casual sexual relationships and experiences</italic> to comprehensively reflect the nature of these relationships/experiences. Specifically, these relationships/experiences are casual in that they occur outside of ongoing dating relationships (i.e., committed romantic relationships) and marital relationships. Notably, the word “casual” does not refer to the salience or importance of these relationships/experiences, but rather it denotes that these relationships/experiences occur outside of the context of formal romantic relationships. Second, CSREs are sexual because they involve sexual overtones and/or behavior. Finally, CSREs include experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2167696813487181">Furman &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>), but are not limited to experiences because individuals in a CSRE mutually affect each other and are interdependent. In other words, some types of CSREs meet the definition of a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2167696813487181">Berscheid &amp; Peplau, 1983</xref>). Therefore, the term <italic>CSREs</italic> reflects the wide variety of sexual relationships/experiences in which emerging adults engage.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a shift from studying solely the number of casual or uncommitted sexual partners an individual has to trying to understand the different forms these CSREs can take. While previous reviews have focused specifically on hookups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813487181">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2167696813487181">Stinson, 2010</xref>), the current article examines CSREs broadly, including other conceptualizations of relationships and experiences such as friends with benefits (FWB), booty calls, and one-night stands. Understanding these various CSREs is important, given that the different types of CSREs increase in prevalence during late adolescence and early adulthood. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167696813487181">Fortunato, Young, Boyd, and Fons (2010)</xref> found that 28% of 7th to 12th graders reported having a hookup. In college populations, the lifetime prevalence rates for CSREs are greater than 50%, ranging from 60 to 64% for FWB relationships and booty calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813487181">Jonason, Li, &amp; Cason, 2009</xref>) and between 53 and 84% for hookups and one-night stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813487181">Gute &amp; Eshbaugh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2167696813487181">Lambert, Kahn, &amp; Apple, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813487181">Paul, McManus, &amp; Hayes, 2000</xref>). While some studies find gender differences in rates of CSREs with men reporting engaging in a greater number of CSREs than women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167696813487181">Grello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011a</xref>), many studies suggest that rates of CSREs do not significantly differ between men and women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167696813487181">Paul &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that not only do CSREs occur (especially within a college environment), but that a majority of emerging adults, both men and women, will experience one or more of these CSREs.</p>
<p>Given the high prevalence rates of CSREs, fully understanding these different relationships/experiences and their precursors is crucial. This is especially important considering that CSREs have been associated with a multitude of potential negative outcomes during emerging adulthood, including lowered psychological well-being, physical dangers, and negative relationship outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder &amp; Carey, 2010a</xref>). In other words, CSREs are importantly linked to risky behavior, mental health, and key developmental tasks of emerging adulthood (including the successful navigation and establishment of positive romantic relationships).</p>

<title>Role of CSREs in Emerging Adulthood</title>
<p>The age period of 18–29, known as <italic>emerging adulthood</italic>, is an important period for the successful development of romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813487181">Arnett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2167696813487181">Arnett &amp; Tanner, 2006</xref>). However, there has been a shift in dating and relationships in the past several decades such that individuals are marrying at later ages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167696813487181">Bogle, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167696813487181">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167696813487181">Garcia &amp; Reiber, 2008</xref>). In the United States, the average age of first marriage has risen to 28.2 for men and 26.5 for women, which represents a peak for the last century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-2167696813487181">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, placing less importance on being married (marital importance) and the desire to delay marriage (marital timing) has been linked to sexual permissiveness in emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2167696813487181">Carroll et al., 2007</xref>). This delay in marriage means that for many individuals emerging adulthood is no longer a time of settling down with a long-term committed relationship as suggested by romantic stage theories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2167696813487181">Shulman and Connolly (2013)</xref> argue for “Coordinating Romance and Life Plans” as a transitional romantic stage during emerging adulthood. In this stage, emerging adults work through a variety of new relationship skills that were not relevant during adolescence before moving toward more long-term relationships. Specifically, emerging adults must navigate their own life tasks (such as work/education and the development of financial resources) and coordinate these decisions with their partner. Because social and economic circumstances in today’s world are highly unstable, working through these tasks has become difficult, leading emerging adults to postpone long-term commitments in favor of less restricting short-term involvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-2167696813487181">Shulman &amp; Connolly, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Instead, many emerging adults use this age period of increased freedom to experiment with different forms of romantic relationships and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2167696813487181">Cohen, Kasen, Chen, Hartmark, &amp; Gordon, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813487181">Arnett (2004)</xref> argues that emerging adulthood is a developmentally unique period where individuals feel like they are no longer adolescents but are not quite yet adults. Emerging adulthood, then, includes a time of exploration in which individuals may try out different sexual relationships and experiences in an effort to examine their own identity. This time period is also more unstable in terms of plans for the future and place of residence than other stages of life, resulting in diverse and fluctuating partners and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813487181">Arnett, 2004</xref>). CSREs during emerging adulthood, then, may provide individuals with the opportunity to develop their sexuality without the added component of an “adult-like” commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2167696813487181">Hamilton &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Before going into further details regarding the outcomes and predictors of CSREs during emerging adulthood, it is important to understand the various manifestations of CSREs. Indeed, these CSREs differ in terms of who participates (i.e., friends vs. strangers) as well as how long the relationship/experience lasts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2167696813487181">Jonason, Luevano, &amp; Adams, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>). The first section of this article provides an overview of the major CSREs (hookups, one-night stands, FWB, and booty calls). We primarily focus on how these CSREs have been conceptually operationalized and what evidence there is—if any—that each of these CSREs is unique.</p>

<title>Hookups</title>
<p>A “hookup” is one of the most commonly used terms to describe uncommitted sexual encounters, but it is also one of the least consistently defined terms in the area of sexuality research. Qualitative research has shown that while male college students share a vague general understanding of what a hookup is, interpretations of the emotional ties and sexual behavior implied vary across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813487181">Epstein, Calzo, Smiler, &amp; Ward, 2009</xref>). Emerging adults may be drawn to the ambiguity of the term, which allows a single word to describe a variety of sexual encounters and sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813487181">Epstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813487181">Glenn &amp; Marquardt, 2001</xref>). However, this imprecision creates issues in conceptualization for researchers.</p>
<p>Specifically, the hookup varies in regard to the types of sexual behaviors it encompasses, the length of relationship, who it involves, and if it includes or is separate from other CSREs. Definitions of hookups generally incorporate a great breadth of sexual activity from kissing to intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167696813487181">Bogle, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167696813487181">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2167696813487181">Hamilton &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2167696813487181">Stinson, 2010</xref>), although some researchers focus specifically on hookups involving sexual intercourse or oral sex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813487181">Gute &amp; Eshbaugh, 2008</xref>). Many researchers have either explicitly limited the hookup to a one-night encounter (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813487181">Paul et al., 2000</xref>) or implied that these relationships do not need to involve interaction past one night (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2167696813487181">Burdette, Ellison, Hill, &amp; Glenn, 2009</xref>). More recent definitions have moved toward a broader understanding that does not limit hookups to one-time encounters (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>). Current research remains inconsistent regarding if hookups occur only with relatively unknown individuals or if hookups also occur among friends. Some researchers limit hookup definitions to strangers or acquaintances (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2167696813487181">Barriger &amp; Vélez-Blasini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813487181">Paul et al., 2000</xref>), others specifically include friends in the definition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167696813487181">Fortunato, Young, Boyd, &amp; Fons, 2010</xref>), and many leave this distinction open to interpretation by defining a hookup as any sexual activity outside of a committed relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder &amp; Carey, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2167696813487181">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167696813487181">Garcia &amp; Reiber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2167696813487181">Owen, Rhoades, Stanley, &amp; Fincham, 2010</xref>). Qualitative studies suggest that participants themselves may use these definitions interchangeably, describing an FWB relationship as a booty call or hookup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813487181">Weaver, MacKeigan, &amp; MacDonald, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The wide range of definitions leads to inconsistency in measurement and confusion regarding whether hookups are an overarching category of CSRE or if they represent a separate type of CSRE. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813487181">Garcia, Reiber, Massey, and Merriwether (2012)</xref> specifically consider a hookup to differ from FWB relationships, whereas other researchers suggest hookups are synonymous with FWB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813487181">Glenn &amp; Marquardt, 2001</xref>) and one-night stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011b</xref>). Based on the definitions in the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman and Wade (2010)</xref> concluded that FWB relationships, one-night stands, and booty calls are all forms of hookups: “Hook ups include one-time sexual encounters (a ‘random’); multiple encounters, generally on the weekends, often without any regular contact during the week (a ‘regular’); infrequent sexual encounters with an acquaintance or friend late at night, generally after an ‘unsuccessful’ night of hooking up (a ‘booty call’); and repeat hookups with friends that do not involve a dating relationship (‘friends with benefits’ or ‘fuck buddies’)” (p. 324). We agree with Heldman and Wade that hookups represent an overarching category of CSREs because hookups cannot be easily differentiated from other CSREs (i.e., one-night stands and FWB) by the definitions currently in use. That is to say, the term <italic>hookup</italic> exists as a broad category; other CSREs (e.g., one-night stands, booty calls, and FWB) represent differing forms of hookups that vary in terms of the emotional connectedness of the individuals and if they include implicit repeated encounters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2167696813487181">
<title>One-Night Stands</title>
<p>From a historical perspective, the one-night stand is not new. However, it is just within the past 50 years that one-night stands have been recognized as an important topic of study in the scientific literature. For example, the one-night stand was recognized as a prominent relationship among homosexual men in the late 1960s, lasting only a brief period of time (a few minutes or hours to a full day or weekend) and occurring between individuals who did not know each other, or knew little about each other (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-2167696813487181">Sonenschein, 1968</xref>). The specific study of a one-night stand became more common over time, appearing in qualitative accounts of sexual behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-2167696813487181">Townsend, 1987</xref>) and with a high percentage of individual’s reporting having had a one-night stand by the late 1980s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-2167696813487181">Snyder, Simpson, &amp; Gangestad, 1986</xref>). In more recent decades, the one-night stand has become both a common lay term and scientific topic of investigation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Because one-night stands are, according to some researchers, synonymous with hookups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011b</xref>), there is a large deal of overlap between these experiences and hookups. One-night stands are primarily sexual relationships that occur one time only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2167696813487181">Cubbins &amp; Tanfer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2012</xref>). Because of the brief nature of the experience, one-night stands generally take place with strangers or brief acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>). Not surprisingly, as these experiences last only one night, one-night stands include fewer emotional acts than booty calls or committed romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167696813487181">Jonason, Li, &amp; Richardson, 2011</xref>). Emotional acts are more common than sexual acts within one-night stands, suggesting that emotional acts (e.g., hand holding, kissing) may be used to bring the encounter quickly to sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2167696813487181">
<title>Friends With Benefits (FWB) Relationships</title>
<p>Definitions of FWB relationships are fairly consistent within the literature and generally include the idea of sexual activity that occurs between friends who do not consider their relationship to be romantic (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011a</xref>). Researchers have found that in general FWB relationships do stem from preexisting relationships including friendships, romantic relationships, and sexual partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2167696813487181">VanderDrift, Lehmiller, &amp; Kelly, 2012</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2167696813487181">Mongeau, Knight, Williams, Eden, and Shaw (2011)</xref> argue for seven types of FWB relationships: true friends, just sex, network opportunism (friends/acquaintances who share network ties), successful transition into a romantic relationship, failed transition into a romantic relationship, unintentional transition into a romantic relationship, and transition out of a relationship. These different types of FWB relationships were qualitatively identified from descriptions of FWB relationships from a sample of 279 college students. The seven types were then validated in terms of friendship strength, nonsexual interaction, and romantic history in a subsequent study of 258 undergraduates who had experienced an FWB relationship. This study suggested that true friends was the most frequent type of FWB relationship individuals reported having, but it only represented one fourth of the total FWB relationships reported. Because FWB relationships can differ with regard to who participates, some researchers allow individuals to use their own definition of FWB relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2167696813487181">Furman &amp; Shaffer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>FWB relationships differ from other CSREs in a number of ways. FWB relationships allow an individual to engage in sexual activity with someone in an ongoing friendship relationship while avoiding commitment associated with romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>). As such, FWB relationships are more stable and include an aspect of respect and emotional involvement not found in other CSREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813487181">Lehmiller, VanderDrift, &amp; Kelly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, individuals participating in FWB relationships share a friendship on top of the sexual aspect of their relationship, making FWB relationships particularly difficult to navigate. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson and Levine (2009)</xref> found that about 48.9% of college students who had experienced FWB relationships expressed uncertainty about the relationship. Specifically, individuals felt unclear about what to call the relationship, how to maintain the relationship, and the future of the relationship. Individuals also expressed concerns about remaining friends after having engaged in sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>FWB relationships may be more likely than other CSREs to include communication regarding sexual monogamy and discussion regarding how to approach the sexual component of the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813487181">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>). Although a majority of individuals in FWB relationships report being exclusive, approximately 25–40% of them are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813487181">Lehmiller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2167696813487181">Vanderdrift et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813487181">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>). Of those who had additional partners, about 40% had made their FWB aware that they were sexually involved with other individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813487181">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that communication about monogamy is fairly common in FWB relationships.</p>
<p>Although communication about monogamy is a part of FWB relationships, communication about other aspects of the relationship may be lacking. Research has shown that the majority of individuals (84%) who have had an FWB relationship did not discuss their relationship even if they have reservations about how to negotiate the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, only 27% of these relationships involved a discussion of relationship “ground rules.” However, effective communication can make an FWB relationship more successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2167696813487181">Goodboy &amp; Myers, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2167696813487181">Hughes, Morrison, and Asada (2005)</xref> found that emotional rules (e.g., not becoming too emotionally attached), communication rules (i.e., guidelines for honesty and talking with each other), and sex rules (e.g., condoms and monogamy) were the most frequently reported rules needed for the maintenance of FWB relationships.</p>

<sec id="section6-2167696813487181">
<title>Booty Calls</title>
<p>The literature on booty calls is relatively new, emerging in the last 5 years. A booty call has been defined as “a communication initiated towards a non-long-term relationship partner with the urgent intent, either stated or implied, of having sexual activity and\or intercourse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2009</xref>, p. 462). This term can function as both a noun to describe a person contacted for the purpose of sex or a verb used to describe arranging a sexual meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-2167696813487181">Nelson, Morrison-Beedy, Kearny, &amp; Dozier, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These relationships acknowledge the influence of social media on the way individuals engage in CSREs and have the unique factor of involving the use of cell phones and other technology to initiate sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2009</xref>). While these relationships are recurring, qualitative accounts suggest that they tend to be less positive in nature than an FWB relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>). They are often a last resort or are initiated when other hookup attempts have failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813487181">Jonason, Li, and Cason (2009)</xref> argue that booty calls involve both short-term and long-term relationship factors and are therefore appealing to men and women for different reasons. Specifically, they include features of long-term relationships (some emotional intimacy) that are appealing to women, but they also include less commitment than committed romantic relationships which is appealing to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167696813487181">2011</xref>). Qualitative data suggest that individuals in booty-call relationships have little affection for each other and do not engage in mutual activities outside of sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Fuck Buddies and Other CSREs</title>
<p>While hookups, FWB, one-night stands, and booty calls have received the most attention in the scientific literature, emerging adults use a variety of other terms to describe CSREs. For example, fuck buddies have received little attention in empirical research thus far, which may be because of the potential overlap with FWB relationships. However, these relationships were identified by participants in a qualitative study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland and Reissing (2011)</xref> as separate from FWB relationships. These relationships, participants suggested, are more derogatory than an FWB relationship but imply more recurring contact than a booty call. Further research is needed to tease apart the nature of fuck buddies, as well as other CSREs mentioned by emerging adults such as “play buddy,” “bang buddies,” “hit it and quit it,” and “last calls” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813487181">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-2167696813487181">
<title>Dimensions of CSREs</title>
<p>While terms and definitions for the various CSREs may vary, there are at least two dimensions on which CSREs differ. Specifically, relationships/experiences vary on the number of times the encounter occurs (i.e., one-night stands happen once, whereas booty calls and FWB relationships reoccur) and how close the individuals are before the event occurs (strangers/acquaintances vs. friends). FWB relationships, booty calls, and one-night stands can be placed in distinct categories based on these two dimensions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2167696813487181">Figure 1</xref>). This also suggests that researchers may need to examine the possibility of a new relationship category that may be specifically a one-time only sexual encounter with a friend.</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to advance research in this field, it is important to develop conceptual and operational definitions that are distinctive and mutually exclusive. As it stands, hookup definitions overlap with booty calls when they include only strangers and acquaintances and overlap with FWB when they include friends. Given this overlap, we recommend that hookups be considered an overarching category of CSREs (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, research needs to utilize consistent definitions if we want to truly understand the potential differences and similarities between the CSREs. Despite these limitations, current research has discovered a number of common predictors and outcomes of these different CSREs.</p>

<sec id="section9-2167696813487181">
<title>Predictors</title>
<p>Researchers have unearthed a number of predictors of engagement in CSREs. With few exceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder &amp; Carey, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167696813487181">Owen, Fincham, &amp; Moore, 2011</xref>), research on predictors of CSREs has, however, been cross-sectional. This research has primarily focused on closeness and intimacy, personality, personal and religious values, alcohol use, situational triggers, and partner characteristics.</p>
<sec id="section10-2167696813487181">
<title>Closeness and Intimacy</title>
<p>Having high levels of intimacy goals (desire for self-disclosure and mutual dependence within a relationship) has been linked with lower levels of sexual activity in casual sexual contexts for adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2167696813487181">Sanderson &amp; Cantor, 1995</xref>). Adult attachment styles have also been implicated in involvement in CSREs. Securely attached individuals, who tend to have trusting, lasting relationships, have been found to report fewer one-night stands and hookups as well as fewer total numbers of partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2167696813487181">Cooper, Shaver, &amp; Collins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813487181">Paul et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals with avoidant attachment styles may follow one of the two patterns: They may avoid sexual intercourse all together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2167696813487181">Cooper et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2167696813487181">Kalichman et al., 1994</xref>) or they may engage in casual sex, which has an absence of emotional involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2167696813487181">Brennan &amp; Shaver, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2167696813487181">Feeney, Noller, &amp; Patty, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813487181">Simpson &amp; Gangestad, 1991</xref>). Those with anxious attachment crave closeness but have difficulty maintaining this closeness. In general, these individuals are not accepting of casual sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2167696813487181">Brennan &amp; Shaver, 1995</xref>). Their desire for intimacy, however, can make them prone to risky sexual experiences because they may have sex out of a fear of losing their partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-2167696813487181">Tracy, Shaver, Albino, &amp; Cooper, 2003</xref>). These individuals have been found to have unwanted but consensual sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2167696813487181">Gentzler &amp; Kerns, 2004</xref>). Gender differences have also been found, such that the link between anxious attachment and casual sex is stronger for females than males and the link between avoidant attachment and sexual risk taking is stronger for males than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2167696813487181">Bogaert &amp; Sadava, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2167696813487181">Kalichman et al., 1994</xref>). Overall, individuals who have secure attachment styles, characterized by low levels of anxiety and avoidance, and individuals who have high levels of intimacy goals appear to have low levels of CSRE engagement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2167696813487181">
<title>Personality</title>
<p>Personality characteristics have also been found to be related to CSRE involvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2167696813487181">Gute and Eshbaugh (2008)</xref> found that neuroticism and extroversion were positively associated with hooking up, whereas agreeableness and conscientiousness had a negative relationship to hooking up behaviors. Other personality traits such as impulsivity and sensation seeking have also been positively related to engagement in casual sex (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2167696813487181">Hoyle, Fejfar, &amp; Miller, 2000</xref> for a review). While the relationship between impulsivity and sexual risk taking has a somewhat weak effect size, sensation seeking has been associated with engaging in unprotected sex, having multiple partners, high-risk sexual behaviors (including casual sex), and the overall number of sexual partners an individual has had (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2167696813487181">Hoyle et al., 2000</xref>). It appears that high sensation seekers evaluate these high-risk sexual activities as less perilous than individuals who are lower on sensation seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2167696813487181">Hoyle et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, narcissism and psychopathy have also been linked to greater CSRE involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2012</xref>). While research is still needed to fully understand the mechanisms that drive the relationships between personality and engagement in CSREs, it appears that both specific traits such as sensation seeking and impulsivity as well as broader personality dimensions (i.e., openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) are associated with involvement in CSREs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2167696813487181">
<title>Personal and Religious Values</title>
<p>Personal values, especially regarding casual sex, also predict engagement in CSREs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-2167696813487181">Puentes, Knox, and Zusman (2008)</xref> found that individuals who valued hedonism (the idea that “if it feels good, do it”) were more likely to have an FWB relationship than those who thought that sex was acceptable within a loving relationship (relativism) or those who believed that intercourse was never acceptable before marriage (absolutism).</p>
<p>Similarly, religious values have also been related to CSRE involvement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2167696813487181">Burdette, Ellison, Hill, and Glenn (2009)</xref> found that women with higher church attendance were less likely to hook up. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-2167696813487181">Penhollow, Young, and Bailey (2007)</xref> found that frequency of religious service attendance and degree of religious feelings were negatively related to hookup behavior and could predict if an individual had ever hooked up and if the hookups included sexual intercourse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2167696813487181">Owen, Rhoades, Stanley, and Fincham (2010)</xref> found that religiosity was related to lower hooking up for women but not men. In general, having personal values that admonish premarital sex as well as having strong religious values may lower an individual’s proclivity toward engaging in CSREs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-2167696813487181">
<title>Alcohol Use</title>
<p>Alcohol use (both frequency and quantity) has been consistently associated with higher numbers of sexual partners and risky sexual experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2167696813487181">Cooper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2167696813487181">Desiderato &amp; Crawford, 1995</xref>; Grello, et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2167696813487181">Halpern-Felsher, Millstein, &amp; Ellen, 1996</xref>). Alcohol use has been implicated in participation in several CSREs, including FWB relationships, hookups, and one-night stands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167696813487181">Grello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167696813487181">Owen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813487181">2011b</xref>) and is associated with feeling regret after engaging in CSREs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167696813487181">Fisher, Worth, Garcia, &amp; Meredith, 2012</xref>). In fact, alcohol use is the most highly cited reason that college students give for engaging in CSREs. Although alcohol is an important precursor for CSRE engagement, this does not mean that alcohol is always involved. There is evidence that alcohol use may only be associated with the first sexual encounter within FWB relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>) and many individuals report engaging in CSREs while sober (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167696813487181">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-2167696813487181">
<title>Situational Triggers and Partner Characteristics</title>
<p>In addition, several situational triggers and partner characteristics are implicated in CSRE engagement. In a short-term prospective study of 140 first-semester college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder and Carey (2010a</xref>) identified two consistent predictors of hookup partners in addition to peak intoxication levels: prior hookup behavior/number of hookups and the effect of situational triggers on an individual’s willingness to hookup (e.g., “when it seems like everyone else is hooking up”). In addition to these predictors, participants have stated a variety of other reasons that individuals engage in CSREs. For example, men often cite social environmental reasons such as increased status and popularity, whereas women cite interpersonal reasons such as hoping their casual relationship/experience might evolve into a more committed romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-2167696813487181">Regan &amp; Dreyer, 1999</xref>). Other common reasons endorsed by participants include having sex while avoiding commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>), sexual desire, spontaneous urges, the attractiveness of one’s partner, wanting to feel attractive/desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2167696813487181">Fielder &amp; Carey, 2010b</xref>), emotional gratification, and because other people are doing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167696813487181">Garcia &amp; Reiber, 2008</xref>). These findings suggest that a number of situational triggers including desire, peer pressure, and the attractiveness of one’s partner might make CSRE engagement more likely.</p>

<title>Consequences of CSREs</title>
<sec id="section16-2167696813487181">
<title>Negative Psychological Outcomes</title>
<p>Research on CSREs thus far has primarily focused on the potential negative outcomes of these relationships/experiences. Research findings demonstrate that there are a number of negative emotional effects associated with engaging in CSREs including feeling used, regret, guilt, shame, and anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2167696813487181">Eshbaugh &amp; Gute, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167696813487181">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813487181">Glenn &amp; Marquardt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167696813487181">Paul &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813487181">Paul et al., 2000</xref>). Individuals who engage in CSREs are also at risk for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2167696813487181">Grello et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that these effects may persist across time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder and Carey (2010a</xref>) found evidence in a prospective study of first-semester college students that penetrative sex outside of a committed relationship led to increased psychological distress (measured by the CES-D) in women 2½ months later.</p>
<p>CSREs may also have negative effects on self-esteem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-2167696813487181">Paul, McManus, and Hayes (2000)</xref> found that college students with a history of involvement in casual sex (sex outside of committed relationships) reported lower self-esteem than students who had been involved in only committed sexual relationships and individuals who did not engage in sexual behaviors. The causal direction of the relationship between self-esteem and participation in casual sex, however, is not entirely clear. It may be that individuals with low self-esteem are drawn to CSREs. Some research does support a causal relationship between hooking up and lower levels of self-esteem. In their short-term prospective study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder and Carey (2010a</xref>) found that females who began hooking up did not have lower self-esteem than those who did not engage in hookups. Follow-up analyses, however, indicated that the group of females who hooked up but did not engage in sexual intercourse had higher self-esteem at a later time point than females who engaged in sexual intercourse in a hookup context. Thus, it could be that self-esteem is linked not simply to engaging in a CSRE but more importantly choices regarding sexual behavior within the CSRE context. While findings are not conclusive (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2167696813487181">Eisenberg, Ackard, Resnick, &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2009</xref> for null findings) and more longitudinal work is needed to fully understand the effects of engaging in CSREs, research does suggest that CSREs may be associated with negative emotional consequences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-2167696813487181">
<title>Gender Differences in Psychological Outcomes</title>
<p>It is also important to note that gender plays a role in the manifestation of these potential negative psychological outcomes. Importantly, these negative psychological effects may be more pronounced for women than for men (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813487181">Campbell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-2167696813487181">Townsend &amp; Wasserman, 2011</xref>). Men tend to report more pleasure and less guilt and regret after engaging in CSREs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2167696813487181">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167696813487181">Paul &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>), and in general there are more social and physical gratification benefits of engaging in CSREs for men than women (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, studies have found that men who did not engage in hookups actually had higher psychological distress than those who did engage in hookups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder &amp; Carey, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers have argued that the double standard regarding sexuality for men and women makes CSRE engagement more damaging for women and gives men power in CSREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2167696813487181">Manning, Giordano, &amp; Longmore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2167696813487181">Stinson, 2010</xref>). As such, CSREs may enable sexual assault victimization, especially for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2167696813487181">Flack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman &amp; Wade, 2010</xref>). Sexual assault victimization is potentially facilitated in CSREs because both men and women overestimate how comfortable same-sex as well as opposite-sex individuals are with uncommitted sex while men are in general more comfortable with uncommitted sex than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2167696813487181">Lambert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2167696813487181">Reiber &amp; Garcia, 2010</xref>). Researchers suggest that this combination puts women in a position of engaging in CSREs despite discomfort because they believe it is normative and men in a position of inadvertently pressuring women to engage in casual sex because they feel at ease with the behavior and overestimate a women’s comfort level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2167696813487181">Lambert et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-2167696813487181">Reiber &amp; Garcia, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2167696813487181">Lambert, Kahn, and Apple (2003)</xref> suggest that therefore sexual assault may occur within the context of CSREs but go unrecognized by some women. Furthermore, even if CSREs do not lead to sexual assault, women are less likely than men to be sexually satisfied during a casual sexual encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2167696813487181">Armstrong, England, &amp; Fogarty, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Physical Dangers</title>
<p>In addition to negative psychological outcomes, engaging in CSREs has been equated with sexual risk taking and may have implications for the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unplanned pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2167696813487181">Manning et al., 2006</xref>). While many individuals do report using condoms within these relationships/experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813487181">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>), CSREs are often unplanned and therefore likely involve unprotected sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2167696813487181">Downing-Matibag &amp; Geisinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2167696813487181">MacDonald &amp; Hynie, 2008</xref>). For example, most individuals report using condoms during sexual intercourse within FWB relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-2167696813487181">Vanderdrift et al., 2012</xref>), but few use condoms or other protection for oral sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-2167696813487181">Weaver et al., 2011</xref>). This is particularly problematic given that unprotected oral and anal sex may have contributed to rising rates of STIs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2167696813487181">Leichliter, Chandra, Liddon, Fenton, &amp; Aral, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, these relationships/experiences lack the communication of traditional committed relationships, which may mean that individuals feel uncomfortable bringing up the subject of condom use with their partner/partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>). Finally, CSREs are less likely to be monogamous than traditional committed romantic relationships, and more importantly, often (except for FWB relationships) do not include a conversation about monogamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland &amp; Reissing, 2011</xref>), which may be another reason for concern regarding STI transmission.</p>

<sec id="section19-2167696813487181">
<title>Romantic Relationship Outcomes</title>
<p>Research has also examined how CSRE engagement is related to expectations for the CSRE itself as well as for future relationships. CSREs often lack communication about future expectations about the relationship/experience. Although equal numbers of men and women report that they hookup with the goal of beginning a romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167696813487181">Garcia &amp; Reiber, 2008</xref>), women are more likely than men to express desire to have an FWB relationship or a hookup morph into a romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2167696813487181">Garcia &amp; Reiber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2167696813487181">Lehmiller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813487181">2011b</xref>). This may vary across the different CSREs, however. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813487181">Campbell (2008)</xref> found evidence that women did not have disappointment that one-night stands did not develop into anything more.</p>
<p>While individuals may not always hope that a CSRE will become a romantic relationship, researchers have argued that engaging in CSREs harms an individual’s potential to develop the necessary skills for successfully navigating committed romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2167696813487181">Glenn &amp; Marquardt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2167696813487181">Manning et al., 2006</xref>). Emerging adults who have engaged in FWB relationships, for example, appear to have less thoughtful relationship decision-making processes than those who have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011a</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2167696813487181">Owen and Fincham (2012)</xref> found only slight differences in relationship satisfaction between couples who began their current relationship as an FWB relationship before transforming it into a committed romantic relationship and those who did not start out as an FWB relationship.</p>

<title>Positive Outcomes</title>
<p>While empirical research has pointed to a number of potential negative effects of CSREs, very little is known about the potential positive implications of these relationships/experiences. A small amount of research has focused on the short-term positive emotional reactions individuals have to CSREs. Both men and women report that their emotional reactions to hookups and FWB relationships are more positive than negative, although again men tend to have more positive and less negative emotional reactions than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2167696813487181">Owen &amp; Fincham, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2167696813487181">2011b</xref>). These positive emotional reactions include feeling happy, desirable, pleased, and excited. Furthermore, research has found that many individuals do not regret their CSREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2167696813487181">Fielder &amp; Carey, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>It seems likely that just as there is variation in satisfaction with romantic relationships, individuals may find some CSREs to be more pleasurable than others. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167696813487181">Paul and Hayes (2002)</xref> found that hookups were most enjoyable when they involved interest and attraction, an attractive partner, and were physically pleasurable. The worst hookups, on the other hand, were quickies in a car, club, or bar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2167696813487181">Paul &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>). CSREs may also be easier and less time consuming than traditional romantic relationships and, according to college students, have the potential to be less emotionally damaging than a bad romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2167696813487181">Armstrong, Hamilton, &amp; England, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2167696813487181">Hamilton &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>). For example, FWB relationships may allow individuals to become closer to a friend and feel positive emotions while avoiding the pressure of commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2167696813487181">Bisson &amp; Levine, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, most CSREs likely include both positive and negative aspects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2167696813487181">Campbell (2008)</xref> examined individual accounts of positive and negative feelings the morning after their last one-night stand (defined as having sex with an individual without the relationship going further). Positive items included “private feelings” such as feeling sexually satisfied and confident, as well “public esteem factors” such as hoping a friend would hear about the encounter or feeling successful because the partner was desirable. Negative items focused on “interpersonal relationships” (e.g., regret about feeling used), “private concerns” (e.g., scared about possible pregnancy), and “public reputation” (e.g., worried about loss of reputation if other people found out). Although they found an overall bias for positivity, women had lower positive scores than men and the net benefit (negative subtracted from positive sores) scores were low, indicating that individuals experienced a mixture of positive and negative feelings after one-night stand encounters.</p>

<title>Conceptual and Methodological Limitations of Previous Research</title>
<p>While research has made a number of advances in our understanding of CSREs, there still remain several questions about the nature of these relationships/experiences. Because much of the research on CSREs has been descriptive in nature, we still know very little about nondescriptive differences in CSREs. There are also questions about how these relationships/experiences vary in different cultures, across sexual orientations, and in noncollege populations.</p>
<sec id="section22-2167696813487181">
<title>Distinctiveness of CSREs</title>
<p>While researchers treat CSREs as distinct categories, there remains a lack of research scientifically testing this assumption. This is problematic considering that the boundaries between these different relationships/experiences are not always clear and because one CSRE can morph into another, with a one-night stand transitioning into a booty call or FWB relationship, or, occasionally, a committed relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167696813487181">Bogle, 2007</xref>). Indeed, evidence from qualitative and quantitative studies suggests that the different CSREs may be more similar than they are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813487181">Epstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2011</xref>). Very few studies have collected information about multiple CSREs in a single-study design, so we know little about if these CSREs have any differential outcomes and predictors.</p>
<p>The few researchers who have examined multiple relationships/experiences at a time have found limited evidence for differences in associated constructs. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2167696813487181">Jonason, Luevano, and Adams (2012)</xref> found evidence that narcissism was associated with preferences for one-night stands and FWB relationships, whereas psychopathology was associated with booty-call relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2167696813487181">Jonason, Li, and Richardson (2011)</xref> also found differences in terms of the types of sexual and emotional acts found in booty calls, one-night stands, and committed romantic relationships. Bay-Cheng, Robinson, and Zucker (2008) found that for women, FWB relationships were associated with higher ratings of desire, wanting, and pleasure than hookups.</p>
<p>Qualitative research has also suggested that there are both similarities and differences between CSREs. For example, a qualitative research study of 19 college-age males conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2167696813487181">Epstein, Calzo, Smiler, and Ward (2009)</xref> found that while men provided separate scripts for hookups and FWB relationships, their real-life experiences involved alterations that blurred the boundaries between the two types of experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-2167696813487181">Wentland and Reissing (2011)</xref> found that when describing CSREs, individuals reported some clear differences between one-night stands, booty calls, fuck buddies, and FWB relationships in regard to the frequency of contact, the type of contact (sexual or sexual and social), personal disclosure, discussion of relationship, and existence of a friendship between individuals. However, future research is needed to fully understand these differences and similarities. For example, initial work from our research lab has suggested that there may be two typologies of relationship/experience involvement: those who engage only in committed relationships and those who have a high probability of engaging in committed relationships as well as all forms of CSREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2167696813487181">Claxton &amp; van Dulmen, 2011</xref>). These findings are consistent with earlier conceptualizations of the nature of sexual involvement. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2167696813487181">Dhariwal, Connolly, Paciello, and Caprara (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-2167696813487181">Simpson and Gangstad (1991)</xref> propose distinctions between individuals who engage in CSREs and those who only engage in committed relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-2167696813487181">
<title>Generalizability</title>
<p>We know little about the presentation of different CSREs across ethnic, sexual orientation, and educational backgrounds. Limited research in the area of cultural and ethnic differences has suggested that the rates of CSRE engagement may vary by ethnicity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2167696813487181">Owen et al. (2010)</xref> found that Caucasian students were significantly more likely to have hooked up in the past year than students from other ethnicities (except multiethnic). However, they did not find ethnic differences in emotional reactions to hooking up. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2167696813487181">Eisenberg, Ackard, Resnick, and Neumark-Sztainer (2009)</xref> found in a sample of 1,311 emerging adults that the percentage of individuals reporting that their last sexual partner was casual varied by ethnicity. Specifically, 42.9% of Black and 26.4% of Hispanic males (compared to 28.5% of White males) reported that their last sexual partner was casual. For females, 36.4% of Native American females and 18.5% of Hispanic females (compared to 15.7% of White females) reported that their last partner was casual. Thus, findings on ethnicity and CSREs seem to be inconsistent depending on if the research is examining an individual’s last partner or CSRE partners over a longer time period. While it appears that there may be differences in the rates of CSREs among different ethnic groups, research has not yet examined differences in the presentation, predictors, and outcomes of CSREs in these different subgroups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of this research has occurred within the United States and Canada, leaving questions regarding how CSREs vary across countries. Cultures differ regarding their acceptance and representations of sexuality (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2167696813487181">Higgins, Zheng, Liu, &amp; Sun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-2167696813487181">Sprecher &amp; Hatfield, 1996</xref>). Therefore, the implications and outcomes of engaging in CSREs may vary based on cultural values regarding sexual behavior outside of marriage (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2167696813487181">Christensen, 1969</xref>). Specifically, engaging in CSREs may have more negative outcomes (e.g., guilt) within sexually restrictive cultures than in sexually permissive cultures.</p>
<p>Similarly, we know very little about CSREs within nonheterosexual individuals. While research has focused on casual sex in gay men—especially in relation to the spread of HIV (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-2167696813487181">Prestage et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-2167696813487181">van den Boom, Stolte, Stanfort, &amp; Davidovich, 2012</xref>) and use of the Internet for solicitation of casual sex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2167696813487181">Brown, Maycock, &amp; Burns, 2005</xref>)—this research has not been integrated with the literature on CSREs. Currently, few studies on CSREs include homosexual participants or have examined differences between heterosexual and homosexual individuals in the practice of CSREs. As such, our understanding of CSREs across various sexual orientations is limited. Furthermore, emerging adulthood is a time when individuals are often exploring their sexual identity, and this may have important implications for their relationships/experiences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2167696813487181">Morgan, 2013</xref> for a review).</p>
<p>Likewise, most of the research on CSREs has been conducted using convenience samples of college students. Given that overall romantic relationship patterns vary between individuals who do and do not attend college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2167696813487181">Goldstein &amp; Kenney, 2001</xref>), CSRE involvement may also differ depending on educational status. Marriage tends to occur earlier among individuals who do not attend college and who are from a lower socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-2167696813487181">Uecker &amp; Stokes, 2008</xref>), so these individuals may not spend as much time exploring different relationships and experiences (or conversely, may explore a variety of relationships/experiences earlier in life). Furthermore, college students cannot truly represent the population of single, emerging adults because many aspects of the college setting are atypical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2167696813487181">Bogle, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2167696813487181">2008</xref>). For example, college campuses tend to offer a great deal of freedom, without the same restrictions faced by individuals in a more traditional workforce. As such, it is not clear whether CSREs manifest in the same way in noncollege populations.</p>

<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>Given the nature of the unanswered questions about engagement in CSREs, there are several clear avenues for future research. First, we recommend that scholars come together and develop consistent definitions of the different CSREs. Second, studies need to be employed that include multiple forms of CSREs in the same study, so that we can empirically examine the differences and similarities between the various CSREs. Incorporating multiple CSREs will also allow researchers to investigate if it is the types of CSREs, or simply the dimensions among which CSREs vary, that are associated with differential outcomes. In addition to these two core recommendations, there is a need for studies that (a) are theoretically informed, (b) extend knowledge beyond cross-sectional samples of college students, (c) understand CSREs as they relate to key aspects of emerging adulthood, and (d) investigate how media exposure affects engagement in CSREs.</p>
<sec id="section25-2167696813487181">
<title>The Need for Theoretically Driven Programs of Research</title>
<p>A major limitation of research on CSREs is a lack of theoretical guidance. The large majority of studies on CSREs do not use an explicit theory or report on any guiding theoretical perspective. This is not to suggest that potential theoretical rationales for research in CSREs do not exist. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813487181">Garcia and colleagues (2012)</xref> argue for an interdisciplinary biopsychosocial model to provide an understanding of the hookup culture. They suggest that evolutionary biology influences why individuals engage in hookups and the reactions they have to these relationships/experience at the same time that social roles and sexual scripts influence how hookups exist in a sociocultural context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder and Carey (2010a</xref>) suggest that the theory of interpersonal behavior, evolutionary theories, and social–cognitive theory can be used to guide understanding of engagement in CSREs. The theory of interpersonal behavior has also been implicated in several studies examining casual sexual behavior around vacation times (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2167696813487181">Maticka-Tyndale, Herold, &amp; Mewhinney, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2167696813487181">Maticka-Tyndale, Herold, &amp; Oppermann, 2003</xref>). Others have also acknowledged the importance of social norms and evolutionary theories (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813487181">Garcia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-2167696813487181">Stinson, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, current empirical research has been largely atheoretical and exploratory. An important next step, therefore, is to ensure the integration of theory and research in order to examine CSREs in a more comprehensive manner. Empirical research that is guided by carefully evaluated theoretical frameworks will also foster research endeavors that aim to better understand the dynamic and multifaceted processes underlying CSREs. Researchers should also continue this work by testing conceptual models that incorporate known risk factors for negative outcomes in order to determine whether CSRE engagement provides additional information in predicting these outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-2167696813487181">
<title>Extending Study Designs Beyond Cross-Sectional Studies of College Students</title>
<p>While there exist exceptions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2167696813487181">Fielder &amp; Carey, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2167696813487181">Hamilton &amp; Armstrong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2167696813487181">Owen et al., 2011</xref>), the overwhelming majority of studies on CSREs have used cross-sectional designs. While these studies have provided important clues about the correlates of CSRE engagement, they can provide little insight into (a) the predictors of CSRE engagement or (b) the short- and long-term consequences of engaging in CSREs. As such, future research needs to focus on implementing innovative designs that include longitudinal components, allowing us to more fully understand the causal direction of the constructs that have been associated with CSREs. Longitudinal designs could also provide insight regarding the relationship between engaging in CSREs and later relationship functioning as well as marital satisfaction. Furthermore, almost all of the research in this area has focused on relatively homogenous college samples, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Logical avenues for future research include examining these relationships and experiences in different subpopulations (including varying sexual orientations) in the United States as well as in other countries.</p>

<sec id="section27-2167696813487181">
<title>What, if Anything, Is Unique About CSRE Engagement During Emerging Adulthood</title>
<p>The large majority of CSRE studies have focused on CSREs during emerging adulthood. What is not clear, however, is to what degree CSREs are unique to this age period. CSREs occur during adolescence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167696813487181">Fortunato et al., 2010</xref>) and for some individuals they may also extend beyond the emerging adulthood years. CSREs may be somewhat developmentally normative during emerging adulthood because they reflect many of the main features (i.e., identity exploration and instability) of emerging adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2167696813487181">Arnett, 2004</xref>). Thus, involvement in some CSREs during emerging adulthood may have a less negative impact on individual functioning than involvement in CSREs during other age periods. CSRE involvement during adolescence, for example, has been associated with especially negative consequences including school suspensions, truancy, and problem behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2167696813487181">Fortunato et al., 2010</xref>). As such, it is important to examine the consequences of engaging in these relationships/experiences at different developmental periods, from the teens into the early to mid-30s. Examining the developmental distinctiveness of the different CSREs is an important next step in fully understanding these relationships/experiences across the life span.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-2167696813487181">
<title>CSREs and Media Exposure</title>
<p>Emerging adults spend the majority of their day in contact with (social) media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2167696813487181">Coyne, Padilla-Walker, &amp; Howard, in press</xref>). Despite the prevalence of media in emerging adults’ daily lives, relatively little is known about how media affects an individual’s understanding of and acceptance of CSREs during emerging adulthood. Short-term CSREs have been portrayed in a wide variety of television shows, movies, and popular books (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2167696813487181">Garcia et al., 2012</xref> for a short list) and mainstream media has become increasingly sexually explicit and includes a number of sexual images and themes. For example, research has shown that overwhelming number of television episodes targeted at adolescents and young adults include sexual references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2167696813487181">Aubrey, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2167696813487181">Heldman and Wade (2010)</xref> argue that the high levels of sexual content in mainstream media, as well as rising rates of self-objectification in women, have contributed significantly to the rise in (and acceptance of) CSREs. While research suggests that exposure to sexual content is associated with earlier sexual intercourse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2167696813487181">Brown &amp; L’Engle, 2009</xref>), and booty calls specifically involve the use of social media (cell phones) for initiating sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2167696813487181">Jonason et al., 2009</xref>), relatively little research has empirically examined the link between media use and engagement in CSREs. As such, further research is needed to better understand the relationship between media exposure and involvement in CSREs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>CSREs, including FWB relationships, booty calls, and one-night stands, are highly prevalent during emerging adulthood, especially within college populations. Research has revealed that these relationships/experiences vary on several aspects, including how well two individuals know each other before engaging in casual sexual activities and whether or not the sexual activity reoccurs. However, the current research on CSREs remains in many ways disjointed, especially regarding conceptualization and operational definitions of these different CSREs. The current article calls for a more comprehensive and consistent study of CSREs as well as a move toward more innovative study designs and a greater use of theoretical guidance. Further examination of these CSREs using diverse samples and innovative methodology will help clarify predictors of engaging in these behaviors as well help identify the distinctions and similarities between the various CSREs, which have been associated with a number of negative outcomes during emerging adulthood.</p>
