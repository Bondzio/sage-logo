<p>Readers who value journalism may be excused for wishing, about a third of the way through this anthology, that it came with antidepressants. But keep reading.</p>
<p>Robert McChesney (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and Victor Pickard (New York University) have compiled thirty-two essays and articles, about a third of which were published previously. The essays are divided into three sections. The first ten are organized under the heading “The Crisis Unfolds,” followed by “The American Traditions” and “The Way Forward.”</p>
<p>Contributors include McChesney and John Nichols, his coauthor on <italic>The Death and Life of American Journalism</italic>, plus Pickard, Craig Aaron, Eric Alterman, the late C. Edwin Baker, Yochai Benkler, Federal Communications Commission member Michael J. Copps, Leonard Downie Jr. and Michael Schudson, Thomas Frank, Todd Gitlin, Chris Hedges, Janine Jackson, Pamela Newkirk, Clay Shirky, David Simon, and Paul Starr.</p>
<p>While there is a great deal of consensus among the authors, McChesney and Pickard have, happily, included essays that diverge from the consensus. The end result is a thought-provoking collection that reflects much conventional and unconventional wisdom about what is wrong with American journalism and what could be done to improve it.</p>
<p>In parts I and II, essayists offer a variety of explanations for how the news business got into its current predicament. Much material about the financial travails of the legacy media is familiar, although there are some fresh perspectives. For example, Janine Jackson suggests that hearing that advertisers no longer wish to subsidize the news is “like learning that foxes have decided to get out of the henhouse-protection business” (p. 204).</p>
<p>Jackson’s comment represents a general consensus throughout the book that commercial interests and independent public affairs reporting do not mix well. Readers of McChesney’s earlier work, most notably <italic>Rich Media, Poor Democracy</italic>, will not be surprised that profit-driven journalism has few fans here. Journalist Matt Welch speaks for many contributors when he argues that the mainstream news media’s focus on “a dreary roll call of depressing statistics” (p. 214) about the news business ignores the opportunities that await journalists and audiences in the emerging media environment.</p>
<p>Beyond the financial challenges, contributors also address the structural failings of modern journalism. Todd Gitlin, for example, says that declining circulation and revenue are only two of five crises facing the media. The others are declining attention because of more competition, declining authority to set the public agenda, and a long-practiced deference to authority that has led to “rampant distrust” (p. 99).</p>
<p>Similarly, Chris Hedges attributes public distrust to the news media’s devotion to the ideal of objectivity. The rules of objectivity led to an overreliance on sources in the “power elite” and the formula of balancing opposing views, even when some of those views were clearly crackpot. Hedges writes that “once the power elite became incompetent and morally bankrupt, the press, along with the power elite, lost its final vestige of credibility” (p. 212). The credibility gap may go deeper with some audiences. Juan Gonzalez and Joseph Torres argue that the mass media have routinely underrepresented and misrepresented minority populations, often fomenting racism. It will be hard, they suggest, to find many minorities weeping over newspapers’ decline.</p>
<p>All of this leads to a difficult question: is American journalism worth saving? The answer, most agree, is yes, even if the legacy media are not. As the editors say in the Introduction, “It is impossible to conceive of effective governance and the rule of law—not to mention individual freedoms, social justice, and effective and enlightened solutions to daunting problems—without a credible system of journalism” (p. ix).</p>
<p>The book’s last section and some essays in earlier sections offer many possible solutions to journalism’s problems. Most involve government intervention, either through enhanced funding for public broadcasting or new programs to subsidize print and online journalism. Bruce Ackerman offers one novel idea: create a “National Endowment for Journalism” and distribute checks to website hosts based on how well their articles aid the public’s political understanding. More conventionally, perhaps, Craig Aaron suggests taxes or fees on spectrum use, advertising, and consumer electronic purchases to pay for enhanced public media.</p>
<p>If the idea of government subsidies for newspapers causes unease, Paul Starr reminds us that news media have long benefited from government subsidies, including favorable postal rates, government printing contracts, and legal advertising. Also, Rodney Benson offers data based on content analyses showing that subsidized newspapers in Europe are often just as critical of government, if not more so, than American newspapers. But there are obvious obstacles, not the least of which are the federal deficit and our political system’s ties to vested and moneyed interests. Yochai Benkler, for example, worries that government intervention would likely benefit the incumbent media at the expense of innovators.</p>
<p>Other essayists suggest that private solutions, including nonprofit, foundation-supported organizations such as ProPublica, while imperfect because of shaky funding or potential donor bias, may help fill in the gaps in reporting created by downsized newspapers. But Ackerman, among others, worries that citizen journalists and small organizations will not be able to fill the gap left by legacy media. “Serious reporting on national and international affairs isn’t for amateurs” (p. 301), he writes. David Simon, meanwhile, urges newspapers to build pay walls online despite skepticism about the audience’s willingness to pay for what is now free. He notes that people said the same thing about cable and satellite television. Frank and Ryan Blethen, representing two generations of the <italic>Seattle Times</italic>’ family ownership, see promise in proposals to allow existing newspapers to convert to nonprofit or low-profit limited liability companies.</p>
<p>The many solutions offered indicate the editors have taken to heart Clay Shirky’s phrase about journalism’s possibilities: “Nothing will work, but everything might” (p. 43). By the end of this book, you may agree.</p>
