<p><bold>Objective</bold>: The purpose of this study was to test a research instrument that could possibly be used for longitudinal research on infant feeding and to report on the preliminary results from the data collected.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: Mixed methods approach – cross-sectional survey and qualitative research.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Mother–infant dyads in South West Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Mother–infant dyads (<italic>n</italic>=211) were recruited (response rate – 88%) within six weeks post-partum by Child and Family Health Nurses in Sydney South West. The parents were subsequently followed up by telephone interview when the child was four months or older. Cross-sectional data on infant feeding practices such as breast-feeding, formula feeding and introduction of solids and other fluids, bio-medical factors and socio-demographic data were recorded.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Of the 211 who agreed to participate, 187 were able to be followed up post-partum. The telephone questionnaire was not found to be intrusive and interviewers had no problems collecting data. Only 33% of mothers (<italic>n</italic>=62) were found to be exclusively breastfeeding at four months post-partum. Higher maternal education was significantly associated with exclusive breastfeeding at four months. Maternal education, maternal country of birth, maternal age, gestational age and maternal antibiotic use post-partum were independent predictors of introduction of fluids. Female infants and residing in a rural/remote area were noted to be independent predictors of introduction of solid food at four months.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: The questionnaire was acceptable to parents and useful data was collected for future longitudinal studies in childhood nutrition and dental health. Given the substantial evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding and later introduction of complementary feeds, health promotion interventions should be targeted at the specific ‘at-risk’ families.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adequate nutrition during infancy and early childhood is essential for normal growth and development. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896912444180">1</xref></sup> and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896912444180">2</xref></sup> both agree that mothers should be exclusively breastfeeding until their infant is six months of age and that mothers should continue to breastfeed until at least 12 months of age, as the scientific benefits of breast-feeding are well accepted. Many Australian studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896912444180">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896912444180">4</xref></sup> have reported that breastfeeding initiation rates are increasing;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896912444180">5</xref></sup> however, this does not correlate to an increase in the duration of breastfeeding, with less than half of the infants being breastfed at age six months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896912444180">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with breastfeeding, the introduction of solid foods to an infant’s diet is critical to maintaining adequate nutrition for growth and development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896912444180">6</xref></sup> The appropriate age of first introducing solid foods has been widely and continuously debated, balancing the risks of diarrhoea (early introduction)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896912444180">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896912444180">8</xref></sup> with maintaining nutritional requirements (late introduction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896912444180">9</xref></sup> A Cochrane systematic review noted that the introduction of solid foods between four and six months had limited benefits and that it did not appear to justify the adverse effect of infectious morbidity from gastrointestinal tract infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896912444180">10</xref></sup> The complexity of the debate is evident in the numerous differing recommendations given by health organizations on the introduction of solid foods. For example, the WHO and NHMRC have established evidenced-based recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding for six months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896912444180">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896912444180">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896912444180">10</xref></sup> whereas the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has adapted the WHO guidelines for industrialized countries stating ‘the introduction of solid foods should not be before 17 weeks but should not be delayed beyond 26 weeks’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896912444180">11</xref></sup> Against the WHO recommendations many mothers do introduce solid foods before six months and a percentage are introducing solids before four months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896912444180">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896912444180">12</xref></sup> The high level of non-compliance seen in Australia is not isolated, with studies in New Zealand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896912444180">13</xref></sup> Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896912444180">14</xref></sup> United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896912444180">15</xref></sup> and Finland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896912444180">16</xref></sup> all recording significant rates of early introduction of solids.</p>
<p>There is no national Australian monitoring system for collecting information on breastfeeding patterns and therefore it is difficult to measure any changes in breastfeeding practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896912444180">17</xref></sup> The New South Wales (NSW) Child Health Survey 2001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896912444180">3</xref></sup> was the first large-scale population survey conducted in NSW to generate data regarding breastfeeding practices and that there is no longitudinal evidence on breastfeeding duration rates in NSW. Furthermore, there is also only limited information on the introduction of fluids and solid foods in NSW children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was two-fold:</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A convenience sample of mothers who gave birth to children in July and August 2009 (<italic>n</italic>=240) in two Sydney South West hospitals were recruited within the first six weeks post-partum by the Child and Family Health Nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896912444180">18</xref></sup> The parents were provided with an introductory letter outlining the aims of the study and were subsequently followed up by a telephone interview to record infant feeding patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0017896912444180">
<title>Questionnaire development</title>
<p>The questionnaire was developed from the Perth Infant Feeding Studies I and II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896912444180">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896912444180">19</xref></sup> and the Iowa Fluoride Study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896912444180">20</xref></sup> two well established longitudinal studies on infant feeding. Information in the interviews was focused on:</p>
<list id="list2-0017896912444180" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Infant feeding practices – breastfeeding frequency, breastfeeding duration, breastfeeding exclusivity, formula feeding, introduction of solid foods and other fluids;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bio-medical factors such as infant gender, birth weight, gestational age, the use of antibiotics by the mother during pregnancy and post-partum, smoking status of the mother during pregnancy and post-partum;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Socio-demographic data such as maternal age, occupation, current employment, ethnicity, marital status, education, partner’s ethnicity, residential postcode.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to the quantitative data collection, a phenomenological qualitative approach was used on a purposeful sub-sample (<italic>n</italic>=15) to get insights of maternal infant feeding experiences which may have an influence on feeding decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0017896912444180">
<title>Telephone interviews</title>
<p>Telephone interviews were carried out by two trained and calibrated independent researchers. Mothers were interviewed once over the phone during the child’s first year of life (at either four, eight or 12 months). Contact was made at a time convenient to the mother during the daytime or evening on either weekdays or weekends. If numbers were disconnected, a reminder letter was sent in the post for them to provide updated contact details.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0017896912444180">
<title>Incentives to study participants</title>
<p>As part of the study, education material on infant dietary and feeding recommendations in the form of leaflets produced by NSW Health was sent to the study participants. In addition to this, a teething ring, sipper cup and birthday card were posted to all participants during the course of the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0017896912444180">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Analysis of data collated was carried out following completion of interviews at an individual level using SPSS version 19. Bivariate analyses were conducted to identify co-variates associated with breastfeeding duration. As a preliminary investigation of the data, Chi-square contingency tables of breastfeeding versus potential explanatory factors were made along with univariate logistic regression analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to determine which individual variables could best predict exclusive breastfeeding at four months post-partum. All potential explanatory variables with the choice for feeding method, along with a variety of interaction terms were included in the full model. The full model was reduced using the backward stepwise procedure and the fitness of model was assessed at every step to avoid dropping non-significant variables that affected the model fitness.</p>
<p>Similar bivariate analyses were conducted of any introduction of fluids and solid foods before the age of four months. Kaplan–Meier survival plot was used to get a better understanding of breastfeeding duration, with the age at which solid foods were introduced.</p>
<p>All the digitally recorded qualitative interviews were listened to by two researchers to a point of data saturation and the qualitative data was analysed by grouping responses into discrete categories of factors which may influence infant feeding behaviours.</p>

<sec id="section8-0017896912444180">

<p>The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of University of Sydney and Sydney South West Areal Health Service.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 240 mothers that were approached, 211 agreed to participate (response rate = 88%) at the first post-natal visit. However, only 187 mothers were able to complete the study as either they decided to withdraw at the time of phone interview or they were unable to be contacted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896912444180">Table 1</xref> provides a breakdown of socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants that took part in this preliminary investigation (<italic>n</italic>=187).

<p>The mothers enjoyed being interviewed as it gave them a chance to discuss their feeding experiences and reported that the interview questions were not intrusive. The interviewers had no problems and reported that the questionnaire flowed well. The timing was appropriate as each interview lasted about 15 to 20 minutes. However, a number of calls were required to find a convenient time, which meant that the interview schedule had to be flexible – evening and weekend calls were essential.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896912444180">Table 2</xref> summarizes the frequencies of the type of infant feeds at time of interview according to infant gender. The results show that at the time of interview, 23.5% of infants (<italic>n</italic>=44) were being mostly breastfed, with an additional 10.2% (<italic>n</italic>=19) on a combination of breast-milk and infant formula, while 47.6% of infants (<italic>n</italic>=89) received infant formula only. Only 18.7% of the infants (<italic>n</italic>=35) were introduced to cow’s milk in various combinations under the age of one year. In regards to other fluids, 78.6% of infants (<italic>n</italic>=147) had been introduced to water within their first year of life (median age of introduction – 17 weeks) and 25.6% of infants (<italic>n</italic>=48) had also been given juice as an additional fluid (median age of introduction – 26 weeks). Solid foods had been introduced to 78.1% of infants (<italic>n</italic>=146) at the time the interviews were conducted (median age of introduction – 20 weeks). Of the solid foods introduced, 52% (<italic>n</italic>=78) were predominantly homemade, 24% (<italic>n</italic>=36) predominantly commercially bought and 24% (<italic>n</italic>=36) received a 50:50 combination of homemade and commercial solid foods. The solids most commonly introduced first were baby cereals, fruit and vegetables. There was a significant association between the timing of introduction of solids and the duration of breastfeeding (log rank test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0017896912444180">Figure 1</xref> shows that infants who were introduced to solid foods after the 20 weeks (median age of introduction) were breastfed four weeks longer than those who were introduced to solids before 20 weeks.</p>

Maternal age, maternal education, marital status, maternal and paternal country of birth and socio-economic status were significantly associated with early introduction of fluids such as juice and water (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Maternal occupation, maternal education, maternal country of birth and living in a rural/remote area was significantly associated with early introduction of solid foods.</p>

Of all the socio-demographic and bio-medical factors, maternal education was the only independent predictor of exclusive breastfeeding at 17 weeks post-partum. Lower maternal education, gestational age (odds ratio (OR)=0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI<sub>95%</sub>) 0.68,0.98), maternal age (OR=0.90, CI<sub>95%</sub> 0.82,0.99), maternal use of antibiotics post-partum (OR=2.91, CI<sub>95%</sub> 1.06,7.95) and mothers born in a Non-English speaking country (OR=3.60, CI<sub>95%</sub> 1.54,8.37) were independent predicators of early introduction of fluids. Interestingly, female infants had 2.5 times the odds of early introduction of solid foods compared with male infants (OR=2.51, CI<sub>95%</sub> 1.01,6.21). Further, mother–infant dyads residing in rural or remote areas of South West Sydney had nearly seven times the odds of introduction of solid food at 17 weeks post-partum (OR=6.96, CI<sub>95%</sub> 2.05,9.61).</p>

<p>This study provided an insight to feeding behaviours in infants residing in South West Sydney. Whilst most mothers initiated breastfeeding, compliance to the Australian guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896912444180">2</xref></sup> on exclusive breastfeeding in the study was poor in our study. These results are similar to those reported in other Australian studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896912444180">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896912444180">21</xref></sup> Our results suggest that many mothers discontinue breastfeeding well before the WHO and Australian NHMRC recommended 12 months guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896912444180">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896912444180">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study showed that mothers with higher levels of education were more likely to exclusively breastfeed their child at four months of age. This result is comparable to other studies in developed coutries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896912444180">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896912444180"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896912444180">24</xref></sup> Other studies have suggested that mothers with lower levels of education should be considered as an at-risk target group for infant feeding recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896912444180">24</xref></sup> The common reasons reported by our study participants for discontinuing breastfeeding were consistent with findings elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896912444180">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896912444180">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896912444180">25</xref></sup> It has been suggested that the most common causes of insufficient milk supply are inappropriate timing and duration of feeds, and improper positioning of the infant for optimum attachment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896912444180">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some 18.7% of infants were introduced to cow’s milk in our study. Despite international recommendations, it is not uncommon for infants to receive cow’s milk before they reach 12 months of age; this can be seen in this study and is reported in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896912444180">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896912444180">26</xref></sup> Health promotion interventions should focus on delaying the introduction of cow’s milk as it has been suggested to increase the risk of renal load, type I diabetes, chronic constipation and anal fissures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896912444180">25</xref></sup> In our study, higher maternal education, higher maternal age and higher gestational age were independent predictors of a lower odds to introduce fluids such as water and juice at age four months. This is consistent with findings elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896912444180">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896912444180"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896912444180">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most appropriate age for the introduction of solids is contentious and is influenced by a multitude of factors that can lead to their early introduction. Mothers in our study had a poor level of compliance to the WHO and Australian feeding recommendations of 26 weeks. Additionally a number of mothers did not comply with the European standards (modified for industrialized countries) that allow for earlier introduction of solids at 17 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896912444180">11</xref></sup> This data is relatively consistent with that found in the 2001 Australian National Health Survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896912444180">12</xref></sup> and other Australian studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896912444180">18</xref></sup> This non-compliance is not isolated to Australia with studies in New Zealand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896912444180">13</xref></sup> Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896912444180">14</xref></sup> United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896912444180">15</xref></sup> and Finland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896912444180">16</xref></sup> all recording significant rates of early introduction of solids. Our findings that the solid foods most commonly introduced into an infant’s diet are infant cereal, fruits and vegetables has also been supported by earlier studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896912444180">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896912444180">28</xref></sup> An Australian study in Adelaide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896912444180">17</xref></sup> supported our results that infants were predominantly introduced first to homemade solids over commercial products.</p>
<p>Our study found that female infants and residing in a rural/remote area were independent predictors of early introduction of solid foods. A Perth study on infant feeding practices found no association between the early introduction of solids and infant gender but did find associations with young maternal age, maternal smoking prior to pregnancy and not fully breastfeeding at four weeks post partum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896912444180">8</xref></sup> Supporting this, other studies have also found associations with young maternal age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896912444180">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896912444180">27</xref></sup>, maternal smoking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896912444180">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896912444180">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896912444180">28</xref></sup>, maternal education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896912444180">15</xref></sup>, lower socioeconomic background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896912444180">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896912444180">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896912444180">29</xref></sup> and early cessation of or never breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896912444180">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896912444180"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896912444180">29</xref></sup> Male gender has been found to have an association in some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896912444180">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896912444180">15</xref></sup> and no association in others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896912444180">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896912444180">29</xref></sup> Targeted health education to these ‘at risk’ groups may serve to reduce rates of early introduction of solids in the community.</p>
<p>Our qualitative data indicated that the main reasons for introducing solids into an infant’s diet were maternal perception of infant hunger and infant readiness to progress to solids, which is supported in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896912444180">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896912444180">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896912444180">29</xref></sup> While our study did not directly investigate mothers’ reasons for initiating solid foods future studies directed at this area may help to target information to parents on methods of interpreting their infants’ behaviours to help decrease early introduction of solid foods.</p>
<p>This study had some strengths and limitations. The response rate of the study was good and although a pilot investigation, the sample size was relatively large. The phone based interview on infant feeding patterns was an acceptable method of data collection in South West Sydney. The questionnaire data provided some useful data on infant feeding and the questionnaire can possibly be used for longitudinal research in nutrition and dentistry. Limitations of the study include a small sample size which may limit its statistical strength and confidence in some observed differences. A possible source of bias in this study may have come from the recruiting process of infant participants. Parents were recruited by Child and Family Health Nurses through post-natal home visit and those parents who did not utilize these post-natal services but had infants born in Sydney South West were not contacted and therefore not asked to participate in our study. Other sources of bias may be related to potential recall on infant feeding by mothers.</p>
<p>Given that our data indicates an early introduction of solid foods or fluids or breast-milk substitutes, health promotion should be focused on encouraging breastfeeding and extending its duration. We suggest that further longitudinal qualitative and quantitative research is required to understand the decision making process in relation to infant feeding, so that appropriate post-natal education may be developed. Health promotion interventions to promote breastfeeding and delay the early introduction of complementary food are required.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The questionnaire was feasible and acceptable to both the parents and the interviewer and could be useful for future longitudinal studies in childhood nutrition and dental health. Based on our preliminary results, we suggest that health promotion interventions should be targeted at specific ‘at risk’ families to improve compliance with WHO and NHMRC feeding recommendations.</p>
