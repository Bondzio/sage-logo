<abstract>
<p>Vehicle acceleration is one of the key characteristics that influence customer satisfaction. Pedal displacements and vehicle speeds are necessary to represent the performance of acceleration: how much acceleration a vehicle is capable of if the acceleration pedal is displaced at a certain speed. The result of varying the acceleration pedal is called the acceleration response surface in three-dimensions. The current approach utilizes a few discrete levels of acceleration response surface for engineering specification because of the three-dimensional nature of the acceleration response surface (ARS), and thus may under-represent the entire acceleration response surface. The underlying variation modes of the acceleration response surface among 92 vehicles are identified by applying principal component analysis in which the entire ARS is analyzed. The 92 vehicles are specifically between the 2006- and 2007-model years with automatic transmission and 4-, 6-, and 8-cylinder engines. Two variation modes are identified, which differentiate vehicles from each other: how fast a vehicle can accelerate overall and how quickly a vehicle reaches its peak acceleration at launch with short or long pedal displacement. The association between the two variation modes and buyer satisfaction from mail surveys similar to Consumer Reports is analysed. Finally the ideal shape of the acceleration response surface is developed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vehicle acceleration is one of the key characteristics that influence customer satisfaction, as an indicator of how likely customers are to make purchases in the future. Influential automotive magazines and surveys such as Consumer Reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012442775">1</xref></sup> and J.D. Power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012442775">2</xref></sup> regularly collect customer satisfaction data on acceleration for marketing research. Some of the typical comments on acceleration include: ‘Car accelerates smoothly without jerking or hesitating’, ‘Car accelerates without excess noise’ and ‘Car accelerates quickly from a standing start to get ahead of traffic, to merge safely into traffic, or to get out of a dangerous situation’. These qualitative statements need to be translated into quantitative engineering specifications such as peak launch acceleration, time duration from zero to 100 km/h, passing acceleration from 100 km/h to 160 km/h, etc.</p>
<p>It is well known that various customers have different expectations and thus levels of satisfaction (e.g. customers desiring sports cars vs. family cars). Acceleration is configured carefully to meet various levels of customer satisfaction and to achieve product differentiation while balancing fuel economy. Fast acceleration at launch and smooth shift in transmission are generally associated with high customer satisfaction. Acceleration at high speed is also vital for executing safe highway merging and passing, which require that some engine power and thus acceleration should be available at high speed. Vehicle curb mass is a key factor influencing acceleration and fuel economy, and horse power-to-mass ratio is one of the measures that characterize acceleration performance by combining both curb mass and engine horsepower.</p>
<sec id="section2-0954407012442775">
<title>Acceleration response surface (ARS)</title>
<p>Two factors are necessary to represent acceleration, as it is perceived by customers: acceleration at various pedal displacements (PD) and vehicle speeds. With a vehicle at standstill, the accelerator pedal is pressed a predetermined distance (e.g. 10 mm) using a fixture attached to it, after which acceleration and speed are measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012442775">3</xref></sup> This test is repeated for various PD and the outcome is a three-dimensional (3D) surface called the acceleration response surface (ARS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The acceleration in <italic>z</italic>-axis ranges from 0.005 g up to 0.8 g, PD from 5 mm to 40 mm, and vehicle speeds from zero to 160 km/h. Note that the label for the vertical axis is multiplied by ten for easy viewing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(a)</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The ARS in 3D can be viewed from the top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(b)</xref>) and from the sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(d)</xref>) so that various characteristics of the ARS can be understood. The top view shows how evenly the acceleration levels are distributed as well as the area of no acceleration (i.e. acceleration less than 0.005 g). This vehicle (V108) shows a very wide area of acceleration for up to 0.2g but a very narrow range for between 0.2g and 0.3g. It shows low acceleration for passing at high speed. For example, when this vehicle travels at 140 km/h at 20 mm PD and the acceleration pedal is pressed additional 10 mm, the resulting acceleration is less than 0.1g. The white area indicates no acceleration (thus constant speed) and overall, the levels of acceleration are well distributed. The side view from the vehicle speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(c)</xref>) shows how quickly the acceleration drops at specific PD and at various speeds. For example, if the acceleration pedal is pressed by 12.5 mm, this vehicle shows 0.3 g at launch and no acceleration at 100km/h. The side view from the PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(d)</xref>) shows how quickly the acceleration rises at various PD at specific vehicle speeds (also known as acceleration gain). This vehicle reaches its maximum launch acceleration of 0.5 g at 20 mm PD and remains flat thereafter.</p>
<p>The downward arrow (A) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the acceleration capability when this vehicle is completely stopped and then accelerates. This curve is the result of upward shift in transmission gears. The arrow (B) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(a)</xref> is related to a vehicle’s passing acceleration and is affected by the downward gearshift. This vehicle can achieve passing acceleration of 0.1 g by depressing the acceleration pedal an additional 10 mm when this vehicle travels at steady state (e.g. 60 km/h at 10 mm PD). The upward arrow (C) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012442775">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows that this vehicle is not capable of passing even though the acceleration pedal is depressed by an additional 10 mm when the vehicle travels at steady state of 120 km/h at 15 mm PD (the acceleration increase was very small, almost unchanged at 0.05 g).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0954407012442775">
<title>Limitations of current approach</title>
<p>Industry norms for characterizing acceleration are time duration from zero to 100 km/h, passing acceleration from 100 to 160 km/h, and peak launch acceleration. The time duration from zero to 100 km/h is a simple and convenient measure that is widely used to compare acceleration performance, in which the accelerator pedal is fully and instantaneously depressed. However, not many people drive a vehicle at such fast acceleration. Daily driving occurs with a partially open throttle of, usually, less than 30% of wide-open throttle capacity. The acceleration pedal is partially depressed, resulting in less than 0.3g in acceleration usually, and drivers perceive the acceleration with low frequency responses from the entire vehicle body. Thus, a vehicle that performs well at wide-open throttle with very high peak launch acceleration might feel heavy or sluggish under daily driving conditions. Passing acceleration is also a convenient measure but does not specify how far an accelerator pedal needs to be further pressed. Quick acceleration with short PD is usually perceived as dangerous in parking lot maneuvers but desirable at initial vehicle movements (e.g. stopped at traffic light).</p>
<p>Current engineering metric utilizes a few <italic>discrete</italic> points in ARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012442775">3</xref></sup> because it is difficult to compare many ARS in 3D simultaneously. Utilizing the few discrete points in the ARS might not represent the transient and dynamic behavior of acceleration, thus potentially under-representing the ARS. For example, customers might perceive differently the acceleration of two vehicles that have the same peak launch acceleration because the first vehicle reaches its peak at 20 mm PD, while the second peaks at 40 mm PD. Therefore, peak launch acceleration is a half-valid measure if PD and time duration are not taken into account. Much time and effort are spent on Robust Engineering or design of experiments in order to improve vehicle design and thus customer satisfaction. However, such activities will prove suboptimal or even doubtful if response variables in such experiments do not correctly represent the multi-dimensional characteristics of acceleration.</p>

<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The objective of this paper is to analyze the variation pattern in vehicle acceleration and how these underlying modes are associated with customer satisfaction. The objective should take into account the entire shape of ARS. Specific objectives include: (1) identifying the average shape of ARS so that it can be used as a baseline for market positioning, (2) identifying vehicles that show extreme acceleration so that performance boundaries can be established, and (3) determining the ideal shape of ARS that incorporates high customer satisfaction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and principal component regression (PCR) are applied to achieve the above objectives. One benefit of applying PCA is that ARS in 3D can be projected in a scatter plot so that many ARS in 3D can be charted and compared simultaneously and easily. Another benefit is that the largest variation patterns are identified, making it likely that customers will easily perceive the largest variation patterns.</p>
<p>The authors carried out a literature review on acceleration and customer satisfaction but could not find many papers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012442775">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012442775">4</xref></sup> Lee<sup>3</sup> analyzed the variation mode of acceleration gain based on 15 midsize sedans. Variation modes will vary, depending on the vehicles analyzed; therefore, a representative selection of vehicles is very critical and this paper analyzes the variation modes of acceleration from 92 vehicles that represent nearly the entire car and sport utility vehicle (SUV) market segments in 2006 and 2007. The ideal shapes of acceleration that are highly correlated with buyer satisfaction are derived and vehicle technical specifications are developed in this paper. In addition, the average shape and extreme shapes of ARS are identified to support market positioning. The ideal shapes of acceleration are to be used as an objective function to optimize vehicle design.</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012442775">Figure 2</xref>). Ninety-two ARS are collected and PCA is applied to extract the variation patterns. Customer satisfaction with acceleration obtained from internal mail survey is then regressed on the underlying variation modes. The desired shapes of ARS associated with high and low customer satisfaction are identified. A summary and discussion of strengths and weaknesses follow. Minitab version 14, statistical software, is used for this paper.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012442775">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Acceleration test data and buyer satisfaction data</title>
<p>The ARS of 92 vehicles with well-recognized vehicle names were extracted from an internal database in which all test data were archived. The acceleration tests were performed in an internal testing facility adhering to Society of Automotive Engineering test procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012442775">6</xref></sup> They include 48 sedans and 31 SUV on the market between 2006 and 2007. The remaining vehicles are vans and pickups. All vehicles have automatic transmissions with 4-, 6-, or 8-cylinder engines from North American, Japanese, European, and Korean manufacturers.</p>
<sec id="section6-0954407012442775">
<title>ARS test data</title>
<p>Acceleration is sampled and digitized at various PD and vehicle speeds simultaneously. PD is between 5 mm and 40 mm with an increment of 2.5 mm (14 discrete levels). Little variation occurs in acceleration beyond 40 mm of PD for most vehicles. Speed is between 0 km/h and 160 km/h with an increment of 3 km/h up to 60km/h and an increment of 5 km/h between 60 km/h and 160 km/h (45 discrete levels). Thus, all the data become a 3D array (45 speeds × 14 PD × 92 vehicles). The data are then unfolded to a 4140 × 14 matrix, given that PCA can analyze an <italic>n</italic>×<italic>m</italic> matrix. The columns of the unfolded matrix are PD and the rows of this matrix are a mixture of 92 vehicles for 45 levels of speed.</p>
<p>Acceleration tests are performed using vehicles that are acquired as is. They are not configured to eliminate other effects in measuring acceleration: vehicle curb mass, horsepower, transmission speeds and gear ratios, tire types and sizes, aerodynamics, etc. Only the acceleration pedal is varied in measuring acceleration and speed because drivers press the acceleration pedal and perceive the acceleration without noticing the factors mentioned above. All these variables are confounded and thus cannot be separated unless controlled experiments are carried out. That is, if the acceleration pedal is pressed by 10 mm, it cannot be known whether the acceleration is affected by changes in PD, different transmission speeds or gear ratio, low rolling resistance tire types, etc. Eliminating the above differences would be impractical in practice, and one way of statistically controlling such differences is to include them in the regression as covariates (termed statistically controlled). The statistically controlled approach does not necessarily separate the individual effects of those variables because they are confounded and highly collinear. For the adverse effects of collinearity and confounding in the regression approach, see published research:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012442775">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012442775"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012442775"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012442775">10</xref></sup> collinear or confounded variables make the regression coefficients unstable, thus the interpretation is often unwarranted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0954407012442775">
<title>Buyer satisfaction data</title>
<p>Customer ratings of acceleration for these vehicles are obtained from internal mail surveys that are sent to buyers a few months after purchase, as part of regular market research. The questionnaires in this mail survey are very similar to those of Consumer Reports and J.D. Power surveys. Buyers are asked to rate their satisfaction with their newly purchased vehicle along a spectrum of vehicle factors (acceleration, braking, ride, handling, noise, styling, etc.). The average number of respondents is around 500 customers per vehicle with a minimum of 200. The customer ratings of just 80 vehicles out of the 92 are available because some vehicles are newly introduced and the customer ratings are not yet collected. Vehicle type (sedan vs. SUV), overall satisfaction with the purchased vehicle, horsepower (HP), vehicle mass, 0 to 60 mile/h, peak acceleration are also collected.</p>
<p>Three questions are available in respect to acceleration: (1) <italic>Please rate your new vehicle experience on engine power and acceleration</italic> (‘Rate: engine power and acceleration’). (2) <italic>Please rate your new vehicle experience on the driving performance</italic> (‘Rate: driving performance’). (3) (‘Evaluate acceleration’) <italic>acceleration refers to how quickly and smoothly the vehicle can speed up to pass, or merge with, other vehicles when needed</italic>. Overall satisfaction with a newly purchased vehicle is also available and collected. All ratings are based on the five-level Likert scale (1: completely unsatisfied, 5: completely satisfied).</p>
<p>The customer satisfaction from mail surveys is observational in nature: respondents are not randomly assigned but are buyers of a particular vehicle. Buyers have different needs or expectations for a certain vehicle or brand due to income, personal experience, perception, word of mouth, etc. If a vehicle rates high in acceleration, it would need to be known whether the high rating results from fast acceleration, whether the vehicle exceeds customer expectations even though it is slow, or whether the vehicle has a good reputation for brand or quality. People might purchase vehicles because of price incentives, and they justify their purchase unconsciously by giving it high satisfaction ratings. Or the high ratings might be a random variation due to small sample size. The authors observed that a vehicle with high acceleration satisfaction also rates high in many other areas including fuel economy, warranty, noise, etc. Virtually all ratings for many questionnaires from the survey are highly collinear.</p>

<sec id="section8-0954407012442775">
<title>PCA and PCR</title>
<p>The idea of multivariate statistical analysis such as PCA is to combine/decompose variables into new variables if the variables are similar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407012442775">11</xref></sup> Depending on the definition of <italic>similarity</italic>, various exploratory methods have been developed, including multidimensional scaling, correspondence analysis, independent component analysis, PCA, etc. The measure of similarity of PCA is covariance/correlation among variables (i.e. variables with high correlation are combined), while distance (e.g. variables with short distance are combined) is for multidimensional scaling, profile (e.g. variables with similar histograms are combined) for correspondence analysis, and kurtosis for independent component analysis.</p>
<p>The new variables are linear combinations (i.e. weighted sums) of the original variables, and the weights are derived such that maximum variance of data is accounted for. The newly derived variables are called PC (principal component) and are also known as underlying patterns, factors, latent variables, loadings, eigenvectors, or variation modes in structural dynamics (e.g. bending or torsion modes of bridges in experimental modal analysis).</p>
<p>PCA is widely applied and has various names depending on disciplines: (1) singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrix <bold>X</bold>, (2) eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of the square matrix <bold>X<sup>T</sup>X</bold> in linear algebra,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012442775">13</xref></sup> (3) proper orthogonal decomposition in feedback control theory, (4) Karhunen–Loeve transformation in electrical engineering, (5) Hotelling’s transformation in multivariate quality control, (6) spectral decomposition in noise and vibration, (7) empirical modal analysis in structural dynamics, (8) empirical orthogonal functions in meteorological science, and (9) Eckart–Young theorem in psychometrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012442775">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012442775"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012442775"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012442775">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>The diagonal elements of <bold>Λ</bold> are called eigenvalues and are arranged in decreasing order, which are squares of the corresponding singular values in <bold>Σ</bold>.</p>
<p>The total variance of <bold>X</bold> is scaled to be equal to the number of variables in <bold>X</bold>, which is the same as the sum of eigenvalues or the sum of squares of singular values (<bold>Λ</bold>=<bold>Σ<sup>T</sup>Σ</bold>=<bold>Σ<sup>2</sup></bold>) by standardizing the variables. Matrix algebra shows that the sum of the eigenvalues of a diagonal and symmetric square matrix such as <bold>X<sup>T</sup>X</bold> is equal to the sum of its diagonal elements (called trace).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012442775">7</xref></sup> The diagonal elements of correlation matrix <bold>X<sup>T</sup>X</bold> are all equal to one, and thus the sum of the diagonal elements in <bold>X<sup>T</sup>X</bold> is equal to the total number of variables. Consequently, the degree of correlation among variables can be represented in relation to the number of variables. For example, if there are ten variables, then the total variance is scaled to ten and the sum of the eigenvalues becomes ten. If the eigenvalue of the first component is seven, then seventy percent (7/10) of the total variance, and thus correlation, is accounted for by the first component. An eigenvalue close to zero indicates that the corresponding PC explains a trivial amount of variance in <bold>X</bold> and thus the corresponding PC can be discarded, i.e. <bold>T</bold> is reduced to <bold>T</bold><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0954407012442775">

<p>PCR uses the <bold>T</bold><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> instead of <bold>X</bold> and applies the least square estimation approach. The benefit of using <bold>T</bold><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is that the columns of <bold>T</bold><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> are orthogonal, thus the adverse effects of collinearity are eliminated. Because the columns of <bold>T</bold><sub><italic>f</italic></sub> are a linear combination of the columns of <bold>X</bold>, all variables in <bold>X</bold> are included in regression. Thus, all important but correlated variables are kept and used in regressing the customer satisfaction on ARS.</p>

<p>The results from the PCA are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012442775">Table 1(a)</xref>, in which only six PC are shown, while 14 PC could have been extracted. The first and second PC (PC 1 and PC 2) account for 95% of the total variance. Thus, the 4140 × 14 matrix can be represented by a 4140 × 2 matrix with a loss of only 5% of the total variance. The fact that many eigenvalues are close to zero indicates that the shapes of the 92 ARS are highly similar (correlated). For example, if a vehicle’s acceleration is high at 30 km/h and 12.4 mm PD, then the acceleration at its neighborhood (e.g. 33 km/h with 12.4 mm PD) will also be high and thus well correlated.

<p>The meaning of the two PC as a projection of ARS onto PC space is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012442775">Figure 3(a)</xref>. The 92 ARS in 3D can be imagined as overlapped and viewed from PD and speed viewpoints. Then the PC 1 is a curve (a new variable) that will best describe the shapes of 92 ARS viewed from PD viewpoints (i.e. the PC 1 accounts for the maximum variance). Certainly, PC 1 does not describe the 92 ARS exactly and thus another curve is derived (PC 2) that will maximally account for the remaining shapes of 93 ARS (Figure 3(b) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012442775">Figure 3(c)</xref>). The extraction of PC continues until all the variances of the 93 ARS are accounted for, though usually the first few PC account for the most variance in <bold>X</bold>.</p>
<p>The shape of PC 1 from the viewpoint of PD shows the overall level of acceleration, as the values of the eigenvector are quite similar in magnitude over the entire range of PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012442775">Figure 3(c)</xref>). The shape of the PC 2 shows that acceleration increases linearly until 30 mm of PD, which shows the general shape of the 92 ARS from PD. Similar curves can be derived from speed viewpoints. Because the rows are a mixture of 92 vehicles and 45 levels of speed due to unfolding, the eigenvectors are then averaged for 92 vehicles at 45 levels of speed ((<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407012442775">Table 1(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012442775">Figure 3(b)</xref>). The shape of PC 1 from vehicle speed shows that the projected acceleration peaks at around 10 km/h and gradually decreases. Thus, the two PC from the vehicle speed viewpoint and the two PC from the PD viewpoint reveal the general shapes of the 92 ARS.</p>

<title>Key results: Projection of 92 ARS onto a scatter plot in PC space</title>
<p>After the two PC are extracted, their scores for 92 vehicles are computed and charted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012442775">Figure 4</xref> (numbers are assigned to label the vehicles due to confidentiality), in which the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axes represent the PC scores for PC 1 and PC 2, respectively. This figure is the key result of this paper. The dots in the figures are the projected location of the 92 ARS onto the two PC space. In it, the 4140 × 14 matrix is reduced to a 4140 × 2 matrix and eventually a 92 × 2 matrix after the PC score for a vehicle is averaged.

<p>This scatter plot (also known as PC score plot) needs interpretation because the PC is a linear combination of the original variables. Vehicles on the left side, such as V2 and V66, show the largest difference in ARS against vehicles on the right side, such as V39, V48, V13, and V100. Vehicles positioned on the right side show larger area under the ARS overall (i.e. higher acceleration) as compared to those vehicles on the left half. For example, V2 and V66 show peak launch acceleration around 0.3g while V39, V48, V13, and V100 are found around 0.6g. Vehicles on the top reach their peak launch acceleration with longer PD as compared to the vehicles on the bottom. For example, V80 and V55 reach their peak launch acceleration around 35 mm PD while V31 does so around 17.5 mm PD. In addition, V31 shows 0.2g at 5 mm PD while V80 and V55 show 0.05g at 5 mm PD (to be shown again in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012442775">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012442775">Figure 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012442775">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<p>To interpret the <italic>x</italic>-axis (i.e. the first mode or PC 1) further, three vehicles are selected (V66, V108 and V39) that are positioned horizontally in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012442775">Figure 4</xref>. As the three vehicles are positioned from left to right (V66 → V108 → V39), the ARS rise up and the area under the ARS enlarges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012442775">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the PC 1 is called the overall acceleration level factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012442775">Figure 5(d)</xref>). This interpretation is also illustrated on the left- and right-hand sides as the ARS is viewed from pedal displacement viewpoint in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012442775">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

As the three vehicles are positioned from bottom to top (V74 → V108 → V31), they reach their peak launch acceleration with shorter PD, while peak launch acceleration remains close to 0.45g. Red dotted lines are drawn to visually aid the peak launch acceleration. The V31 reaches its maximum peak launch acceleration with only 12.5 mm PD and 0.15g acceleration at 5 mm PD, while the vehicles V108 and V74 reach this at 20 mm and 27.5 mm, respectively. Similar patterns occur for vehicles positioned vertically although the results are not shown: (V67 → V29 → V104), (V55 → V105 → V70), and (V13 → V39 → V100). Thus, PC 2 is termed the peak acceleration factor at launch with short and long PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012442775">Figure 6(d)</xref>).

Therefore, cars with 4-cylinder engines are slower overall and reach peak launch acceleration earlier with shorter PD than cars with 8-cylinder engines.

<title>Regression of customer satisfaction on the two modes of ARS</title>
<p>Buyer satisfaction ratings of the 79 vehicles (‘Rate: engine power and acceleration’) are regressed on the two PC in order to comprehend how the two PC are associated with customer satisfaction. The ratings of some vehicles are not available yet because there are newly introduced vehicles in the data. Two additional customer satisfaction ratings (‘Rate: driving performance’, ‘Evaluate: acceleration’) are also regressed and the results showed them to be quite similar (not shown). The three ratings have correlation coefficients among each other of close to 0.9.</p>
<p>Because only seven pickups and one van are available, one categorical variable for vehicle type (Utility) is used to include the difference in customer satisfaction between sedan (as a base for comparison) and utility. Overall satisfaction with the purchased vehicle is included as a proxy to control the various noises statistically, such as with brand perception and customers’ expectation. Thus, it is assumed that the overall satisfaction is a measure for the brand perception and customers’ expectation. Vehicle mass and engine HP are combined into a HP-to-mass ratio and used as a surrogate measure to statistically control the difference in vehicle mass and HP and to avoid the adverse effects of collinearity because HP and mass are inversely correlated. The HP-to-mass ratio and the overall satisfaction with a new vehicle are standardized as indicated by the ‘S’ after the predictors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954407012442775">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>All the predictors except vehicle type (Utility) are statistically significant with <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.005, indicating that customer satisfaction is associated with overall vehicle satisfaction, HP-to-mass ratio, and two variation modes. No difference between cars and SUVs is found (cars and SUVs overlap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012442775">Figure 7</xref>, in which the contour lines for buyer satisfaction are shown). Regression from one of the three customer satisfactions (‘Evaluate: acceleration’) show that the regression coefficient for Utility is statistically significant (not shown). Thus, there might be differences in customer satisfaction between cars and SUVs.</p>
<p>High customer satisfaction is associated with high overall acceleration level (PC 1) with longer PD to reach its peak launch acceleration (PC 2). The statistically significant PC 2 indicates that buyers seem unsatisfied if a vehicle reaches its peak launch acceleration with short PD (thus no acceleration occurs, even if the acceleration pedal is further pressed). In other words, some acceleration should be reserved for when the acceleration pedal is depressed for passing and merging on the highway.</p>
<p>The r-square, the adjusted r-square, and the predicted r-square are above 70% and similar in magnitude, indicating that this regression model is stable and buyer satisfaction is well predicted. The variation inflation factors for the four predictors are very close to the ideal value of one, another indication that the partial regression coefficients are stable.</p>
<p>The sequence of predictors specified in the regression model is of note because ARS test data and customer satisfaction are not from controlled experiments (i.e. observational data). The specific sequence of the predictors in this regression model indicates that the customer satisfaction is associated first with vehicle type (not statistically significant though) and then with the overall satisfaction with the purchased vehicle, followed by HP-to-mass ratio and, last, the two PC. Vehicle type is specified first because it is already known when buyers made their purchase. Then overall satisfaction with the purchased vehicle (i.e. brand perception and expectation) affects satisfaction with acceleration first, and followed by actual acceleration of the vehicle (two PC).</p>
<p>The sequence of predictors specified in the regression is important in understanding the individual predictors’ contribution to customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0954407012442775">Tables 2(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0954407012442775">(d)</xref>), which is known as the sequential sum of the square. If the sequence of predictors is simply switched, the sequential sum of the square for overall satisfaction and HP-to-mass ratio change considerably as well as PC 1 and PC 2. Overall satisfaction accounts for the most variance (6.5/11.51, from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954407012442775">Table 2</xref>) while PC 1 accounts for minor variance (0.29/11.51), however, PC 1 accounts for a very large amount of variance (3.42/11.51) by simply specifying it as the first predictor.</p>
<p>If these predictors are orthogonal, as in a controlled experiment, the sequence of the predictors specified in regression does not affect the variance explained in a regression model. The considerable changes in the sequential sum of the square occur because the overall satisfaction for a purchased vehicle and the HP-to-mass ratio are well correlated with each other and they are also well correlated to the two variation modes even though PC 1 and PC 2 are orthogonal. It is subsequently found that the HP-to-mass ratio has correlation coefficients of 0.62 with PC 1, 0.52 with overall vehicle satisfaction, and 0.52 with PC 2. The considerable changes in the sequential sum of square demonstrate the difficulty of interpreting the partial regression coefficients as a measure of importance of engineering metrics due to collinear predictors from observational data (i.e. the individual effects of different transmission gear ratio, aerodynamics, styling, or low rolling resistance tire, etc.). This is in spite of the fact that variation inflation factors are much smaller than the recommended value of 5 or 10 and close to the ideal value of one.</p>
<p>In summary, the vehicle type is associated with only one of the three customer satisfactions. The overall satisfaction with purchased vehicles and the two modes of acceleration are well associated with customer satisfaction with acceleration. Vehicles that reach the peak launch acceleration with short PD are associated with low customer satisfaction, suggesting that some acceleration should be available. However, these findings must be validated in controlled experiments.</p>

<title>Vehicles with high and low customer satisfaction</title>
<p>The ARS for the most and least preferred vehicles are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012442775">Figure 9</xref>. V2, V66, and V77 are rated lowest while V13, V48, and V49 show highest customer satisfaction. V2 reaches peak launch acceleration of 0.5g at a very long 40 mm PD and thus might be perceived sluggish. V2 is an example that uni-dimensional measure of peak launch acceleration is only a half-valid measure if the peak launch acceleration is utilized without knowing the PD. V66 reaches its peak launch acceleration of 0.3 g at 17.5 mm PD and remains flat (no acceleration achievable after 17.5 mm PD). Thus, overall acceleration is very low and it reaches its peak launch acceleration with very short PD. V77 shows similar behavior to V66; however, V77 shows acceleration close to 0.2g at 5 mm PD. This vehicle is very aggressive in acceleration with very short PD, considering the fact that most vehicles’ peak launch acceleration ranges between 0.3 g and 0.6 g. The areas of no acceleration (white area) for these three vehicles are large. The three vehicles with highest customer satisfaction (V13, V48 and V49) reach their peak acceleration of around 0.6g with 20 mm PD. These three vehicles still have plenty of acceleration (e.g. 0.2 g) left beyond 160 km/h speed. Also, there are very few areas of no acceleration.</p>

There are very few vehicles exceeding this shape in the current automotive market, with the exception of very expensive vehicles (i.e. beyond $100,000). Peak launch acceleration lower than 0.4 g and decreasing thereafter to zero acceleration at 130 km/h (i.e. 80 miles/h) is considered unsatisfactory due to insufficient acceleration (danger zone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012442775">Figure 11(a)</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on the ARS of V13, V48, V49, V80, V82, V39, and V55, the authors conclude that the launch acceleration of 0.6g at 20 mm PD seems to show the highest customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012442775">Figure 11(b)</xref>). The level of peak launch acceleration at 20 mm PD seems to be the most important factor. Vehicles with 0.6 g peak launch acceleration at 20 mm PD and less than 0.1g acceleration at 5 mm PD seem to show the highest buyer satisfaction. Thus, the acceleration gain of 0.03 g/mm is the desired value (acceleration divided by PD). Vehicles with less than 0.4 g peak launch acceleration at 20 mm PD also show low customer satisfaction. Vehicles with more than 0.1g at 5 mm PD seem to be perceived as having a touchy acceleration pedal. Vehicles with peak launch acceleration longer than 35 mm PD show low customer satisfaction. Two acceleration gains from PD and speed viewpoints, the area of no acceleration, thus constant speed, need to be considered for passing acceleration capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012442775">Figure 11(c)</xref>). These findings should be confirmed by controlled experiments.</p>
<p>It might prove an interesting subject to investigate how the distribution of acceleration affects the customer satisfaction from the top-view. It is recommended that the acceleration should be shaped and distributed equally and linearly for the acceleration between the slowest and fastest ideal acceleration levels (intermediate PD and vehicle speed). The rationale is that it is likely that customers perceive liner shapes more easily than non-linear shapes.

<p>The authors observe that the concept of PCA is difficult to comprehend due to its advanced mathematics. In particular, people ask, ‘What is PC?’, or ‘What is the measure of units for the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axis of the scatter plot?’ It seems especially difficult to understand that the <italic>x</italic>- and <italic>y</italic>-axes are linear combinations of the original variables.</p>
<p>The extracted variation modes will vary depending on the vehicles analyzed; therefore, a representative selection of vehicles from the market should be used. However, the 92 vehicles cover nearly the entire car and SUV market segments in 2006 and 2007. All these vehicles are well known in the automotive market. However, very few pickups, vans, and high-performance sport vehicles are included. Customer satisfaction with acceleration is also affected by several other factors (e.g. price, jerkiness, smooth gearshift, etc.) but they are not analyzed.</p>
<p>Controlled experiments are necessary to confirm the conclusions of this analysis. The two extracted modes could be used as design parameters. Vehicles will be configured to represent the extreme modes: (1) short/long PD to reach peak launch acceleration, (2) the high/low launch peak acceleration, and (3) high and low acceleration at 5 mm PD. Participants will then rate their satisfaction.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>PCA was applied to understand the underlying variation modes of the ARS among 92 vehicles encompassing the majority of the most important vehicles currently in the market. The results showed that two variation modes could represent the ARS well. The first variation mode showed the overall level of acceleration (i.e. area under the ARS). The second variation mode indicates the short/long PD used to reach peak launch acceleration with short PD. Customer ratings on acceleration from internal marketing surveys similar to Customer Reports and J.D. Power ratings were regressed on the two variation modes. The regression indicated that the two modes are well associated with customer satisfaction. Ideal ARS shapes are then developed. It is concluded that vehicles with 0.6g peak launch acceleration at 20 mm PD (i.e. acceleration gain of 0.06 g/20mm) and less than 0.1g acceleration at 5 mm PD seem to show the highest buyer satisfaction. Vehicles with less than 0.4g peak launch acceleration at 20 mm PD also show low customer satisfaction. Vehicles with more than 0.1 g at 5 mm PD seem to have touchy pedals and thus low customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Currently, many engineering specifications utilize only a few discrete points from transient and dynamic vehicle performance measures (e.g. acceleration, braking, ride, handling, noise, vibration, etc.). Many activities have been carried out to respond to the management request: ‘Which engineering metrics are most important to customer satisfaction?’ If the engineering metrics (i.e. response variables) do not correctly represent the multidimensional nature of vehicle performances, such activities would tend to be suboptimal or even doubtful, even though controlled experiments are applied. PCA can analyse transience and multidimensionality, which down the road could prove to be important design variables in controlled experiments.</p>
<p>The underlying modes are extracted without considering the customer satisfaction. A methodology called partial least square can modify the underlying modes so that they can be maximally correlated with customer satisfaction. However, this approach is not taken yet because the customer satisfaction data from mail survey contains much noise and many confounding factors. Another method called parallel factor analysis could be applied to consider the 3D arrays of 96 ARS, this method does not require that a 3D array be transformed into a two-dimensional matrix.</p>
