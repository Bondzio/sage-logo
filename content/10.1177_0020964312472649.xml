<p>HEALING STORIES CONFRONT PREACHERS with formidable challenges. One pastoral problem involves the reality of suffering and pain within our congregations. Yes, Jesus was in the healing business. And yes, we believe God still works to effect healing. But how many weeks may a preacher extol Jesus’ healing ministry in a given year? One group of researchers estimates that over 30% of Americans live with chronic pain (Catherine B. Johannes et al., “The Prevalence of Chronic Pain in United States Adults: Results of an Internet-Based Survey,” <italic>Journal of Pain</italic> 11 [2010]: 1230–39). Another puts the number closer to 40% (Alina Selyukh, “Chronic pain costs U.S. up to $635 billion a year,” Reuters, June 29, 2011. Online: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-pain-iom-idUSTRE75S4GX20110629">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/29/us-pain-iom-idUSTRE75S4GX20110629</ext-link>, accessed April 30, 2012).</p>
<p>Preachers also face the sheer volume of healing stories in the Gospels. Luke 7:1–10 constitutes the sixth individual healing or exorcism story in Luke’s narrative, not counting the summaries of Jesus’ healing activities in Luke 4:40–41, 5:15, and 6:17–19. The centurion’s slave, Luke informs us, is just about to die before Jesus delivers him. Many in our congregations pray that someone they love will receive similar deliverance, yet they wind up attending the funeral just the same. Week after week, what can preachers say about healing and death?</p>
<p>One helpful practice for interpreting healing stories involves attending to what is distinctive in each one. The Gospels celebrate Jesus’ power over sickness and death, but they rarely tell the same story over and over. Nearly every healing story brings with it unique features not found in any simple formula. The story of the centurion’s slave stands out in several respects, each one an opportunity for proclamation.</p>
<p>First, Luke pairs the narrative of the centurion’s slave with that of the widow’s son (7:11–17). Luke frequently takes traditions from Mark or Q and pairs them with independent traditions that feature female characters. While the widow does not speak in Luke’s account, the story slows down to focus upon her and her plight: the dead man is “his mother’s only son—and she was a widow—and a great crowd from the city was with her” (7:12; my translation). No wonder the Lord’s compassion falls upon her (7:13). Not only does she grieve her only son, but also her destitution may lurk just around the corner. These two stories, then, share a common focus on the predicament of the person who faces the death of a loved one. Careful interpreters note that the Greek does not resolve whether the centurion’s slave is “honored,” “valuable,” or “dear” to him. The temptation to associate <italic>entimos</italic> (7:2) with “intimate” is just too much for some preachers to bear. By pairing the centurion’s story with the widow’s very personal grief, and by describing the slave not only as a <italic>doulos</italic> (slave) but also as a <italic>pais</italic> (child), Luke strongly suggests a relationship of affection in addition to mere utility.</p>
<p>Second, the centurion/widow pairing recalls Jesus’ speech at Nazareth. Luke takes Mark’s account of Jesus’ underwhelming reception in Nazareth (Mark 6:1–6a), edits it dramatically, and moves it to the very beginning of Jesus’ public career (Luke 4:14–30). As such, Jesus’ visit to Nazareth provides a critical piece, perhaps the concluding piece, for Luke’s introduction of Jesus. Whereas Mark traces Jesus’ Nazareth troubles to folks’ familiarity with “Mary’s son” (Matt 13:53–58 deviates slightly), Luke attributes the conflict to the very content of Jesus’ teaching. People like Jesus’ gracious words on Isaiah, including release to the captives, new sight for the blind, and release for the oppressed, and the fulfillment of all these things in their hearing (4:22). They do not like it, however, when Jesus points out that God’s blessing can pass by Israel to include Gentile widows and military officers (4:25–27).</p>
<p>Jesus, Luke’s great prophet, extends healing beyond Israel’s boundaries. Like Elisha, Jesus ministers to a Gentile military official, and like Elijah, he restores life to a widow’s son who by all appearances has died. The parallels are not perfect. The centurion seeks healing for his slave, not for himself, as Naaman does. Yet like Naaman, he does send emissaries. Meanwhile, the widow at Nain appears to be a Galilean and not a Sidonian. (Why Luke extends the report of her son’s healing to Judea remains a mystery.) Nevertheless, Jesus “marvels” at the centurion: “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith” (7:9).</p>
<p>Third, the centurion represents a rare case among the Gospel supplicants. Gospel supplicants rarely seek healing for someone else, but Luke includes a few cases of “worthy” supplicants. Jesus heals Simon’s mother-in-law after “they” ask him to, and he responds to the faith of the paralytic’s friends (5:17–26). In 7:1–17, the narrative focus resides with both the Gentile official and the widow, not with the persons who find themselves healed. Not only does the centurion love the people, he also has built the local synagogue at Capernaum. According to the local elders, he is “worthy” of Jesus’ consideration (7:4–5).</p>
<p>Interpreters may puzzle over the centurion’s mediated interaction with Jesus. Why does this “worthy” (7:4) centurion consider himself “unworthy” (7:6) to have Jesus visit, and why does he consider himself “unworthy” to come out and greet Jesus himself (7:7)? One suspects that Jesus perceives the centurion’s faith when the centurion’s friends deliver his speech. As a person of high status, the centurion recognizes one of his own kind—but of a greater degree—in Jesus. Jesus need only “speak in a word” (my translation), and the boy will be healed.</p>
<p>Many people who attend our preaching wonder about their own “worthiness” to receive healing. Indeed, this question haunts the souls of many, functioning as a curse for those humble enough to accept their faults and who so desire wholeness for those they love. The pastoral and homiletic dilemma might intensify if we recognize a signature dimension of Luke and Acts. While Luke’s Gospel celebrates Jesus’ companionship with sinners, Acts depicts all of its converts, including the centurion, as worthy in advance of the gospel’s arrival. Careful preachers, then, will observe Luke’s pairing of the centurion’s story with the widow’s. While the centurion demonstrates his faith by recognizing Jesus’ authority, the widow does no such thing. Jesus extends compassion to her simply on account of her plight. No spiritual mathematics accounts for the relationship between worthiness and healing, nor should the burden of such calculus weigh people down.</p>
<p>Fourth, the centurion in this healing story is especially rich in relationships. The Capernaum elders “earnestly” (v. 4) entreat Jesus on his behalf. Later in Luke, “the elders” represent a menacing group of Jesus’ adversaries, participants in the plot to kill Jesus, but no such sinister implications attend these elders. The centurion employs other friends to greet Jesus’ on his way, and these execute his bidding perfectly. One might read the story with a bit of suspicion: this enemy of the people sends elders, future enemies of Jesus, and then his friends on behalf of his slave. Perhaps the story amounts to the primary case study in Jesus’ command to “love your enemies” and to “be merciful, as your Father is merciful” (6:35–36). But such a suspicious reading requires that we read into the story associations the narrative has not yet provided. Instead, the healing of the centurion’s slave involves a web of relationships. Healing always goes better, and is more likely, with a healthy web of relationships. We observe how the centurion benefits from his relationships as well as his faith. We never hear of the widow’s faith, but a crowd does attend her in her grief (7:12).</p>
<p>One primary relationship drives the story, that of the centurion and his “esteemed” (<italic>entimos</italic> again) slave. I have no desire to stir up the sexuality debates among the churches, but I must also confess my own bafflement with so many commentators who simply assume that this relationship is asexual. It is indeed possible that the “boy” (<italic>pais</italic>) is “valuable” (<italic>entimos</italic>) by virtue of his education or training. It is also possible that the boy is “treasured” or “highly valued” (<italic>entimos</italic>), as the NRSV states, by the centurion on the basis of friendly affection or faithful service. But surely, one cannot exclude the possibility that ancient readers would have taken the dual description of the slave as both <italic>entimos</italic> and <italic>pais</italic> as a sign of sexual intimacy. This is the most likely way in which a “boy” (whose age we do not know) would have been “dear” to a centurion. The point here is not to employ the passage in contemporary polemics nor to condone the horrific practice of sexual abuse of minors by adults, but to reiterate the significance of relationships in this healing story.</p>
<p>Preachers never go wrong in proclaiming the power of Jesus’ healing ministry and God’s healing will. Preaching about healing calls forth the best of our pastoral and theological sensitivities. Like so many healing stories, however, this one has its own distinctive characteristics, opening space for us to reflect on grieving and love, the boundlessness of God’s mercy, God’s ability to respond to us as we are, and the role of relationships in healing.</p>
