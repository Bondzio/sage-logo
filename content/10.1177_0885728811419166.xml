<abstract>
<p>Although early work experiences can impart a number of benefits to adolescents with disabilities, few students have meaningful access to these opportunities. The authors examined “community conversations” to build capacity and interest in expanding employment opportunities. Events were held in seven different communities and used the World Café process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885728811419166">Brown &amp; Isaacs, 2005</xref>) to facilitate asset-based identification of localized next steps. Observations, analyses of surveys completed by the 239 community members who attended, and examination of artifacts suggested that the events offer a promising avenue for identifying solutions, building social capital, and increasing employment opportunities. The authors offer recommendations for drawing on this approach to harness and build the capacity of communities to support youth in transition, along with directions for future research.</p>

<p>Early work experiences are among the strongest factors linked to positive postschool outcomes for youth with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885728811419166">Test et al., 2009</xref>). These experiences often lead to increased skill development, expanded opportunities to explore strengths and interests, and stronger connections to employers and the range of employment possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885728811419166">Zimmer-Gembeck &amp; Mortimer, 2006</xref>). Yet, despite the efforts of the educational system to strengthen vocational and rigorous inclusive educational experiences in preparation for postschool employment, adolescents with disabilities continue to experience significantly lower employment rates than their peers without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885728811419166">Wagner, Cadwallader, &amp; Marder, 2003</xref>). Clearly, improving employment outcomes for youth with disabilities—like so many complex social issues—will require a much more comprehensive approach than can be addressed by any single organization system working in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885728811419166">National Alliance for Secondary Education and Transition, 2005</xref>). Instead, new approaches are needed for engaging broader segments of a community in ways that draw on all local assets, build new partnerships, exchange information, generate novel and locally feasible solutions, and increase the community’s capacity to work together. Community conversations show promise as an approach for generating solutions to a common problem that affects all members of a community to varying degrees, harnessing the capacity of diverse perspectives, local resources, and social capital.</p>
<p>A workforce experiencing stable employment—one that includes young adults with disabilities—has a positive impact on the entire community. Consistent opportunities to work contribute to the financial independence of a population vulnerable to under- and unemployment, the cache of individuals’ support services and benefits such as health insurance, and the diversity and strength of social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885728811419166">Grant, 2008</xref>). Indeed, everyone benefits when all citizens—including those with disabilities—are contributing to the economic and civic stability of a community. Economic self-sufficiency means less reliance on tax-funded programs and supports. In addition, when people with disabilities have disposable income to spend in their communities, it enhances local prosperity. Yet, according to the National Longitudinal Transition Study–2, only 36% of youth with intellectual disabilities and 53% of youth with emotional and behavioral disabilities have worked either during the school year or during the summer of a given year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885728811419166">Wagner et al., 2003</xref>). In the state in which this current study was conducted, only 38% of youth with significant disabilities and 53% of youth with emotional/behavioral disabilities worked at any point during the summer, compared with 72% of youth with learning disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885728811419166">Carter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885728811419166">Carter, Trainor, Ditchman, Swedeen, &amp; Owens, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some youth with disabilities successfully find and keep jobs, youth with disabilities often face greater obstacles in identifying and retaining work experiences, such as having to overcome low community expectations, identify and secure needed supports, and obtain adequate career preparation. For example, many employers report hesitation in hiring individuals with disabilities because they are unsure of where or how to find support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885728811419166">Smith &amp; Philippen, 2005</xref>). In addition, school staff and leadership, traditionally responsible for providing work experiences for adolescents, may be uncertain about how best to partner with leaders from the business community to identify and increase opportunities that include adolescents with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811419166">Carter, Trainor, Cakiroglu, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885728811419166">Trainor, Carter, Owens, &amp; Swedeen, 2008</xref>). Given the poor employment rates for youth with disabilities nationwide, using a community organizing strategy such as community conversations may hold potential for bringing a broad cross-section of community members together to identify specific localized solutions that address the pervasive challenges associated with increasing employment access for youth with disabilities.</p>
<p>A wide range of participants with diverse experiences and perspectives are assets in community-based problem-solving approaches because consensus among and across a broad base of stakeholders is more effective in creating sustainable changes than simply finding agreement among a community’s established leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885728811419166">Hyde &amp; Meyer, 2010</xref>). One way to problem solve with a diverse group of community members is to form a community coalition. A coalition is made up of diverse community members who brainstorm together to tackle community problems or needs, leading to the pooling of resources that can be used to intervene when a challenge surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885728811419166">Wolff, 2001</xref>). Diversifying and expanding the number of individuals contributing to these efforts also helps create synergy in the problem-solving processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885728811419166">Lasker, Weiss, &amp; Miller, 2001</xref>). Each individual brings different perspectives and ideas, connections to different programs and services, and social networking that holds potential to evolve into meaningful partnerships. Other outside factors that affect a coalition’s synergy include access to tangible resources and community expertise, the establishment of relationships among participants, and public policy that supports interdependency among people and programs. Diverse collaboration, in fact, is more likely to afford positive outcomes and mitigate the presence of negative outside forces, such as a lack of funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885728811419166">Lasker et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Once a diverse group of individuals come together, many different ways exist to problem solve and act on community change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885728811419166">Watson-Thompson, Fawcett, &amp; Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885728811419166">Wells, Ward, Feinberg, &amp; Alexander, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885728811419166">Wells and colleagues (2008)</xref> examined 79 youth-oriented coalitions to identify motivations for participation and engagement across community members. Results illustrated that membership and buy-in increased when people had multiple opportunities to affect outcomes and were included in group processes. To engender a wide variety of solutions, leaders of community-based approaches need to ensure that diverse participants are included and feel welcomed at meetings and to provide supportive feedback to participants.</p>
<p>Another way to address community issues is by using specific problem-solving strategies. For example, a proactive focus on mission, objectives, and strategic actions may be particularly fruitful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885728811419166">Watson-Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). Brainstorming solutions require coalition members to assess a community problem, generate outcome goals, and identify practical responses and interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885728811419166">Watson-Thompson et al., 2008</xref>). Effective solutions are likely to be practical and involve the use of existing resources, evidenced through pooling assets and sharing information. Ensuring that the unique contributions that combine to create a collective profile of a community, as well as aligning a plan of action with those characteristics, is an additional element of successful community-based problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885728811419166">Arthur et al., 2010</xref>). Developing a community profile, tailoring a plan to match the profile, and then implementing suggested solutions are each necessary steps in the problem-solving process. Often implemented in relation to finding solutions to health care issues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885728811419166">Feinberg, Jones, Greenberg, Osgood, and Bontempo (2009)</xref> found this model to be effective in reaching adolescent community members and intervening to solve problems relevant to their lives, such as increasing academic achievement or decreasing undesirable or troubling behaviors. Results from a <italic>meta-analysis</italic> of community-based problem-solving partnerships implemented in 34 studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885728811419166">Roussos &amp; Fawcett, 2000</xref>) identified the following essential components to effective collaboration: identifying a common problem in need of attention, having a clear group vision for potential solutions, creating detailed plans for collaboration that include consideration of logistics (e.g., location, duration), and sustaining community member buy-in. Openness to divergent ideas and input as well as perceived equal standing of all participants are essential to successful collaborative efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885728811419166">Hicks, Larson, Nelson, Olds, &amp; Johnston, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Our goal in this research project was to bring diverse set of community members together as part of a multipronged intervention package designed to increase employment opportunities for students with disabilities. To maximize collaboration with institutions and people known to support community involvement and partnerships, we implemented community conversations as a first step in the process. A major focus of these events was to identify community resources that could partner with schools to support employment for students with disabilities. These structured conversations, described in detail below, were held in multiple, distinct communities and drew on the World Café process (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theworldcafe.com">www.theworldcafe.com</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885728811419166">Brown &amp; Isaacs, 2005</xref>). In this approach, small groups of people with diverse perspectives and experiences are brought together to brainstorm and exchange ideas about a community concern or issue. Following a series of small-group discussions, the entire group comes together to share ideas and strategies. Specific to this project, groups brainstormed strategies to increase employment for youth with disabilities. We encouraged involvement from a range and breadth of community members. In addition, we developed an environment conducive to problem solving by responding to community members’ preferences regarding meeting logistics and atmosphere and acknowledging the capacity and contributions of all participants. In the following sections, we detail the process, results, and implications of this model for collaboration. The purpose of this research study was to examine the implementation of community conversation events as one avenue for strengthening the capacity of communities to increase employment outcomes for youth with disabilities.</p>
<sec id="section1-0885728811419166" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We held seven community conversations with two purposes in mind. First, the community conversations were one component of a multipronged intervention designed to increase summer opportunities for youth with disabilities. Findings from this intervention evaluation are beyond the scope of this article and are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885728811419166">Carter, Trainor, Ditchman, &amp; Owens, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885728811419166">Carter, Trainor, Ditchman, Swedeen, &amp; Owens, 2009</xref>). Second, we were interested in better understanding the process of bringing a wide range of community members together to address a shared concern. The following research questions guided our study of community conversations:</p>

<title>Communities</title>
<p>We implemented community conversations in seven communities purposefully selected to build a diverse sample based on population size, urbanicity, and geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885728811419166">Patton, 2002</xref>). A minimum of one high school from each community participated in a larger research project focused on developing an intervention to increase employment and community activities for youth with disabilities during the summer months. According to U.S. Census data, two schools served midsized cities, three served urban fringes of large cities, one served a large town, and one served a small town.

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One of our primary goals was to gather a broad cross-section of participants from the community, including a substantial number of participants who may have limited familiarity with disability or adolescent issues, to gather new perspectives, resources, ideas, and connections. Anticipating that some community members may be initially reluctant to spend an evening discussing an issue about which they might perceive they have little direct connection or background knowledge, we used a variety of strategies to encourage broad participation and promote the event across each community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0885728811419166">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>For recruitment purposes, we created an invitation that would resonate with a variety of different community members. The invitation—a one-page print and electronic flyer—noted the community’s need for high-quality employees and emphasized that adolescents with disabilities desired work and comprised a viable source of dependable, high-quality employees. We also defined the parameters of the duration of the conversation: a one-time evening event lasting about 2 hours. Next, we compiled an initial list of invitees by (a) including stakeholders identified in the professional literature on adolescent employment and disability and (b) collaborating with local school staff, business representatives, and other community members who comprised a broad range of potential participants. The list enumerated a range of stakeholders, including school, human resource, and vocational rehabilitation staff; city and state policy makers; community development organizers; civic and service club volunteers; employers; families and youth; and staff from other community entities (e.g., 4-H, the YMCA, Boys and Girls clubs, Citizen Action Coalitions, the Humane Society). The publicity flyer and all communication jointly listed the local high school and either the Chamber of Commerce or a local business as cosponsors of the event, potentially increasing credibility among diverse audiences (e.g., city government, employers, volunteer groups).</p>
<p>The flyer was sent via email to the broad invitee list and physically posted in public places, such as schools, libraries, community centers, municipal buildings, schools, and other visible locations. In addition, we requested school staff, youth, and other community members who were instrumental in planning the conversation to personally share the invitation to potential participants. Invitations were also disseminated on local email listservs and included in various newsletters of schools, PTAs, human service organizations, and Chambers of Commerce. Simultaneously, we developed a local press release that included a quote from a participating teacher and business member. In six of the seven communities, these press releases resulted in feature articles in local newspapers promoting the conversation before it took place. Publicity for each event began 4 to 6 weeks in advance of the scheduled event dates.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection aligned with the steps in the implementation of the community conversation. At each event, five to six members of the research team assisted in facilitating the event. During the conversations, at least two members of the research team observed the process and took field notes on laptops. We also collected written artifacts, such as anonymous participant surveys, from each event. Each of these types of data is described below in further detail. Finally, the research team, consisting of two or three of the principal investigators, the project manager, and several graduate student researchers, debriefed the events of the evening, noting necessary changes or thoughts about future implementation and analysis of observations.</p>
<sec id="section7-0885728811419166">
<title>Event procedures</title>
<p>Participants signed in as they arrived and sat at round tables in groups of four to six people. Either in advance or as participants arrived, we asked specific people to act as “table hosts,” based on our estimation of familiarity with the focus of the event (i.e., increasing youth employment) and/or comfort level with the World Café process. Table hosts did not receive prior training; rather, they were asked to generally facilitate the breakout conversations according to the “host responsibilities” posted at each table. Examples of host responsibilities included facilitating introductions, reminding participants to jot down key ideas on paper placemats, and briefly summarizing the previous discussion to new participants at each new round of discussion. Each community conversation started with a brief 15-min welcome, overview of the topic of discussion (i.e., employment for adolescents with disabilities), and a description of the process we intended to follow (i.e., the World Café). Last, we explained that we would be collecting data about the community conversation as part of a larger research project. Two questions were then posed to the participants for discussion during the remainder of the evening:</p>
<list id="list2-0885728811419166" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What can our community do to increase summer employment for youth with disabilities?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What can I do to increase summer employment for youth with disabilities?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We encouraged participants to write or jot ideas on paper placemats and tablecloths provided at each table and then collected at the end of the conversation. Event facilitators, all members of the research team, circulated among the tables to answer questions and guide the process of the conversation. Discussion of the first question occurred in small groups. After 20 min of discussion, attendees were asked to disperse to a new table with participants with whom they had not been sitting. The purpose of shifting the group configurations was to increase the diversity of ideas and the opportunity for participants to connect with one another. After a second round of discussion on the first question, participants were asked to move once more, to begin discussing the second question. By the end of the evening, participants conversed with an average of 12 to 18 other people. After three rounds of discussion, the large group reassembled and small-group ideas were shared with all participants through a facilitated discussion and shared notes on large poster paper. This final discussion lasted approximately 15 to 20 min.</p>

<sec id="section8-0885728811419166">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>At the end of each community conversation, all community members who attended the event were invited to complete an anonymous survey addressing their views regarding the event itself (6 items) and their perceptions of broader community (7 items). Attendees were asked to rate the extent to which they agreed with each of the statements (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885728811419166">Table 3</xref> for actual items) using a 4-point scale ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly agree.</italic> An option to mark “I don’t know” was included. In addition, attendees were asked to indicate which descriptor best described their role at the event (i.e., school staff, employer or business community, human services agency or organization, parent or family member of someone with disabilities, youth, or other, with space to write in) and to indicate whether they worked with people with disabilities regularly as part of their job. Finally, three open-ended items asked participants to complete the following stems:</p>
<list id="list3-0885728811419166" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>I attended tonight’s community conversation because . . .</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If I were asked what recommendations I had for improving the quality of this evening, I would suggest . . .</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I wish the following people from our community had been present at tonight’s event . . . [no need to include actual names . . . for example, you could say “someone from ____ agency” or “someone working at ____ business.”]</p></list-item>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Research artifacts collected for analysis included placemats, tablecloths, and chart paper from small- and large-group discussions at each conversation. In addition, participant questionnaires were collected and analyzed, as were observational field notes and notes from research-team debriefing sessions. From the seven community events, the total data set included 7 sets of participant-generated data (as recorded at each small- and large-group discussion), 18 sets of observational and debriefing field notes, and 191 completed participant questionnaires. Our focus for this analysis was on the content of the participant-generated data and on participants’ questionnaire responses.</p>
<p>Aligned with our dual purposes for conducting community conversations, we had dual purposes for our analyses. First, we implemented each event as a component of an intervention designed to increase access to employment for adolescents with disabilities. Therefore, we developed brief, community-specific reports that listed participants by broad affiliation, key challenges raised at the event, a list of ideas and resources generated at each conversation event to address each challenge, and a set of recommended next-steps. This summary—along with a thank you for attending the event—was sent by email within a few weeks after each community conversation to all participants who voluntarily provided contact information. Our second purpose was to examine the process of community conversations and their potential to be used as a tool to support collaborative, community-based problem solving. For both of these purposes, we used a generic approach to qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885728811419166">Caelli, Ray, &amp; Mill, 2003</xref>), meaning that we coded data inductively according to our interpretations of its content. We simultaneously examined relationships among codes and represented these relationships with themes. For example, when coding, we identified numerous participant comments that addressed transportation needs. Thematically, community members stressed the need to find creative and collaborative solutions to address transportation limitations. Collaboration and creativity, then, became a theme that stretched across communities and populations.</p>
<p>Because this was a group analytic process involving multiple researchers, a project coordinator, and several graduate assistants, our focus was to individually analyze data and then reach consensus where differences surfaced. The desired outcome of our analysis was to summarize the lessons learned from the community conversation process across multiple communities and through the lenses of multiple researchers; therefore, multiple interpretations of the data were not only acceptable, they were anticipated. To facilitate this process, the first author led the collaborative research group in the utilization of NVivo™, a qualitative data analysis software. Using this program allowed us to create a log that detailed our coding schema and thematic analyses, to examine each other’s work, and to make suggested changes without altering any original data set.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section11-0885728811419166">
<title>Community Conversation Participants</title>
<p>Attendance across the seven community conversations ranged from 17 to 61 (<italic>M</italic> = 34) and included persons identifying themselves as human services agency or organization staff (18.0%), high school staff (16.3%), family members or youth with disabilities (21.3%), employers (12.6%), or others (e.g., local and state government representatives, media; 12.1%). The remaining participants did not identify their role on the anonymous survey. Across the seven conversation events, more than 100 employers, agencies, and organizations were represented, including faith communities, civic groups, nonprofit and for-profit businesses, organizations that rely on volunteers (e.g., the Humane Society and community gardens), youth development programs, job centers, city and state policy makers, school board members, and a variety of others. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885728811419166">Table 1</xref> for community conversation participant roles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0885728811419166">
<title>Community-Based Solutions Generated</title>
<p>As reflected in the community conversation questions, we intentionally designed our process to generate potential solutions to problems rather than to focus on problem identification. Our goal was to facilitate community-generated ideas and solutions. To this end, we facilitated large-group sharing sessions at the end of each conversation and noted solutions on poster paper. Within a few weeks following each conversation, we sent a summary of the community conversation along with the participant-generated list of solutions to attendees. Connecting youth with disabilities to existing resources, developing employer awareness, and providing transportation were the most commonly addressed solution categories. Other solution categories were generated to address localized and unique issues. For example, members of the event in Community C identified challenges to interagency collaboration and generated a series of solutions that would increase direct contact between youth, their families, and local employers. One community conversation event solution included increasing youths’ awareness of where to locate employment information and educating employers about the youth workforce and disability. Another focused on family awareness of existing agency resources such as vocational rehabilitation and strategies for accessing related services. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885728811419166">Table 2</xref> depicts the categories of solutions generated in each community conversation.</p>
<p>Transportation presented a common obstacle to youths’ opportunities to work during the summer. Some ideas and solutions for developing transportation supports transcended community characteristics. For example, reduced-cost or subsidized taxis and senior citizen volunteers were two suggestions for increasing transportation availability in Communities A, B, F, and G. Other ideas and solutions were specific to community characteristics. For example, in Community F, a suburban community, many participants were aware of, and had access to, a countywide volunteer organization with a time bank component. Participants in this conversation event suggested making members of the time bank aware of youth’s work-related transportation needs, noting that volunteers would be able to redeem their time spent providing transportation receiving services they needs from other volunteers in the time bank. . . . noting that volunteers would be able to exchange the time that they provided transportation for needed services provided by other volunteers in the time bank.</p>
<p>Solutions aimed at developing employers’ awareness of employment and disability issues, also acknowledged at all but one of the community conversation events, included a wide range of ideas that built on the concept of social networking. In Community E, solutions included Chamber of Commerce–sponsored events such as meals or meet-and-greets with youth employees. In Communities A and E, one potential solution was to have business-to-business networks of mentors who would share expertise in the areas of disability and employment. Community G members considered having youth speakers address Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions Clubs to speak about personal experiences related to disability and employment. Although each event surfaced solutions around a common core of potential obstacles, solutions were context specific and generated by a diverse group of community members who were able to bring a range of perspectives and ideas into event discussions.</p>

<sec id="section13-0885728811419166">
<title>The Social Validity of the Process</title>
<p>Participants overwhelmingly agreed that the community conversation process was a valuable way to spend their time (range = 93.5%–100%; <italic>M</italic> = 97.9). Most participants also agreed that they learned about resources and connections related to youth employment that they did not previously know about (range = 82.6%–100%; <italic>M</italic> = 90.5). Furthermore, nearly three quarters or more (range = 73.4%–100%; <italic>M</italic> = 92) of participants across communities responded that the community conversations helped them identify what they personally could do to increase employment opportunities for youth with disabilities. Overall, most participants (range = 91.0%–100%; <italic>M</italic> = 95.5) agreed that they left the conversation with an improved perception of the community’s capacity to improve employment opportunities for youth with disabilities.</p>
<p>At the same time, surveys results illustrate that participants’ views of their communities did not reflect confidence that the employment-related needs of youth with disabilities were being met in their communities. Fewer than half of all participants perceived that “numerous opportunities for employment for youth with disabilities” existed (range = 33.3%–46.9%; <italic>M</italic> = 39.5), yet most indicated that their communities did have the capacity to support young employees with disabilities (range = 57.2%–79.3%; <italic>M</italic> = 69.6). According to participants, employers in their community may need help learning how to support youth with disabilities on the job (range = 90.9%–100%; <italic>M</italic> = 96.7) and only about half of attendees believed that strong school–employer partnerships existed in their community (range = 33.4%–63.6%; <italic>M</italic> = 49.5). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0885728811419166">Table 3</xref> summarizes data from the community conversation questionnaires.</p>

<title>Building Social and Cultural Capital Through Community Conversations</title>
<p>These seven community conversation events brought diverse groups of community members together, providing a powerful context to build trust and develop networks of support known as social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885728811419166">Putnam, 2000</xref>). The development of social capital, through strengthened personal networks, leverages the development of cultural capital such as material information (e.g., how to apply for a job) and nuanced understandings of identity, roles, and processes (e.g., how to meet and interact with employers at formal and informal events). Put simply, capital can be thought of as a resource that has potential to leverage power. During the transition to adulthood, social and cultural capital is essential for youth with disabilities and their families as they leave special education, a system of entitlement, and enter systems of eligibility (e.g., vocational rehabilitation), requiring them to acquire and use information and networks to connect to community opportunities for employment and other activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885728811419166">Condeluci, Ledbetter, Ortman, Fromknecht, &amp; DeFries, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885728811419166">Trainor, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Community conversation events facilitated social capital such as connections with members of the business community and created sources for cultural capital in the form of information about employment opportunities for teachers, students, and their families. For example, in Community E, the mayor attended and spoke of opportunities for summer jobs within the city government. He subsequently hired three youth in his municipal offices. In the same community, the president of a local bank discussed the potential for youth with disabilities to work in his organization. In three communities, local news reporters attended and participated in the conversations, resulting in more in-depth feature stories that helped build awareness and understanding about the importance of employment for youth with disabilities after the event.</p>
<p>Community conversation events also prompted the exchange of cultural capital, a resource that is, at times, implicit, contributing to an underlying culture or way of doing or knowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885728811419166">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>). During each conversation event, people discussed their experiences with employment in the community, sharing their perceptions of employers who were open to working with youth with and without disabilities. At one event, a banker from Community E demonstrated commitment and a willingness to get involved, contributing to a shared sense of purpose and possibility. Similarly, in Communities C, D, and F, local employers shared with others about the positive experiences they had with hiring youth with disabilities. These shared stories and perceptions may have raised greater awareness of a key need facing the community and enhanced views concerning the feasibility of taking action, constituting a shared cultural capital.</p>
<p>Across communities, the breadth of participants represented a diversity of community members’ roles. The diversity of participants’ roles and experiences with youth employment contributed to a constellation of solutions that likely extended beyond what one school or several transition teachers could generate on their own. We interpret this breadth to exemplify the untapped potential of this approach in harnessing the ideas, connections, and resources (i.e., capital) of a broad range of community members in developing new and community-specific solutions to a particular issue. Participants, even those who perceived themselves to be removed from the issue, found the conversations to be a good use of their time and agreed that it improved their knowledge and perceptions about the capacity of their community to respond to this specific challenge. For example, civic leaders and employers who joined community conversations had varying experiences working directly with youth with disabilities, yet each group recognized the potential that access to employment and high-quality employees have on the economic well-being of the community, thus justifying the time they devoted to the community conversations. In addition, community members who represented stakeholders with direct connections to disability and employment issues (e.g., parents and teachers associated with individual youth with disabilities) comprised a substantial number of participants.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the numbers of event attendees did not correlate with the size of community. One of the smallest communities, Community F, generated a large number of attendees to the conversation. Even at the smaller conversations, we found that 20 participants were enough to generate new ideas and make initial connections to community resources and people, particularly when diverse stakeholders were involved. For example, although the number of participants at the conversation in Community E was small, the mayor, a banker, and the head librarian came together to generate solutions that included increasing youth connections through the use of the Internet and city websites that provide human resources information and applying for transportation-related grants. The community conversations with large numbers of attendees were events in which school staff and students personally invited people to attend, rather than relying solely on flyers, newspaper coverage, and email invites. In addition, the least-attended community conversation coincided with a winter snow storm, conceivably preventing some people from attending.</p>

<title>The Feasibility of Using Community Conversations to Solve Problems</title>
<p>As Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885728811419166">Putnam (2000)</xref> observed in <italic>Bowling Alone,</italic> modern American life leaves precious little time for coming together in community. In our experience, holding community conversations is a low-investment, high-yield endeavor. The feasibility of organizing community members to come together, get to know one another, and work toward generating potential solutions that address a common problem is not complicated. Although our research team was primarily responsible for organizing the events we discuss in this article, we did not tap into a specialized knowledge set, large caches of funding, nor did we utilize specific tools or other resources available only in the contexts of universities. We used the Internet, developed paper flyers, and relied on word of mouth to publicize the events. We held the events in public spaces, and our supplies (pens, paper, etc.) were not costly. The conversations were a part of a larger intervention study that drew on the solutions that emerged from the conversations to promote employment for participants, who were all youth with disabilities.</p>
<p>With a relatively low time commitment by the community conversation participants themselves, feasible solutions and incremental steps toward more long-term goals surfaced and became public knowledge. In addition, community members increased their awareness of the interests and needs of a historically marginalized group, youth with disabilities. Furthermore, rather than focusing on what the communities lacked, the process affords a solutions-based approach. The solutions themselves were community generated, thus maximizing the contextual factors that influence both the problem and the solution.</p>
<p>Tracking the extent to which participants acted on every suggested solution generated in community conversations was not feasible. However, we were able to gain information about community members’ follow through via other data collection efforts that were a part of our larger project. For example, in the larger project, we interviewed those persons responsible for helping youth solidify plans for summer employment. Community connectors, as these adults in the intervention were called, reported that specific ideas, connections, or strategies from community conversations were instrumental in connecting youth with summer employment experiences. Community connectors reported that this was the case for youth included in the intervention, approximately 14 of the 38 (36.8%) youth with severe disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885728811419166">Carter, Trainor, Ditchman, et al., 2009</xref>) and 15 of the 33 (45.5%) youth with emotional and behavioral disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885728811419166">Carter, Trainor, Ditchman, Swedeen, et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, community connectors noted that the community conversations helped them navigate their roles in promoting employment. To expand data collection to ascertain the long-term impact of community conversations, future research could implement a follow-up survey, asking attendees to detail what, if any, actions they took as a result of their participation in the event. Another approach could include tracking youth involvement in work experiences over time to see whether there is an increase while they are still in school or utilizing postschool outcome data.</p>
<p>Although we were enthused by the response to the community conversation events, we interpret the results with caution. Community participants were diverse in terms of their roles and experiences in relation to employment and disability. However, we did not track other aspects of diversity such as race/ethnicity, language, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Future research should incorporate questions and methods of data collection and analysis that allow researchers to pay close attention to these expanded aspects of diversity. Moreover, although some of the youth who attended were active participants who provided ideas and suggestions, youth with more significant disabilities and communication challenges may need advanced preparation by school staff and family members that provides strategies and encouragement for sharing their thoughts and experiences at the event. In addition, we do not have data detailing the specific transition education programs currently in place at each setting. Participants did share general comments about school-based programs and community-based resources they found to be useful, yet we do not know how specific participating youth with disabilities were currently being prepared for transition. To better understand the impact of community conversations, it would be helpful to have this information. Finally, we recommend that future research projects incorporate audio or video recordings of community conversations so that participants’ full conversations can be analyzed for content and context.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, this study contributes important initial findings and implications for a process that is widely used in other contexts but one that educators and community members concerned about education have yet to fully tap. Replicating community conversations involves context-specific decision making (see implementation details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885728811419166">Carter, Owens, Swedeen, Trainor, Thompson, Ditchman, &amp; Cole (2009))</xref>; however, the process is not complicated and has potential to yield valuable experiences for communities united by a common problem in need of solving.</p>
