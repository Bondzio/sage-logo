<abstract>
<p>Health literacy may be defined as the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. While health literacy has become a vibrant area of international research, Ireland has lagged behind and to date few data exist. This article summarises the research that has been carried out in Ireland, highlighting key findings and recommendations. With several new initiatives in place such as the Crystal Clear health literacy Awards, it is expected that Ireland will lag behind in this field no longer. Inadequate health literacy is at epidemic levels in Ireland and is fast becoming recognised as a national issue. Simplification of the healthcare system, in its entirety is required but the much needed financial investment will only be made after original research, demonstrating successful interventions has been conducted. With a trend worldwide towards personalized medicine, this theme should be extended to include tailor-made personalized health care information. An investment in health literacy will ultimately increase a patient’s self-esteem, compliance, capacity to self-manage and most importantly patient outcomes and safety.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>From its humble beginnings, appearing in the literature in 1974,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911431034">1</xref></sup> health literacy has become a vibrant area of international research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911431034">2</xref></sup> With continuous research, its definition has been augmented and has increased in scope and complexity. In 1999, the American Medical Association’s Ad Hoc Committee on health literacy defined health literacy as the “constellation of skills, including the ability to perform basic reading and numerical tasks required to function in the health care environment”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911431034">3</xref></sup> Other overlapping definitions have been provided by Healthy People 20104 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911431034">5</xref></sup> defining health literacy as “the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions”. These definitions present health literacy as a function of an individual’s capabilities, allowing the patient to acquire and apply new health information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911431034">2</xref></sup> These capabilities are modifiable i.e. the level of health literacy may be increased by education programmes or decreased by any process that reduces cognitive function e.g. a pathology or simple aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911431034">6</xref></sup> Being health literate enables an individual to make informed decisions, to influence events and to exert greater control over their own lives i.e. health literacy is crucial to personal empowerment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913911431034">7</xref></sup> If a health care provider has the ability to determine a patient’s level of health literacy, they may be able to tailor information and materials provided to maximise patient care and increase the likelihood of favourable clinical outcomes. Studies in health literacy research propose a direct link between individual health literacy and health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913911431034">8</xref></sup> It has been suggested that inadequate literacy may have a direct, negative effect on health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913911431034">9</xref></sup> Patients with limited health literacy may have worse self-management skills,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913911431034">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913911431034">11</xref></sup> lower use of preventative services,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911431034">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913911431034">13</xref></sup> higher hospitalisation rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913911431034">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913911431034">15</xref></sup> worse self-rated health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913911431034">16</xref></sup> and higher rates of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757913911431034">17</xref></sup> In addition, those with literacy problems may also have poorer medication adherence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757913911431034">18</xref></sup> which is a specific challenge associated with chronic illness management. To conclude, the literacy skills of an individual have consistently been shown to be a stronger predictor of health status than age, income, employment status, education level, and racial or ethnic group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757913911431034">19</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section2-1757913911431034">
<title>Screening tools</title>
<p>Several screening tools have been developed which have the ability to predict/ determine health literacy and include the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757913911431034">20</xref></sup> its 66 item modified form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757913911431034">21</xref></sup> and its many variations; the REALM-SF (REALM-Short Form)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757913911431034">22</xref></sup> and the REALM-R (REALM-Revised).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757913911431034">23</xref></sup> The REALM, in particular, has been widely used in health literacy research as it requires only three minutes for administration. It has also recently been validated for use as a screening tool in the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757913911431034">24</xref></sup> This is of particular interest as there are little available data regarding the use of any health literacy screening instruments in Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757913911431034">25</xref></sup> and the recent UK validation may serve as a model for this country.</p>
<p>The Test of Functional health literacy in Adults (TOFHLA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757913911431034">26</xref></sup> was first published in 1995 and is used to measure functional health literacy using health-related materials such as prescription bottle labels and appointment slips to assess both numeracy and reading comprehension. It is designed to assess adult literacy in the health care setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757913911431034">27</xref></sup> It is available in both English and Spanish and in a full-format (a 22-min test, with 50 reading comprehension items in three passages and 17 numeracy items), and a short form (S-TOFHLA; a 12-min test, with 36 reading comprehension items in two passages and four numeracy items).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757913911431034">28</xref></sup> The passages use a modified Cloze procedure where every fifth to seventh word is omitted and subjects select the correct word from among a set of four options.</p>
<p>The Newest Vital Sign (NVS) requires only 3 minutes for administration, but achieves an estimate of functional health literacy by measuring comprehension and numeracy skills in addition to reading ability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757913911431034">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1757913911431034">30</xref></sup> The NVS consists of a nutrition label from an ice-cream container which is presented to the patient and to which they refer to during the test. The patient is then asked six questions in relation to the information on the label and scores range from 0 to 6. Total scores can be classified into limited (0-1), possibility of limited (2-3), and adequate (4-6) literacy. These tools have been widely used in the research setting however in the clinical setting, their use may pose a number of challenges including; time taken to administer and associated staffing requirements, along with potential negative feelings on the part of the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757913911431034">31</xref></sup> The NVS is a relatively new test which measures reading comprehension and numeracy in the same time it takes to administer the REALM instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757913911431034">32</xref></sup> Studies of patient acceptability mentioned above suggest that the NVS could possibly be more acceptable to patients than the REALM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757913911431034">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757913911431034">34</xref></sup> This was also hypothesised by Baker in his 2006 review of health literacy measurement, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757913911431034">35</xref></sup> where he mentions that a nutrition label, a material which is likely to be encountered in daily life, may feel more comfortable and natural than instruments which appear more as academic tests of reading ability. This issue of patient acceptability with respect to the various instruments will be an interesting future area of study.</p>

<title>Literacy and health literacy</title>
<p>In the past, it was believed that there was a direct correlation between being generally literate i.e. the ability to read and write, and being health literate. However it has been demonstrated that even when a person has advanced general literacy, their ability to obtain, understand and apply health information can be inadequate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913911431034">7</xref></sup> While it is now evident that general literacy and health literacy are not synonymous, measurement of general literacy may be used as a surrogate to estimate health literacy. There is a high correlation between the Basic Skills Agency Initial Assessment Test (BSAIT), a general literacy screening tool and the REALM (r = 0.7; P &lt; 0.001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1757913911431034">36</xref></sup> As adequate health literacy requires the ability to comprehend and apply unfamiliar and sometimes complex health terminology and technology, it is accurate to assume that an individual’s health literacy level will be below their general literacy level. The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), carried out from 1994 to 1998, demonstrated that 25 percent of the Irish population, aged between 16 and 66 years have low literacy skills and cannot satisfactorily read medication instructions. An additional 30 percent can only comprehend simple, non-complex information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1757913911431034">37</xref></sup> Given that an estimated 55 percent of the general population has reduced general literacy, it may be assumed that the proportion of individuals with inadequate health literacy is even more significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757913911431034">
<title>Impact of limited health literacy</title>
<p>It is well established that low health literacy can significantly limit a patient’s ability to prevent and manage disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1757913911431034">38</xref></sup> According to research, individuals with limited health literacy are less likely to participate in preventive measures, such as mammograms and immunisation schemes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1757913911431034">39</xref></sup> It has also been demonstrated that limited health literacy is associated with an increased frequency of chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1757913911431034">40</xref></sup> Similarly, these individuals are more likely to take medication incorrectly and become hospitalised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1757913911431034">41</xref></sup> This increased frequency of hospital visits results in increased healthcare costs for the individual and, if applicable, the supporting economy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1757913911431034">42</xref></sup> With patients retaining an average of 12 percent of explanations provided by healthcare providers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1757913911431034">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1757913911431034">44</xref></sup> it is clear there is a significant gap between what a patient understands and what a healthcare professional expects them to know.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1757913911431034">45</xref></sup></p>

<title>Literature search</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757913911431034">Table 1</xref> summarises the findings of a literature review on the main research which has been conducted in Ireland in the field of health literacy. ScienceDirect and PubMed databases were searched using a wide variety of search terms including ‘Ireland health literacy’, ‘Irish health literacy’, ‘health literacy levels Ireland’ and health literacy Irish population’. The results of this search yielded only five studies which were of specific relevance to the Irish context. The most recent study published was a European-wide comparative analysis, collaborating data from 11 countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1757913911431034">46</xref></sup> The sheer magnitude of this research is its major strength i.e. n = 130 000. However it is not without weaknesses. Assumptions were made regarding health literacy levels i.e. screening tools discussed previously were not employed. This research demonstrates a positive correlation between education level and health function, relying on self-reported health status as a key variant. This may arguably be prone to bias. In addition, the number of Irish participants was significantly lower than the other participating countries e.g. 16,559 from Ireland versus 43,355 from Germany. The second study focussed on the readability levels of Patient Information Leaflets (PILs) for older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1757913911431034">47</xref></sup> The strength of this research lies in the fact that limited health literacy has been demonstrated to be more prevalent in the older person and by focussing on PILs aimed at this sub-population; follow-on initiatives based on this research may be highly beneficial. However, when expressing readability levels of PILs, results were stated in American terms i.e. 6th grade, without any conversion to the Irish education system. The third study examined the link between health literacy and the ability to manage a chronic condition i.e. type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1757913911431034">48</xref></sup> This was the only research retrieved that employed one of the validated screening tools for health literacy i.e. REALM. It was demonstrated that non-Irish-national patients had lower health literacy levels than those of the Irish national patients and as a population demonstrated poorer glycaemic control. However this research failed to provide a direct correlation between lower health literacy and poor self-management. In spite of this, it demonstrates the need to address the discrepancies within the healthcare system and the need to provide, simplified multi-lingual educational material to the ever-increasing immigrant population. Fortunately the Health Promotion Unit of the Health Service Executive has begun to embrace Ireland as the multi-ethnic, multi-lingual country it has become and has published information pamphlets on topics such as drug abuse, smoking cessation and alcohol addiction in a variety of languages including Czech, French and Spanish (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.healthpromotion.ie">www.healthpromotion.ie</ext-link>). The fourth study examined the levels of mental health literacy among internet users in Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1757913911431034">49</xref></sup> Involving a large number of participants (n = 998), this research boasts high power but once again makes assumptions regarding levels of health literacy without using any direct assessment. The fifth study examined users of a cancer information service in Northern Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1757913911431034">50</xref></sup> Once again, this study involved a high number of participants (n = 571) but has several shortcomings; there was no direct measurement of health literacy and while the researchers strove to record all inquiries made to the service, it was reported that this was not always possible. Researchers failed to report the percentage of inquiry forms with incomplete information thus the final data presented may not be representative. As health literacy is an interdisciplinary topic, a thorough search of the internet, using Google as a search engine was also carried out. The aim of this search was to find articles, studies or reports which are not available on the databases already examined. A wide variety of search terms were employed, in various combinations to maximise the probability of finding all relevant health literacy work, carried out by many disciplines. Focus was then made on organisations known to have particular interest in health literacy, such as the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA). This search yielded a further four relevant studies, which had not appeared in the database search. The first of these studies was the 2007 Adult Health Literacy Survey, undertaken by Lansdowne Market Research on behalf of Merck Sharp and Dohme Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1757913911431034">51</xref></sup> Data from this research were obtained directly from the organization. The strength of these data lies in the fact that the 1000 participants are considered representative of the Irish population in terms of gender, socioeconomic class, age and national: non-national ratios. The research deals exclusively with the participants’ attitudes towards and experience of navigating the healthcare system. Once again this research makes assumptions regarding health literacy without direct measurement and has not been peer-reviewed. The second study is the health literacy Policy and Strategy Research Report conducted, written and edited by NALA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1757913911431034">52</xref></sup> This report ‘marks the first time literacy has significantly entered the health debate in Ireland’ and aims to act as a platform for policy reform. Assessment of health literacy in the general public and medical professionals was inferred through interview without any direct measurement. The third study is entitled ‘Meeting the Health, Social Care and Welfare Services Information Needs of Older People in Ireland’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1757913911431034">53</xref></sup> Once again health literacy was not directly assessed, nor is this research peer-reviewed but through a series of personal interviews, general literacy barriers in the healthcare system as a whole were revealed. This study also highlights the emotional impact of limited health literacy and how an illness coupled by the complex health system can elicit unnecessary stress and anxiety. The final study is The National Health &amp; Lifestyle Surveys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1757913911431034">54</xref></sup> conducted in 1999. It remains the only national survey which directly addresses the issue of health literacy. Despite involving nearly 6000 participants, it has not been peer-reviewed and a direct measurement of health literacy was not carried out. In addition, data are more than a decade old and may no longer be representative of the current Irish population which includes a greater number of immigrants and older adults, two groups which have been identified as exhibiting low levels of health literacy. Thus in many studies, while conclusions were made regarding health literacy levels in the population groups studied, there was often no indication as to how these levels were determined i.e. the established screening tools were rarely employed. The sample sizes among studies varied from less than 50 participants to almost 17,000 participants. The methodologies used also varied from conducting interviews with participants to the use of online surveys. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the studies identified, they all demonstrated significant levels of health Illiteracy in their samples, particularly certain sub-populations, where health literacy levels are disproportionately lower, i.e. the elderly and the immigrant population.</p>

<title>Health literacy in Ireland: implications for policy and practice</title>
<p>NALA research report of 2002 stated that at the time minimal research in the field of health literacy had been carried out in Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1757913911431034">52</xref></sup> However this situation is changing fast with researchers and practitioners recognising its validity for inclusion in healthcare strategies. In fact a bibliometric analysis found that Ireland is one of the top countries regarding research productivity in this field (after adjustment for GDP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1757913911431034">55</xref></sup> Recent advances include the establishment of a PhD study in health literacy in University College Dublin and the launch of the Crystal Clear MSD health literacy Awards in 2007, which recognise and reward excellence in programmes in this field.</p>
<p>In September 2009, NALA published a report entitled ‘NALA Policy Belief on health literacy in Ireland’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1757913911431034">56</xref></sup> The policy offers several recommendations which have direct implications for health literacy. NALA recommends that health literacy should be considered during all national initiatives by the Department of Health and Children, suggesting that all published materials be tested with focus groups, written in plain English and frequently incorporate images. The government funded Breastcheck programme is an example of a national initiative which has recognised the merits of employing plain English, integrating visual information and ensuring frontline employees are literacy aware, an effort which has been acknowledged in the Crystal Clear health literacy Awards 2010 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.breastcheck.ie">www.breastcheck.ie</ext-link>). The report also reiterated the point that while individuals may not experience literacy difficulties in everyday life, they may encounter obstacles in the healthcare setting due to unfamiliarity or the use of complex terminology, obstacles that ought to be addressed. It suggested that health literacy audits be routinely conducted in the healthcare setting to assess literacy barriers and to implement systems to address them. It also stresses the importance of establishing a training framework for administrative and medical practitioners which would highlight the low health literacy levels in Ireland while also promoting self-assessment. The ignorance of the issue has been highlighted in a recent survey which identified that only 31 percent of Irish general practitioners are aware of the extent of low literacy in the Irish population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1757913911431034">57</xref></sup> While the SLAN survey of 1999 included the concept of health literacy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1757913911431034">54</xref></sup> it has not been integrated into any further work thus this report recommends its inclusion in all national surveys.</p>
<p>In 2008 the HSE published the National Intercultural Health Strategy which recognised the need for an increased use of visual and spoken communication in the healthcare environment. In addition, it promoted the use of clear, understandable English which will allow individuals from minority groups e.g. the travelling community and ethnic groups as well as individuals with reduced literacy to gain full advantage of the healthcare system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1757913911431034">58</xref></sup> In June 2010, a health literacy Report was published detailing the proceedings of the National health literacy Conference entitled ‘Linking Policy with Practice’. At this conference, Ireland’s inclusion in the European Union health literacy Survey (EU-HLS) was confirmed. In contrast to previous research which has concentrated on general literacy, this survey focuses solely on the concept of health literacy. A total of 1000 participants over the age of 15 years from across 8 different countries are included and analysis involves a specially designed questionnaire coupled with personal interviews. Results of the survey are expected to be published by the Maastricht University by September 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1757913911431034">59</xref></sup> and it is hoped that these findings will propel the concept of health literacy to the forefront, stimulating national interest, recognition and much needed funding.</p>
<p>As is evident from the literature search, there are few study data available in the field of health literacy in Ireland. Although research on health literacy is largely conducted in the US, it is important to assess the prevalence of inadequate health literacy in the Irish setting as the results will not be transferable, due to demographic differences between the two countries. The changing profile of the Irish population, specifically the increase in the number of older adults, will pose increased challenges to healthcare professionals as the literature has shown that older patients are more likely to have limited health literacy. Research strategies in the US developed to aid patients with limited health literacy will also need to be investigated in the Irish setting due to inherent differences in healthcare systems. Research in this group has focused on addressing a number of these issues specifically with regard to the prevalence of limited health literacy and targeted approaches to improving prescription drug labels to aid patient comprehension (unpublished). This work is currently submitted and under Peer-review. Future randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are planned to investigate interventions to improve patient knowledge and understanding of healthcare-related materials. Reports have been published, as summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757913911431034">Table 1</xref>, which speculate on the topic but it is clear that more original research in the general population is required, particularly with a focus on providing successful interventions and combatting this modifiable obstacle to health.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude, it is evident that health literacy is a national issue, one which can have drastic consequences yet is readily surmountable. Healthcare professionals must be made aware of the levels of health illiteracy and receive training on how to address the issue, to maximize patient care. Literacy levels of health information needs to be analysed and the ‘one size fits all’ policy that is currently established must be eliminated. With a trend worldwide towards personalised medicine, this theme should be extended to include tailor-made personalized health care information. An investment in health literacy will ultimately increase a patient’s self-esteem, compliance, capacity to self manage and most importantly their safety.</p>
