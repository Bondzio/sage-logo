<abstract>
<p>This article analyses events that trigger the establishment of a works council and the actor or agent who triggers it. The article extends previous research in two dimensions. First, it examines specific events that motivate workers to establish a works council, such as a change of owner, founding a spin-off, a firm acquisition or a radical restructuring. These events express protection against uncertainty as workers’ primary motivation for establishing a works council. Second, the article analyses the actor or agent who triggers the establishment of a works council and shows that management is involved in one-third of all cases and has, in a minority of cases, motivated workers to establish a works council. Managerial involvement in the process of establishment reveals a positive managerial response to worker representation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>German works councils attract a lot of attention as plant-level worker representation because works councils are generally considered to promote industrial democracy, improve working life and benefit economic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11408146">Addison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11408146">Addison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11408146">Frege, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the EU’s 2002 Information and Consultation of Employees Directive requires similar plant-level employee representations in European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11408146">Hall, 2006</xref>). Although a long tradition of research has investigated the determinants and effects of works councils, we do not know much about the reasons and circumstances that trigger the establishment of a works council. This article examines events triggering the establishment of a works council and the actor or agent who triggers it.</p>
<p>Previous studies dealing with the establishment of works councils basically argue that employees establish a works council to limit the opportunistic behaviour of employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>). Because this behaviour is more likely to occur during an economic crisis than during a boom for the firm, works councils are likely to be established when a firm faces a poor profit situation and a decline in employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11408146">Kraft and Lang, 2008</xref>). We extend these previous studies along three additional dimensions.</p>
<p>First, we argue that there must be specific trigger events that motivate workers to establish a works council. The article shows that a change of owner increases the probability of establishing a works council. Also, a partial plant closure and a radical restructuring trigger the establishment of a works council. Thus, the result supports and specifies previous findings that works councils protect workers against employer opportunism; in particular, they overcome information asymmetries, enforce implicit arrangements and enhance workers’ bargaining power.</p>
<p>Second, the panel design of our study also allows the investigation of the establishing intensity of works councils over the overall business cycle (not only a firm’s economic situation). Works councils are more likely to be established during a sector-wide economic downturn than during a boom.</p>
<p>Third, in addition to previous studies, we also show that not only is it workers who take the initiative to establish a works council but that the management is a relevant actor as well. In approximately one-third of all cases, management is involved; and in a minority of cases, it even motivates workers to establish a works council. This finding allows distinctions of the effects of different qualities of intra-firm industrial relations, specifically of managerial response, which is considered the most important factor in collective voice theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11408146">Addison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11408146">Bryson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Medoff, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows: first, we present an overview of institutions, discuss motivations for establishing a works council and derive our main hypotheses. Subsequently, in the third section, we describe our data and variables. Afterwards, in the fourth section, we present our results on trigger agents and trigger events and in the final section continue to conclude and discuss the generalized transfer of our results to other countries.</p>

<title>Institutions, theory and hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section3-0143831X11408146">
<title>Institutional framework</title>
<p>Works councils’ rights are laid down in the Works Constitution Act, stating that councils can be elected by the workers of firms with five or more employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X11408146">1</xref></sup> Because their creation depends on the initiative of a firm’s employees, councils are not present in all eligible firms. Works councils have full co-determination rights (participation or veto rights) on a set of issues, including the introduction of new payment methods, overtime work and the use of technical devices designed to monitor employee performance. They have weaker consultation rights in matters such as changes in equipment and working methods which affect job requirements. Their information rights cover financial and economic matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11408146">Addison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11408146">Hübler and Jirjahn, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Works councils’ coverage increases by firm size from around 6 percent in the smallest eligible establishments to 28 percent in firms with 20–49 employees to 85 percent in firms with 300–500 employees (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11408146">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although formally only workers can establish a works council, a descriptive study by Schlömer et al. already shows that managers also sometimes motivate workers to establish a works council or that management and workers cooperate in its establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11408146">Schlömer et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we also discuss both trigger agents, workforce and management, and their motivation in addition to different trigger events for establishing a works council.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0143831X11408146">
<title>Protection against uncertainty as workers’ motivation</title>
<p>For workers, works councils are an instrument for protecting workers against employer opportunism. In particular, works councils can discipline managers for breaking implicit arrangements about compensation schemes, working conditions, fringe benefits, cooperative culture and leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Lazear, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11408146">Kaufman and Levine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11408146">Smith, 1991</xref>). Such implicit contracts are common in employment relations, which are characterized by information asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11408146">Hogan, 2001</xref>). Although implicit contracts are usually self-enforcing due to reputation mechanisms, employers and employees may cooperate initially, but the employer may be tempted to renege on the promises made to the employees. Employers can behave opportunistically with respect to information, payment, employment and working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11408146">Betrand, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Lazear, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11408146">Ramey and Watson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this framework, each job offered includes an implicit contract about certain working conditions, compensation schemes and a cooperative culture, arrangements that are neither contractible nor enforceable and are, therefore, implicit. An implicit contract is broken when managers announce lay-offs, cancel fringe benefits or increase the workload, to name a few. Consequently, workers demand an institution protecting their interests which are not legally enforceable. Works councils are an instrument for protection against such uncertainties because works councils have legal co-determination rights on personnel issues. These statutory rights reduce the uncertainty of arbitrary management decisions, making works councils an instrument to safeguard workers’ interests. Legal co-determination rights can discipline managers for breaking the implicit contract.</p>
<p>Managers may have reasonable arguments for cancelling an implicit contract; for instance, competition and innovation force a restructuring, or the economic situation no longer allows paying fringe benefits. However, as long as workers cannot evaluate whether the economic situation really requires such concessions by workers or whether managers only want to increase their rent share to the cost of the workers’ (information asymmetry), workers will be inclined to establish a works council because works councils have legal access to information on financial and economic matters and legal bargaining power to enforce the implicit contract. Thus, if the management announces an organizational shock, such as a restructuring, a partial plant closure or founding a spin-off, workers are inclined to establish a works council to protect workers from the aforementioned uncertainties (referred to as protection against uncertainty in the following).</p>
<p>Furthermore, a change in ownership can break the implicit contract. A new owner can introduce a new corporate culture, change compensation and working conditions, but the conditions of the former owner fitted workers’ preferences better, causing workers to resist these changes. The resentment can lead to the wish for legal co-determination that protects workers’ interests. A works council enhances workers’ bargaining power and enforces implicit contracts by penalizing the firm for breaching the implicit contract. Thus, a change in ownership can trigger the establishment of a works council based on protection against uncertainty.</p>
<p>Protection against uncertainty and rent protection as used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn (2009)</xref> are different although not incompatible motivations for establishing a works council. Rent protection is associated with the rent the workforce derives from their insider status. Protection against uncertainty from employer opportunism is a more general concept. For example, a new owner of a plant changes the working conditions. The new working conditions may not alter the overall rent distribution between workers and shareholders. However, the changing working conditions can lead to a utility loss for workers, who have selected themselves in the firm because they preferred the former working conditions. The uncertainty about future work conditions can now lead to a collective call for action.</p>
<p>The crucial point is that such uncertainty because of organizational shocks is likely to cause the establishment of a works council or – to put it differently – to lead to a collective call for action. Because employment conditions are a public good for all workers in the firm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11408146">Olson (1965)</xref> points out that the potential free-riding problem impedes collective action for a public good in large groups or firms. In contrast to his theoretical expectations, we also observe that in firms with more than 300 employees, works councils are newly established. However, social psychologists and behavioural economists have shown that under certain conditions for the provision of public goods, a few altruistic actors can create incentives for a majority of purely selfish individuals to contribute to the public good when all individuals would suffer a utility loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11408146">Charness and Rabin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11408146">Fehr and Gächter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11408146">Fehr and Schmidt, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0143831X11408146">2</xref></sup> Thus, a sufficiently large utility loss can trigger collective action. In our case, we argue that a utility loss caused by a strong deterioration of working conditions is a reasonable trigger event leading workers to act collectively and establish a works council.</p>

<sec id="section5-0143831X11408146">
<title>Solving the commitment problem as managerial motivation</title>
<p>For managers, solving commitment problems is the main advantage of works councils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11408146">FitzRoy and Kraft, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Lazear, 1995</xref>). Even if only workers can legally establish a works council, solving the commitment problem can be a motivation for managers to support the establishment. Commitment problems can arise in a variety of situations. Workers may withhold information about potentially performance-enhancing innovations when they fear that the employer might use the information about innovations to their disadvantage through actions such as the intensification of the workload or job cuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, employees may refuse concessions even when those concessions may be necessary to overcome a crisis of the firm if employees fear that the employer overstates the crisis to demand greater concessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn and Smith, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Works councils can solve commitment problems and create trustful employment relations and cooperation, which enables effective communication and increases the legitimacy of management decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Medoff, 1984</xref>). Therefore, employees are willing to share their ideas for improving the efficiency of production. Furthermore, works councils increase work satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11408146">Cornelissen et al., 2010</xref>), which leads to a reduction in quitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11408146">Pfeifer, 2010</xref>). Lower turnover suggests lower hiring and training costs and less disruption in the functioning of work groups. The likelihood that workers and firms remain together over a longer period increases the incentive for investments in skills specific to the enterprise, which also raises productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Medoff, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>However, employee involvement gives workers a stronger bargaining position to renegotiate a firm’s rents. Rent redistribution is the main reason why managers oppose the establishment of a works council, particularly when the expected increase of the rent share for the workforce offsets the expected increase in total rent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Lazear, 1995</xref>). Although works councils have no legal right to strike, they can still increase workers’ bargaining power using their veto rights or delaying decisions where participation and consultation rights prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11408146">Nienhueser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11408146">Visser, 1995</xref>). Moreover, management needs additional time for preparing consultations and persuading works councillors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11408146">Hall et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>When managers expect that productivity enhancement, due to solving commitment problems, outweigh expected losses, due to rent redistribution and the loss of control in decision-making, they have a strong self-interest in supporting or motivating workers in the establishment of a works council.</p>

<title>Data and variables</title>
<sec id="section7-0143831X11408146">
<title>Data sets</title>
<p>We use two data sources to analyse events that trigger the establishment of a works council and the agent who triggers it. The IfM Bonn Works Council Survey allows in-depth descriptions of the establishing process regarding the trigger event and the agent but does not include questions about these events for firms that did not establish a works council, and it does not include a time dimension. We thus turn to the IAB Establishment Panel in another step and estimate the influence of an organizational shock on the probability of establishing a works council.</p>
<p>The IfM Bonn Works Council Survey is a unique cross-section data set about co-determination in small- and medium-sized companies in Germany. The unique feature of this survey is a set of questions about the establishment of a works council. All firms covered by a works council report the trigger event, trigger agent and year of establishment. The data set is representative of firms with 20–500 employees and was collected by the Small and Medium Size Enterprise Research Institute in 2005 (Institut für Mittelstandsforschung – IfM; for a detailed data description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11408146">Schlömer et al., 2007</xref>). Because the survey was collected in 2005, several years after most works councils were established, we drop all firms where the manager reports that he or she cannot remember or was not in charge at the time of establishment. Furthermore, we restrict the sample to firms that established their works councils between 2001 and 2005. We draw this sub-sample because these firms also report the number of employees at the time of establishment, which is necessary for subsequent regression analyses. This restriction yields a sample of 60 firms that established a works council between 2001 and 2005.</p>
<p>The IAB Establishment Panel is a representative survey based on a stratified random sample from the population of all German establishments. We use the waves 1999–2007 of this panel in which information about works council status, organizational shocks and other firm characteristics for each firm are available (for a data description, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11408146">Jacobebbinghaus, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0143831X11408146">3</xref></sup> We match growth data downloaded from the Federal Statistical Office. We drop non-profit and agriculture firms as well as all firms with more than one change in their works council status and all firms that abolished their works council, i.e. that switched from having to not having a works council. Furthermore, we drop all firms with fewer than five employees because of the legal threshold for establishing a works council.</p>
<p>We use the IfM Bonn Works Council Survey for detailed descriptive analyses and the IAB Establishment Panel for our main regressions so that we derive our variables for the latter data set.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0143831X11408146">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>Using the IAB Establishment Panel, we identify all firms that did not have a works council in the previous year but report to be covered by a works council in the following year as newly established works councils. This definition excludes firms which abolished a newly established works council. The probability of establishing a works council for a random uncovered firm is around 1 percent. Even if the establishment of a works council is a rare event, we identify 273 newly established works councils. The control group contains all firms that have not established a works council between two observation periods. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0143831X11408146">Table A1</xref> in the Appendix shows the descriptive statistics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0143831X11408146">
<title>Explanatory variables</title>
<p>Several variables capture the trigger events described earlier. First, we define a set of dummy variables for organizational shocks that directly influence the security of workplaces, such as a partial plant closure, an outsourcing or a spin-off of a part of the firm. These relatively rare events increase workers’ uncertainty about workplace security as a part of the implicit contract and, therefore, should present a strong incentive for workers to establish a works council. Second, a radical reorganization may increase workers’ uncertainty and break the implicit contract between workers and management when it entails job cuts and worsens working conditions.</p>
<p>Third, a change in ownership can threaten the implicit contract when new owners change working conditions but workers stay at the firm because working conditions under the old owner better fit their preferences. Moreover, new owners may cut fringe benefits so that workers suspect losing the rents they have created with their effort to the new owner. We define an owner change when a firm was a single-site firm in the previous year and is a branch of a larger company in the next year.</p>
<p>In addition to these trigger events, we check the determinants of establishing a works council that are used in previous studies. A bad economic perspective lowers profits and can force managers to announce wage cuts and to urge workers to increase their effort, all of which threaten the implicit contract as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn (2009)</xref>. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11408146">Kraft and Lang (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn (2009)</xref>, we use plant-level employment growth as an indicator for a bad economic situation, defined as the percentage increase or decrease in the previous year’s employees. In addition, we distinguish between plant-level and sector-level economic downturn. Because sector-wide downturns are frequently reported in media, workers may react differently when only the plant or the entire sector faces a downturn. We measure the sector-wide economic situation with the deviation from the mean growth for each sector and year. This variable additionally enables the measurement of the establishment of works councils over the business cycle. A negative deviation from the sectoral mean growth in a particular year should be correlated with a higher probability of establishing a works council. Note that the deviation from sectoral mean growth is independent of plant-level trigger events, which can occur in good as well as in bad times. This is one of the innovations in our study compared to previous studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0143831X11408146">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>In addition to our variables of key interest, we control for other variables that determine the establishment of a works council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11408146">Addison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11408146">Kraft and Lang, 2008</xref>). Firm size may have a positive influence on the establishment of a works council. The number of employees indicates a more complex and hierarchical organization, where councils mitigate transaction costs. Moreover, the legal rights of works councils are stronger in larger firms, and the stronger rights might increase workers’ incentives for establishing a works council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, we include several variables for the composition of the workforce and take into account that different types of workers may differ in their taste for representation. Skilled workers may be more likely to establish a works council than unskilled workers because their firm-specific human-capital investments are threatened by job loss. In contrast, works councils face difficulties in effectively representing part-time employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11408146">Pfeifer, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, variables that influence the coverage of works councils can also influence the establishment; for example, East German firms tend to have a lower probability of coverage, and older firms have a higher probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11408146">Zwick, 2004</xref>). Moreover, we include a dummy for payment above the collective agreement and the presence of a collective bargaining agreement. Collective bargaining coverage discourages workers from adopting a council because it limits the scope for plant-level bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11408146">Hübler and Jirjahn, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, firms switching to collective bargaining might discourage workers from establishing a works council. Furthermore, export-oriented firms, a common proxy for international competitiveness, and firms with higher investments per capita, a common proxy for capital stock, usually make higher investments in human capital, which in turn make earning losses larger when leaving the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11408146">Zwick, 2004</xref>). Moreover, the legal form and the ownership status of a firm may have an influence on the probability that the management breaks the implicit contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>The IfM Bonn Works Council Survey</title>
<p>The IfM Bonn Works Council Survey directly asks managers about specific events and about the actor or agent that triggered the establishment of their works council from their perspective. The definition of some trigger events slightly differs between both data sets. First, a change of owner is more widely defined in the IfM data set than in the IAB Establishment Panel and comprises every change of ownership. Second, the definition of a reorganization only identifies a radical restructuring, so it should be reported by a smaller proportion of firms. Moreover, the IfM Works Council Survey contains additional trigger events such as new workers from plants with a works council motivate their co-workers to establish a works council, that workers require co-determination and mangers want a fixed employee representative (see Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0143831X11408146">Table A3</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if we mainly use the IfM Bonn Works Council Survey for descriptive evidence, we check our results and regress the trigger agent on a set of covariates which are similar to those described above. Moreover, we control for managers’ attitudes towards the works council at the time of establishment. This variable is a proxy for intra-establishment industrial relations that are an important predictor for firm performance and quit rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11408146">Dilger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Using the IfM Bonn Works Council Survey, we present descriptive evidence about specific trigger events bringing about the establishment of a works council. We then present the agents who triggered the establishment and examine correlations between the two. Afterwards, we turn to the IAB Establishment Panel and analyse the role of these trigger events on the probability of establishing a works council comparing firms that have established a works council with firms that have not.</p>
<sec id="section13-0143831X11408146">
<title>Trigger events</title>
<p>The IfM Bonn Works Council Survey indicates that organizational shocks are a relevant trigger in 43 percent of the firms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11408146">Table 1</xref>). The most important organizational shock is a change of owner (32 percent). Workers thus seem to consider a new owner as a menace to the implicit contract. Workers, for instance, suspect that new owners cut fringe benefits, change working conditions and prefer a new management style, whereby the style and conditions of the former owner fitted workers’ preferences.</p>

<p>The classification in the three groups: managerial communication, workers’ voice and organizational shock, is based on logical connection, if the management was named in the question or if an organizational shock was asked about. This classification cannot be obtained by a factor analysis because most respondents tick only one possible answer and therefore a factor analysis can only be based on a minor sub-sample. Sample restriction: 60 firms that have established a works council between 2001 and 2005, answers were given by the managers and multiple answers were possible.</p></fn>

</table-wrap>
<p>Moreover, workers require protection against uncertainty when an organizational shock affects the security of workplaces, such as when mangers announce a radical reorganization or a partial plant closure. Workers, thus, have an even stronger incentive for establishing a works council. These events naturally happen seldom but are frequently identified as trigger events. A partial plant closure triggers the establishment of a works council in 3 percent and a radical restructuring in 15 percent of all cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0143831X11408146">4</xref></sup> Workers are keen to protect their interests, in particular; they enforce an implicit contract and reduce information asymmetries when an organizational shock occurs or the owner changes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the second category, ‘workers’ voice’ (58 percent), cannot be assigned unambiguously to protection against uncertainty. For example, the sub-category ‘conflicts between management and workers’ (10 percent) can either result from protection against uncertainty spurred by something like management’s plan for cancelling fringe benefits or from the workers’ strategy for enhancing workers’ rent share. A similar argument holds true for the sub-categories ‘workers want more co-determination’ (18 percent) and ‘the management knows no reason why workers have established a works council’ (27 percent). In contrast, the last sub-category, ‘new workers with works council experience’, can be interpreted that newly hired employees who previously worked at a firm covered by a works council convinced their co-workers to establish a works council (13 percent). This category describes a network effect, where the idea of co-determination spreads to other firms in a certain region and industry. This idea is frequently used as an instrument for works councils in studies of economic effects of works councils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143831X11408146">Müller, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The third category, ‘managerial communication’ (22 percent), refers to answers in which the management is explicitly named as involved in the establishing process. The first sub-category, ‘management demand a fixed representative’ (13 percent), suggests that managers demand the council’s mediation role. The council’s mediation role avoids transaction costs and solves commitment problems. These reasons may also play a role in the second and third sub-categories, ‘managers want to improve productivity and motivation’ (13 and 5 percent, respectively). These sub-categories additionally refer to the argument that works councils enhance the size of the enterprise pie.</p>
<p>In addition, the questionnaire allows multiple answers, and one-third of the respondents marked off more than one trigger event. For example, 14 of the 35 respondents to ‘workers’ voice’ also identify the organizational shock of a ‘new owner’ as a specific trigger event. In these cases, an ownership change also leads to conflicts between management and workers, or the new owner does not know why the workers establish a works council after the owner changes. Such multiple answers support the idea that protection against uncertainty spurred by enforcing the implicit contract is a prevalent trigger. Otherwise, the productivity enhancement argument of works councils seems to be a relevant trigger in a minority of cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0143831X11408146">
<title>Trigger agents</title>
<p>The IfM data set additionally allows identifying trigger agents which provide a more comprehensive insight into the establishing process. Even though only workers can formally establish a works council, managers can support the establishment of a works council. Management support reveals a positive attitude of those mangers towards employee representation. As a result, these works councils should have more positive effects, such as increasing firm performance and reducing turnover, because managerial response to workers’ voice is generally considered a key factor for beneficial employee representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11408146">Bryson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11408146">Freeman and Medoff, 1984</xref>). Managers are involved in the establishment of works councils in about one-third of cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11408146">Table 2</xref>). In these firms, managers actively want to moderate an intra-firm industrial relations change once workers show interest in plant-level co-determination. Furthermore, management itself encourages workers to establish a works council in approximately 7 percent of all cases. Management motivations for establishing worker representation are described in a case study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11408146">Schlömer et al. (2007)</xref>. For example, they cite a manager who knows the positive effects of a works council, particularly the mediation role of works councillors, from his previous job. To take advantage of worker representatives, he motivates the workforce to establish a works council in his new firm. Nevertheless, workers alone trigger the establishment in the majority of all cases. Our results show that both workforce alone and workforce in conjunction with management are prevalent initiators of council establishment.</p>

<p>We can also calculate descriptive statistics on the trigger events and agents for the entire sample, but the retrospective nature of the questions may cause recall problems for respondents and bias the results. For instance, we can show that the number of firms where managers were involved in the establishment process or have motivated workers to establish the works council significantly increases if the time span between the establishment of the works council and the survey increases. This finding may be a tribute to good employment relations in those firms where managers cannot imagine that they would oppose employee representation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0143831X11408146">5</xref></sup></p>

An organizational shock increases this probability by 48 percent when we control for managerial attitude towards employee participation at the time of establishment (column 3). Moreover, a positive managerial attitude decreases the probability that the workforce alone calls for election; that is, an increasing probability of managers being involved in the establishment process. However, managerial attitude is highly endogenous and should be interpreted with caution. All other variables are insignificant when we control for the managerial attitude towards employee representation at the time of establishment.</p>

The standard errors are clustered at the firm level. The occurrence of an organizational shock has a significant positive effect on the probability of establishing a works council. The marginal effect is 0.35 percentage points on all uncovered firms. This effect has to be compared with the probability of establishing a works council of 1.07 percentage points, which yields a relative influence of one-third. Moreover, an ownership change increases the probability of establishing a works council by 0.8 percentage points, although we can only indirectly measure a change of the owner in the IAB Establishment Panel.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we divide the organizational shock into five categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0143831X11408146">Table 6</xref>). Three shocks, a spin-off of a part of the firm, an acquisition of another firm and a reorganization have a positive impact on the probability of establishing a works council. Founding a spin-off increases the probability of establishing a works council by 0.18 percentage points. Workers in those plants may fear deteriorating working conditions or job cuts when jobs are transferred to a spin-off. Contrarily, acquisition of another plant increases the probability of establishing a works council by 0.6 percentage points. In these cases, the insourced plant may already have a works council which has spread to the buying plant. Furthermore, a restructuring increases the probability of establishing a works council by 0.3 percentage points. On the contrary, a partial plant closure and an outsourcing of a part of the firm have no significant effect. Altogether, the results support the hypothesis that protection against uncertainty is a prevalent motivation for employees to establish a works council and that a new owner, firm acquisition, spin-off and a restructuring trigger the establishment of a works council.</p>
<p>Furthermore, breaking the implicit contract cannot only result from specific organizational shock events; additionally, a bad economic situation of the firm or industry may force managers either to cut fringe benefits or to demand higher effort levels from workers. We capture this source of breaking the implicit contract on the plant-level and on the sector-level. First, unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn (2009)</xref>, we find that plant-level employment changes have no effect after controlling for organizational shocks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0143831X11408146">8</xref></sup> Second, we find that the economic situation in the industry does have a significant effect. The deviation from the average sectoral growth preceding the council’s establishment has a significant negative impact on the probability of establishing a works council. This measure takes into account a different economic growth between industries, whereby the average sectoral growth is the reference point. A negative deviation means that the sectoral growth rate is lower than the average of the sector during the last years and, vice versa, a positive deviation represents a higher rate. A growth 1 percent below the average of the previous year increases the probability of establishing a works council by about 0.1 percentage points.</p>
<p>The control variables have the expected signs. The firm size has a positive concave shape. An increasing number of employees indicates a more complex and hierarchical organization in which a higher need of communication increases the benefits of having a works council’s, such as the mitigation of transaction costs. The finding shows that the increasing coverage of works councils by firm size stems not only from the fact that firms with a works council grow, but also that large uncovered firms are more likely to establish a works council than small uncovered firms. This relation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11408146">Figure 2</xref>. The probability of establishing a works council increases from less than a half of a percent in the smallest eligible firms to around 6 percent in firms of around 500 employees. Therefore, larger firms have a higher probability of having a works council, and the remaining uncovered firms have a higher probability of establishing a works council.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, the proportion of part-time workers has a negative impact on the probability of establishing a works council, which confirms recent findings that councils face difficulties in effectively representing part-time employees. Moreover, firms covered by a collective agreement are more likely to establish a works council than firms without a collective agreement. Furthermore, limited firms have a positive influence on the probability of establishing a works council, and single-site firms have a negative influence. Single-site firms may better reflect workers’ interests than multi-site firms because mangers of multi-site firms have to consider different plants. Moreover, East German firms have a lower probability of establishing a works council which coincides with a lower incidence of works councils in East Germany than in West Germany. This finding does not support a convergence of industrial relations in the two parts of Germany. Furthermore, the export share of total sales and the level of investment have no influence.</p>
<p>We run a series of robustness checks for the estimations of the trigger events using the IAB Establishment Panel. First, we test the influence of all key explanatory variables alone. Second, we repeat the estimation for West Germany only. Both tests confirm our findings. Third, we exclude the reorganization dummy because this variable has the highest weight in the organization shock and, more importantly, was not regularly asked in the IAB Establishment Panel. Even if reorganizations are not asked about regularly, the construction of this question allows interpolation to previous years. Nevertheless, this measure may not be as precise as the others. Therefore, we run all regressions without the reorganization dummy and obtain qualitatively and quantitatively similar results.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>This article presents evidence for trigger events and trigger agents of establishing a works council. We show that a change of the owner and organizational shocks, such as firm acquisition, the creation of a spin-off, or a restructuring of the firm, lead to a higher probability of establishing a works council. These trigger events support the argument that workers demand works councils as an instrument of protection against uncertainty of deteriorating working conditions and to safeguard workplaces. Moreover, these trigger events extend recent findings that financial distress and declining employment causes the establishment of a works council because organizational shocks can occur in good and bad times. However, sector-wide economic downturn still has an effect on the probability of establishing a works council.</p>
<p>Moreover, we show that while the workforce alone is the most frequent trigger agent in about two-thirds of all cases, management is involved in the other third and has motivated workers to establish a works council in a minority of cases. When managers are involved in the process of establishing a works council, intra-firm industrial relations may exhibit less conflict during and after the establishment of a works council.</p>
<p>Our findings are also relevant for other countries of the European Economic Area (EEA), which follow the adoption of the EU’s 2002 Information and Consultation of Employees Directive (ICE), and are now all required to have provisions for the establishment of representative structures for employee information and consultation within national undertakings, i.e. at workplace and/or firm level. The rights specified in the Directive differ from the German Works Constitution Act, which provides more robust rights on the timing and quality of information provision, a more rigorous definition of consultation and, in addition, co-determination rights on a range of issues which in effect provide works councils with veto rights on personnel matters. These differences are likely to dilute the extent of the protection against uncertainty provided by national legislation introduced under the Directive as compared to Germany, and, hence, the incentive for workforces to seek the establishment of works council-type arrangements. Moreover, the Directive also provides considerable leeway for individual member states in their framing and implementing of national legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11408146">Carley and Hall, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>How far the findings of the present study are relevant to other EEA countries can be considered along two dimensions. The first is the robustness of information and consultation rights, with stronger rights inducing stronger incentives to establish works councils. Under Austrian and Dutch legislation, for example, these are equivalent to those specified in Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0143831X11408146">9</xref></sup> The same broadly applies to the rights of local trade organizations within firms under the basic agreements which govern industrial relations in the Nordic countries. In France and Spain, however, statutory consultation rights are weaker than in Germany – hence the protection against uncertainty incentive for workers is reduced. In the UK and Ireland, where universal rights to employee information and consultation were unknown until the coming into force of national legislation implementing the EU Directive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11408146">Hall, 2006</xref>), the recent legislation’s information rights are less precisely specified than in continental Western and Nordic Europe, and consultation rights are weaker. Moreover, framing of the UK regulations leaves open the opportunity for management and workforce representatives to negotiate ‘private’ arrangements outside the formal procedures of the UK legislation. These so-called ‘pre-existing’ agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11408146">Hall, 2006</xref>) do not necessarily have to meet the information and consultation standards specified in the UK legislation. Nonetheless, even in the UK and Ireland, the weaker consultation rights do not necessarily impinge on the potential for obtaining credible information about the economic situation, which are necessary to overcome the information asymmetries after an organizational shock. Therefore, a works council basing itself on the ICE Directive can also be an instrument for protection against uncertainty, for example, when the management cancel implicit contracts about fringe benefits or working conditions. Indeed, weaker co-determination rights may result in a weaker incentive for workforces to trigger the establishment of a works council. In other countries, management might be a relatively more prominent trigger agent in establishing a works council (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11408146">Hall et al., 2007</xref> for the UK). Management incentives for promoting the establishment of works council-type arrangements are likely to be less impacted by these differences. Hence, in countries such as the UK and Ireland, management appears to be a relatively more prominent trigger agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143831X11408146">Hall et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The second dimension is the extent to which rights to information and consultation, and the corresponding works council-type structures, rights and requirements, are well known, with more well-known rights, amplifying the aforementioned incentive effects. In countries such as Germany, where the current legal framework has essentially been in place for more than half a century, an equilibrium situation prevails. In contrast, where information and consultation rights have only recently been introduced, as in the UK, and a situation of transition prevails, both management and workforces have greater uncertainty about the potential costs and benefits involved. Equilibrium means here especially that, on the one hand, workers and managers are aware of works councils’ statutory rights and regulations. These rights are taught in Germany, for example, during the apprenticeship where two-thirds of a birth cohort are trained. On the other hand, unions see works councils as a complementary industrial relations institution in Germany, and this mutual recognition has evolved over a long period accompanied by an intense conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11408146">Müller-Jentsch, 1995</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of works councils in a historically developed country-specific system of industrial relations is hard to predict, and, therefore, country-specific institutions do not allow a direct application of our results.</p>

<ack>
<p>We thank Thomas Zwick, Bernd Fitzenberger, Alexander Rathke, Steffen Müller and Stefan Szymanski for useful comments, the IfM Bonn (and here especially Nadine Schlömer and Rosemarie Klay) and the Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the Federal Employment Agency at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) for data access. Data access for the IAB data was via guest research spells at FDZ and afterwards via controlled data remote access.</p>

<label>1.</label>
<p>Works councils are establishment-level employee representation bodies. We use the term firm instead of establishment to avoid misunderstandings to the term establishment of a works council.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0143831X11408146">
<label>2.</label>
<p>See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11408146">Axelrod and Hamilton (1981)</xref> for the evolution of cooperation based on an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma game.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0143831X11408146">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Again, we use the term firm instead of establishment to avoid misunderstandings but the analysis is based on the establishment-level.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0143831X11408146">
<label>4.</label>
<p>The percentage of each category does not equal the sum of the sub-categories because multiple answers were possible and some respondents identified two sub-categories as trigger events.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0143831X11408146">
<label>5.</label>
<p>Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143831X11408146">Schlömer et al. (2007)</xref> cite managers who state, ‘if works councils do not exist, they have to be invented’.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0143831X11408146">
<label>6.</label>
<p>The definition of all control variables are shown in Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0143831X11408146">Table A2</xref>. All variables are collected in 2005. However, managerial attitude towards employee representation and the establishment size at the time of establishment are specifically asked. All other variables used are assumed to be constant over time.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0143831X11408146">
<label>7.</label>
<p>Because the IfM Works Council Survey asks managers, the results should be cautiously interpreted; particularly, management’s role in the establishing process may be biased.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0143831X11408146">
<label>8.</label>
<p>In comparison to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11408146">Jirjahn (2009)</xref>, we use a more specific set of trigger events. Jirjahn’s Hanover Firm Panel permits other trigger events such as an expansive market strategy. Moreover, the IAB Establishment Panel covers the entire German economy and the Hanover Firm Panel only manufacturing firms in one region.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0143831X11408146">
<label>9.</label>
<p>This point only applies to smaller firms in the Netherlands because the Dutch legislation specifies that management is obliged to establish a works council in establishments with more than 50 employees. A trigger mechanism whereby the workforce can request the establishment of a works council exists for workplaces with 10–49 employees.</p></fn>
