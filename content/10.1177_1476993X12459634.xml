<p>Jewish coins of the Second Temple Period and the two Jewish Wars are of great interest to scholars who study Near Eastern archaeology, Jewish history and early Christianity. Studies about these coins were published as early as the seventeenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1476993X12459634">Wasserus 1605</xref>), but the nineteenth century saw publication of several important works by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X12459634">Cavedoni (1850)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X12459634">De Saulcy (1854)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1476993X12459634">Madden (1864</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1476993X12459634">1881</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1476993X12459634">Levy (1862)</xref> among others. In the early twentieth century <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476993X12459634">Hill (1914)</xref> catalogued and discussed the British Museum collection, and his work served as the principal reference for many years, and remains vitally important. Later works providing an overview in English include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1476993X12459634">Reifenberg (1947)</xref>, Meshorer’s various books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1476993X12459634">1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1476993X12459634">1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1476993X12459634">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">2001</xref>) and volumes by this author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476993X12459634">Hendin 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X12459634">1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X12459634">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476993X12459634">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">2010a</xref>). These reference or guidebooks on ancient Jewish coins usually include listing and attribution of known coins, inscriptions, descriptions, drawings or photographs, and varying historic and numismatic background and narrative.</p>
<p>Numismatics of ancient Israel has experienced a golden age since the 1960s and an increasing number of relevant articles have appeared in numismatic journals such as <italic>Israel Numismatic Journal, American Journal of Numismatics</italic>, and, for the last six years, <italic>Israel Numismatic Research</italic>, as well as journals of archaeology and other disciplines.</p>
<p>Books, articles, presentations and dissertations have added significantly to the literature, and it may be difficult for a non-specialist to keep up with the latest views and opinions. This article is intended to briefly review notable research on money of the Holy Land from the time before coinage through the Bar Kokhba revolt, which ended in 135 <sc>ce</sc>.</p>

<title>The Time Before Coins</title>
<p>Ancient systems of weights and measures in Mesopotamia and Egypt were used as early as 3500–3000 <sc>bce</sc>, around the time of the Urban Revolution. Highly developed systems of weights and measures existed in Syria from the later part of the Early Bronze Age (3100–2900 <sc>bce</sc>), during the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 <sc>bce</sc>) at Alalakh in southern Turkey, with the Hittites in Anatolia, and in the ancient Holy Land. Archaeological evidence for various systems of weights and measures has been found in excavations throughout the Near East and data are reviewed in <italic>Ancient Scale Weights and Pre-Coinage Currency</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The ancient economic system did not grow simply or universally. Powell notes that ‘The ancients themselves encountered great obstacles when they tried to define units of measure in the absence of standardized systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1476993X12459634">1992</xref>: 899).</p>
<p>In the ancient Holy Land, a crossroad of multiple cultures, there were no fewer than three mathematical weighing systems in use simultaneously: the system of dividing down by 10 or 20, which was the Egyptian (10) or Canaanite (20) method; the Babylonian system, in which 6 was the main number; and the upward multiplication of 2 (binary system), which originated in the Greek and Aegean worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1476993X12459634">Qedar 2001</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>An early Near Eastern weight unit, the <italic>talent</italic>, probably reflected the average ‘load’ a man could carry. This is illustrated by ancient words such as <italic>biltu</italic> in Akkadian, <italic>gun</italic> in Sumerian, and <italic>kikar</italic> (meaning ‘round thing’) in Hebrew (Ezek. 8.26). The word <italic>talent</italic> (Exod. 38.25-26) comes from the Latin derivation of the Greek <italic>talanton</italic> (a weight or something weighed). By the Late Bronze Age the <italic>talent</italic> had become a basic trade weight, illustrated by a number of early copper ingots ranging in weight from about 28 to 30 kg that have been discovered. In some places and some periods the <italic>mina</italic> was a fraction of the talent, usually ranging from 40 to 60 <italic>mina</italic> per <italic>talent</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2007</xref>: 39-41).</p>
<p>Simultaneously, in many ancient cultures, the ox or bull served as a general measure of value. The ox is a standard unit throughout Homer’s writings; for example, the armor of Diomedes was worth nine oxen while the golden armor of Glaucus was worth 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1476993X12459634">Svoronos 1909</xref>: 35). Thus it isn’t surprising that some early copper ingots in the <italic>talent</italic> range of weight may have been made to resemble stretched, dried ox hides—rectangular masses with two or four projections reminiscent of limbs. Such ‘oxhide’ ingots have been found in many areas of the ancient world, and several hundred of them were found in the fourteenth to thirteenth century <sc>bce</sc> Cape Gelidonya and Uluburun shipwrecks found off the southern coast of Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1476993X12459634">Pulak 2000</xref>: 247).</p>
<p>The <italic>talent</italic> ingots were just the right weight to be lifted and carried by a man, as shown in some Egyptian reliefs and paintings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X12459634">Bass 1967</xref>: 63). Thus, for convenience, smaller bronze ingots were required. Some were in the shape of wedges, and others were shaped as rings or bracelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X12459634">Biran and Gophna 1970</xref>: 151-69).</p>
<p>The names of many pre-coinage weights, including <italic>stater, shekel, drachma, gerah</italic> and <italic>obol</italic> evolved directly into the names of coin denominations in the Greek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1476993X12459634">Sear 1978</xref>: xxviii-xxxiii), Roman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1476993X12459634">Sear 2000</xref>: 17-26) and Judaean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 42-50) systems.</p>
<p>Coins were introduced in the ancient Holy Land late in the fifth century <sc>bce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476993X12459634">Gitler and Tal 2006</xref>: 25-26). But their use did not become universal for hundreds of years. Ariel points out that small transactions in the provinces even as late as Roman times were probably mostly undertaken by barter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12459634">2006</xref>: 58). Even though a great deal of trade was carried out by direct barter and taxes were often paid in kind, there were still units of value set in silver, and a number of scholars have gathered material on this subject.</p>
<p>In general, the prices of products were set in relation to a metal, and rulers set firm prices. Under Hittite law, for example, the price of a plough ox was set at 12 <italic>shekels</italic> of silver, a cow was five <italic>shekels</italic>, and a calf was only three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476993X12459634">Hoffner 1997</xref>: 142). ‘The exact nature of such prices is not always clear: Was it a maximum price, since the laws involved fines? Or an “average” price? Economic documents warn us that such set-prices were not always kept’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1476993X12459634">Kletter 2001</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>We see a number of instances where metals, or their equivalent in commodities, were used, such as in ancient Egypt, where ostraca from Deir el Medina tell us that a worker’s monthly wage was 5½ sacks of cereal or 11 <italic>debens</italic> of copper. A goat was worth one to three <italic>debens</italic>, a donkey was worth 25 to 30 <italic>debens</italic> and a pair of sandals was worth ½ to three <italic>debens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1476993X12459634">Lassen 2000</xref>: 234).</p>
<p>There are few texts that actually quote the prices paid for specific goods during the second millennium <sc>bce</sc>. Stieglitz reports that ‘Of the many hundreds of economic texts from Ugarit, written in both Akkadian and Ugaritic, this group numbers less than four dozen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1476993X12459634">Stieglitz 1979</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Stieglitz lists financial transactions gathered from these texts. A Tyrian robe with purple-dyed wool, for example, was priced at two <italic>shekels</italic> of silver and a scarlet garment cost 18 <italic>shekels</italic> (1979: 17). Such garments were highly prized at Ugarit, as they were in Israel some three centuries later (see 1 Sam. 1.24).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X12459634">Dandamayev (1988</xref>: 53-58) expanded Babylonian references on wages to and prices for the sixth to fifth centuries <sc>bce</sc>, and noted that during the Chaldean dynasty, an adult slave cost an average of 50 to 60 <italic>shekels</italic> per year. Under the Achaemenids, the price for slaves gradually rose to about one and a half times their previous levels.</p>
<p>Pulak has observed, ‘In antiquity, as in recent times, market forces as well as political circumstances could have caused, over time, fluctuations in the value of certain mass standards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1476993X12459634">Pulak 1996</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Eventually trading metals ceased to be a commodity transaction and, via circulating coins, became a purchase; also at this time coins began to be counted, instead of weighed, and the concept of fiduciary coinage began. Fiduciary coinage, now a universal concept, carries a premium value above the weight of the coin’s intrinsic value (for example, a current US one-dollar coin has little intrinsic value beyond the user’s acceptance of the government’s guarantee). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1476993X12459634">Seaford (2004</xref>: 145) notes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The result is the paradox that even coinage of unadulterated silver (let alone bronze) may tend to become in effect fiduciary coinage: although the silver contributes to confidence, it is not envisaged as a commodity. And so whereas we frequently hear of metal artefacts being melted down to make coins, we do not hear of Greek coins being smelted down by Greeks to create bullion or artefacts.</p>

<title>Diaspora and Return</title>
<p>After the exile, Jews returned to the province Yehud and, not surprisingly, over the years they had developed differences to their brethren, one of which was language.</p>
<p>The written history of the Persian Period (c. 538–334 <sc>bce</sc>) begins with the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, and ends at around the time Alexander the Great conquered the land in 334 <sc>bce.</sc> This territory included the southern part of the huge Fifth Satrapy of Persia called <italic>Eber Nahara</italic>, the ‘land beyond the river’ and included Syria, Phoenicia, Palestine and Cyprus. Economic changes were significant in the life of this region whose basic financial system evolved from the exclusive use of weighed metal, mostly silver, to the use of foreign coins or fragments of them, and eventually to a local coinage. These cut silver pieces are often referred to as hacksilber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X12459634">Balmuth 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Conflicts between the Jews and Samarians are illustrated in Ezra, where it is specifically noted that the Jews rebuffed offers of help to rebuild the Jewish Temple, which resulted in open animosity (Ezek. 4.4-5).</p>
<p>Barag describes a conflict led by Tennes, king of Sidon, during which the 60 years before Alexander the Great conquered the East ‘were marked by considerable unrest in the southwestern parts of the Persian Empire…and Phoenicia and Palestine had not recovered by the time of Alexander’s invasion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X12459634">Barag 1966</xref>: 6-12).</p>
<p>We read about a current coin denomination:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand <italic>darics</italic>, and of silver ten thousand <italic>talents</italic>, and of brass eighteen thousand <italic>talents</italic>, and of iron a hundred thousand <italic>talents</italic> (1 Chron. 29.7).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are other references to the <italic>daric</italic> in both Ezra 2.69, 8.27 and Neh. 7.70-72. Since these gold coins circulated during the fifth century <sc>bce</sc> throughout the Persian Empire, one might think that many were carried back to the ancient Holy Land by the returning Jews, with whom they must have been current. However, until today only two gold double <italic>darics</italic> and one <italic>daric</italic> have been found in controlled archaeological excavations in Judaea, Philistia, Samaria and Galilee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476993X12459634">Gitler and Tal 2006</xref>: 11 regarding double <italic>darics</italic>; single <italic>daric</italic>, personal communication with Y. Meshorer).</p>
<p>No silver <italic>sigloi</italic> (singular <italic>siglos</italic>, a 5.5 gram silver coin struck contemporaneously to the <italic>darics</italic>) have been found in archaeological excavations in the Holy Land, and these common coins never appeared for sale in the markets of Israel until quite recently when they were imported from abroad for sale to tourists. Based on the large number of Jews who returned from Babylon, one might expect that more of these coins would have appeared in the biblical lands. It therefore appears that while the post-captivity references in Ezra and Nehemiah might be references to actual coins in circulation at the time, the archaeological evidence so far suggests that even these references may be anachronistic, at least for the land of Judah.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section3-1476993X12459634">
<title>Persian Period</title>
<p>For more than 100 years the denominations of silver coins struck in ancient Palestine have been referred to as Greek coins: <italic>staters, tetradrachms, drachms, obols</italic> and their fractions. However, Tal concludes that <italic>all</italic> of the silver coins struck in ancient Judah, Samaria, Philistea and possibly Edom, were based upon a <italic>shekel</italic> standard, although the weights of the <italic>shekel</italic> probably varied from time to time and place to place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1476993X12459634">Tal 2007</xref>: 17-28).</p>
<p>‘There is no indisputable reference in the Bible for the use of a Greek denominational system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1476993X12459634">Tal 2007</xref>: 19). Years earlier Stern concluded ‘with a large measure of certainty that in the Persian period, alongside the Babylonian-Persian system of weights…a local system existed in Palestine which preserved the ancient Hebrew names though it was based on a different standard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1476993X12459634">Stern 1982</xref>: 217). And Tal concluded that for the regions of ancient Palestine, ‘a local denominational system and weight standards based on the <italic>shekel</italic> and its fractions should be preferred’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1476993X12459634">Tal 2007</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>There is scant written evidence relating the <italic>shekel</italic> to the Greek <italic>stater</italic>, but one reference from the fifth century <sc>bce</sc> Elephantine papyri suggests there are two <italic>shekels</italic> in one <italic>stater</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1476993X12459634">Stern 1982</xref>: 215). Certainly this does not refer to the Philistian <italic>shekel</italic> standard of 14.32 grams or the Jewish standard of 11.33 grams (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1476993X12459634">Tal 2007</xref>: 25 for a chart of differences in weight standards and silver content), since the Attic <italic>stater</italic> weighed only 17.2 gm. However, there were numerous Babylonian and related <italic>shekel</italic> standards from around 7.6 to 8.6 gm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2007</xref>: 72-77), and the reference is likely a reference to one of them.</p>
<sec id="section4-1476993X12459634">
<title>Philistian Coins</title>
<p>Hill treated these as Greek coins, and referred to them as ‘Philisto-Arabian’ and ‘Egypto-Arabian’, although he described those terms as ‘not very satisfactory’ to describe the earliest coins struck in ancient Palestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476993X12459634">Hill 1914</xref>: lxxxiii); he erroneously included some Cilician coins in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476993X12459634">Hill 1914</xref>: plate XX nos. 1-3).</p>
<p>More recently Gitler and Tal describe these coins as ‘Philistian’ and point out this is ‘a geographical rather than an ethnic term. The fact that Gaza was the southernmost Palestinian minting authority bordering Arabian domination rather than being under Arabian rule, lends support to our understanding of these coins as Philistian’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476993X12459634">Gitler and Tal 2006</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>The Philistine confederacy described in the Old Testament was influenced by Phoenicia and Egypt as well as other Mediterranean cities. Mildenberg observed that in the fifth to fourth centuries <sc>bce</sc>, ‘Sidon and Tyre had developed their main coinages, the heavy denominations. Gaza is their counterpart, being the best of ports in the South. Her importance as the final destination of the desert routes and major junction of the coastal roads can hardly be overestimated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1476993X12459634">Mildenberg 1992</xref>: 33-40).</p>
<p>Gitler and Tal suggest that Gaza may have been a central mint which produced not only generic Philistian coins and coins of Gaza, but also struck coins for nearby cities such as Ashdod and Ashkelon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476993X12459634">Gitler and Tal 2006</xref>: 30-31). Yehud, the Persian name for Judah, was struck on at least two types of Philistian quarter-<italic>shekels</italic> (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1045, 1046), and the initial <italic>yod</italic>, its first letter, was struck on both quarter-<italic>shekels</italic> and <italic>ma’ah</italic>-<italic>obols</italic> (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1047, 1048).</p>
<p>One coin, possibly a quarter-<italic>shekel</italic> (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1049) is of special interest because it relates to the Judaean weight standard and it carries the name <italic>yhwd</italic> in four paleo-Hebrew letters along with the Phoenician letter <italic>ayan</italic>, a traditional mintmark of Gaza (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476993X12459634">Figure 1</xref>). This clue suggests that the earliest series of Yehud coins, all of which are either unique or extremely rare, were likely struck at Gaza for use in Judah, and later at a mint closer to the Jerusalem area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 88). Gitler also concluded that the earliest coins of Yehud were struck at Gaza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X12459634">Gitler 2011b</xref>). (Yehud coins are discussed below.)</p>

<p>The first issues of Philistian coins were struck just after 450 <sc>bce</sc> and they tend to be patterned after their Athenian predecessors, but expand into a number of fascinating oriental motifs such as the sphinx, local cult figures, flora and fauna. A group of the Philistian coins contain ‘elusive motifs’ or optical illusions that provide more than one way to look at a coin. These unusual designs are also known in other coinage, but they are more prevalent in the Philistian series. For example, one tiny silver coin depicts a male head to the right wearing a cap; closer inspection reveals that the cap is really the head of a dog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476993X12459634">Figure 2</xref>) facing in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476993X12459634">Gitler and Tal 2006</xref>: plate XIV, 220).</p>

<title>Edomite Coins</title>
<p>The first possible Edomite coins are discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476993X12459634">Gitler, Tal and Van Alfen (2007</xref>: 47-62). They point to a group of ‘peculiar Athenian-styled Palestinian coins’ which were struck from dies that had very worn obverses that were re-cut and re-polished. Thus instead of a head of Athena, the obverse appears simply as dome-shaped. Distribution of these coins suggests that they ‘circulated in the boundaries of what we define as Edom in the later part of the Persian period and might well have been the silver money mentioned in several of the Edomite ostraca’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476993X12459634">Gitler, Tal and Van Alfen 2007</xref>: 47).</p>
<p>Gitler, Ponting and Tal analyzed southern Palestinian coins of the Persian period using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. They concluded that Edomite and Philistian coins originated at the same mint (2008).</p>
<p>Ostraca from Tel Arad discuss various monetary units of <italic>ksp</italic> or <italic>kesef</italic> in Hebrew or Aramaic, which refer both to silver and to money in ancient times. The units of <italic>kesef</italic> in the Tel Arad ostraca are ‘<italic>s</italic>’ (for <italic>shekel</italic>), ‘<italic>r</italic>’ (for <italic>rebah</italic>) or quarter, and ‘<italic>m</italic>’ (for either <italic>ma’eh</italic> or <italic>maneh</italic>), a smaller denomination that seems to be parallel to the <italic>gerah</italic> (1/24th of a <italic>shekel</italic>). A late fourth century <sc>bce</sc> papyrus discovered near Jericho and additional Aramaic ostraca discovered at Tel Be’er Sheba all suggest ‘a vivid monetary economy in fourth-century <sc>bce</sc> Edom in which the <italic>shekel</italic> contained four quarters and each quarter contained six <italic>ma’ehs</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X12459634">Gitler, Ponting and Tal 2008</xref>: 18-19). This denomination system is similar to the Attic weight standard of 17.2 gm, even though the weights of the <italic>shekel</italic> and Attic tetradrachm differ. In the Attic system, the tetradrachm formed the basic unit of weight, equal to four drachms, with the drachm corresponding to six obols. The average weight of the possible Edomite coins suggests a <italic>shekel</italic> standard of around 15.96 gm.</p>

<title>Coins of Samaria</title>
<p>Samaria has significant written material from the Wadi ed-Daliyeh papyri, dated to the fourth century <sc>bce</sc>. These documents use the term <italic>kesef</italic> and refer to silver <italic>shekels</italic> and silver <italic>mnn</italic> or <italic>mnh</italic> which could be <italic>ma’ah</italic> or <italic>maneh</italic>. Meshorer and Qedar, in their book <italic>Samarian Coinage</italic> (1999), suggested that this coinage was struck in denominations of <italic>drachms, obols</italic> and hemi-<italic>obols</italic>. But Tal points out that the average weights of the Samarian coins vary around 16 per cent from both the Sidonian and Attic standards of the same period. Thus, Tal concludes that ‘given the epigraphic and numismatic evidence, it is very likely that the Samarian coinage follows a local weight standard, where the basic unit was the <italic>shekel</italic>, which from the numismatic evidence weighed 14.52 gm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1476993X12459634">Tal 2007</xref>: 20).</p>
<p>The numismatic history of Samaria and Judah began toward the end of the Persian period. Samaritan coins were minted fairly consistently from around 375–333 <sc>bce</sc> while the Yehud coins, discussed below, were minted less frequently, from around 400–260 <sc>bce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1476993X12459634">Meshorer and Qedar 1991</xref>: 1). Other than the coins, several references in Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles, and a few manuscripts and ostraca, history records little of these years. It is generally believed that around 400 <sc>bce</sc> ‘the Samaritans were still considered Jewish, and as such were approached by the Jews of Elephantine [also called Yeb, a small island in the Nile with an active Jewish population at this time]. The Samaritan high priests and governors in the fifth and fourth centuries bear Jewish names as recorded in the Elephantine documents and the Wadi Daliyeh papyri’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1476993X12459634">Meshorer and Qedar 1999</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>The coins of Samaria were not known prior to the 1970s and they were first published during the early 1980s, when Meshorer wrote a few paragraphs about them and identified four coins in <italic>Ancient Jewish Coinage I</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 1982</xref>: I, 31-33). By 1991, together with Qedar, Meshorer published <italic>The Coinage of Samaria in the Fourth Century <sc>bce</sc></italic>. A second book, <italic>Samarian Coinage</italic> was published in 1999 and identified 224 coin types or subtypes. More Samarian coin types continue to be discovered; in 2007, Ronen published 20 additional specimens (Ronen 2008). Fischer-Bossart refines the classification further in a new work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1476993X12459634">Meshorer <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref> [in press]). The first substantial discovery of Samarian coins came from two hoards, the ‘Nablus Hoard’ of around 1,000 coins of which several hundred were Samaritan, and the ‘Samaria Hoard’, which was found near Samaria (Sebaste) in the 1980s; of 334 coins, 182 were Samaritan, 43 from Sidon, 32 from Tyre, 11 from Arados, 66 Athenian prototypes, plus a number of pieces of jewelry including earrings, beads, and miscellaneous objects. Both hoards appeared in the Israel antiquities market and were studied by Meshorer and Qedar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1476993X12459634">Meshorer and Qedar 1991</xref>: 65).</p>
<p>Samaria issued silver coins to maintain parallel prestige with cities in other areas such as Judah, Phoenicia and Philistia. The Samarian coins circulated locally, although rarely have they been found in both Judaea and further south. Samaria’s small denomination silver coins filled local needs for payments in religious, military and commercial transactions, alongside the continued use of other small pieces of silver in addition to coins.</p>
<p>Since coins of Samaria were apparently struck during the 45 years prior to Alexander’s conquest in 330 <sc>bce</sc> (and therefore before any formal Jewish-Samaritan schism), they should technically be considered Jewish issues, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1476993X12459634">Meshorer and Qedar (1999</xref>: 15). Samaritan coins parallel the coins of places to which Samaria was commercially connected such as Sidon, Tyre and Cilicia. Samaria’s geographic location—far to the north of Jerusalem—makes such commercial links logical. The coins of Judah, on the other hand, imitate mainly Athenian and Hellenistic Egyptian prototypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1476993X12459634">Meshorer and Qedar 1991</xref>: 20).</p>
<p>Gerson (a psychiatrist and a numismatist) has analyzed the coins of Yehud and Samaria and concludes that they can ‘project information about the characteristics of peoples that produced them, as well as the particular spirit’ of an epoch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X12459634">Gerson 2001</xref>: 119). Even though the territories of Samaria and Judah had many parallels with each other, the coins themselves are quite different. There are around ten times more specific types of Samarian coins than Yehud coins.</p>
<p>‘Focused analysis of the coins indicates a reality of many profound economic, cultural, and religious differences between these important provinces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X12459634">Gerson 2001</xref>: 119). Overall, Gerson suggests that ‘the sensibility and vision of Judaea was more “inward”, interior and conservative while that of Samaria was to look “outward” during this period. I am not attaching a value judgment to these differences, but am trying to characterize simply “what was”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X12459634">Gerson 2001</xref>: 119).</p>
<p>Coins of both Samaria and Judah also carry personal names or their abbreviations, apparently the names of governors of the respective regions. Most of the names are Jewish; among those named on Samaritan coins are Jeroboam, Hiyam, Hananyah, Sanballat and Delayah. Some coins also carry the name of the Persian satrap Mazaeus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1476993X12459634">Meshorer and Qedar 1999</xref>: 19-28).</p>
<p>The scenes on many Samarian coins are syncretistic—representing a synthesis between elements of different cultures. A superb example of this is shown on the coin that represents a standing frontal figure of the Egyptian god Bes (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1028) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1476993X12459634">Figure 3</xref>). Images and figurines of Bes appear not only in Egyptian art, but throughout the ancient Near East from the second millennium <sc>bce</sc> to the Roman period. Bes was sort of a household protector god, who represented good and opposed bad. With such a mandate, it’s no wonder that this Egyptian deity was widely adopted in nearby Syria, Phoenicia and ancient Palestine. Depictions of Bes had many variations, and there is evidence that in early times the attributes of Bes, among other non-Judeo-Samaritan deities, were associated and merged with local gods. In the case of this coin it seems possible that the physical attributes of Bes were merged with the iconography of the Samaritan god (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1476993X12459634">Meshorer and Qedar 1999</xref>: 33-34).</p>

<title>Yehud Coins</title>
<p>While the Jews who had remained in Judah during the exodus continued using written and spoken Hebrew, the returning exiles now spoke Aramaic, which soon became the dominant language not only in Judah but throughout most of the ancient Levant. Hebrew now began to be used infrequently, mainly on the coins of Yehud, as well as on some official seals and documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 40-41). This was a graphic show of nationalistic pride and religious tradition.</p>
<p>Unlike Edom and Samaria, there is little written data regarding the use of the <italic>shekel</italic> system in Judah during the Persian period. To date, archaeological evidence from the Persian period regarding <italic>shekel</italic> denominations is non-existent, although Ronen makes a good case for carrying forward the Iron Age weight system of Judah into the Persian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1476993X12459634">Ronen 2003–2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As discussed above, the first coins mentioning the Persian province of Yehud were likely struck at Gaza. The earliest coins struck in Judah proper were the tiny (many weigh less than 0.2 gm) silver coins of the Persian and early Hellenistic periods with the inscription <italic>yhd</italic> or <italic>yhdh</italic>.</p>
<p>Most of these coins have been known for only about 40 years and new types are still being discovered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1476993X12459634">Meshorer (1982)</xref> listed 17 types; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer (2001)</xref> listed 35 types; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin (2010a)</xref> listed 41 types.</p>
<p>Ronen suggested that the Yehud coinage can be split into two series, first the coinage of the Persian period and then the related Hellenistic series struck during Macedonian or Ptolemaic rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>). Previously these coins have been studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1476993X12459634">Mildenberg (1979)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1476993X12459634">Meshorer (1982</xref>, 2001), and Barag (1994–99). However, Ronen (a nuclear physicist) made the important observation that the weight standards differ strikingly between the earlier series and the later series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>). This was important because coins that were fractions of a Judaean <italic>shekel</italic> would be very easy to group into the amount needed for the half-<italic>shekel</italic> Temple tax (Exod. 38.26).</p>
<p>Among the most common early Yehud issues are the tiny coins imitating Athenian tetradrachms (Athena bust/owl) but with the <italic>yhd</italic> inscription instead of AΘE (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1047-1055) and those coins which carry on one side the portrait of a Persian king (GBC Nos. 1057-1059). Ronen studied 64 ‘owl’ coins and 82 ‘Persian king’ coins, ‘quantities sufficient for reliable statistics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>: 122-23). He learned that the average weight for the ‘owl’ coins is 0.48 gm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1476993X12459634">Figure 4</xref>) and the average weights of the ‘Persian king’ coins are 0.26 gm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1476993X12459634">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>During the Persian period the standard of Greek coins commonly copied in the coastal cities, especially Gaza, was based on the Athenian tetradrachm, which had an average weight of 16.5 gm. An <italic>obol</italic> was 1/24th of a tetradrachm, and indeed we see Greek <italic>obols</italic> of this period with an average weight of 0.69 gm.</p>
<p>Weight of very small coins varies more greatly, by percentage, than the weight of larger coins. Ronen points out that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>we can find coins minted with the same die which are different by a factor of two in their weight. With Persian period techniques it was very difficult to produce coins with the same weight. In particular, it was difficult to control the production process of the small silver coins in which the flans were hand-made. However, from a given amount of silver, mints were required to produce a given number of coins. Thus, the average weight of a large number of coins of the same type is a valid and correct measure for the weight of that type of coin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>: 122-23).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is no logical reason that the <italic>obol</italic> of Yehud should average 0.48 gm and the Greek <italic>obol</italic> should average 0.69 gm during the same time period unless multiple local standards were in use during the Persian period in Judaea. Indeed, during the Israelite period there was a system of weights based on the weight of a silver <italic>shekel</italic>. Surviving scale weights suggest that the weight of the <italic>shekel</italic> at the end of the First Temple period was about 11.4 gm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2007</xref>). Since weight standards did not change overnight, we can assume that this Judaean <italic>shekel</italic> standard would have at least transitional impact on the following period.</p>
<p>Observes Ronen:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The shekel was divided into 24 smaller denominations or <italic>gerah</italic>…thus the weight of the <italic>gerah</italic> was 0.475 gm., which is nearly equal to the average weight (0.48) of the ‘Owl’ coins. It is our suggestion, therefore, that the <italic>yhd</italic> coins, during the late Persian rule, were in the denomination of a <italic>gerah</italic> (‘Owl’ coins) and half <italic>gerah</italic> (‘Persian king’ coins). Taxpayers used these coins to pay the half-shekel (12 gerahs) to the Temple in Jerusalem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>: 124).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Bible states that there are 20 <italic>gerahs</italic> to the <italic>shekel</italic>: ‘the <italic>shekel</italic> is 20 <italic>gerahs</italic>’ (Exod. 30.13). However, Kletter has concluded that there were more likely 24 <italic>gerah</italic> to the standard <italic>shekel</italic>, and that the figure of 20 <italic>gerah</italic> may have been a scribe’s error or perhaps a different <italic>shekel</italic> standard, since several are mentioned in the Old Testament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X12459634">Kletter 1998</xref>: 101 and further discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2007</xref>: 80-86). So it seems that these are <italic>gerah</italic> and half-<italic>gerah</italic> coins that were manufactured so they could easily combine to make up the exact amount used to pay the annual silver half-<italic>shekel</italic> to the Temple.</p>
<p>As further proof to his theory that the Yehud coins were used as Temple payments, Ronen notes that <italic>fourrée</italic> or ‘silver plated’ coins with base metal interiors are rather common among the coins of the late Persian period, except in the Yehud series. Once it was believed that the <italic>fourrée</italic> coins were simply ancient forgeries. However, this seems not to have always been the case, as shown by Hoover: ‘Although plated coins are frequently described as “ancient forgeries”, it is difficult to be certain that criminal enterprise was responsible for all of the known plated specimens. Some series that are of especially high quality may possibly be official’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476993X12459634">Hoover 2007</xref>: 155).</p>
<p>Ronen points out that there is only one known example of a base-metal Yehud coin and it has no traces of silver plating at all, so may have been a trial strike. Thus for all practical purposes the Yehud series is the only contemporary series of the area where <italic>fourrée</italic> coins do not exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1476993X12459634">Ronen 2003–2006</xref>: 29). ‘If the Yehud coins were indeed used for the Biblical half-<italic>shekel</italic> tribute to the Temple (Mishnah Shekalim 2.4), the <italic>shekel</italic> weight system is the appropriate standard. Moreover, pure silver was required for the Temple dues, which explains the absence of silver-plated Yehud coins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1476993X12459634">Ronen 2003–2006</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>When the Yehud coins of the Macedonian and Ptolemaic periods were manufactured, they were more in line with the weight of Greek <italic>obols</italic>. For example, Ronen studied 72 coins of the Ptolemaic period and learned that the average weight of the Ptolemy and eagle coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>) is 0.18 gm. ‘This weight of the Ptolemaic coins clearly deviates from the Persian period’s weight of the 0.48 or 0.26 gm. of the <italic>gerah</italic> and half-<italic>gerah</italic>, respectively. However, the 0.18 is suitable to the <italic>obol</italic> system of weight. This coin clearly represents a quarter of an <italic>obol</italic>, which has a weight of 0.17 gm. The shift from the gerah standard during the Persian period to the <italic>obol</italic> standard during the Ptolemaic period is unmistakable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1476993X12459634">2003–2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Combining Ronen’s mathematics with Tal’s logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1476993X12459634">Tal 2007</xref>: 20), we suggest that denomination of the Yehud and Samarian coins should be called a <italic>ma’ah-obol</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 91). This hybrid terminology recognizes both the local nature of the coinage and the underlying Greek system.</p>
<p>Yehud coins were apparently for local circulation since virtually all of the Yehud coins are found only within ancient Judaea, while coins from the same period struck in Gaza, Tyre, Sidon and Aradus are also found within Judaea in significant numbers. Similar to the local nature of the Samarian coins, Ronen suggests this ‘might indicate that the Yehud coins were not used for international trade, as were the Phoenician coins. If the Yehud coins were only used locally, the use of a non-conventional weight system becomes more readily explicable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X12459634">Ronen 1998</xref>: 126).</p>
<p>Ronen discussed the chronology of the Yehud falcon coins (20010). Gitler and Lorber established a chronology of the Macedonian period Yehizkiyah coins and links them to the coins of the Persian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476993X12459634">Gitler and Lorber 2008</xref>). The same team also drew upon metallurgic analysis and current research into royal Ptolemaic coinage to establish a chronology for the Ptolemaic coins of Judah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X12459634">Gitler and Lorber 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Metrology, Mints and Values of the <italic>Prutot</italic></title>
<p>Following the coins of the Persian to Ptolemaic periods, there were no known coins struck by and for the Jews in their land until around 130 <sc>bce</sc>; coinage struck in Judaea, Samaria and the Galilee continued intermittently until the end of the Jewish War, and was briefly resurrected during the Bar Kokhba Revolt. Through to the end of the Jewish War, the principal Jewish coin was the small bronze <italic>prutah</italic> (pl. <italic>prutot</italic>). The author published a study of 10,312 Judaean bronze <italic>prutot</italic> of 27 general types and various denominations that has led to some conclusions regarding the Judaean bronze coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>The data show that the Judaean bronze coins were intended to be a fiduciary currency and were manufactured ‘al marco’ (by the group) rather than ‘al pezzo’ (individually). Meshorer had previously observed that ‘it is likely that the mint masters knew the amount of coins to be produced from a specific amount of bronze; the exact quantity of the metal included in each coin would have been exceptionally difficult to control. It would not have been expedient to remove bronze from coins that were too heavy or to add bronze to the lighter ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>Our research confirms this and strongly suggests that even though the <italic>prutah</italic> was a fiduciary coin, it nevertheless became lighter or heavier, depending on the circumstances of the issuing authority. The heaviest <italic>prutot</italic> occur in the earliest Hasmonean issues (2.47 +/− 0.03 gm) and then the denomination deteriorates through the reigns of Herod and his son Archelaus, only to climb again in weight beginning with the coins of the procurators and Agrippa I and reaches a second peak with the <italic>prutot</italic> of the Jewish War (2.51 +/− 0.02 gm). The weight range for any particular type of <italic>prutah</italic> varied widely, and it was common for coins of the same exact type (and thus the same value) to range from less than a gm to more than 3 gm. We further suggest that among the small Jewish bronzes, it is axiomatic that coins with the same design motifs were the same denomination in spite of the wide ranges in weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2009</xref>: 107-108). Thus the late, poor anchor/star coins of Alexander Jannaeus or his successors (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1153, average wt. 0.81 +/− 0.01 gm) were most probably degraded <italic>prutot</italic>, as were the dated Jannaeus coins (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1152, average wt. 1.20 +/− 0.02 gm), and so, too, were the early anchor/star <italic>prutot</italic> (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1150, average wt. 1.71 +/− 0.3 gm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010b</xref>). It would have been impossible for a person in the market to distinguish on the spot, by hand, between a one gram and three gram coin of exactly the same design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1476993X12459634">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1476993X12459634">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1476993X12459634">8</xref>).</p>

<p>Previously, Meshorer and others suggested that small examples of the same type coins might be lower denominations (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 1982</xref>: 261, no. 14). Subsequently, however, Meshorer evolved his opinion and noted that ‘the fact that their weight is half that of the ordinary <italic>prutah</italic> or even less does not necessarily indicate that they are half-<italic>prutot</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 81). Multiple-<italic>prutah</italic> and half-<italic>prutah</italic> denominations did exist, and the diameter relative to the <italic>prutah</italic> was, in addition to type, an indication of denomination. The diameter of the <italic>prutot</italic> themselves was subject to change over time as the coins became smaller and lighter, and then heavier again.</p>
<p>The fiduciarity of the Judaean bronze coins had several ramifications. During the Hellenistic period in Judaea, the striking of coins was a royal prerogative, and the grant to Jews by Antiochus VII (1 Macc. 14.9-13) appears only to have been valid for bronze coinage. Silver coins were struck in ancient Judaea only during the Persian period and the two revolts against Rome (66–70 <sc>ce</sc>) and (132–135 <sc>ce</sc>).</p>
<p>This is illustrated by the editors of the Talmud, which discusses whether bronze coins should be considered money or commodities when traded against silver coins. Typically, weighing both sides of the argument, the Talmud concludes: they are money because in areas where the bronzes were the common form of currency, they were more readily accepted and exchanged than silver coins; they are commodities because their greater acceptance increases their value (Baba Metzia 44b). The Talmud also recognizes the tiny value of the <italic>prutah</italic> when it states that it is forbidden to steal even an amount less than a <italic>prutah</italic>, but if one does, he cannot be subpoenaed to court. He must, however, answer to God, even for such a tiny transgression (Baba Metzia 55a).</p>
<p>Such insights confirm the extremely low value of the bronze <italic>prutot</italic>. During the first century <sc>ce</sc>, the <italic>shekel</italic> consisted of 256 <italic>prutot</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 122). This was very small change indeed. In those days the cost of one pomegranate was one <italic>prutah</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1476993X12459634">Sperber 1974</xref>: 104). After all, pomegranates grew wild and could be plucked off trees in many areas of the ancient (and modern) Holy Land for free.</p>
<p>While coins served the marketplace they also served the state, since the profit motive for striking fiduciary coins was significant. Thus profit joins both market and political motives in pushing the desire of local rulers to obtain the right to strike their own coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010b</xref>: 119). Judaean bronze coinage certainly had economic elements, but the need for Jews to establish and maintain an independent Jewish state at the time suggests this coinage had a political significance nearly as great as its economic significance.</p>
<p>Even though they were struck in the first century <sc>bce</sc>, <italic>prutot</italic> continued to circulate well into the first century <sc>ce</sc> when Jesus lived, but even through the fourth century <sc>ce</sc>. This has been shown by archaeological excavations in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X12459634">Bijovsky 2000–2002</xref>). These were useful pieces of small change, at a time and place that small change was not easy to find and many late Roman and Byzantine small bronze coins were chopped in halves and quarters to accommodate the market needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1476993X12459634">Leonard 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Kushnir-Stein discusses the beveled edges of the Judaean <italic>prutot</italic> and suggests that this was a specific characteristic of coins minted in Jerusalem during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2000–2002</xref>).

<title>Graven Images</title>
<p>The Yehud and Samarian coins of the Persian period consistently depict a wide range of graven images. No graven images are carried forward into the Hasmonean coinage and only once an animal appears on a coin of Herod I (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1190). Herod’s son Philip and grandson Agrippa I and great-grandson Agrippa II all issued coins covered with imagery of humans and Greco-Roman gods—including their own portraits. But during the Jewish Wars, the Jewish coinage once again spurns graven images altogether. Expanding on this thesis, Roth explains the circumstances surrounding the time period under examination:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The meticulous obedience or relative neglect of the apparent biblical prohibition of representational art seems in fact to have been conditioned by external circumstances, and in two directions—revulsion, or attraction… The almost frenzied Jewish opposition to images of any sort toward the close of the Second Temple period seems to have been prompted by the extreme nationalist elements, happy to find a point in which their political opposition could be based on a clear-cut religious issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1476993X12459634">Roth <italic>et al.</italic> 2007</xref>: 492).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, with respect to the use of the iconography of graven images, the evolution of the Jewish royal coinage and the coinage of the two Jewish Wars closely reflects the evolution of Jewish independence, interdependence, and assimilation with the Greeks and Romans.</p>

<title>Hasmonean Coins</title>
<p>Early scholars attempted to identify who issued the Jewish bronze coins with paleo-Hebrew legends. It had once been believed that Simon the Maccabee (142–135 <sc>bce</sc>), Judah’s brother and the first Maccabee to carry the title High Priest, struck Jewish bronze coins in the mid-130s <sc>bce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1476993X12459634">Madden 1864</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1476993X12459634">Reifenberg 1947</xref>). This concept was largely based upon the words of Antiochus VII Sidetes (138–128 <sc>bce</sc>) who urgently needed to keep the Jews on his side in the battle against Tryphon for the Syrian throne. Thus he granted a number of privileges in 139 <sc>bce</sc>, including permission to ‘mint your own coinage as currency for your country. Jerusalem and the Temple shall be free’ (1 Macc. 15.6). However, Simon did not issue any coins before Antiochus VII reneged on his promise and in spite of a tribute payment of 2,000 men, gold, silver and armor by Simon, he ‘repudiated all his previous agreements with Simon and broke off relations’ (1 Macc. 15.27). Later, in light of archaeological evidence from Beit Zur and elsewhere, it became clear that all of the coins once attributed to Simon should be re-attributed to the Jewish War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1476993X12459634">Sellers 1933</xref>: 89-90).</p>
<p>In 1967, Ya’akov Meshorer suggested that Hyrcanus I’s son, Alexander Jannaeus, struck the first Jewish bronze coins (1967: 56). This was widely debated for years. Today, while all chronological problems of the Hasmonean coins have not been fully resolved, there is a consensus that the first coins were struck by John Hyrcanus I (135–104 <sc>bce</sc>), the son of Simon and nephew of the legendary Judah Maccabee, hero of the Chanukah story, using the Hebrew name ‘Yehohanan’. This scenario was firmly established by the discovery of a hoard of Hasmonean coins in Nablus in the 1990s. This hoard entered the market largely intact and heavily encrusted so the coins could not have been previously sorted. It was immediately purchased for the Hebrew University Institute of Archaeology and studied by Barag (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X12459634">Hendin 1996</xref>: 66-77).</p>
<p>Still, there remain areas for discussion about the Hasmonean coins. They are complicated because contemporaneous historians refer to the Greek names of rulers (Hyrcanus, Jannaeus, Aristobulus and Antigonus) while most Maccabean coins carry only Hebrew names—Yehohanan, Yehonatan, Yonatan, Yehudah and Mattatayah. Coins of Jannaeus (Yehonatan and at least some Yonatan) and Antigonus (Mattatayah) are bilingual and have definite name linkage, and thus definite attribution. The other three names, however, cannot be directly linked with Greek equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 163) and assumptions must be made on archeology or paleography.</p>
<p>Today there is consensus that the first coins struck in Jerusalem under the Maccabees carry the name of Antiochus VII (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1131) and are dated to the years Seleucid Era 181 and 182 (132/131 and 131/130 <sc>bce</sc>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476993X12459634">Hoover 2003</xref>). These were small lily/anchor bronzes issued in Jerusalem early in the reign of Hyrcanus I as a kind of transitional issue from Seleucid to Jewish coinage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X12459634">Houghton and Lorber 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476993X12459634">Houghton, Lorber and Hoover 2008</xref>). The last coins of this issue were struck less than a year before Antiochus VII died in battle against the Parthians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476993X12459634">Houghton and Spaer 1998</xref>: Nos. 2140-2145).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the earliest Hasmonean coins with paleo-Hebrew legends were struck by Hyrcanus I. Many of them carry an obverse ‘A’ monogram above the paleo-Hebrew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1476993X12459634">Figure 9</xref>). In Meshorer’s now displaced theory that Hyrcanus II issued these ‘Yehohanan’ coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 1967</xref>: 46-47), he followed Kanael’s earlier theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1476993X12459634">Kanael 1952</xref>) and suggested that the monogram referred to Antipater, Herod I’s father and powerful advisor to his son-in-law Hyrcanus II. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1476993X12459634">Arie Kindler (1974)</xref>, among others, suggested that the ‘A’ monogram referred to Jannaeus’s wife and successor Queen Salome Alexandra. Stein’s theory suggested that it refers to Hyrcanus I’s son and successor Judah Aristobulus I, and that the other reverse monograms refer to magistrates who may remain forever anonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1476993X12459634">Stein 1943</xref>: 19-21). More promising, however, is the idea that both the letter ‘A’ on the obverse (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1132) and the various ‘A’ and ‘AΠ’ monograms suggest a continuing numismatic relationship between Hyrcanus I and the Seleucid kings—Antiochus VII and successor Alexander Zebina (128–123 <sc>bce</sc>). This relationship was suggested as early as 1864 by Madden, who said, ‘if the coins with the two cornucopiae originated with Alexander II Zebina, then John Hyrcanus made this type the sign of his alliance with Zebina, and it helps to prove that the Greek letter A on some of his coins refers to this king’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1476993X12459634">Madden 1864</xref>: 57). More recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X12459634">Barag and Qedar (1980</xref>: 18) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476993X12459634">Hoover (1994</xref>: 41-57) have agreed. It seems likely that these monograms were discontinued when Hyrcanus ‘severed his last ties with the Seleucids’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X12459634">Barag and Qedar 1980</xref>: 18). Josephus supports a Zebina connection: Hyrcanus I ‘flourished greatly during the reign of Alexander Zebina’ and was a great friend of the king (<italic>B.J.</italic> xxi. 273, 269).</p>

<p>The author’s recent epigraphic study establishes that Hyrcanus I’s son, Aristobulus I (104 <sc>bce</sc>) (and not Aristobulus II) issued coins under his Hebrew name Yehudah during his brief reign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Coins of his successor Alexander Jannaeus (104–76 <sc>bce</sc>) often carry both the names Yehonatan in Hebrew and Alexander in Greek. Thus there is little doubt who issued them. Yet, there remains the matter of the similar name Yonatan. It had long been thought that the name Yonatan, appearing on a parallel series of coins, was simply another version of ‘Yehonatan’ that omitted several letters. In 1992 a new translation of Dead Sea Scroll fragment 4Q448 by Eshel, Eshel and Yardeni underlined the matter. They translated the fragment as follows: ‘Holy city, for King Yonatan and all the congregation of your people Israel who are in the four winds of Heaven’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X12459634">Eshel, Eshel and Yardeni 1992</xref>: 201). This represented the first reference ever found in the Dead Sea Scrolls to a Jewish historical figure and it referred to Jannaeus, since he was the only Jewish king at about the time this scroll was written who had a name like this and the title king. There was another Yonatan, the brother of Judah Maccabee, one of the immediate family members who liberated Jerusalem from the Greeks. But that Yonatan ruled Judaea between 157–142 <sc>bce</sc> and held only the title high priest, never king. Thus, since scroll fragment 4Q448 refers to Jannaeus with the name Yonatan, it hints that both the Yehonatan and the Yonatan coins may have been struck by Jannaeus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X12459634">Hendin 1996</xref>: 70).</p>
<p>Shachar suggested even more strongly that the coins inscribed with the name Yonatan, as opposed to Yehonatan, were struck by Jannaeus and not one of his successors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1476993X12459634">Shachar 2004</xref>). After the author discovered a double-overstruck <italic>rutah</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1476993X12459634">Figure 10</xref>), he co-authored an article with Shachar and noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The coinage of the Hasmonean rulers has been studied intensively and today there is general agreement on most of the attributions and several points of chronology. Among the issues that have still eluded consensus are the attribution of coins which bear the name <italic>yntn</italic> in paleo-Hebrew script, and the chronology of the coins minted by Alexander Jannaeus. This article focuses on an unpublished double overstrike of a well-known Hasmonean coin which was recently discovered in the market by Hendin. This coin not only proves definitively the attribution of at least one major group of <italic>yntn</italic> coins, but also helps to resolve the question of the chronological order in which certain Jannaeus types were struck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476993X12459634">Hendin and Shachar 2008</xref>: 87).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Regarding some salient points on these subjects, we pointed out that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Various attempts have been made to explain why Jannaeus’ mint chose (or was directed) to overstrike Jannaeus’ anchor/flower type bearing the title ‘king’ with a cornucopias/inscription type bearing the title ‘high priest’. According to Josephus, Jannaeus provoked a civil insurrection in the course of which thousands were killed. At one point he tried to appease his enemies. One theory is that Jannaeus’ adoption of the royal title was offensive to many, especially the Pharisees, and a way to appease them might have been to overstrike stocks of his flower/anchor coin with a new version of his cornucopias/inscription coin, thus abandoning the Greek inscription and royal title on the flower/anchor coin and promoting his status as ‘high priest’. Attempts at appeasement did not succeed, and rival forces asked the Seleucid ruler, Demetrius III, for military assistance. Demetrius ruled from 96–88 <sc>bce</sc> and died shortly after his campaign against Jannaeus. If the appeasement theory is correct this would give a time frame of the latter part of Demetrius’ reign for the overstriking phenomenon. Later issues of Jannaeus coins, which once again give the title ‘king’, could reflect his improved self-confidence after military victories abroad and an end to the civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476993X12459634">Hendin and Shachar 2008</xref>: 89).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, this coin ‘provides an unequivocal answer’ to one of the Yonatan coin groups (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1149), which was struck under Jannaeus and not under any successor ruler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476993X12459634">Hendin and Shachar 2008</xref>). We concluded:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The intriguing question of why the mint of Alexander Jannaeus chose to overstrike his anchor/flower coins with cornucopia/inscription dies remains open. Nonetheless, we now have an established fact to support the notion that this occurred around the middle of Jannaeus’ reign and that it is likely to have been a gesture of appeasement to his enemies. We will leave it to others to argue the historical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476993X12459634">Hendin and Shachar 2008</xref>: 94).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally we observed that the remaining unsolved attributions in this field have to do with the ‘wild’ style Yontan (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1159-1160) types. Since Shachar and I already established that the overstruck coins (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1149) are indeed struck during the reign of Jannaeus, it might be tempting to suggest that the ‘wild’ type coins should also be attributed to Jannaeus. However, the unusual and distinct epigraphic style of the inscriptions leaves open the possibility that these coins belong to a different high priest, perhaps Aristobulus II or Hyrcanus II, the sons and successors to Jannaeus, or by their mother Salome Alexandra, her husband’s immediate successor who may have acted as regent for Hyrcanus II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476993X12459634">Hendin and Shachar 2008</xref>: 94).</p>

<title>Paleo-Hebrew on the Hasmonean Coins</title>
<p>There has been a great deal of misunderstanding about the epigraphy on the ancient Judaean coins from the time of the Hasmoneans. The paleo-Hebrew alphabet used on the Maccabean and later coins and, rarely, in manuscripts of the period, was anachronistic, since this form of written Hebrew had been discontinued several hundred years earlier.</p>
<p>Meshorer wrote,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>According to archaeological evidence, during this period of the first century <sc>bce</sc> the Aramaic script, also known as the ‘square script’ or ‘Syrian script’, was the leading one. It was used for writing both in Hebrew and in Aramaic, and it seems that the early paleo-Hebrew script was almost completely forgotten and only few were able to read it (2001: 40).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Among the Dead Sea Scrolls the only paleo-Hebrew manuscripts, except for Job, are from the Pentateuch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1476993X12459634">VanderKam and Flint 2002</xref>: 151). In some other scrolls written in the Aramaic script, only the Tetragrammaton is written in paleo-Hebrew, ‘thus indicating that the scribes who preserved this script knew that it was the original Hebrew one and its archaic flavor made it suitable for writing the name of the Lord’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 40).</p>
<p>Limited use of paleo-Hebrew script during the Maccabean period through the Jewish Wars was thus symbolic. It was intended to revive thoughts of the glorious days of the Israelite period around the time of King David and even ‘the desire to create a link between the earlier kingdoms of Judah and Israel and that of the Hasmonean dynasty… These were however not living letters to which the principles of development and evolution could apply’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 1967</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>In summary, then, it is impossible to undertake a meaningful study of the development proto-Hebrew script used on the coins of the Maccabees or the Jewish Wars, because it was an alphabet no longer in normal use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1476993X12459634">Naveh 1987</xref>: 122). Instead of evolving as would a living alphabet, script forms resulted from the way various master engravers and their assistants or apprentices cut these scripts into the coin dies. Other than a few instances where we can suggest that the same engraver worked during transitions between rulers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2009</xref>), there is little to be learned about the chronology of the coins from the style of the paleo-Hebrew scripts.</p>
<p>The best example of such a transition is the coins struck during the brief reign of Judah Aristobulus I in 104 <sc>bce</sc>. The very rare type (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1142) uses wedge-like characters that probably came from the same workshop as the Hyrcanus I coins with the same style (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1135, 1137). However, the more common Aristobulus coins (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1143) contains a script almost identical in style to the coins of his successor, Alexander Jannaeus (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1144), and probably came from the same workshop, if not the same engraver. This connection between the workshops of Aristobulus’ predecessor and successor allow us to establish a chronology for his coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>At a certain point late in Jannaeus’ reign, the Aramaic (square Hebrew) script appeared on coins dated to the year 25 of Jannaeus (76 <sc>bce</sc>) while, at the same time, the ‘high priest’ title was eliminated (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1152). Such a significant change may have been prompted by the conflicts between the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Jannaeus was supported by the Pharisees, and the Sadducees contended that he should give up the high priest title and be content with the royal crown (Kiddushin 66a). There is no evidence that Jannaeus gave up the high priest title, but simply stopped flaunting it, not only by eliminating the reference on his coins, but by changing to the <italic>lingua franca</italic> of Aramaic both alphabetically and linguistically.</p>
<p>As noted, Jannaeus was succeeded by his wife, Queen Salome Alexandra (Shlomozion), who was far more sympathetic to the Pharisees than her late husband (<italic>Ant</italic>. xiii, 408).</p>

<p>it is natural to conclude that the coins being cast into the treasury were strictly Jewish coins…the choice of strictly Jewish copper is accordingly limited to the coins of the Hasmonean or the Herodian families…and with some degree of certainty it may be said that the popular coins for this purpose were the small copper of Alexander Jannaeus and his successors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X12459634">Rogers 1914</xref>: 76).</p>

<p>Whatever its origin, the poor widow’s <italic>mite</italic> has become one of the most frequently referenced and most popular ancient biblical coin. The widow’s <italic>mite</italic> story is related by both Mark (12.41-44) and Luke (21.1-4), and tells us that the amount of money the widow threw into the Temple treasury was two coins of the smallest size in existence in Jerusalem at that time. There is no doubt that the small <italic>prutah</italic> (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1152-1154) or half-<italic>prutah</italic> (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1134, 1138, 1147, 1185-1187), coins of the Maccabean kings and Herod the Great, fit that description. The most common among them, probably by a factor of more than 1000 to 1, is the small <italic>prutah</italic> of Jannaeus and possibly his successors.</p>
<p>We also studied the word <italic>lepton</italic> and in its context (Mk 12.42) it seems to be a reference to a generic small coin and not to a specific denomination, which is the usage modern writers have generally applied to the term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010b</xref>: 107).</p>

<title>When the Mite Became a Mite</title>
<p>In spite of a great deal of writing to the contrary, many collectors and students of the coins of the ancient Holy Land continue to believe that the ‘mite’ was a well-known name for the smallest coin in circulation during the life of Jesus. That is not so. In fact, the word ‘mite’ first appears in the books of Mark and Luke in the initial publication of <italic>Tyndale’s New Testament</italic>, published in 1525, where it may have been intended as a shortened version of the word ‘minute’ and not as the name of a denomination.</p>
<p>Hoover points out that neither the original Greek text of the New Testament nor the Latin Vulgate Bible mention the ‘mite’. Instead the Greek or Latin words refer to either <italic>lepta</italic> or <italic>minuta</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476993X12459634">Hoover 2006</xref>). The word ‘mite’ was most widely spread by the King James Version of the Bible, printed in 1611, which became the most popular English version of the Bible that has been published, and a significant influence on the English language until today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476993X12459634">Hoover 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Hoover explains that the translators stated that they wanted their translation of the Bible to ‘speak like itself, as in the language of Canaan, that it may be understood even of the very vulgar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476993X12459634">Hoover 2006</xref>: 13). For this very reason the King James Version and some earlier English translations are of</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>some interest to numismatists, given their tendency to reinterpret the ancient coin denominations of the Greek, Latin, and Hebrew scriptural sources in terms of contemporary sixteenth and seventeenth-century English money. Thus, in a small way, the King James Version serves as a document for the circulating coinage of early modern Great Britain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476993X12459634">Hoover 2006</xref>: 13).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, there was no ‘mite’ coin known in British coinage of this period. ‘In fact, the mite (meaning “small cut piece” in Old Dutch) was only created as a circulating coin of Flanders in the fourteenth century. Initially, the mite was a small billon coin…but by the sixteenth century it had become copper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476993X12459634">Hoover 2006</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>One might guess, therefore, that this denomination was imported and used in Britain at the time, but Hoover explains there is little or no evidence to support this. Even though the Dutch mite did not circulate in Britain, and no British mites were struck, the mite was mentioned in sixteenth-century arithmetic books as a fraction of a farthing, varying from 1/3 to 1/16.</p>

<title>Herodian Coins</title>
<sec id="section15-1476993X12459634">
<title>Herod I (the Great)</title>
<p>Only in the waning years of the Hasmonean dynasty did Mattatayah Antigonus (40–37 <sc>bce</sc>) reclaim both titles of king and high priest, as reflected on his coins (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1162-1168). This took place just before Herod I was named King of the Jews by the Roman Senate in 40 <sc>bce</sc>.</p>
<p>The life and times of Herod I (40/37 <sc>bce</sc> to 4 <sc>bce</sc>) have been the focus of a great deal of interest due not only to his accomplishments, but his proximity as King of Judaea when Jesus was born. Recent volumes about Herod’s life and his building projects abound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1476993X12459634">Richardson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476993X12459634">Kokkinos 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1476993X12459634">Roller 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1476993X12459634">Lichtenberger 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1476993X12459634">Netzer 2001</xref>). Herod was a great politician, convincing the Roman Senate and the triumvirate to name him king, even though Mattathayah Antigonus was already king on the ground. In 37 <sc>bce</sc> with support from the Roman general C. Sosius, Herod besieged Jerusalem and captured it, along with Antigonus and his Parthian sponsors. Herod was a great builder and his projects included the structural enlargement of the Temple Mount and rebuilding of the Second Temple, his palace complex at Herodium, and the magnificent port of Caesarea Maritima. Herod also sponsored important construction in Tripolis, Damascus, Ptolemais, Byblos, Berytus, Tyre, Sidon, Ascalon, Lycia, Samos and Ionia (<italic>B.J.</italic> i.426-428). Herod sponsored athletic contests and built venues for them; on a visit to Rome in either 18 or 12 <sc>bce</sc> he was made president of the Olympic Games. Herod’s subjects were heavily taxed to finance his building projects (<italic>Ant</italic>. xvi.149). Herod was also greatly paranoid. He had many of his immediate family members murdered, including his wife the Hasmonean princess Mariamne (in 30/29 <sc>bce</sc>) and his two sons by Mariamne, Antipater and Aristobulus, father of the future Agrippa I (<italic>B.J</italic>. i.664). These executions eliminated every member of the Hasmonean family who might threaten Herod’s throne during his life. When Augustus heard about the sentences he reportedly said, ‘It is better to be Herod’s pig than his son’ (Macrobius, <italic>Saturnalia</italic> 2.4.11).</p>
<p>The title ‘the Great’ seems to be mainly a modern addition to Herod’s name. He is referred to this way only once in Josephus, in a genealogy where the word ‘great’ was clearly intended to designate him as the ‘first’ (<italic>Ant</italic>. xviii.130, 133, and 136). His coins never refer to him as ‘the great’, only as ‘King Herod’ (although his grandson Agrippa I is designated ‘the great’ on some of his coins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 232, nos. 121, 125).</p>
<p>Herod may have been ‘great’, but his ‘numismatic legacy is disappointing to say the least’, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12459634">Ariel and Fontanille (2012</xref>: 1). ‘Considering Herod’s larger-than life persona, most of his coinage is particularly unimpressive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12459634">Ariel and Fontanille 2012</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>In <italic>The Coins of Herod</italic>, Ariel and Fontanille provide the most thorough analysis of Herod’s coinage undertaken. It includes a die study based upon examination of 2,504 specimens.</p>
<p>Only bronze coins were minted under Herod, a clear reflection of his status as a ‘client king’ of Rome, which retained the right to mint gold and silver coins. Herod’s coins were issued sporadically and were mostly poorly designed and manufactured. Herod’s coins did, however, avoid the use of graven images. This catered to his local population by depicting motifs such as anchors, cornucopias, tripod tables, and various plant species. Some of Herod’s designs were taken from Roman coins, such as the helmet, shield, aphlaston and winged caduceus, but it is likely that they were not fully understood as Roman symbols by Herod’s subjects, and thus did not offend them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12459634">Ariel and Fontanille 2012</xref>: 101). One of Herod’s coins depicts an eagle, which may have represented the eagle he ordered placed over the Temple gate (<italic>Ant</italic>. xvii.151).</p>
<p>Four denominational types of Herod’s coins were dated to the ‘year three’ probably referring to 37 <sc>bce</sc>, the third year of his official reign and his first year as king on the ground; none of his other coins were dated. Meshorer believed this series was struck in Samaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>); Ariel prefers Jerusalem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12459634">Ariel and Fontanille 2012</xref>: 92-95). The issue of mints is not yet fully understood, and the possibility exists that the Herodian as well as the Hasmonean coins were minted at multiple locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476993X12459634">Hendin and Bower 2011</xref>: 40).</p>
<p>A central reason for Herod to issue large numbers of bronze coins was the profit to be made from fiduciary coinage. However, facilitating commerce and trade and the propaganda/promotional aspect of coinage must be considered. Ariel and Fontanille believe that some of Herod’s coins may have been issued and used as handouts called <italic>congiarium</italic>, a form of largess often given by the Roman emperors. They might have been distributed to celebrate the entertainment structures or Herod’s founding and hosting of the quadrennial games in Jerusalem and in Caesarea, where games were instituted in 12 <sc>bce</sc> at Herod’s dedication festival for the city and its extravagant port. Herod also proclaimed an annual festival on the day he ascended as king, another logical time for gifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12459634">Ariel and Fontanille 2012</xref>: 26-27).</p>
<p>The <italic>donativum</italic> was a gift of money by rulers to soldiers in the legions. Ariel and Fontanille suggest that a <italic>donativum</italic> was likely to have been given just after Herod’s troops conquered Jerusalem in 37 <sc>bce</sc>, when the Romans began to plunder the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X12459634">Ariel and Fontanille 2012</xref>: 97). Sosius, their commander, was not inclined to stop them, but Herod finally agreed to ‘distribute rewards to each of them out of his own purse’, according to Josephus (<italic>Ant</italic>. xiv.485-486).</p>
<p>Establishing a chronology for the coins of Herod has been ‘one of the most intractable subjects of Jewish Numismatics’, according to M. Avi-Yonah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X12459634">Meyshan 1968</xref>: 10). Ariel has used archaeological, typological, epigraphical and other evidence to set forth a relative chronology of the coins of Herod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X12459634">Ariel 2000–2002</xref>: 123). He links some coins with specific events, such as his suggestion that Herod’s common anchor/cornucopias <italic>prutah</italic> (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1188) may have been issued to commemorate the dedication of Caesarea in 12 <sc>bce</sc> and, likewise, he links Herod’s anchor/galley coin (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1191) to the first use of Herod’s fleet in 14 <sc>bce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X12459634">Meyshan 1968</xref>: 58; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1476993X12459634">Richardson 1996</xref>: 213).</p>
<p>Until now there have been few chemical analyses performed on Herod I’s undated coins, although as early as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1476993X12459634">1927</xref> Reifenberg noted the analysis of a single coin using older, but quite accurate, methods. Recently I was part of a group that analyzed 78 coins, mostly undated coins of Herod I (and also dated coins bracketing his rule) using x-ray fluorescence (XRF) to determine major and trace elements, and by multi-collector inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry to obtain lead isotope analysis. Our study revealed declining amounts of arsenic in Judaean coins during the period 100 <sc>bce</sc> to 100 <sc>ce</sc>. This observation allowed us to review Ariel’s proposed relative chronology for Herod I’s undated coins. We attributed the loss of arsenic over time to two factors: re-smelting (a possible but not consistent variable) of bronze and to a changing pattern in local metal supplies, with copper alloys from Dead Sea Rift mines, where arsenic is mostly absent, replacing those from Cyprus, where arsenic can be measured in most samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476993X12459634">Hendin <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>: 97).</p>
<p>We concluded that ‘our data not only reinforces [Ariel’s] conjectural chronology of Herod I’s undated coins, it also provides further evidence that the Dead Sea Rift mines, such as Timna, and potentially Faynan, were in use during a period when they were previously thought to have been largely abandoned, well before the region was annexed by the Romans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476993X12459634">Hendin <italic>et al.</italic> 2011</xref>: 102).</p>

<title><italic>Shekels</italic> of Tyre</title>
<p>Tyrian <italic>shekels</italic> and half-<italic>shekels</italic> were prescribed as the coins of choice for payments to the Jerusalem Temple (Tosefta Ketubbot 13.20), including the half-<italic>shekel</italic> tribute that every Jewish male over age 20 was obliged to pay (Exod. 30.11-16; Mishnah Shekalim 2.4), individual contributions and vows, as well as the redemption price of the first-born, and the purchase of sacrificial offerings.</p>
<p>The coins of Tyre were so commonly used in Judaea during the first century that the Mishnah says that ‘Silver, whenever mentioned in the Pentateuch, is Tyrian silver. What is Tyrian Silver? It is a Jerusalemite’ (Tosefta Ketubbot 13.20). In recent excavations by Shukron and Reich in the main drainage channel of Jerusalem from the time of the Second Temple, a Tyre half-<italic>shekel</italic> dated 22 <sc>ce</sc> was discovered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early+History+-+Archaeology/Rare+ancient+coin+found+in+Jerusalem+excavations+19-Mar-2008.htm">http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early+History+-+Archaeology/Rare+ancient+coin+found+in+Jerusalem+excavations+19-Mar-2008.htm</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Why did the Jews feel comfortable using Tyre coinage that depicted the graven image of a pagan god to make their annual payments to the Temple? The Mishnah explains that valid money is not subject to being unclean, and it is only susceptible to uncleanliness when it is used for another purpose such as jewelry or a weight (Kelim 12.7). Since a viable coin cannot be defiled, the only relevance is its value and purity, not its design.</p>
<p>Tyre first began to issue autonomous silver coinage—<italic>shekels</italic> and half-<italic>shekels</italic> (infrequently also quarter-<italic>shekels</italic>)—after it was freed from Seleucid domination in 127/6 <sc>bce</sc>. As on the Seleucid coins, an eagle continued to appear on the reverse of these <italic>shekels</italic>, but the inscription no longer included the name of a king, which was replaced with the name and titles of the city: ‘of Tyre the holy and city of refuge’. The king’s portrait was replaced by the head of the city god, Herakles-Melqarth. A date, according to the era beginning in 127/6 <sc>bce</sc>, also appears.</p>
<p>Meshorer believed it was likely that from the year 108 of the Tyrian era (=19/18 <sc>bce</sc>), the Tyre <italic>shekels</italic> and half-<italic>shekels</italic> were struck in Jerusalem under the authority of Herod the Great, rather than the mint of Tyre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 73). Meshorer points out that in this year the coinage is first marked with a new monogram, KAP—actually appearing to be KP in most cases, and displays stylistic and technical differences from the earlier products of Tyre. Meshorer also notes that Tyre was severely punished by Augustus for the riots that occurred there in 20 <sc>bce</sc>, the year before the change in the appearance of the <italic>shekels</italic>, and also that these later <italic>shekels</italic> ceased with the onset of the Jewish War in 65/6 <sc>ce</sc>. He believed that this information pointed to Jerusalem as the originating mint for the ‘KP’ <italic>shekels</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 77).</p>
<p>Brooks Levy, curator of coins at Princeton University, has argued against Meshorer’s theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1476993X12459634">Levy 1993</xref>), and her ideas are widely accepted. Levy’s brief summary:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is unlikely that the Roman government would have countenanced the permanent transfer of a prestigious allied city’s coinage to the capital of Herod’s Judaea. Within the coin series itself there is no sign of a stylistic break at the proposed moment of transfer, nor of consistent and gradual later deterioration. Since it seems that users of the shekel became increasingly limited to those who paid the Temple tax, a concentration of find-spots in Judaea should not surprise us; but in fact the largest single find of late shekels—the Usfiye hoard, of over 4,000 pieces, closing in 53/54 <sc>ce</sc>—was buried much closer to Tyre than Jerusalem. Finally, the shekel of Israel differs in fabric from its Tyrian predecessor at least as much as it resembles it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1476993X12459634">Levy 2005</xref>: 889).</p>

<title>Herod Antipas (4 <sc>bce</sc>–37 <sc>ce</sc>)</title>
<p>When Herod I died, Archelaus (4 <sc>bce</sc>–6 <sc>ce</sc>) assumed control of his father’s government in Judaea, and the Jerusalem mint was probably part of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X12459634">Ariel 2000–2002</xref>: 109). Antipas, on the other hand, inherited a territory without much infrastructure; his new capital was Sepphoris, probably the only real town in his territories at the time. He rebuilt it ‘to be the ornament of all Galilee and called it Autocratoris’ (<italic>Ant</italic>. xviii.27). Several public structures had existed at Sepphoris for some time and were probably still in use when Antipas became Tetrarch. Eric Meyers has reported a fortified structure in Sepphoris, which appears to have been in use by ca. 100 <sc>bce</sc> judging by the coins, pottery and other late Hellenistic finds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1476993X12459634">Meyers 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Eventually Antipas began to devote his attention to the creation and ‘founding’ of a new city, Tiberias. He moved his capital there, and apparently founded the city between 17/18 and 20/21 <sc>ce.</sc> Avi Yonah explains that the actual event most probably took place in the year 18, which was not only the sixtieth birthday of Tiberius, but also the twentieth anniversary of his holding the Tribunicia Potestas. The year 18/19 <sc>ce</sc> was also the twenty-second year of the reign of Antipas as tetrarch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X12459634">Avi Yonah 1950</xref>: 168).</p>
<p>Meshorer expanded the number of known denominations and dates of Herod Antipas’ coins and described four denominations for each year he minted coins at Tiberius beginning in 20/21 <sc>ce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 84).</p>

<p>Until this new coin was discovered, the first coins known to be struck by Antipas were dated ‘Year 24’ (of Antipas’ reign) and thought to be struck in 20/21 <sc>ce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 81). Meshorer had attributed the delay in Antipas’ first coinage to the reality that he was ‘forced to establish an original basis for his administration; no previous governing system existed for his tetrarchy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 1982</xref>: 35). Antipas started with no government, little infrastructure and, ergo, no mint.</p>
<p>This coin sheds a different light on the situation and seems to prove that Herod Antipas did not wait 24 years to issue his first coinage. Since the coin is dated to the fourth year of his reign, it indicates that he likely struck at least a trial coinage at his first capital of Sepphoris. The coin itself was produced by the method and style of typical Jewish or procuratoral <italic>prutot</italic> of the period. The weight is consistent with <italic>prutot</italic> from the period of Herod Archelaus; the edges are beveled and it was clearly struck on a strip of cast flans, chopped away from coins on either side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2003–2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The palm-tree motif is not remarkable for Jewish coins. In 6/7 <sc>ce</sc>, only six years after its use on the coin under discussion, the palm tree appears on a coin of Coponius; it appears later on coins of the Jewish War, Bar Kokhba Revolt and in the Judaea Capta series, among others. However, this coin would mark the palm tree’s first appearance in the Judaean series. The grain of either barley or wheat is also not a surprising design for an ancient Jewish coin, although this coin is unique in its presentation of a single grain. Ears of grain appear on coins of the Hasmonean kings, Herod Philip, Agrippa I, Agrippa II and the procurators Coponius and M. Ambibulus.</p>

<p>Lönnqvist attempted to show that Agrippa II minted the very common series of bronze <italic>prutot</italic> dated to the year 6 (canopy/3 ears grain).

Furthermore, Epstein <italic>et al.</italic> studied this coin type using x-ray fluorescence and lead isotope ratios, and concluded that ‘the elemental isotope ratio, archaeological evidence, and numismatic data strongly support that these coins were minted by Agrippa I’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X12459634">Epstein <italic>et al.</italic> 2010</xref>: 390).

<title>Agrippa II (49/50–94/95 <sc>ce</sc>)</title>
<p>Among the great enigmas of Jewish numismatics has been to understand the multiple dating eras of the coins of Agrippa II. All of Agrippa II’s coins bear dates, many together with imperial portraits, but it has not been easy to understand the relative meaning of Agrippa’s eras. The problem is that two coins of Agrippa II are double-dated according to two distinct systems (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1278, 1279), discussed below. If those two dating eras are applied to all of Agrippa II’s coins as the principal eras, however, an illogical picture emerges, which means that the dating has not been correctly placed.</p>
<p>There has long been a consensus that multiple minting eras exist for Agrippa II. In an attempt to solve the mystery, Madden, in 1864, suggested four different dating eras that he applied to Agrippa II’s coins. In 1914, Hill rejected this and maintained a system based upon a single era beginning in 61 <sc>ce</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476993X12459634">Hill 1914</xref>: xcix). Meshorer suggested two eras, beginning in 56 and 61 <sc>ce (</sc><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref><sc>: 107)</sc>. Most recently, Alla Kushnir-Stein reviewed the history of this subject and proposed a logical new framework of eras (2002). Kushnir-Stein brings us to the conclusion that multiple eras are indeed appropriate for the coins of Agrippa II, and she has quantified them. She also concludes that ‘Coins dated by two different eras could have hardly been produced in the same place simultaneously’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1476993X12459634">Meshorer <italic>et al.</italic> 2013</xref> [in press]). Thus she suggests that different mints operated and produced similar coins at the same time, and each mint dated coins according to different regnal eras.</p>
<p>Kushnir-Stein believes that Agrippa II’s most logical era began in the year 49, ‘mentioned by Josephus in <italic>BJ</italic> 2.284. Josephus reported that the Jewish revolt began in the twelfth year of Nero and the seventeenth year of Agrippa, in the month of Artemisos. This means the spring of 66. Seyrig has [also] shown that the starting point of Agrippa’s era is the autumn of 49’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2002</xref>: 127). She adds that ‘Since one of the anachronistic coins features Pan, the tutelary deity of Caesarea Paneas, the era of 49 must belong to this city’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2002</xref>: 128).</p>
<p>This leads us back to Agrippa II’s two rare double-dated coins, which belong to this series. They both carry reverse inscriptions proclaiming ‘year 11 which is also year 6’. One coin was apparently struck in 60 <sc>ce</sc>, and thus corresponds to the era of 49 combined with a secondary local era of 54 <sc>ce</sc>. Kushnir-Stein explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When Agrippa was appointed king over Chalcis, there must have been a counting by his regnal years which started in 49/50. Josephus reports that, several years later, Claudius took Chalcis away from Agrippa, but gave him instead the former territories of Philip, Lysanias and Varus. When he moved into these new territories Agrippa may well have retained his earlier era, with an additional era, marking the beginning of his actual rule in these territories, being introduced as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2002</xref>: 128).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seems, then, that the small double-dated issues were the earliest coins bearing Agrippa II’s royal title, and the only coins referring to both the eras beginning in 49 <sc>ce</sc> and 54 <sc>ce</sc> with the possible exception of <italic>GBC</italic> No. 1280 which also may have been dated according to the era of 54 <sc>ce</sc>.</p>
<p>Kushnir-Stein further concludes that Agrippa II’s second major era began in 60/61, but ‘We do not know what exactly happened in the year 60/1’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2002</xref>: 129) although she suggests it might have been ‘a further enlargement of Agrippa’s kingdom by Nero’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2002</xref>: 129). If that was the case, ‘the coins of Agrippa dated by the era of 60 <sc>ce</sc> could thus have been struck in a place which came under his control in 60/1 <sc>ce</sc>… Agrippa’s father struck coins in Caesarea Paneas, Jerusalem, and Caesarea Maritima’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2002</xref>: 130).</p>
<p>Assuming that Kushnir-Stein has solved the problem of the dating, the next question takes us to the location of the mints. Agrippa II’s first mint has been established to be Caesarea Paneas based upon use of the Pan motif on an early Flavian medallion (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1281) and rare pseudo medallions (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1286) dated to years 26 and 27 of 49 <sc>ce.</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin (2010a)</xref> suggested that the medallions commemorated the inauguration of Agrippa II’s mint at Caesarea Paneas beginning in 74/75 <sc>ce</sc>, just a year following the fall of Masada.</p>
<p>One coin type of Agrippa I names the harbor of Caesarea Maritima (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1246, 1250), thus establishing that Agrippa II’s father operated a mint there. However, Andrew Burnett has observed that Caesarea Maritima was not part of Agrippa II’s kingdom, thus he may not have minted coins there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12459634">Burnett 2011</xref>: 124). Burnett further quotes Kushnir-Stein, who has been studying the find records of Agrippa II coins. She reported that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>according to the picture I get from the find spots of Agrippa II’s coins, the issues dated by the era of 60 <sc>ce</sc> emanate from Tiberias. This is certain at least for the dates 19, 24, and 25. These predominate in the Lower Galilee and especially around the Sea of Galilee. I have information on 32 coins of Agrippa II found in the Sea of Galilee Area (on the very coast and no more than some 10 km inland; the bulk comes from excavations), of which 26 are from these years. Among the latter, there are 10 coins of year 19, the two coins from Capernaum included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12459634">Burnett 2011</xref>: 124).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We further note three coins struck during Agrippa II’s pre-royal years, and dated to 53/54 <sc>ce</sc> were struck in Tiberias (<italic>GBC</italic> Nos. 1266-1268). Also, the first of Agrippa II’s coins that commemorate the Roman victory over the Jews (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1280) was struck in Tiberias. Moreover, the coin was dated to year 15, which might have related to 69/70 (according to the secondary era of 54 <sc>ce</sc>), when Jerusalem was destroyed, or to 74/75 <sc>ce</sc> (according to the era of 60 <sc>ce</sc>) the year after the absolute end of the war when Masada fell.</p>
<p>Kushnir-Stein has also pointed out that the style of the wreath on the reverse of <italic>GBC</italic> No. 1316 is nearly identical to the wreath styles of coins of Herod Antipas (Kushnir-Stein, personal communication 2012), as well as the pre-royal issues. This confluence of data seems to strongly support the identification of Tiberias as Agrippa II’s second mint.</p>
<p>In the same article in which Burnett discusses the Tiberias mint, he has discussed in detail the coin struck under Agrippa II with a female head and the title CEBACTH (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1314) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1476993X12459634">Figure 12</xref>). Burnett reevaluates this coin, struck in year 19 of Agrippa II’s era beginning in 60 <sc>ce</sc>, which translates to 78/79 <sc>ce</sc>. That was the year that Agrippa and his sister Berenice sailed to Rome in anticipation of her marriage to Titus that never materialized due to protests from the Roman Senate.</p>

<p>Previously the most common suggestions for the identity of this woman have been Livia, Nero’s wife, or Berenice, Agrippa II’s sister who came very close to marrying Titus. Maltiel-Gerstenfeld had suggested Berenice, and proposed that the coin was struck in Agrippa II’s territories ‘in anticipation of the forthcoming marriage and elevation of Berenice to the status of CEBACTH’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1476993X12459634">Maltiel-Gerstenfeld 1980</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>Burnett argues that this identification is ‘extremely unlikely’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12459634">Burnett 2011</xref>: 122). He adds that Livia would also be an unlikely choice, since Livia was the wife of Augustus, and such a late portrait of her would be most unusual.</p>
<p>He proposes, however, that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Given the hierarchical nature of the coinage, one might then suppose that the Sebaste of our coin was none other than Julia the daughter of Titus, who appears precisely at this time on the coinage of Rome with the title Augusta… Her appearance would complete the imperial ‘family set’ appearing on the coinage of Agrippa at the very beginning of Titus’ own reign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12459634">Burnett 2011</xref>: 123).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The reason that the earlier attributions have continued to be used is based ‘presumably on the principle that “numismatics abhors a vacuum”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12459634">Burnett 2011</xref>: 123). He concludes that ‘we can, and should, confidently banish Agrippa’s sister Berenice from the numismatic literature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X12459634">Burnett 2011</xref>: 125).</p>

<title>Prefect and Procurator Coins</title>
<p>An editorial by Alla Kushnir-Stein in <italic>INR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2007</xref>) suggests a new way to classify the coins of the prefects and procurators of Judaea. These local governors ruled in Judaea from 6 to 66 <sc>ce</sc>, except for a gap between 41 and 44 <sc>ce</sc> during the reign of Agrippa I (37–44 <sc>ce</sc>).</p>
<p>Most numismatic references refer to these governors as procurators, but it has been long known that the early Roman governors, during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, were called prefects, while during the reign of Claudius and Nero they were called procurators. For the purpose of this article we will refer to them as the ‘early Roman governors of Judaea’.</p>
<p>Partial proof of their titles is based upon a stone discovered in Caesarea by Italian archaeologists in 1961. The stone, usually on display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem (with a facsimile on display at the archaeological park in Caesarea) is inscribed with the name of Pontius Pilate with the title PRAEFECTVS IVDAEAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X12459634">Frova 1961</xref>. Israel Museum Inventory AE 1963 no. 104).</p>
<p>One reason for a special interest in the coins of these governors is that their years of rule overlapped with the life and ministry of Jesus, including the time of his death and the years following. These were formative years for Christianity, and many of the local Roman governors played significant roles. None of these coins bears the names of those governors. Instead they name the current Roman emperor at whose pleasure the prefects and procurators served, the regnal year in which the coin was issued, and often the names of other members of the Roman Imperial family.</p>
<p>The names of the governors are known to us primarily from the writings of Josephus. Current numismatic references, and those going back more than 100 years, refer to these coins according to the names of the early Roman governors of Judaea under whom they were believed to have been issued. Thus we list them as coins of Coponius, Marcus Ambibulus, Valerius Gratus, Pontius Pilate, Antonius Felix and Porcius Festus.</p>
<p>However, Kushnir-Stein points out that ‘if a coin is placed under a heading that includes…two basic components—the emperor’s name and the year of his rule—it is easy to identify it immediately. Moreover, these components correspond to what one actually sees on a coin, with no speculative elements involved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2007</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>Kushnir-Stein adds:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Josephus gives few precise chronological indications about the periods of tenure of most of the governors involved, and the exact years of their comings and goings remain very unclear. For instance, the coin dated to ‘year 5’ of Nero (58/9), often appearing under the name of Festus, has an equal, if not greater chance of having been struck under that official’s predecessor, Antonius Felix.</p>
<p>Another example is the issue under the emperor Augustus dated ‘year 39’. If counted by a proper era—that of autumn 31 <sc>bce</sc>—this issue belongs to 8/9 <sc>ce</sc>. Josephus tells us in a casual manner that there were three governors under Augustus—Coponius, Marcus Ambibulus and Annius Rufus—and that the emperor died during the administration of Rufus. He further adds that Augustus’ successor, Tiberius, dispatched Valerius Gratus to replace Rufus. We have no proper knowledge of when each of these governors replaced another, and most of the dates appearing in scholarly literature are no more than conjecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1476993X12459634">Kushnir-Stein 2007</xref>: 4).</p>

<title>The Jewish Wars</title>
<p>Both important similarities and differences exist between the coins of the Jewish War (66–73 <sc>ce</sc>) and the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–135 <sc>ce</sc>). But the coins of these two Jewish Wars against Rome contrast dramatically to all three series of Judaean coins that preceded them.</p>
<p>Based on these differences, one might be tempted to observe that the coinage of the two wars was the only fully realized independent Jewish coinage in ancient times. Conception, creation and circulation of these coins during the periods of the two wars were unique human achievements for a small, backwater nation of the ancient world.</p>
<p>The reasons to mint coins in antiquity were varied and are not fully understandable from a modern perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X12459634">Howgego 1990</xref>). Yet LeRider identifies two primary motivations for producing coinage: military payments and generating a profit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1476993X12459634">Le Rider 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1476993X12459634">1989</xref>: 159-72), as discussed earlier.</p>
<p>But the need for coins went well beyond economics; they advanced political ideas. As Van Alfen notes, once coins became struck objects rather than chopped fragments, ‘the monetary instrument could now advance upon levels of political symbolism that were unattainable with anonymous bits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1476993X12459634">Van Alfen forthcoming</xref>). This is especially relevant to coinage of the Jewish Wars, since there were both political and religious issues to be considered (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2007–2008</xref> for discussion of these matters). As Mildenberg has noted, coins were ‘the best mass media of the time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1476993X12459634">Mildenberg 1984</xref>: 72).</p>
<p>Because neither Seleucids nor Romans had previously allowed the Jews to issue silver coins, the autonomous series of silver coins of the Jewish War against Rome made a major political statement—‘an ostentatious demonstration of the recovery of independence’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1476993X12459634">Roth (1962</xref>: 34), who suggests the minting of coins by an autonomous Jewish government ‘was a religious as well as a patriotic necessity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1476993X12459634">Roth 1962</xref>: 33).</p>
<p>The Yehud and Samaritan coins of the Persian to the Macedonian periods are particularly interesting because of their lack of Jewishness. These were mainly copied from contemporary Greek coins—Cilician, Sidonian and Athenian—and are probably Satrapal issues and local mint Ptolemaic coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X12459634">Barag 1994–1999</xref>).</p>
<p>During the Hellenistic period in Judaea it was a royal prerogative to issue coins, and this grant was made to the Jews by Antiochus VII (1 Macc. 16.6). Thus Maccabean coins often use Greek legends along with the paleo-Hebrew, and while they do not display graven images, they continue to copy symbols from Greek coinage. The single exception is the chauvinistic coin of Mattatayah Antigonus that depicts two objects from the Temple, the showbread table and the menorah (<italic>GBC</italic> No. 1168). Herodian coins carry exclusively Greek legends; the early coins rarely use graven images, although many of them carry images that may have had specific meanings to the Romans which were not fully understood by the Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X12459634">Ariel 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At the time of the Jewish War there were many silver coins of Tyre as well as Seleucid, Ptolemaic and Roman coins in wide circulation in the area (<italic>BJ</italic> v.421 and 550-52) not to mention many small bronze coins from Hasmonean and Herodian times, and from the Roman governors of Judaea (prefects and procurators). Robert Deutsch suggested that the Jewish War silver coins were made from melted and further purified Tyre <italic>shekels</italic> that came from the Temple treasury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X12459634">Deutsch forthcoming</xref>, and personal communications). Thus the Jewish War silver coins did not offer the manufacturers as much profit as might have been realized.</p>
<p>Rappaport believes that the silver coinage of the Jewish War was ‘first and foremost minted to provide for the Temple’s expenditures for provisions and maintenance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1476993X12459634">Rappaport 2007</xref>: 104). He believes that the high priests and rich nobles were acting as if they supported the revolt in order to attempt to avoid what they believed would be a hopeless confrontation with Rome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1476993X12459634">Rappaport 2007</xref>: 104).</p>
<p>Religious necessity for the Jewish War silver, however, is not clear. There was ample coinage in circulation and available in the Temple treasury, including the <italic>shekels</italic> and half-<italic>shekels</italic> of Tyre that had been collected for many decades (Exod. 30.11-16; Mishnah Shekalim 2.4; Tosefta Ketubbot 13.20). This suggests that the Jewish War silver coins were intended to send the dramatic message of independence not only to Rome but to the local Jewish population. Paying for commodities (sacrificial animals, wine, incense, olive oil, wheat and related products) and services (craftsmen and other workers) required by the Temple was an excellent method of moving the newly made coins into circulation.</p>
<p>No political or religious authority is named on the coins of the Jewish War. Reference to ‘Jerusalem’ on these coins is likely a reference to the place of minting. Since the Jewish War was chaotic and factious from its outset, it is remarkable that the Jews were able to create consistently high quality coins. The anonymity of the minting authority suggested a Jewish national unity that simply did not exist on the ground since there were several factions of Jews, some diametrically opposed to each other.</p>
<p>Coins of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, on the other hand, were commonly struck with the name ‘Simon’ referring to Bar Kokhba, who styled himself <italic>Nasi Y’srael</italic>. Another name, ‘Eleazar the Priest’, occasionally has been suggested as being one of the minting authorities, or a colleague of Bar Kokhba. In a forthcoming article I explore my suggestion that Eleazar the Priest was not a living person during the Bar Kokhba war, but a messianic and heroic reference to Eleazar the Priest, son of Aaron, a man of legend, whose name was known by every Jew of the time. Eleazar the Priest was at Joshua’s side when he crossed the Jordan River to conquer Canaan. Eleazar the Priest’s persona was directly related to various aspects of Bar Kokhba’s cause: first to redeem Jerusalem, second to rebuild the Temple, and finally, at least in the eyes of his early Rabbinic loyalists, to show himself as the Messiah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476993X12459634">Hendin forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>Another significant difference between the coins of the two Jewish Wars and the earlier Jewish coins is the naming of the land in which these coins were struck. Coins of the Persian through the Ptolemaic periods refer to the area as ‘Yehud’ or ‘Yehudah’, the name of the Persian satrapy harkening back to the Iron Age name Yehudah. The Hasmonean coins refer to the ‘High Priest and the Council of the Jews (or Judaeans)’.</p>
<p>Why, then, do the coins of the Jewish War, and later the Bar Kokhba Revolt, name the native land of the Jews as ‘Israel’ instead of ‘Judaea’?</p>
<p>The term Israelites (or Children of Israel) refers to the descendants of Jacob, later named Israel. More generally it also refers to the worshippers of the god of Israel, irrespective of their ethnic origin. On the other hand, Judaeans are a specific group who lived in Judaea, who were not the same as other Jewish geographic groups of the time, such as the Galileans.</p>
<p>One may also surmise that at this time there was an effort to be inclusive for all Jews, some of whom may have identified with the ten lost tribes that disappeared from biblical accounts after the return of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin from Babylon.</p>
<p>Goodblatt discusses uses of ‘Judaea’ and ‘Israel’ and relates the coins to literature of the first and second centuries. He wonders if the later preference of Israel over Judaea could ‘reflect an attempt to differentiate the rebel regime(s) from the Hasmonean-Herodian state “of the Judaeans,” or from the Roman province of Iudaea? Certainly the rebels would want to emphasize the discontinuity with the Imperial provincial structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476993X12459634">Goodblatt 2006</xref>: 137). He further observes that ‘Rabbinic materials emerge as a literature beginning in the late first century. The earlier strata of rabbinic literature thus reinforce the preference for an Israel nationalism evidenced among the rebels of 66 and 132’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476993X12459634">Goodblatt 2006</xref>: 139).</p>
<p>Goodman suggests that perhaps the Jews rejected the name ‘Judaea’ simply because it was the name used by Rome to refer to their province (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476993X12459634">Goodman 2005</xref>: 166). One also notes that by the time of the two Jewish Wars, significant communities of Jews had been established in foreign capitals such as Alexandria (<italic>Ant.</italic> 15.113), Antioch (<italic>Ant</italic>. 12.119-120), Sidon (<italic>Ant</italic>. 14.323) and Tyre (<italic>Ant.</italic> 14.314). It is therefore possible that the use of the broader term of ‘Israel’ for the physical state being sought by the rebels was intended to differentiate from ‘Jews’ or ‘Judaeans’ who no longer lived in the area, but belonged to the rapidly growing Jewish Diaspora that increasingly supported Jewish activity in and around Jerusalem. For additional recent scholarship on the terms ‘Jews’ and ‘Judaeans’ (and ‘Judaism’) see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1476993X12459634">Miller 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X12459634">2012</xref>.</p>
<p>Precise wording in the legends and selection of the images on the coins of the Jewish Wars suggests that the leaders had a clear understanding of how to use coins for political communication.</p>

<p>Even though the striking of Jewish silver <italic>shekels</italic> was revolutionary, their legends were rather generic. Without reference to any specific issuing authority, they could be embraced by all of the Jews, whether they were pro-peace, zealots or middle-of-the-road.</p>
<p>The slogans on the lower value coins differed in tone. Huge numbers of bronze <italic>prutot</italic> were dated to the second and third years of the war, and each carried the words, ‘for the freedom of Zion’. The larger denomination bronze issues are inscribed ‘for the redemption of Zion’. These are perhaps the earliest recorded Zionistic slogans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 348).</p>
<p>By the fourth year, Jerusalem was under siege by Titus. Vespasian had ascended to the throne in Rome and the tide had turned dramatically against the Jews. At this time, the legends and the nature of the Jewish bronze coins had changed. These larger denominations, with the words ‘half’ and ‘quarter’, seem to be fiduciary fractions of silver <italic>shekels.</italic> The slogan, ‘freedom of Zion’, is replaced by ‘redemption of Zion’.</p>
<p>Roth points out that the slogan change in the fourth year was ‘certainly not accidental [and] may well reflect the fresh political circumstances of this time, for Simon bar Giora had by now entered Jerusalem and established his supremacy there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1476993X12459634">Roth 1962</xref>: 43). It is also possible that the change in language reflects the Jewish insurgents’ realization that they would soon be defeated by the Roman war machine. Hence, the change in tone from the call for physical ‘freedom’ from oppression versus ‘redemption’ or ‘salvation’, which has a more spiritual tone.</p>
<p>Goldstein and Fontanille observe that ‘freedom does not necessarily imply confrontation and can conceivably be obtained by mutual consent, possibly as a result of negotiation, whereas redemption denotes salvation or a forced release from a status of war and oppression’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476993X12459634">Goldstein and Fontanille 2006</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>Absence of the word ‘Zion’ on the Bar Kokhba coins, discussed further below, suggests it may have referred to the Temple, which no longer existed. Zion is completely replaced by ‘Israel’ or ‘Jerusalem’, as in ‘for the redemption of Israel’ and ‘for the freedom of Jerusalem’. References to Jerusalem express desires to regain the city, but there is no evidence that Bar Kokhba succeeded at any point in the war. In controlled excavations in Jerusalem, scores of thousands of coins have been found, but among them were only four coins of Bar Kokhba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X12459634">Ariel 1982</xref>: 293).</p>
<p>Both series of Jewish War coins used similar forms of the paleo-Hebrew script from the Iron Age. As discussed above, it had been essentially discontinued several hundred years earlier and ‘saw only very limited use in the Maccabean age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X12459634">Kanael 1963</xref>: 44). Also significant is the consensus that ‘Judaean society in antiquity was no more literate than the surrounding cultures. In other words, the vast majority of Judaeans were illiterate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476993X12459634">Goodblatt 2006</xref>: 33). Thus the majority of Jews were not likely to have read the Aramaic (square Hebrew) letters any more easily than the obsolete paleo-Hebrew (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X12459634">Harris 1989</xref>: 327 for a discussion of literacy in the ancient world).</p>
<p>However, inability to read the coins need not have reduced the efficacy of the transmission of messages. Considering the strong Jewish oral traditions, it is possible that the coins provoked patriotic discussion among the rebels. One can imagine a Jewish rebel passing along a coin and saying: ‘Look, it is written in the language of King David, do you know what it says? “For the freedom of Zion”.’ Now the coin and the verbal legend, playing on tales of the glorious, distant past, could pass from hand to hand into every corner of Judaea where the rebels carried on their lives.</p>
<p>Language, of course, is not the only way to communicate; symbols and images can be equally effective, such as the portraits of Roman emperors on their coins which circulated to the far reaches of the empire and made impressions upon even those who could not read. This could not occur on Judaean coins, because of the admonition against graven images that was strictly observed at this time.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier Jewish coins, virtually all of the symbols on coins struck during both Jewish Wars against Rome go well beyond simply using inoffensive motifs. They are overtly Jewish, and refer to two basic themes: the Jerusalem Temple, and the popular festival of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>
<p>While the manufacturing of the coins of the two Jewish Wars were not similar to each other, both are unusual when compared to other contemporary coinages. Precise manufacturing was a hallmark of the Jewish War silver coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476993X12459634">Goldstein and Fontanille 2006</xref>: 17). They were uniform in weight, purity, shape, and striking. Engraving of the dies was the best in the history of Judaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1476993X12459634">Roth 1962</xref>: 40).</p>
<p>This is remarkable considering the ongoing civil war and changes among Jerusalem’s Jews, which was certainly not consistent with the stable minting of coins for five years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1476993X12459634">Rappaport 2007</xref>: 103). Both the Tyre and Jewish War <italic>shekels</italic> are between 96 and 98 percent silver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X12459634">Deutsch forthcoming</xref>).</p>

<title>Minters and Motifs</title>
<p>There has been a long discussion of who minted the coins of the Jewish War and where they were minted. Rappaport believes that the silver coins were minted in the Temple area, directed by Temple officials sympathetic to the Zealots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1476993X12459634">Rappaport 2007</xref>). He further suggests that Simon bar Giora’s party most likely minted the bronze coins, whose slogans ‘represent a more radical ideology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1476993X12459634">Rappaport 2007</xref>: 111) than the silver coins.</p>
<p>The Jewish War coins were struck with symbols referring primarily to the festival of Sukkot. Romanoff suggested that the chalice depicted on the obverse of the silver <italic>shekels</italic>, half-<italic>shekels</italic> and quarter-<italic>shekels</italic> and the small bronze of the fourth year was actually an Omer cup (Romanoff 1944: 22). Earlier descriptions of this cup suggested it was related to drinking wine, but Romanoff argues, ‘It is doubtful whether or not the vessel was a drinking cup. The dotted [beaded] border would make drinking almost impossible. The cup, “<italic>kos</italic>”, in the Temple was used for sacrificial blood; while the drinking of wine in the Temple was forbidden, and…the Jewish coins do not contain any symbol of blood sacrifices’ (Romanoff 1944: 22).</p>
<p>On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476993X12459634">Goldstein and Fontanille (2006)</xref> point out that an Omer cup is not described in any ancient sources, and believe it is equally likely that this is a generic Temple chalice, perhaps a chalice offering salvation (Ps. 116.13). In either case we note that this chalice with a beaded rim is the only design that is repeated on both the silver and the bronze coins of the Jewish War.</p>
<p>The grouping of three pomegranate buds also shown on the silver <italic>shekels</italic> and half-<italic>shekels</italic> has often been described as hanging on a sprig or stem (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 240, No. 183). Deutsch, however, asserts that this symmetrical object more likely represents a man-made staff, ‘such an artifact matches a sacred object, a staff used by the high priests in the Temple and explains its appearance on the silver coins. Therefore the staff is likely to represent the minting authority, which is the high priesthood or the Temple as an institution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X12459634">Deutsch forthcoming</xref>, and personal communications).</p>
<p>An ivory pomegranate, possibly part of a similar staff, inscribed ‘[Belonging] to the Temple of [Yaweh], consecrated to the priests’ in paleo-Hebrew script was purchased by the Israel Museum in the 1980s. In 2005 a committee of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Israel Museum found the pomegranate to be ancient, but the inscription to be a modern addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476993X12459634">Goren <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). However, in 2008, Prof Yitzhak Roman, former academic director of Hebrew University’s scanning electron microscope (SEM), examined the pomegranate under SEM and concluded that the inscription was genuine and original to the pomegranate. (For a summary of Roman’s report as well as the original Hebrew text and an English translation see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bib-arch.org/news/news-ivory-pomegranate.asp">http://www.bib-arch.org/news/news-ivory-pomegranate.asp</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Deutsch reported on an undated <italic>prutah</italic> of the Jewish War and concluded it was struck during the first year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X12459634">Deutsch 1992–1993</xref>), which expands the bronze coinage to four years rather than three.</p>
<p>Syon reported on the bronze coins struck at Gamla, designed to resemble the silver <italic>shekels</italic> of Jerusalem. Seven examples were discovered in excavations at Gamla. All were struck from the same obverse die and two reverse dies (Syon 1992–93 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1476993X12459634">2007</xref>). The crudeness of the paleo-Hebrew and Aramaic inscriptions makes the Gamla coins difficult to read. Meshorer read the inscriptions ‘for the redemption’ and ‘holy Jerusalem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 244). Farhi later read the obverse as ‘Gamla [year] 2’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X12459634">Farhi 2003–2006</xref>: 69-76). Most recently Sahuri read the coin as Aramaic with obverse ‘to the freedom’ and reverse ‘y[ear] of the Jewish people’ (Sahuri cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 364).</p>

<sec id="section24-1476993X12459634">
<title>Bar Kokhba (132–135 <sc>ce</sc>)</title>
<p>Bar Kokhba did not have the benefit of an existing infrastructure, so his government improvised and struck ALL of their coins, both bronze and silver, upon Greek and Roman coins. This unusual system caused the full range of Judaean coin denominations to change, now the Jewish silver coins are all the size of Roman tetradrachms, denarii or drachms and the bronze coins appear in large, medium and small denominations consistent with the coins circulating in the area at the time. The Bar Kokhba coins are unique in another way; they are apparently the only coins struck that did not add fiduciary value upon manufacture, since it actually cost the government more to take them from circulation, to re-strike them and re-introduce them than the circulating value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Some Bar Kokhba coins were saved by patriotic Jews for many years and used as jewelry or even carefully collected as worthless tokens and kept together with one’s greatest wealth. A Bar Kokhba coin hoard, found in a pottery oil lamp, was buried no earlier than 151/152 <sc>ce</sc>. This hoard contained Roman gold (4) and silver coins (5) but also a clearly selected set of seven Bar Kokhba bronze coins that had been invalidated in 135 <sc>ce</sc>, more than 15 years earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2000–2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The coins of the two Jewish Wars against Rome were rooted in the Jewish desire for an autonomous nation. Political, religious and economic elements all played roles in the creation of these coinages. There are significant differences between the coins of the two Jewish Wars and all Jewish coinage that preceded them. After studying the slogans, imagery and extensive manufacture of these coins during difficult times, we conclude that the principal motives behind them were political and psychological—to make bold statements of Jewish sovereignty, in spite of a less than clear reality.</p>
<p>Contrarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 2001</xref>: 137), we also believe that the Bar Kokhba coins were struck mostly upon circulating Roman or provincial coins because they were most readily available, and not as a significant part of the political statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For more than 150 years numismatists who examined coins of the Jewish War and the Bar Kokhba War have speculated that the Bar Kokhba minters had access to the Jewish War coins. This was suggested by the paleo-Hebrew script forms and the similar Zionistic slogans. But there was not a shred of archaeological evidence that this was the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1476993X12459634">Mildenberg 1984</xref>: 68). In other words, there has been no record of Jewish War coins found together with the Bar Kokhba coins at any archaeological sites in Israel or Jordan.</p>
<p>Recently, however, Zissu and colleagues excavated a Bar Kokhba period cave in the western Judaean hills. There they found three coin hoards—one was a combination of Roman gold and Bar Kokhba silver coins. The second was a group of 83 Bar Kokhba coins and a piece of a silver earring. The third, a smaller hoard, was the very first known discovery of a Jewish War coin together with Bar Kokhba coins and one Hasmonean <italic>prutah</italic>, thus proving suspicions that the wars, separated by 63 years, had a numismatic connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1476993X12459634">Zissu and Hendin 2012</xref>). Thus it is now proven that Bar Kokhba’s followers were well aware of the nature of the coins of the Jewish War. Furthermore they were also familiar with Hasmonean bronze coins!</p>
<p>This fresh evidence serves to solidify Goodman’s belief that the Bar Kokhba coins show a ‘clear desire to link their uprising with the revolt that ended in <sc>ad</sc> 70’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476993X12459634">Goodman 2005</xref>: 166).</p>

<sec id="section25-1476993X12459634">
<title>The Temple and Other Images</title>
<p>The most stunning motif on the coins of Bar Kokhba is the façade of a tetrastyle temple shown on the obverse of the large silver <italic>sela’im</italic> (<italic>tetradrachms</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1476993X12459634">Figure 14</xref>). Meshorer summarizes various proposals as to the identification of this structure, and concludes that it is ‘a schematic geometric shape representing the Temple to all who viewed it, but not the actual building’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1476993X12459634">Meshorer 1982</xref>: II, 140). Given historic descriptions of the Jerusalem Temple, however, it may be less schematic than Meshorer suggests. The Temple façade has a few variations on Bar Kokhba coins. The Temple was destroyed only around 60 years earlier, so stories and perhaps drawings of it were fresh. Today we are able to explain some of the motifs previously not fully understood.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1476993X12459634-fig12.tif"/></fig>
<p>The wavy line, cross or star above the Temple are not fanciful designs, but representations of objects. ‘A vine of gold stood over the entrance to the sanctuary. Those who wished to donate—a leaf, grape or cluster he would bring and hang it on her [on the vine]’ (Mishnah Midot 3.8). Thus we understand that initially only the vine was hung, and this is represented by the wavy line. The golden leaves and grapes were added as donations from the people, and, logically, cleared away from time to time to make room for new donations.</p>
<p>The Mishnah also tells us that, ‘Helena set a golden candelabra over the door of the Sanctuary’ (Yoma 3.10). This chandelier was a gift from Helena, queen of Adiabene, a converted Jew who visited Jerusalem and was buried there around 56 <sc>ce</sc>. Rabbinnic literature says that this candelabrum sparkled with rays and reflected light that could be seen from many places in Jerusalem. Thus there are two renditions of the object above the Temple—a cross or a star— but they both represent the artist’s interpretation of the twinkling chandelier (Goldstein cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 377-79).</p>
<p>Dan Barag suggests that the object between the central pair of columns is the showbread table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X12459634">Barag 1986</xref>: 217-22). Previously, Romanoff suggested it might be the Ark of the Covenant hidden by a veil, as described in Exod. 40.3 (Romanoff 1944: 40). Reifenberg suggested an Ark of the Torah with scrolls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1476993X12459634">Reifenberg 1947</xref>: 30-32). Mildenberg suggests that the object ‘resembles a chest with a semi-circular lid, seen from one of the small sides’, and sees a parallel between it and the Ark of the Covenant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1476993X12459634">Mildenberg 1984</xref>: 33-37).</p>
<p>The Ark of the Covenant, however, was not housed in the Second Temple. Romanoff points out that ‘it is quite possible because of inaccessibility for the laymen to the sanctuary, this fact was only known to the High Priests and a few others, the general belief being that the art was there’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1476993X12459634">Romanoff 1971</xref>: 41).</p>
<p>One may find an additional clue in the two staves used to carry the original ark, which ‘were not seen, but protruded through the curtain and looked like two woman’s breasts’ (B. Talmud Yoma 54a; Menachot 98b). Indeed the graphic image in the center of the Temple on Bar Kokhba’s <italic>sela’im</italic> has two points directly reminiscent of that description. This suggests the image of an idealized, rebuilt Temple containing the Ark that did not even exist in the Second Temple, consistent with Bar Kokhba’s messianic message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476993X12459634">Hendin forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>Goldstein believes that this part of the representation of the Temple may simply depict the sanctuary entrance, with a generic object inside. He also observes that the horizontal ladder-like object is not a balustrade or fence as some have suggested but represents the twelve steps leading up to the Temple that were described by both Josephus and in the Mishnah. ‘Not one of the dies recorded by Mildenberg depicts more than twelve steps’ (Goldstein cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2010a</xref>: 281).</p>
<p>Trumpets and several styles of lyres or harps are also shown on Bar Kokhba coins. The trumpets recall almost identical instruments depicted on the Arch of Titus as well as an inscription discovered on a stone block from the Jerusalem Temple, now in the Israel Museum, that declares, ‘To the place of trumpeting…to herald’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1476993X12459634">Mazar 1975</xref>: 138-39). The block, according to Mazar, had probably been a part of the parapet of the Temple, where, on the evening of Sabbath, ‘one of the Priests would ascend…and sound a trumpet to signal the advent of the holy day, and at sundown the process was repeated to announce its conclusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1476993X12459634">Mazar 1975</xref>: 138). Silver trumpets were also used during the Sukkot ceremonies in the Temple (Mishnah Sukkah 5.5).</p>
<p>Harps and lyres appear on both bronze and small silver Bar Kokhba coins. The harp, which has a sound box shaped like a skin bag (<italic>nevel</italic> in Hebrew, <italic>chelys</italic> in Greek), and the narrower lyre, with a chest-like sound box (<italic>kinor</italic> in Hebrew, <italic>kithara</italic> in Greek), have been associated with the Jewish religion and worship since ancient times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X12459634">Eshel 2007–2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The flagon and branch shown on numerous Bar Kokhba coins, previously seen as generic ritual objects, have been connected to Sukkot, by Yonatan Adler, who believes they represent</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the golden flagon used in the water libation ceremony performed on the Temple altar during the Feast of Tabernacles. The branch appearing to the side of this flagon, previously identified as a palm frond, should be recognized instead as a willow-branch, symbolizing the willow-branch ceremony that took place at the Temple altar in conjunction with the water libation ceremony…the numismatic evidence provided by the Bar Kokhba <italic>denarii</italic> is the only evidence of the willow-branch ritual outside of Rabbinic literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X12459634">Adler 2007–2008</xref>: 135).</p>
<p>In ancient times, the willow branch ritual was carried out daily in the Jerusalem Temple. The Talmud says: ‘There was a place below Jerusalem called Motsa. They went down to there, and collected young willow branches, and then came and set them upright along the sides of the altar, with their tops bent over the top of the altar. They then sounded a prolonged [trumpet] blast, a quavering note, and a prolonged blast’ (Mishnah Sukkah 5.5).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly the menorah motif is completely missing from the coins of both Jewish Wars. However, the most extensive use of the palm tree on ancient Jewish coinage occurs during the Bar Kokhba Revolt, and in almost every instance, even on the irregular coins, the palm tree is shown with seven branches. (This is also true for the palm tree on the bronze half-<italic>shekel</italic> of the Jewish War.) Possibly this form of the local date palm is a reference to the seven-branched menorah.</p>
<p>Mildenberg’s master work delineated the actual dies and die links of the vast majority of Bar Kokhba coins (1984). Kaufman published two supplements to Mildenberg’s book, listing additional dies for bronze and silver coins of all denominations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1476993X12459634">Kaufman 2000–2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476993X12459634">2007–2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Dan Barag showed that at least two mints operated during the Bar Kokhba revolt, one producing ‘regular’ coins and another producing the ‘irregular’ issues. Barag is quick to note that ‘in the eyes of the Greeks and Romans all Jewish coinage was no doubt considered “irregular coinage”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X12459634">Barag 2000–2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We published an unusual bronze test strike of a Bar Kokhba silver <italic>zuz</italic> or <italic>drachm</italic> that offered additional insight into the Bar Kokhba minting operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X12459634">Hendin 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Barag reported on the geographic distribution of the sites where Bar Kokhba coins were found in archaeological excavations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X12459634">Barag 1980</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1476993X12459634">Zissu and Eshel (2002)</xref> dramatically expanded on Barag’s mapping, adding many coins and many sites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476993X12459634">Bijovsky (2004)</xref> expanded the territory further and discussed the distribution of these coins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476993X12459634">Amit and Bijovsky (2007)</xref> expanded the northwestern border a few kilometers more by reporting on Bar Kokhba coins found in excavations at Khirbet Zikhrin.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Excavation and study of the coins of ancient Judaea will no doubt continue by scholars around the world. Many concepts and theories discussed above may be altered or changed by new information gathered and evaluated over time. Perhaps in the future it will also be possible to solve some of the ongoing mysteries relating to this coinage, including: (1) Which authority issued the Yehud and Samarian coins? Exactly who are the individuals who are named on these coins? (2) Did any rulers between Alexander Jannaeus and Mattatayah Antigonus mint coins that copied the coins of Jannaeus? (3) What were the intended denominations of the dated coins of Herod I? Even though the Judaean bronze coins were fiduciary in nature, why did Herod issue coins of similar size, but half the weight, of the coins of Mattatayah Antigonus? (4) Where were the coins minted? How many mint locations existed? (5) Why were the dies for so many Hasmonean and Herodian coins created so much larger than the flans that they were to be struck upon? (6) Have we in fact now focused on the correct dating eras for the coins of Agrippa II? And at any rate, why did Agrippa II strike coins using two different dating eras? (7) The coins of the Jewish War against Rome (66–70 <sc>ce</sc>) do not contain the names of any issuing authorities. It is a consensus that the silver coins were struck in or near the Jerusalem Temple complex under the Temple authority. But, who struck the bronze <italic>prutot</italic> of the second and third years? Were they struck by the same authority that struck the bronze ‘siege’ coins of the fourth year? Were the coins of the Jewish War all struck at a single mint or were there two, possibly three mints? (8) Who was Eleazar the Priest, whose name appears on Bar Kokhba coins of the first year as well as rare, later hybrid issues?</p>
