<p>In this paper, the effects of the use of various aluminium materials as liner material in shaped charges for the perforation of concrete slabs are examined with numerical simulations. Using AUTODYN-2D software, formation of the shaped charge jets for seven different aluminium materials are modelled first and then these jets are directed to 35 MPa compressive strength concrete slabs. Those analyses are performed for a constant liner thickness which corresponds to 8% of the shaped charge diameter. Furthermore, the effect of standoff on the penetration of concrete slabs is examined by using shaped charges with the same geometry and liner material (7075-T6). The cone angle of the shaped charge is taken as 100°.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The shaped charge concept was first used by mine engineers in the late 1700s. During World War I the Germans started to use it as a means of destruction and, with the enhancements and modifications made during World War II, demolition of concrete walls and damaging armoured targets by means of small amount of explosive became possible. A shaped charge is simply composed of a primary explosive, a metal liner, a casing and a secondary explosive used for detonating the primary explosive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911410757">1</xref></sup> The explosive has a cavity in it which is confined to a metal liner, which may have different geometries such as a cone, hemisphere, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911410757">1</xref></sup> When the secondary explosive detonates the primary explosive, a high-speed spherical detonation wave emerges and propagates across the explosive. This wave may have a velocity of 5000–10,000 m/s, depending on the type of explosive. When the wave reaches the liner, there exists a sudden pressure increase in the outer surface (where the liner is contacted with the explosive) of the liner and this causes it to collapse perpendicularly to the face of the liner to its centreline. As a result of this process, the metal particles have high kinetic energy flow through the symmetry axis due to the symmetry of the liner. The formed jet at the end of this process, which has very high kinetic energy, is called the shaped charge jet. Although their velocity varies depending on the liner material and geometry, jet tip velocities may reach values of up to 10 km/s in different applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911410757">1</xref></sup> When encountered with a target, a shaped charge jet can penetrate into the target and create a deep hole due to its high kinetic energy. However, particulation occurs during the growth of the jet as a result of the velocity gradient on the jet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911410757">1</xref></sup> Alignment of the particles formed by this process is very important, since they need to follow each other in order to avoid sidewall collisions within the crater formed by preceding particles. In other words, the more the particulation grows, the greater the number of side collisions, which result in a decrease in the penetration depth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548512911410757">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512911410757">3</xref></sup> Therefore, the distance the jet travels before hitting the target is crucial in determining the penetration characteristics. This distance is called the standoff and in this paper it is specified in terms of the charge diameter (CD) of the shaped charge.</p>
<p>The use of shaped charge munitions was limited to armoured targets in the first place, yet they began to be used against concrete structures in the following years. Depending on the different targets, to acquire the desirable effect on the target, shaped charge design should be carried out accordingly. The material used for the metal liner and its correspondent geometry determines the characteristics of the jet, which has different effects on different targets. For instance, shaped charges with copper liners are generally used against steel armoured targets,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911410757">1</xref></sup> whereas shaped charges with aluminium liners, having a lower density, are preferred against concrete targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911410757">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548512911410757"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548512911410757">6</xref></sup> Moreover, the profile of the cavity formed in the target by different jets exhibits different characteristics. To illustrate, shaped charges with cupper liners generally penetrate deeper into the target, causing smaller diameter holes. On the other hand, shaped charges with aluminium liners create larger diameter but smaller hole depths in the same target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548512911410757">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There are plenty of parameters affecting the penetration depth caused by a shaped charge and the most important ones are as follows: geometry of the liner; type and amount of explosive; geometry and material of the casing; and the standoff distance. In this paper, a shaped charge with a cone liner having a cone angle of 100° and a constant liner thickness is taken into account. By altering the aluminium material types, simulations are carried out for concrete targets, which are located at different standoff distances.</p>

<sec id="section2-1548512911410757">
<title>2. Computational simulations</title>
<p>All the simulations are performed using AUTODYN-2D with axial symmetric models. As the computational solver, the Eulerian approach is preferred. In Eulerian mesh system, cells are stationary in space and material flows through the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548512911410757">8</xref></sup> Moreover, solvers using the Eulerian approach give more reliable results where extreme deformations are observed, as in the case of a shaped charge jet formation process. The strain value may increase up to 10 mm/mm during this jet formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911410757">1</xref></sup> Therefore, a solver using the Eulerian approach has been chosen in order to obtain more reliable results. Due to the fact that jet formation and penetration are non-linear problems, the AUTODYN solvers use explicit methods in the computations.</p>
<p>In the modelling phase of the analysis, the region where the major deformation takes place, which is the metal liner, is modelled with small-sized elements (0.5 mm × 0.5 mm), whereas larger sized meshes are preferred (1 mm × 0.5 mm) for the rear part of the shaped charge. In the transition region, 0.75 mm × 0.5 mm elements are used in order to reduce the computation time. All the elements modelled in the meshing phase are perpendicular to each other. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512911410757">Figure 1</xref> shows the grid used in the simulations.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548512911410757">Figure 2</xref> shows the shaped charge model used in the simulations. Seven different aluminum liners are used in the simulations. Among them, six have different compositions and five have different heat treatment characteristics. The following metals are used in the simulations: Al 1100-O, Al 2024-T351, Al 2024-T4, Al 5083-H116, Al 6061-T6, Al 7039 and Al 7075-T6. Liner thickness of the shaped charge has been taken as 8% of the CD and the cone angle is kept constant at 100°. In the simulations, standoff values are taken as 1 and 2 CD for all materials. The L/D (length over diameter) ratio of the shaped charge is taken as 1.5. The explosive material is C4 and the casing material is polycarbon. As the target material, concrete having an ultimate compressive strength of 35 MPa is selected.</p>

<title>3. Results</title>
<p>Simulations are carried out without the target in order to observe the free formation of jets for longer distances. After the tip of the jet reaches the desired standoff value, the jet is remapped to a new model containing the target in order to reduce the computation time. This method is applied since the mesh resolution used for the jet formation is finer. If the target is modelled using the same mesh resolution, the number of cells exceeds the desired level, which in turn increases the computational time. Therefore the jet, which has fine mesh, is remapped to a new model after it has formed a new shape as it continues to elongate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548512911410757">Figure 3</xref> reveals two sample jets formed at 1 and 2 CD standoff distances.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548512911410757-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>After remapping, simulations are concluded when the jet inside the concrete loses the majority of its kinetic energy. In other words, simulations are continued until the jet particles erode in the target or their velocities decrease to a negligible value. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911410757">Figure 4</xref> unveils a sample simulation with 1 CD standoff distance.</p>

</fig>
<p>For the 1 CD standoff distance simulations, while remapping the formed jet, explosive is remapped along with the jet, since it still contributes to the jet’s kinetic energy to some extent. On the other hand, for the 2 CD standoff distance simulations, while remapping the formed jet, explosive is not transferred to the new model due to the fact that it no longer increases the kinetic energy of the jet significantly. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1548512911410757">Figure 5</xref> shows a sample simulation with 2 CD standoff distance.</p>

<p>The penetration depth obtained for the 1 and 2 CD models corresponding to different aluminium liner materials are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1548512911410757">Figure 6</xref> in terms of the CD of the shaped charge. As can be understood from the figure, increasing the standoff corresponds to a much greater increase in penetration depth compared to using different liner materials. It can also clearly be seen that for both 1 and 2 CD standoff distances the difference between penetration depths belonging to different aluminium liners is small. Therefore, it is concluded that using different aluminium liners for the purpose of concrete penetration does not affect penetration depth as much as changing the standoff distance does.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548512911410757-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In order to investigate the relation between penetration depth and the standoff distance, a shaped charge with a 7075-T6 aluminium liner with the same configuration as the previous study is modelled. The concrete target is placed between 1 and 5 CD distances away from the shaped charge. For this type of application, 5 CD standoff is assumed to be the upper value and, therefore, higher standoff distances are not considered. When the standoff distance exceeds a certain value, due to the high velocity gradient on the jet, it begins to particulate. When the particulation occurs penetration decreases. Therefore, it is expected that the penetration increases up to the optimum standoff distance, but it starts to decrease as the standoff distance is increased beyond its optimum value. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1548512911410757">Figure 7</xref>, penetration depths belonging to correspondent standoff distances are shown. No decrease was observed in the penetration depth up to 5 CD standoff distance. Therefore, for the 1–5 CD standoff range for this particular case, increasing the standoff distance enhances the penetration. This figure reveals that the optimum standoff distance for the shaped charge is greater than 5 CD.</p>

<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>Simulations show that changing the aluminium type used in the liner does not contribute to the penetration of concrete slabs as much as the standoff distance does. Considering different standoff distances, penetration depth is seen to be low for 1 CD and it increases as the standoff distance gets higher. For higher standoff distances, the jet elongates and tip velocity of the jet increases. As a result, penetration depth increases. This effect can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1548512911410757">Figure 7</xref>. However, as a consequence of the velocity gradient, particulation occurs as the forming jet elongates, which has a negative effect on the penetration performance of the shaped charge. To conclude, in the design of the shaped charges, an optimum standoff distance should be sought and be implemented. On the other hand, for the protection of armours, some precautions should be taken to change the optimum standoff distance of shaped charges.</p>
