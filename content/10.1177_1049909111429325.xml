<abstract>
<p>The widening gap between the demand for palliative care services and the supply of trained palliative care professionals has resulted in considerable end-of-life distress for patients. Without formal training in palliative medicine and end-of-life symptom management, physicians in the United States are less equipped to competently address seriously ill and dying patients' medical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Recent attempts within graduate medical education training deliberately seek to prepare a critical mass of physicians as the new hospice and palliative medicine workforce in the United States. In addition, healthcare reform proposals may re-define the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) post-graduate training over the next five years and the Hospice Medicare Benefit altogether. Healthcare policy options include steady changes at multiple levels of medical training —namely, medical school curriculum mandates, requiring all graduate physician residency training to foster patient-centered communication skills and discussions about advanced directives, and instituting palliative medicine proficiency Continuing Medical Education (CME) requirements for all states' medical licensing boards. Attracting qualified physicians to serve patients at the end of life, innovative medical school loan repayment programs and scholarships will also foster excellence in the field of hospice and palliative medicine. Correcting our current paucity of formal training in palliative medicine better utilizes hospice and restores patients' dignity at the end of life.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Many people in the United States die without dignity due to the gap between the need for palliative care services and the supply of trained palliative care professionals. Hospice is the end-of-life medical setting in which palliative medicine specialists competently address seriously ill and dying patients’ medical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Without formal training in palliative medicine and end-of-life pain management, physicians in the United States are less equipped to provide their patients the necessary pain relief modalities and their patients’ families resources. Furthermore, an incorrect association of hospice with physician-assisted suicide or with forgoing potentially life-prolonging treatments precludes patients’ access to end-of-life palliation. Avoidance of death in the terminally ill is part of the current and urgent problem of a broken end-of-life policy in the United States.</p>
<p>The paucity of formal training in palliative medicine thus under-utilizes hospice, the most comprehensive program to provide palliative health care in the United States. President Obama signed comprehensive health reform into law in March 2010 with the goal of implementing health care workforce changes by 2011. The proposed time line called for an establishment of Teaching Health Centers to provide payments for primary care residency programs in community-based ambulatory patient care centers. At present, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) administers residency training not only for primary care but also for subspecialty training, such as palliative medicine. However, only 25% of hospitals and 70% of academic medical centers offered inpatient palliative care consultation. Also, only 30% of patients are enrolled in hospice at the time of death and the median length of stay for those who have been referred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909111429325">
<title>Problem</title>
<p>Terminally ill patients do not currently die with dignity in the United States due to lack of training on the part of health care professionals. Health care reform as of 2011 has not adequately addressed the fact that the United States graduate medical education system must adopt a preferred alternative or educating primary care providers to proficiently counsel patients on end-of-life care. Requiring all patients’ involvement in the palliative medicine process is equally important; mandatory completion of a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) form when getting driver’s license ensures that patients communicate in written form their end-of-life decision preferences. The problem is avoidance of death, which intuitively is unavoidable, rather than focusing on quality and quantity of life.</p>
<p>In American culture, discussion of death is not a popular topic. Thus, debate about how to best allocate resources at the end of life reflects that effort to deal with the inevitable by simply relying on progressively sophisticated technology to “buy time.” In practical terms, an otherwise healthy 20-year-old swimmer, who while drowning would likely sustain rib fractures with the appropriate chest compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and yet her respiratory recovery may be confounded more by the delayed healing of her fractured ribs than the drowning itself. All too frequently, health care professionals find themselves ill-equipped to address time-sensitive decisions to perform CPR on physiologically compromised 85-year-old patients.</p>
<p>Lack of preparation is then coupled with failure to communicate health care decision-making proxies in advance. Next, panic on the part of well-meaning family members nonetheless compels health care professionals to buy time by performing CPR on all comers. This practice unfortunately relegates very sick young and old patients to ventilator dependence from which they have a difficult time recovering from.</p>
<p>As a result, terminally ill patients do not currently die with dignity in the United States. Lack of training on the part of health care professionals to address the Palliative Medicine needs of terminally ill patients is part of the problem. Physicians must be more proficient at the management of the imminently dying patient. This education must include care of medical disorders, effective communication, and coordination with the medical care team.</p>
<p>Other part of the problem is that as a nation, we have not articulated a plan to empower patients to consider what care plan they would like implemented when they are deemed terminal. Decision making of patients must be grounded in the principles of hospice and palliative medicine, ethics, and appropriate law. Interdisciplinary care planning optimizes the use of hospice, and systems of palliative care can thus better serve populations with advanced illness.</p>

<title>Policy Options</title>
<sec id="section4-1049909111429325">
<title>Medical School Curriculum Mandates</title>
<p>Medical school education must provide physician students training with prognostic tools. Medical students must learn to enhance quality of life that should be offered alongside curative and/or restorative medical care in all medical settings. When implemented as a medical school curriculum policy, teaching medical students appropriate triage for the inclusion of more patients with advanced stages of noncancer diagnoses (such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia) in specialized hospice programs would improve quality of life in those terminal patients.</p>
<p>The American College of Cardiology (ACC) has tried to improve the use of the New York Heart Association Classification of Congestive Heart Failure by medical trainees using objective metrics rather than subjective functional measures. Neither method is perfect and can be discordant to correctly predict time till death. In the United States, Medicare part B pays for hospice care; so correct prognostication is vital to determine who pays for what. Early on in their medical school training, physicians must thus understand the economic, public policy, and clinical implications of hospice care. Research such as that produced by the ACC will help physicians-in-training understand that treatment in hospice care might allow more patients to die with optimal medical care in the advanced stages of their illnesses. Mandating hospice care education into medical school curricula empowers medical students to consider palliative care a key component of excellent medical care, but not an alternative to be pursued only after other approaches have been exhausted.</p>

<sec id="section5-1049909111429325">
<title>The ACGME Residency Requirements</title>
<p>The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) charged with regulating that all US graduate physician residency training must establish mechanisms to foster excellence in the specialty field of hospice and palliative medicine, including scholarships. As a good way to attract qualified physicians to the palliative medicine field, medical school loan repayment programs would allow ACGME resident physicians to advance the palliative medicine discipline. The Steven Thompson Loan Repayment Program (STLRP) administered by the Medical Board of California is a model program, whereby primary care physicians practicing in medically underserved areas have their medical school loans up to US$105 000 forgiven by the State of California. The STLRP template, in fact, requires 15% of recipients to practice in a geriatric setting; so, this would be an easy model for the ACGME to adopt as a policy for palliative physicians’ medical school loan forgiveness.</p>
<p>This ACGME physician residency education policy would also specifically address the shortage of palliative and hospice physicians in California. In California, only 4 Palliative Medicine fellowship training programs exist. The ACGME should also collaborate with the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM), which recognizes the shortage of palliative physicians and has thus implemented a plan, which was to “grandfather” physicians to palliative medicine specialty certification. This educational process encourages those physicians trained through the ACGME to become certified after they had more than 400 hours of taking care of terminally ill patients. The ACGME must now determine whether and how to extend the grandfathering period past 2012.</p>
<p>Even as the ACGME weighs in, the Kaiser Permanente Medical System acknowledges that medical physicians will be given these palliative medicine jobs even without the fellowship training. To have uniform palliative care and hospice standards and to train greater number of clinicians to close the substantial gap between need and availability, the AAHPM supports public and private funding mechanisms to ensure the growth and development of ACGME certified palliative medicine fellowship programs. Such programs are essential. Processes of these envisioned ACGME graduate medical education programs specifically designate a set of specialist-level skills and practices which must be offered by credentialed specialists in hospice and palliative medicine.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049909111429325">
<title>Continuing Medical Education Requirements for State Licensure</title>
<p>Continuing medical education requirements are routine for all states’ medical licensing boards and are a viable method to regulate palliative medical education proficiency. With the field of palliative medicine evolving, physicians must be kept abreast of medical advances in the specialty and their terminal patients’ care. The American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs in November 2010 encouraged physicians to participate in their patients’ advance care planning, including Durable Power of Attorney for Health care. This medico-legal policy stance was influenced to some degree on defensively practiced medicine rather than doing what is best for the patient but nonetheless proactively required end-of-life care discussions.</p>
<p>Recently, the American Thoracic Society also recommended that the AMA encourage the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to designate voluntary discussions about end-of-life care. Physicians will be required to submit proof of completion of courses on medical care in the palliative setting as covered services in the 2012 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. In addition, they will be better equipped to question use of public funds and hold policymakers to task in the creation of health care budgets.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049909111429325">
<title>Supporting Argument</title>
<p>As a physician myself, I support palliative medicine education at the medical school stage because this philosophical stance needs to be inculcated early in physician training. Medical school curriculums afford most of the time of medical professionals with relatively fewer clinical responsibilities and waiting until residency training to learn these concepts is too late. In fact, some graduate ACGME medical specialties, such as radiology, have very little direct patient contact so it does not make sense to wait till that ACGME residency training phase. On the other hand, oncologists who are very attuned to the death process must be trained early on; the palliative medicine consultants indeed act as an extension of the oncology care team so the oncologists can focus on giving chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, all medical doctors must realize that dealing with death and dying are part of the medical praxis.</p>
<p>Many patients are not aware of the Hospice Medicare Benefit and rely on their physician to guide them in the emotionally taxing time of end of life. Hospice Medicare Benefit and other end-of-life topics fit well into the ethics components curricula of many medical schools. Medical school curricula should emphasize the humanistic approach, so that physicians can care for their patients comprehensively, including knowledgeable advocacy at the time around death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909111429325">
<title>Opposing Argument</title>
<p>Requiring palliative medicine training in the medical school curriculum is unrealistic and logistically untenable. Basic science classes are meant to focus on fundamental anatomy, and pathophysiology principles are already overwhelmed with the sheer volume of material requiring mastery. In addition, at the medical school preclinical stage, the medical students have fewer interactions with patients so these philosophical issues have less relevance. It is more reasonable to inform the public about hospice and have consumer-driven demand for palliative medicine in life-limiting illnesses. Continued experimentation with the curriculum for problem-based learning has not produced better doctors.</p>
<p>Under the current practice of residency training for postgraduate studies in the United States, Medicare pays for ACGME training. To envision a new teaching health center program does address the lack of primary care physicians in the United States with palliative medicine specialty training, but it overlooks the fundamental ongoing problem of geographical misdistribution of such health care providers. Furthermore, the legislated timeline proposed by Obama was inaccurate to start with because training programs recruit medical school graduates over a year in advance through an annual complex application–interview cycle called “The Match.” Therefore, it would not be practical to implement the proposed changes until 2012 at which point the new centers would also not likely be in place functionally yet.</p>
<p>President Obama’s health care reform law is supposed to somehow raise $1.5 billion for the National Health Service Corps postgraduate training over 5 years, which would actually delay palliative medicine training. Medical education incorporating end-of-life training can instead be part of medical licensure from the start. Respecting life requires discussion of end-of-life decisions in the medical school curriculum, which is relatively relaxed setting of nonacute medical care. Waiting to address these issues under times of physical and emotional duress of a medical emergency in the intensive care unit setting is a recipe for misunderstanding and defensive practice of medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049909111429325">
<title>Recommendation for Action</title>
<p>The United States health care system serves its citizens most effectively during end-of-life care by training physicians in hospice care. The clinical evidence on quality of patient care strongly recommends early implementation of palliative medicine training in physicians’ skills sets. One of the strongest reasons to incorporate palliative medicine in to the medical school curriculum is that it is cost effective. Palliative care consultations not only reduce costs but also improve quality of the remaining life for the sickest (ie, most expensive) patients that physicians provide health care for. The early inculcating of a philosophical stance that life itself and quality of life are sacred is another reason palliative medicine principles must be required in the medical school curriculum.</p>
<p>Requiring all patients’ involvement in the palliative medicine process is equally important; mandatory completion of a POLST form when getting driver’s license ensures that patients communicate in a written form about their end-of-life decision preferences. Similarly, the collaborative physician–patient covenant aligns an individual patient’s palliative care wishes with their tailored treatments; this also ensures that patients and their families are comfortable and supported in the end-of-life health care phase.</p>
<p>The routine integrating of end-of-life discussions into primary care physician visits removes the stigma of palliative medicine as a “giving up” of care. Instead, patients are given advance notice that palliative care can help with their eventual end-of-life symptom management and concomitant psychosocial support so that patients can continue treatments. In turn, hospice programs staffed by a critical mass of physicians specializing in palliative medicine can provide a greater number of patients palliative care support before they qualify for hospice. Patients involved in this process will have working fluency to request hospice care sooner and maximize their cost-effective Medicare Hospice Benefit for longer lengths of stay.</p>
<p>Physicians trained early on in their medical education about the patient’s health advantages with hospice, including reduced hospital re-admissions. These changes thus end up saving the US health care system literally thousands of dollars per hospitalized patient. Loan forgiveness programs for physicians working in palliative medicine, similar to the STLRP template in California, are a feasible method to attract the best physicians to the palliative medicine field.</p>
<p>In conclusion, early implementation of palliative medicine training in physicians’ skills sets during medical school curricula is solidly based on clinical evidence regarding quality of patient care. Such training by hospice programs shall yield a critical mass of physicians specializing in palliative medicine. Only in this way can health care in the United States provide a greater number of patients palliative care support before they qualify for hospice and ultimately be the cost-effective way for Americans to enjoy quality of life as well as quality of dying.</p>
