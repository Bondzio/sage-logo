<title>Background:</title>
<p>Trials of dignity therapy (a palliative care psychotherapy) have shown self-reported benefits for participants from taking part, although more so in intervention than control groups. However, the sources of these benefits are unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216312449272">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore and compare participants’ views on taking part in a mixed methods phase II randomised controlled trial of dignity therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216312449272">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>This was a qualitative study, using the framework approach to the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216312449272">
<title>Setting/participants:</title>
<p>It involved residents, aged 65+, with no major cognitive impairment, living in one of 15 nursing/care homes in London, UK (49 residents at 1-week follow-up, 36 residents at 8-week follow-up).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216312449272">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Residents’ views were represented in nine themes, and three of these themes were evident only in the intervention group: views on the generativity document; generativity; and reminiscence. Six themes were evident in both groups: refocusing; making a contribution; interaction with the researcher or therapist; diversion; not helping with their problems; and cognitive impairment. Our findings support some of the proposed mechanisms of action for this palliative care intervention (pride, hopefulness, care tenor) but also draw attention to some of the potential problems of delivering the intervention. We show how residents could benefit from taking part in research, regardless of whether or not they receive the intended intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216312449272">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Dignity therapy is likely to be beneficial to some care home residents, albeit the small minority who have the desire and the capacity to engage in such an intervention. Whether or not dignity therapy helps distressed residents, and the most effective way of screening for those who might benefit from it, need to be determined.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In many countries, as a result of an ageing population, increasing numbers of people will die in long-term care facilities such as nursing or care homes. Although many residents do not have a recognisable terminal illness, psychological and spiritual distress can result from multiple health problems, loss of function and awareness that they are likely to die in the home: consequently, there has been an increased focus on providing palliative care in these settings. Dignity therapy, an empirically-based brief life review style psychotherapy, has been developed specifically to address psychosocial and existential distress, enhance quality of life and bolster a sense of meaning, purpose and dignity among terminally ill people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref></sup> The theoretical framework from which the therapy has been developed is a model of dignity developed from interviews with Canadian hospice patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312449272">2</xref></sup> Seven themes from the model inform the structure, content and therapeutic tone of dignity therapy: generativity; continuity of self; role preservation; maintenance of pride; hopefulness; aftermath concerns; and care tenor (See Supplementary Data).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref></sup> The therapy involves an interview with a trained professional which is recorded, transcribed, edited and then returned to the patient, who, once they are satisfied with it, can share or bequeath the resulting ‘generativity’ document to people of their choosing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref></sup> The potential benefit of the therapy for families and friends is a unique aspect of dignity therapy and evaluations with hospice patients in Canada, Australia, US and UK have shown that patients feel that it had helped them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312449272">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312449272">4</xref></sup> and that it had, or would, help their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312449272">5</xref></sup> These studies focused largely on people with cancer, the majority of whom were being cared for at home. The generalisability of these findings to people with chronic non-malignant conditions, who may have psychological or spiritual concerns (although may not necessarily be in the palliative phase of illness) or may be being cared for in other settings, is uncertain.</p>
<p>Our study of the views of older people in care homes on dignity supported most of the themes informing the development of dignity therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312449272">6</xref></sup> However, there was no evidence that residents had major concerns about death (e.g. aftermath concerns). Support for the dignity model suggested that dignity therapy could be beneficial to care home residents. Quantitative findings from our mixed methods phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that, overall, residents in the intervention group felt that dignity therapy had helped them and that it would help their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312449272">7</xref></sup> However, residents in the control group also felt that participation in the study had helped them, albeit less so than those who also received the therapy: this finding was also observed in trials of dignity therapy for palliative care patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312449272">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312449272">4</xref></sup> The source of these perceived benefits is not known. Qualitative studies can help answer such questions. Although qualitative studies are important in trials of complex interventions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312449272">8</xref></sup> particularly where there is uncertainty about the mechanism of action, they are uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312449272">9</xref></sup> Participants’ views and experiences are an essential component of any evaluation.</p>
<sec id="section8-0269216312449272">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this qualitative study is to explore and compare residents’ views on dignity therapy and taking part in the dignity therapy trial.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Further details of this trial are reported with the quantitative findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312449272">7</xref></sup> and in our protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312449272">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section10-0269216312449272">
<title>Ethical approval</title>
<p>The study was approved by the joint South London and Maudsley and the Institute of Psychiatry NHS Research Ethics Committee (24/11/2008, ref. no. 08/H0807/75) and met the requirements of the Local Research Governance Framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216312449272">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This was a qualitative study embedded in a phase II RCT of dignity therapy. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected simultaneously and the quantitative analysis preceded this qualitative analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216312449272">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in the study were residents aged 65+ years with no major cognitive impairment (score of 15 or less on the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312449272">11</xref></sup> living in one of 15 care homes in London, UK. All residents still in the study at follow-up were interviewed.</p>
<sec id="section13-0269216312449272">
<title>Intervention group</title>
<p>The intervention group received dignity therapy in addition to standard psychological and spiritual care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312449272">7</xref></sup> The study team (including all therapists/researchers) were trained to deliver dignity therapy by Professor Harvey Max Chochinov) (University of Manitoba &amp; Cancercare Manitoba) who developed the therapy. Training included: the theoretical basis for the intervention; demonstrations of dignity therapy; a detailed overview of the manual; editing the dignity therapy documents; and working with residents to produce a document that would be helpful for them and other recipients. The standard framework of questions used in the therapy was given to residents after randomisation to give them the opportunity to think about their responses before the session. Dignity therapy interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and then shaped into a narrative using a formatted editing process. This included clarifications, chronological corrections, tagging and editing any content that might inflict significant harm on recipients of the ‘generativity’ document (after discussion with the resident), and finding a suitable ending for the document which was appropriate to the overall message. Another session was arranged for the therapist to read the ‘generativity’ to the resident who was invited to make editorial suggestions. Once this document was finalised, it was given to the resident to share with anyone they chose. To assure quality, 14 (52%) therapy transcripts were reviewed by SH, PS, or a therapist working with Harvey Chochinov’s research group (who were evaluating of the intervention with hospice patients).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269216312449272">
<title>Control group</title>
<p>The control group received the usual psychological and spiritual care offered by homes and baseline and follow up interviews.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section15-0269216312449272">
<title>Demographic measures</title>
<p>We collected demographic information including: cognitive functioning (Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration test),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312449272">11</xref></sup> performance status (Karnosfsky scores),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312449272">12</xref></sup> ability to perform activities of daily living (Barthel scores),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312449272">13</xref></sup> age, gender and ethnic group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0269216312449272">
<title>Research interviews</title>
<p>Details of randomisation and recruitment and the recruitment procedure are reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312449272">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312449272">10</xref></sup> Both groups took part in face-to-face semi-structured interviews with one of three female researchers at 1-week and 8-week follow-ups. Two researchers were psychologists (both with MSc qualifications) and one was a palliative care nurse. One researcher (CG) is a co-author. None of the researchers worked in the care homes or had relationships with residents prior to commencement of the study. No information about the researchers was given to residents prior to their first meeting. The researchers also delivered the therapy, however, they did not recruit or collect follow up data on the residents to whom they delivered the therapy. All researchers were trained in the use of the topic guide, field notes were recorded, and interviews were discussed at regular team meetings. Researchers also recruited and obtained consent from the residents for the study. Qualitative interviews immediately followed completion of quantitative measures and were conducted in private in the resident’s care home. The interviews covered residents’ views on the therapy and/or taking part in the study. For example, they were asked if they felt that dignity therapy or taking part in the study helped them and if they felt that it had, or would have, helped their families. Follow up interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts of follow-up interviews were not returned to participants for comment and/or correction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0269216312449272">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We used the framework approach to qualitative analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312449272">14</xref></sup> This comprehensive and flexible approach has been developed specifically for applied (or policy-relevant) qualitative research in which the objectives of the research are typically set in advance, for example, exploring the proposed mechanisms of action of an intervention. This approach can be used for studies which are more descriptive than interpretative and is particularly suitable for comparing different groups. Since we were interested in summarising, in everyday terms, residents’ descriptions of how dignity therapy and taking part in the study had helped them, we stayed close to the data and to the surface of words and events. Consequently, our analysis was more descriptive than interpretative. We felt that minimally-theorised, or otherwise minimally-transformed or ‘spun’ answers to our questions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312449272">15</xref></sup> would be most relevant for those interested in delivering dignity therapy. We use the term ‘theme’ to describe a more limited and concrete category than is often used in qualitative research. We conducted the analysis systematically and rigorously (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312449272">Table 1</xref>), and used QSR NVivo (Version 8.0) to organise the data.</p>

<title>Impact on residents</title>
<p>Some residents felt that their generativity documents were useful, well-written and made them feel important. They appreciated how editing resulted in a coherent document and being given the opportunity to make changes to drafts. For example, one gentleman, who was initially concerned about some of the content of his document following criticism from a family member, was delighted with the revised version.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, other residents were relatively neutral about their documents. They found them difficult to read either because of problems with their eyesight or because they found it tiring to read. Although residents had agreed the final version, they still found minor errors due to memory lapses, and some still felt that they had not included enough information about some people or times in their lives. However, none of these were major concerns.</p>

<title>Impact on residents’ families</title>
<p>Some residents had already given their generativity documents to the intended recipients, whilst others were planning to bequeath them after their death. Some residents felt that recipients would understand them better or learn more of their family history, although others pointed out that their families already knew all the information in their documents. Residents appreciated the opportunity of reminding their families of the more positive aspects of their lives or thought that their family might enjoy their amusing anecdotes. Some of the residents, who had already shared their documents, thought that this might improve current communication with their families (or for one resident, communication with a member of the care home staff) or prompt enjoyable reminiscence. Residents rarely spoke about dying, however, one felt that her document would be helpful for her funeral.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can tell them about things getting better and better, and as I get older, to forget the troubles and think of the future … [member of care home staff name] got one … She says very good, very helpful … maybe she’ll understand me better. (Intervention, R28: 8-weeks)</p>
<p>I think they knew me pretty well before they got the document. But they, they have discovered some things they didn’t know … You see one way in which it could be useful is supposing [nieces’ names] were not available to arrange things when I die, supposing I live to be a hundred, they might be gone mightn’t they? [laughter] So it might be useful to have, keep it with my Will … because … people, you know, at a funeral people usually expect somebody to speak about the, the person who’s died, don’t they … it does contain a good deal of information about my background, you know. (Intervention, R14: 8-weeks)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, other residents could see no potential benefits for recipients or felt that their documents could create problems, for example by raising long-standing family disagreements. Others had no immediate family or felt that potential recipients would not be interested in their document.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well I haven’t got a family, you see … well they’re not immediate [siblings] … they might not like it, because I’ve referred to them here and there, and maybe they’d prefer not to be. So it’s … it’s a bit awkward … it’d be up to them how they view me, of course. Some might be, say, well that poor old devil had a hard time, and others will say, oh he must have been a lazy old bugger to spend his life like that, you know … Well they probably wouldn’t be in the least interested.

<title>Generativity</title>
<p>Although one of the aims of dignity therapy is to help people deal with concerns that nothing of them will transcend death (generativity issues), only one resident mentioned that dignity therapy could help him to be remembered after his death, although this did not appear to have been a concern for him. He said, ‘for future generations, like future times, for my children and that, you know … to remember me by when I’m gone’ (Intervention, R38: 8-weeks).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0269216312449272">
<title>Reminiscence</title>
<p>Several residents who received dignity therapy described how it had jogged or restored memories, both good and bad. This could help them to see how aspects of their past related to one another. Many enjoyed a rare opportunity to share their memories with an attentive listener, although one resident had felt sad when recalling unpleasant memories and another felt that it was more important to think of the future rather than dwell on the past.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Oh they’d send me into melancholy [memories]. Some of them were horrible … there’s no way it can be corrected [the past]. The time’s not on my side, as you know… As well as the bright moments, it brought back some of the not so brighter ones . (Intervention, R2: 8-weeks)</p>
<p>It’s brought back the past for me. And I like to dwell on the past, not in a bad way, just in good things … I didn’t have a bad past but especially certain instances that happened, and, and so I, I dwell on the good part. I’m not a one to talk of the past all the time, I’ve never done that, I think your future’s the best, you never know what’s there, there do you? (Intervention, R21: 1-week)</p>

<sec id="section27-0269216312449272">
<title>Refocusing</title>
<p>Residents in both groups described changes in direction or emphasis in their lives. Some who had received dignity therapy felt that they had gained new insight into themselves and that the therapy had helped them to solve problems, focus more on the positive aspects of lives, appreciate their achievements and the important people in their lives, and feel that their lives had been worthwhile. Residents in the control group felt that taking part had made them realise that things were not as bad as they could be. They described being more thoughtful and more contented and accepting of their current situation and the care they were receiving. Although one resident in the control group described gaining more insight into his past, this did not seem to be accompanied with increased feelings of pride or self-worth.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well I did feel better about myself because … after a while you, you lose all connection with work and, and your colleagues, and so on, and so … you begin to wonder about how well you did it [laughs] … it boosted my morale a bit really … it has stimulated me to think more about life generally and … you know, not to just think oh well I’m coming to the end of it all. (Intervention, R54: 1-week)</p>
<p>I think it was a help … it gave me an insight to all that I have been through … I was thinking all through my life what I have done. The things that I’ve done, the way that I acted for the family. (Control, R59: 8-weeks)</p>

<title>Making a contribution</title>
<p>Many residents seemed to find satisfaction in the thought that they might be helping others. Some felt that it had made them feel useful or special. This theme was evident in both groups, but particularly prevalent in the control group. For some residents in the intervention group this was an additional benefit of taking part whilst for the control group this seemed to be a major benefit.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I feel that I’m not useless, you know … that I am … will help somebody, you know, apart from myself. (Intervention, R4: 8-weeks)</p>

<sec id="section29-0269216312449272">
<title>Interaction with the researcher or therapist</title>
<p>This was a prevalent theme in both groups. Residents who received dignity therapy described the therapist, and sometimes the researcher conducting the follow up interviews, as kind, thoughtful or understanding. The residents appreciated having someone who cared and was interested in them and any problems they might have. Residents in the control group looked forward to the visits of the researcher. For some this was seen simply as enjoyable company, however, for others these visits seemed more meaningful: knowing someone was interested in them made them feel more worthwhile and they felt that they had benefited from the opportunity to talk about their problems with an empathetic listener.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m very happy to see you [researcher] … Yourself and [therapist] and it’s just a very, very wonderful … Well I must say I’m very fortunate to have you come … Well you see you can be left on the shelf, as it were, and nobody cares and this is … very grateful for people like you take interest in us … sharing my problem with someone I trust . (Intervention, R61: 1-week)</p>

<sec id="section30-0269216312449272">
<title>Diversion</title>
<p>In contrast to the more substantial benefits described above, some residents in both groups felt that taking part in the study was helpful simply because it gave them something to do or think about: it was a change in routine and relieved boredom. They could forget their troubles or symptoms for a while. Here a sense that taking part in the study was something special was missing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well I think it does help you when you can talk to somebody and, you know, it helps to take things away and that … things like the sickness and that, you don’t feel, feel about it so much when you can talk to somebody. (Intervention, R50: 1-week)</p>

<sec id="section31-0269216312449272">
<title>Not helping with problems</title>
<p>Some residents in both groups felt that they had not been helped with the main problems they were experiencing. As one resident who had received dignity therapy pointed out, ‘there’s no cure for old age’ (Intervention, R29: 8-weeks). The problems residents felt that they needed help with involved coping with losses (such as loss of function, loss of freedom or the loss of their home) or distressing symptoms.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>How can it be helping me? You should be doing something for me and speaking to these people … I want more freedom. Being cooped up here all day long. It’s not as if I’m … haven’t got my faculties about me, you know what I mean … I don’t wanna be here. (Intervention, R38: 1-week)</p>

<sec id="section32-0269216312449272">
<title>Cognitive impairment</title>
<p>Dignity therapy is not, in its current form, recommended for people with significant cognitive impairment, as their generativity documents are likely to reflect a distorted sense of self which could be distressing for themselves and the recipients. Several residents in the intervention group felt that, since most residents in the care home had dementia or other communication problems, they would not benefit from dignity therapy. However, although we screened residents for cognitive impairment at the start of the study, some who had received the therapy did have problems recalling their experience of the study. One resident in the control group also had problems recalling their experience of the study.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t remember much about it [dignity therapy] now, but I do remember it, yes … quite honestly I don’t know what the document was about now [laughs] it’s too long ago, so … After all, at my age … you can remember sort of some things and that, but things like that you just answer them and then they’ve gone [laughs].

<title>Changes over time</title>
<p>Although there was some consistency between the two follow up periods for individuals, residents sometimes gave a view at one point in time which they did not mention at the other. This, however, did not seem to be related to particular themes: all themes were represented at both time points. Neither were there changes in opinion (e.g. saying that something was helpful at one interview and then saying it was unhelpful at the next interview, and vice versa).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Some residents were delighted with dignity therapy and described many benefits for themselves and their families. Our findings support some of the proposed mechanisms of action for this palliative care intervention for this population. However, our findings also draw attention to some of the potential problems in delivering this intervention to care home residents. Our study also shows that residents can benefit from taking part in sensitively-conducted research regardless of whether or not they receive the intended intervention.</p>
<sec id="section35-0269216312449272">
<title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
<p>The strengths and limitations of this study are those of the RCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312449272">7</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge this is the first published evaluation of dignity therapy in a care home setting using a randomised design with the inclusion of a longer-term follow-up than in other evaluations of dignity therapy. Furthermore, this qualitative study allowed us to explore participants’ views on the ways in which this intervention may or may not have been working in this setting, along with the potential benefits of taking part in research. The main limitationsof the study are the low response rate and the low baseline levels of distress in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0269216312449272">
<title>Perceived benefits</title>
<p>The perceived benefits of dignity therapy are evident across some of our themes and support some of the proposed mechanisms of action of this intervention (pride, hopefulness and care tenor). The focus on the achievements of residents, and recording these in their generativity documents, seemed to bolster a sense of pride and hopefulness in some residents. Care tenor was clearly evident in reports of their enjoyment of the visits of therapists and researchers. We suspect that the intervention sometimes took longer to deliver than expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312449272">7</xref></sup> because residents prolonged meetings: and they quickly realised that if they requested editorial changes to their documents then we would return.</p>
<p>However, most of the themes from the dignity model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312449272">2</xref></sup> which informed the development of dignity therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref></sup> and relate to the proposed mechanisms of action were not evident. Residents did not seem to be concerned about whether or not their life had stood for something; or that they would have influence that would transcend death (generativity); or about the problems that their death would impose on others (aftermath concerns); or that their essence remained whole (continuity of self); or being unable to identify with previously held roles (role preservation). This is consistent with the low baseline levels of distress in our sample (and other published evaluations of dignity therapy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312449272">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312449272">4</xref></sup> and an apparent lack of concern about death observed in our earlier study of the views of care home residents on maintaining dignity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312449272">6</xref></sup> Rather than ameliorating generativity or aftermath concerns, generativity documents were sometimes valued more for their more immediate benefits of improving communication and additional opportunities to reminisce. Many older people enjoy reminiscing and residents felt that this was a benefit of the intervention. However, although it is pleasing that residents enjoyed this aspect of the intervention, the therapeutic aim of dignity therapy is not simply to describe memories but to engage more in positive evaluation (e.g. focus on achievements etc.) as it is a life review style therapy. Reminiscence is often encouraged in care homes, however, this is usually done with a peer group and aims to increase integration and improve memory.</p>
<p>With the exception of benefits relating specifically to generativity documents, it was often not possible to differentiate the benefits of dignity therapy from those of taking part in the study. There seemed to be a strong sense of pride underlying residents’ feelings that, by taking part in the study, they were making an important contribution and this was evident in both groups. The potential benefits of feeling that they were making a significant contribution has been reported in other studies of nursing home residents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312449272">16</xref></sup> and in palliative care patients and carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312449272">17</xref></sup> Altruism and a wish to make a contribution is a motivator to participate in RCTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312449272">18</xref></sup> and in palliative care research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312449272">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312449272">20</xref></sup> Completion of questionnaires focusing on any concerns or problems that they might be experiencing alongside the more in-depth qualitative interviews could also have been beneficial to residents in both groups. Researchers (and therapists) were selected and trained to work with older people in care homes. They treated residents with kindness, humanity and respect: these are core values of medical professionalism which are often overlooked in the time-pressured culture of modern health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216312449272">21</xref></sup> Although only one group received dignity therapy, both groups received ‘dignity conserving care’. Our study, and other evaluations of dignity therapy, support the notion of palliative care research as ‘a therapeutic opportunity’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216312449272">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-0269216312449272">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>Although the perceived benefits of taking part in the study are encouraging, some residents were less enthusiastic. Although no participants felt that they had been seriously adversely affected by taking part, difficulties with the therapy can arise. Although generativity documents aim to capture the ‘essence’ of residents, they have lived long lives and some seemed to want a biography of their lives. Deciding what to include in generativity documents can be a difficult decision as recipients (usually family members) can be critical of the content of documents and residents concerned about potential responses, particularly when there are difficult family issues. Individuals might not be mentioned, or not mentioned enough, events considered important by recipients omitted, and witty comments or well-meaning advice taken the wrong way. Avoiding these pitfalls depends on the skill of the therapist, who could not foresee all of these issues. Residents often have no close family or friends and, although some are pleased to have the document for the pleasure of reading it themselves, there can be a sense of sadness when there is nobody who cares enough to appreciate receiving it. Dignity therapy has been shown to be particularly beneficial to patients who feel that it will help their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some residents recall distressing events or want to talk about unresolved issues, their symptoms or disabilities, their losses, loneliness, concerns about being in the care home and the care they are receiving. For some, this is the only opportunity that they have to talk about these issues to an attentive listener. In contrast to life review, in which participants typically work at coming to terms with more difficult memories over several sessions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216312449272">23</xref></sup> dignity therapy usually involves a single session focusing more on achievements and happier memories. Therapists do not have the time or the expertise to help people deal with problems, although they can suggest that they seek the help they need. Since participants in published evaluations of dignity therapy are, overall, not distressed there is a need to explore more rigorously the impact of this intervention on distressed individuals, along with consideration of how therapists should deal with patients’ intense regrets and life-long conflicts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216312449272">24</xref></sup> However, few residents were distressed and several pointed out that although the therapy had not helped them because they had not needed help, they had enjoyed it anyway. Finally, cognitive impairment is likely to be a particular problem for this population. The vast majority of residents in these homes were excluded from this study for this reason. Some of those who had passed our cognitive screening reported minor and major memory lapses. The former resulted in repeated visits to correct documents, the latter resulted in inability to recall the therapy. Cognitive impairment at follow-up might have been temporary (having a ‘bad day’ ) or permanent (resulting from a relatively rapid deterioration in health).</p>

<sec id="section38-0269216312449272">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Dignity therapy in its current form is likely to be beneficial to some care home residents, albeit the small minority who have the desire and the capacity to engage in such an intervention. However, in view of the relatively small proportion of residents who are likely to benefit from this intervention and the time it takes to deliver it, the cost of offering this therapy as usual care needs to be considered particularly if other interventions, such as reminiscence therapy, are already in place. Whether or not dignity therapy helps distressed residents, and the most effective way of screening for those residents who might benefit from it, needs to be determined: perhaps by identifying those with concerns particularly likely to be helped by the therapy. Items from the Patient Dignity Inventory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216312449272">25</xref></sup> could be used as these relate directly to the themes from the model of dignity in the terminally ill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312449272">2</xref></sup> which informed the structure content and therapeutic tone of dignity therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312449272">1</xref></sup> (i.e. generativity, continuity of self, role preservation, maintenance of pride, hopefulness, aftermath concerns and care tenor). It is possible that residents with moderate cognitive impairment, and their families, might benefit from a slightly modified protocol where family members contribute to the therapy interview. Although, some interventions were challenging, therapists often enjoyed delivering the therapy as much as the residents who received it. However, we feel that ongoing supervision and support, similar to that given to counsellors and psychotherapists, is needed to help therapists deal with more unusual or difficult cases.</p>
