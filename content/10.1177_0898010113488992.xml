<abstract>
<p>This article describes the use of energy dialogue technique (EDT), a healing intervention that provides awareness of imbalances in the energetic field that affect patients’ health and guide the practitioner to sense and direct the frequency, vibration, intention, awareness, or consciousness to correct these imbalances. The authors document the effectiveness of this technique as it was used to treat side effects of the medical intervention for hepatitis C in a male with hemophilia. Following EDT, the client’s symptoms of fatigue and pain improved by 30% to 40%; moreover, thyroid function returned to normal. The authors suggest that EDT be studied and explored for inclusion as a treatment modality.</p>

<body>
<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most prevalent blood-borne infection in the United States, commonly leading to liver disease. Fatigue, pain, and thyroid dysfunction are some of the common side effects that present in patients taking Pegylated interferon and Ribavirin (PI&amp;R) treatment for HCV. Stress from infection, inflammation, and disease, as well as psychological distress, can result in symptoms similar to those generated by these treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898010113488992">Tsatsoulis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Some 60% of the population with HCV respond to PI&amp;R, which eliminates the presence of HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010113488992">Shindo, Arai, &amp; Okuno, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010113488992">1999</xref>). However 20% of those infected develop thyroid dysfunction and require thyroid medication to stabilize. It may take up to 6 months after completion of the medical treatment to normalize the side effects of PI&amp;R. The case presented in this report represents a typical hemophilia patient with hepatitis C infection undergoing medical treatment. However, when energy dialogue technique (EDT) was used in conjunction with the medical treatment, the patient’s pain and fatigue were reduced, thyroid dysfunction was normalized, psychological distress appeared lower, and recovery period was shortened.</p>
<p>The EDT described in this case study is a product of the efforts of five health professionals who have been students of various holistic, mind–body, and energetic therapies for over 25 years. Our group comprises a nurse practitioner, physical therapist, speech therapist, and two occupational therapists. Our collective studies beyond our profession include Craniosacral Therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898010113488992">Zhang, 1995</xref>), Integrative Manual Therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010113488992">Giammatteo &amp; Wieselfish-Giammatteo, 1997</xref>), Applied Kinesiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010113488992">Savva, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898010113488992">Tsatsoulis, 2006</xref>), Mindfulness Meditation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113488992">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010113488992">Kabat-Zinn &amp; Burney, 1981</xref>), and Osteopathic Manipulation, as well as multiple manual and energetic diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The EDT is an intervention that can be used in any healing setting by diverse practitioners.</p>
<p>The EDT intervention that we developed, which is described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0898010113488992">Appendix A</xref>, is based on several key ideas: that disturbances in the biofield or energetic environment affect wellness, that it is possible to alter those disturbances energetically, and that the practitioner interfaces with the patient’s energetic field. (Please see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0898010113488992">Appendix A</xref> for details.)</p>
<p>EDT begins with internal stillness in which one’s mind is quiet. The effectiveness of a quiet mind, as achieved through many meditation techniques, has been well documented in reversing the metabolic effects of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010113488992">Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, &amp; Walach, 2004</xref>), reducing pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010113488992">Astin, 2004</xref>), improving cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010113488992">Benson et al., 2000</xref>), reducing depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010113488992">Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992</xref>), and facilitating neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113488992">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A quiet mind provides a state of heightened awareness and the ability to sense and experience subtle energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010113488992">Dale, 2009</xref>) that pulse and permeate throughout a person’s energetic field. The subtle energy fields are part of the energetic makeup of the biofield.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies have shown the ability of thought and intention to effect physical change. These studies have documented the ability of meditative thought to effect change on the pH of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010113488992">Tiller, Dibble, Shealy, &amp; Nunley 2004</xref>), propagation of fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010113488992">Tiller, 1993</xref>), permeability of red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010113488992">Tiller, Kohane, &amp; Dibble, 2000</xref>), and crystal formation of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010113488992">Radin, Hayssen, Emoto, &amp; Kizu, 2006</xref>). Clinical studies demonstrate that positive thought increases the level of immune antibody S-IgA (secretory immunoglobulin A) and the production of the hormone DHEA (dehydoepiandosterone), found to be a factor in medical problems such as sleep disorder, diabetes, chronic fatigue, high cholesterol, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010113488992">McCraty, Atkinson, &amp; Tomasino, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>EDT utilizes communication between a person and his or her inner self that gives access to the wisdom of the biofield. Based on many years of clinical experience, the practitioners/authors view the biofield as a huge field transmitting information between all life forces. To best navigate the ocean of information, the practitioner dialogues with the inner self to serve as a guide to access information from the biofield.</p>

<title>Energy Dialogue Technique as a Healing Intervention</title>
<p>The National Institute of Health in 1994 recognized this energy field as the biofield and defined it as the “endogenous, complex dynamic electromagnetic field . . . proposed to be involved in self-organization and bio-regulation of the organism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010113488992">Rubik, 2002</xref>, p. 709). Eastern philosophies theorize that the subtle bodies of the human being beyond the physical body involve realms of mind, soul, and spirit. They posit that a full scientific model of the human being may require elements that go beyond space–time and matter–energy and require multidimensional geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010113488992">Rubik, 2002</xref>). Biofield theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010113488992">Jonas, 2004</xref>) expands this model of healing to include the flow of energy among quantum, potential, and electromagnetic layers. Disease is manifested with impeded flow; intention can focus biophysical energy and create healing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010113488992">Sicher &amp; Targ, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010113488992">Harris et al, 1999</xref>). In contrast to conventional biology, which offers a reductionist analytic perspective based on molecules and structure, the biofield model posits a broader concept with its field interactions and flow of information in relation to the environment. The biofield is the mechanism through which Energy Medicine operates. Energy Medicine includes biofield therapies such as Reiki, Therapeutic Touch, external qi healing, and other subtle energy interactions, as well as homeopathy, acupuncture, magnet therapy, and bio-electromagnetic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010113488992">Rubik, 2002</xref>)</p>
<p>Dr. Valerie Hunt, working with NASA to measure the energetic fields radiating off of the body, found that imbalances in these fields predict dysfunction in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010113488992">Hunt, 1989</xref>). Kirlian photography documents the presence of the energetic field through visual demonstration of an electrical corona. The coronal discharge patterns provide diagnostic information pertaining to the presence of cancer, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010113488992">Gerber, 2001</xref>). Dr. Harold Burr, in the 1930s, identified and measured energy fields surrounding organisms from mold to plants to frogs and humans. He was able to distinguish electrical patterns that corresponded with health and illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010113488992">Gerber, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of energy healing therapies are based on the awareness that questions thought by a practitioner elicit a perceptible response. This response reflects information accessed from the wisdom of the body, soul, or unconscious, all of which are part of a complex multilevel of information transmission that takes place in the biofield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010113488992">Rosch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010113488992">Rubik, 2002</xref>). Dr. John Upledger, the founder of Craniosacral Therapy, describes dialogue with “the inner physician,” or inner knowing of an individual. He found that tissue rhythm or motility responds to questions or communications offered by the practitioner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898010113488992">Upledger, 2003</xref>). Applied Kinesiology utilizes a unique feedback system of muscle testing to interpret the body’s special “body language.” The body can “talk” simply by changing the response of the muscle test when asked specific questions. Ask the body specific questions and you can get answers to growing health concerns and gain valuable information that cannot be attained through traditional types of laboratory testing or symptom analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010113488992">Barral, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010113488992">Benor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010113488992">Levy &amp; Lehr, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>The Anecdotal Case Study</title>
<p>The client, a 26-year-old male who has hemophilia, was followed by a traditional hematology practice located in a large urban metropolitan area in New York. In 1989, at the age of 8, he contracted HCV from a blood transfusion. His liver function was monitored closely through blood tests and computerized tomography (CT) scans. His liver showed progressive deterioration with progressive scarring evident on CT scans. By July 2007, his physicians recommended treatment with PI&amp;R, shown to be effective in treating HCV. At the time of initiation of treatment, the client was a newlywed employed in a community-based nonprofit organization that required a high level of activity and long hours. Despite the immediate development of achiness (pain scale 3-4/10) and flu-like symptoms, the patient was able to sustain a full workload and personal responsibilities. The patient reported that symptoms of fatigue and achiness progressed in a slow but consistent level until March 2008, when pain values reached 8-9/10. His blood values of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) increased on March 6, 2008, secondary to interferon treatment. In March 2008, he was referred for treatment for relief of pain and fatigue. The practitioner first gathered all medical information, diagnostic tests, and objective values relevant to the presenting symptoms. The client’s kyphotic posture, soft atrophied extremities, overall weakness of ≥3/5, and fatigue placed him in the category for the preferred practice patterns for endocrine and metabolic disease based on pattern 4B impaired posture guidelines for metabolic-based fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010113488992">American Physical Therapy Association, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Energy Dialogue Technique: “What Is It?”</title>
<p>EDT is the dialogue between an individual’s inner self and the biofield. EDT is based on the understanding that the energetic field or biofield is the blueprint of our physical self and contains wisdom, experience, and knowledge about the body beyond our conscious awareness. Through the EDT, the energetic disturbance, imbalance, or blocks in the biofield, also known as energetic lesions, can be identified. More in-depth dialogue can specify understanding and awareness of the energetic imbalances or lesions on or off the body. Imbalances that are felt or perceived are balanced through awareness and consciousness that can facilitate the healing process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010113488992">
<title>Energy Dialogue Technique: “How Does It Work?”</title>
<p>The process of awareness or consciousness of these energetic levels facilitates change in the physical dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010113488992">Tiller, 1993</xref>). Quantum theory proposes that awareness generates changes of vibrations of the energetic wave pattern. These energetic wave patterns transform into particles of matter, allowing change on the physical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010113488992">Tiller, 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898010113488992">
<title>Energy Dialogue Technique: “How to”</title>
<p>Dialogue is the means of sharing or transmitting information through verbal or nonverbal exchange. (Verbal exchange requires the use of language common to the parties involved, whereas nonverbal expression can be through facial motion, movement, or some other means of indicating thoughts, needs, or other expression.) The EDT also requires the establishment of some form of agreed-on communication. The yes/no (y/n) communication used in various therapies is a means of communicating with a person’s inner self. The energetic breath scan (EBS) is another method of communication used in EDT, in which the practitioner observes the flow of energy through his or her own energetic field as described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0898010113488992">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<p>The EDT takes place between the person and his or her inner self, otherwise referred to as the inner wisdom, inner physician, soul, or All. The information accessed through EDT can be transmitted through various tools. One is through the EBS, where imbalances in the energetic field are sensed through bodily sensation and intuition. The other is the y/n communication, which can confirm findings of the EBS and also provide alternative avenues of exploration.</p>
<p>The y/n in EDT is established through sensory training of the hands. Sensation of directional change in the hand indicating yes and no is perceived in response to questions posed by the practitioner. The y/n dialogue allows for exploration into the many aspects of causes and solutions for presenting problems. The choice of different healing vibrations such as color, music, words, and prayer can be explored and offered through the y/n dialogue. On completion of the energetic intervention, the practitioner returns to the physical professional guidelines to determine change or improvement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010113488992">Table 1</xref> documents the thyroid function and perception of pain for the patient from October 30, 2007, at the beginning of interferon treatment through May 19, 2008. His perception of pain stayed at the 3-4/10 range until January 2008 where he began to become more symptomatic of achiness, soreness, and pain in the range of 6-7/10. In March, his pain increased, along with elevated TSH, which is indicative of decreased thyroid function, a documented side effect of interferon treatment. EDT offered on March 7 provided immediate relief of pain in the range of 4/10. A follow-up blood test in April 2008 indicated improved TSH values and continued lower levels of pain.</p>

<title>Case Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The client experienced the expected achiness of interferon from the beginning of treatment in July 2007. He developed thyroditis in October 2007 and subsequently became hypothyroid in March 2008. Energy dialogue sessions were initiated in March 2008. In this case study, subsequent to the EDT there was a 40% relief of pain, which improved progressively over the month. There was also an improvement in TSH values, moving toward normal thyroid function.</p>
<p>Systemic effects of PI&amp;R therapy include fatigue, nausea, muscle achiness, and thyroid dysfunction. The literature does not cite any cases of thyroid function normalizing during the year’s duration of PI&amp;R therapy. Also, the literature does not describe the use of nonpharmaceutical intervention to relieve symptoms of treatment. In this case study, using EDT, there was a 30% to 40% relief of symptoms of fatigue and achiness and the thyroid function was moving toward normalization.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of EDT requires quieting of the mind and sensing and balancing of energetic restriction in the client’s field. Quieting of the mind has been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010113488992">Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010113488992">Teasdale et al., 2000</xref>), and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010113488992">Bonadonna, 2003</xref>). It has also shown clinically significant changes in bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010113488992">Nash, 1982</xref>), hemolysis of red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010113488992">Braud, 1992</xref>), and increasing cellular messengers of healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010113488992">Kiang, Ives, &amp; Jonas, 2005</xref>). The uniqueness of EDT is that it expands the quieting of the mind to actual dialogue and sensing of imbalances in the field that allows the patient to nonverbally guide the practitioner.</p>
<p>Based on this research and the preliminary findings, EDT should be explored for inclusion as part of the physical therapy for those suffering with systemic effects of PI&amp;R and other stress-related diseases. EDT demonstrates the influence a practitioner can have in choosing the healing possibilities of clients. As there is currently limited documentation of the EDT and only anecdotal and case study evidence to assess its practical and effective application, the authors encourage a structured study of its use in multiple sites.</p>

<title>Energy Dialogue Technique</title>
<p>EDT offers two methods of communicating with a person’s inner self to identify and balance the energy field. The two methods are (a) EBS and (b) a y/n communication.</p>
<p>In the EBS, the practitioner observes the flow of energy through his or her own field to identify areas of imbalance. This awareness, experienced in the field of the practitioner, reflects imbalance in the field between the client and the practitioner. The imbalance is corrected by paying attention to the area identified. Quiet presence and breathing in the identified area allows the field to “shift.” This can be felt as many different types of sensations, including heat, tingling, throbbing, areas of restriction that clear up, sensations of release, and ease of movement.</p>
<p>The practitioner first senses and balances his or her own field prior to engaging in exploration of the extended field of the client. The EBS identifies imbalances in the energetic field of the practitioner that can be balanced with awareness and consciousness. The dialogue is the awareness that can be felt of energetic imbalances. This dialogue can expand with continued awareness and sensation of shifts and changes in the energetic flow in response to nonvocal questions offered by the practitioner.</p>
<p>The EBS is about sensing the energy flow in and around the body. There are many different fields pulsing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010113488992">Figures A1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0898010113488992">A4</xref>. Allow your inner self to act as a guide to direct where to pay attention. Your awareness may be drawn to specific or multiple locations. Once you have entered the quiet space of your inner self, allow yourself to become quiet and receptive. It is important to be willing and ready to simply listen and pay attention. It is also important to allow the inner self to guide whatever is being sensed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010113488992">Figure A1</xref> shows a flow of energetic movement up from the feet through the center of the body and, once reaching the head, turns and flows through the outer perimeter of the body.</p>

<p>The y/n in EDT is established through sensory training of the hands. Sensation of directional change in the hand indicating yes and no is perceived in response to questions posed by the practitioner. Y/n questions are offered that guide the practitioner in balancing the field and providing a healing environment. The EDT brings awareness of imbalance that can be corrected through breath, consciousness, or vibration chosen by the inner self of the practitioner. The y/n can confirm findings of the EBS and provide alternative avenues of exploration. The y/n dialogue allows for exploration into the many aspects of causes and solutions for presenting problems. The choice of different healing vibrations such as color, music, words, and prayer can be explored and offered through the y/n dialogue.</p>
<p>A method of learning y/n is to begin in a seated position. Let your nondominant hand rest gently on your thigh. This position is recommended for comfort as well as leaving the dominant hand available to write or take notes on the dialogue.</p>
<p>Very gently let your hand drift toward you, toward your body as a signal of yes, and then let your hand drift or move away from you as a signal of no. This pattern is repeated 20 times. It is an exercise of establishing an agreed-on motion or sensation to communicate y/n. As an exercise, the movement is initiated by you. It is a small almost imperceptible motion. Repeat, “Show me yes,” and move your hand toward yourself, and “Show me no,” and move your hand away from yourself.</p>
<p>Once this movement has been established and agreed on between you and your inner self, the language of the dialogue is in motion. Begin with simple questions to assure accuracy of response. The y/n is a sensation felt in response to a question. You are listening with your hand.</p>
<p>Questions to gain confidence in the y/n are the following:</p>
<p>Show me yes________ Show me no________ Am I ________ (your name)</p>
<p>For the first level of EDT, use the y/n as confirmation of what is sensed in the EBS or as an alternate means to engage in dialogue with the field.</p>
<p>Suggested questions to begin the y/n dialogue may include the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0898010113488992" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Is my awareness providing a healing environment?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Should I stay here longer?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there disturbance in my field?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is it best to end the session now?</p></list-item>
</list>

<title>Preparation for Energy Dialogue Technique</title>
<p>Both forms of EDT, the EBS and the y/n, require quieting of the practitioner’s mind, also known as “Being in the Now” to allow increase of awareness of the inner field. The goal of quieting the mind is to allow increased awareness of the flow of the energetic field. Our minds get locked into chronic chatter (i.e., worry over upcoming activities or chronic review of what was.) The chronic mind chatter drives us into the future or holds us rehashing the past, interfering with the ability to perceive and engage with energetic awareness. The state of being and having a quiet mind has independent value in strengthening the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010113488992">Pert, 1985</xref>), promoting relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010113488992">Benson, Kotch, &amp;Crassweller, 1977</xref>), and creating a healing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010113488992">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010113488992">Grossman et al., 2004</xref>). Quieting of the mind opens the door to accessing the sensation and awareness of the energetic field.</p>
<p>Suggested methods of quieting the mind include the following:</p>
<list id="list3-0898010113488992" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Breathing exercises that follow the breath through the body (familiar to those who practice yoga, tai chi, and chi gong)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>External mindfulness brings focus and attention to a specific movement or sensation outside of the body—for example, mindful walking where attention is given to all the sensations involved in the movement of walking, paying attention to the sensation of water running over one’s hands, or paying attention to the sensation of holding a soft toy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010113488992">Hunt, 1989</xref>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Biofeedback using, for example, the HeartMath@ feedback unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010113488992">McCraty, Atkinson, &amp; Bradley, 2004</xref>) that guides the individual into a relaxed state using auditory and visual cues of a slowing heart rate</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It takes time and discipline to learn how to quiet the mind and sense the field. As one expands the skill of quieting the mind, access to sensing the field also expands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0898010113488992">
<title>Step 1: Scan</title>
<p>Sit quietly and sense if any particular part of your body or field is brought to your awareness. It is possible to feel throbbing or pulsing in a particular area. Pay attention to the quality and symmetry of flow. Pay attention. Does the flow feel like a thin trickle or an even, full flow? Do you sense blocks where the EBS does not go? Do you sense irregular patterns or even pulling that throws off your balance? Your field or your inner self is showing you where there are energetic imbalances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0898010113488992">
<title>Step 2: Observing</title>
<p>Bring awareness to this area. Patiently observing without judgment or active intervention can be enough to shift, clear, and balance the area. You know this has happened when you can sense an ease and opening in the area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0898010113488992">
<title>Step 3: Exploration</title>
<p>Mentally, ask, “Is there more?” Asking this question presents the intent to allow and sense more in the field. Wait and see if awareness is taken to another part of the body or field and repeat Steps 1 and 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0898010113488992">
<title>Step 4</title>
<p>As an exercise in exploring the EBS, simply asking a question expands awareness. Offer to explore the flow of the pelvic floor and allow your awareness to begin from the pelvic floor upward. Allow yourself to sense symmetry of flow generally through the area, sensing if your awareness is brought to any particular location. If your awareness is brought to an area, or if a block or asymmetry is sensed, stay there. Breathe. This could take a few minutes before sensing a shift in the flow. You are clearing and balancing your field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0898010113488992">
<title>Step 5</title>
<p>Continue exploration. Offer to explore the abdomen, thorax, neck, and head. Allow that with each of these steps it is possible to feel flow in and out of the body. Some practitioners find it helpful to write down or draw descriptions of what is experienced.</p>
<p>Steps 1 to 5 are exercises in sensing the flow of the energetic field that is pulsing continuously through and around our bodies. The awareness of this flow accomplishes two things. First, it identifies areas of energetic imbalance that can be balanced with awareness. Second, it establishes a means of nonverbal dialogue. The field responds to our thoughts and questions. A question can be thought and the answer felt in the body.</p>
<p>All wisdom and knowing is held in the field. The EBS directs the dialogue to actually be experienced in the field itself. The dialogue is felt and experienced in or around the body. When a question is asked, the answer is palpated or sensed. It is important to learn how to ask a question and to understand the limitations of words and language.</p>
<p>This type of dialogue will not reveal a story of what has happened in a person’s life, nor will it reveal a cause for disease or tell someone what to do. This dialogue will show location of imbalance. Once sensed, awareness and consciousness to the area may be enough to shift and balance the field. Once a sense of comfort is felt with the experience of the flow of the energetic field, it is possible to expand this dialogue.</p>
<p>Examples of simple statements to expand the EBS include the following:</p>
<list id="list4-0898010113488992" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Show me where to best pay attention to facilitate a healing environment for myself.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Show me where to best pay attention to all that interferes in my healing environment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Show me where I hold _______ (emotion, thought, event, or anything that you may feel is present).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Once an area is identified, staying and breathing in that area will facilitate further balance of the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0898010113488992">
<title>Summary of Energetic Breath Scan and Yes/No</title>
<p>The EBS allows sensing and exploring of the energetic fields that pulse and flow in and around the body. It can be used to identify imbalances, blocks, and distortion that can translate into physical symptoms. Awareness and presence brought to these areas can promote energetic balance that can be observed with an improved sense of well-being as well as changes in physical symptoms. The y/n palpation can be used to confirm findings in the EBS. It can be further developed in expanding the energy dialogue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0898010113488992">
<title>Application of EBS and Yes/No in Clinical Practice</title>
<p>Health practitioners use multiple measurements to assess patient status in determining a treatment plan. Mindfulness Meditation has already been suggested as a valuable exercise for health practitioners in heightening their awareness and clinical skills. Expanding the skill of mindfulness to include the EBS and y/n palpation may serve as an additional tool in developing a more balanced therapeutic intervention. The full breadth of the energy dialogue has not been presented here. Yet, even in this modified form, this tool can be used in a practical clinical setting.</p>
