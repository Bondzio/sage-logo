<abstract>
<p>Asthma is a serious health issue for older adults. Among Australians aged 55 years and older, asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality are relatively high by international comparison and compared to other age groups. As people age, the diagnosis of asthma becomes more complicated, primarily due to comorbid conditions. Treatment and self-management are also more difficult in this age group due to the different medications prescribed for multiple conditions. At the same time, older adults do not perceive that they are susceptible to developing asthma, and they do not consider asthma to be a particularly serious disease, especially compared to other diseases. Therefore, the consequences and impacts of asthma on older people are underestimated by the older adults themselves. Furthermore, there is a lack of awareness among older adults that certain symptoms could be indicative of asthma. In many countries, there has been a strong emphasis on asthma promotion directed at children or parents. Overall, these interventions have been effective and have contributed to the decline in asthma mortality and morbidity in children and adolescents. Many of these effective interventions have utilized a social marketing framework in combination with behavioral theories and other health promotion strategies. Recent social marketing interventions targeting other health behaviors among older adults have been effective in changing health behaviors, leading to improved health outcomes. Thus, we argue that the social marketing framework should be utilized to develop asthma initiatives to increase asthma knowledge and encourage older adults to take control of their respiratory symptoms.</p>

<p>Asthma awareness interventions directed at older adults are needed to address the high levels of asthma morbidity and mortality among adults aged 55 years and older. Despite the serious impact of asthma on the health of older people, asthma awareness activities have not directly targeted this group. Interventions addressing childhood asthma over the past three decades have been successful in reducing asthma morbidity and mortality among younger people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713476951">1</xref></sup> At the same time, the impact of asthma on older adults has worsened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713476951">2</xref></sup> A recent review recommended the development and implementation of interventions to increase community awareness and understanding of asthma in older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713476951">3</xref></sup> The purpose of this article is to highlight the impact asthma has on older adults, review the effectiveness of asthma awareness interventions, and argue for the social marketing framework as an appropriate foundation for future interventions.</p>

<title>Impact of Asthma on Older Persons</title>
<p>The prevalence of diagnosed asthma in older adults in Australia is approximately 10%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713476951">2</xref></sup> which is high by international comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713476951">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713476951">4</xref></sup> Recent research has concluded that asthma is underdiagnosed in older adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713476951">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129713476951">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150129713476951">6</xref></sup>; the actual prevalence of asthma in this population has been estimated at 15%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129713476951">7</xref></sup> 25%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129713476951">8</xref></sup> and up to 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129713476951">9</xref></sup> Asthma mortality is much higher for older adults; almost 90% of deaths attributed to asthma are people aged 55 and older.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129713476951">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, asthma has a considerable impact on quality of life; “years of life lost due to disability” accounts for approximately 65% of the asthma burden in older Australian adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713476951">2</xref></sup> Older adults with asthma report significantly lower quality of life compared with those without the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150129713476951">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129713476951">12</xref></sup> Asthma not only has a serious impact on older adults with the disease but also on the community health system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713476951">2</xref></sup> with the average length of stay in hospital for people admitted for asthma being 4.3 days for those aged 55 years and older, compared with an average stay of 2.2 days across individuals of all ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129713476951">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Complexity of Diagnosis</title>
<p>Contrary to the general community perception that asthma is a childhood disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129713476951">14</xref></sup> it does develop in older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129713476951">15</xref></sup> Asthma is difficult to diagnose in older people for a number of reasons. Many older adults do not report asthma-related symptoms to their doctor, often assuming that respiratory difficulties are a normal part of ageing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129713476951">16</xref></sup> Comorbid conditions are common in older people, and many of the key asthma symptoms overlap with those of other respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129713476951">17</xref></sup> and some non-respiratory diseases such as congestive heart failure and gastroesophageal reflux disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129713476951">18</xref></sup> Consequently, doctors have the difficult task of ascertaining the correct diagnoses of (potentially) multiple conditions and then determining an appropriate combination of medications to treat the various presenting symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129713476951">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2150129713476951">
<title>Asthma Knowledge and Perceptions</title>
<p>The available research on asthma knowledge and perceptions of older adults indicates that they have poor knowledge and inaccurate perceptions of their susceptibility to asthma as well as the severity of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129713476951">14</xref></sup> Older persons do not perceive they are susceptible to developing asthma and do not consider asthma a particularly serious condition, especially compared with other chronic diseases. Furthermore, there is a lack of awareness among older adults that certain symptoms could indicate asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129713476951">18</xref></sup> Tightness in the chest and a persistent cough at night are key signs of asthma, though older adults may attribute these signs to another condition, or even to old age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129713476951">16</xref></sup> Due to the lack of knowledge and low perceived susceptibility, there is a demonstrated need to raise awareness that certain respiratory symptoms experienced by older people may be indicative of asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129713476951">9</xref></sup> In this way, asthma-focused health promotion activities directed at older people should lead to more people talking to their doctor about their experience of respiratory symptoms. Older adults with diagnosed asthma could acquire self-management skills and, in the medium to long term, improve their health-related quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129713476951">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>Scopus, CINAHL Plus, and Web of Science were used to search for evaluated asthma awareness interventions, using the following terms: asthma, campaign, intervention, promotion, knowledge, awareness, and evaluation. The results were limited to articles published after January 1990. Scopus retrieved 290 articles, CINAHL Plus 52 articles, and Web of Science 166 articles. Studies were included when the intervention aimed to increase asthma knowledge or awareness, the intervention used media or mass communication channels, and the intervention was evaluated. The exclusion criteria were no intervention, no evaluation, school- or hospital-based education programs, interventions to educate physicians or other health professionals, asthma self-management interventions, environmental interventions, drug trials, and interventions focusing on diseases and issues other than asthma. The reference lists of selected articles were also examined to find other studies for inclusion. Seven published studies satisfied the set criteria. Many of these effective interventions used social marketing techniques in combination with behavioral theories and other health promotion strategies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150129713476951">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The social marketing framework, defined as “the systematic application of marketing, alongside other concepts and techniques, to achieve specific behavioral goals, for a social good,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2150129713476951">32</xref></sup> can be applied to the development of asthma interventions targeting older adults. Health promotion interventions utilizing this framework have the potential to increase asthma knowledge and awareness in the community and improve self-management behaviors of those with respiratory symptoms. The social marketing process is a consumer-centered approach involving the target audience in the planning, message and materials development and pretesting stages through to intervention implementation, final evaluation, and feedback for future promotion efforts with similar audiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2150129713476951">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two recent reviews of the application of social marketing techniques to public health interventions have concluded that social marketing can effectively change specific health behaviors and improve the health of a wide variety of target groups in a range of settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2150129713476951">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2150129713476951">35</xref></sup> The reviews highlight the usefulness of social marketing as a “toolkit” of effective techniques and strategies to change behavior that can be modified and adapted according to a particular health issue. Importantly, evaluations of recent health promotion interventions have demonstrated the positive impact of social marketing on the health outcomes of older adults. Thus, social marketing interventions targeting older adults have successfully increased physical activity levels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2150129713476951">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2150129713476951"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2150129713476951"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2150129713476951">39</xref></sup> improved nutritional behaviors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2150129713476951">40</xref></sup> increased screening for various diseases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2150129713476951">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2150129713476951">42</xref></sup> and improved knowledge of specific health issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2150129713476951">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2150129713476951">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2150129713476951"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2150129713476951"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2150129713476951"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2150129713476951"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2150129713476951">48</xref></sup></p>

<td>Researchers need to actively involve older persons from the target population in all stages of the research. Older adults must be involved in the initial planning phases and then throughout intervention development, implementation, and evaluation. The literature and evaluations of previous health promotion campaigns targeting similar groups need to be examined in order to incorporate recommendations from past interventions.</td>

Qualitative research methods, such as focus groups, would enable an understanding of older people’s reactions to proposed intervention messages and materials.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Behavior</td>
<td>Social marketing efforts should promote particular behaviors to the target audience. For example, interventions directed at older adults with uncontrolled respiratory symptoms need to support these individuals to seek further information about asthma and encourage them to discuss their unexplained symptoms with their doctor. This, in turn, may lead to the adoption of appropriate self-management behaviors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exchange</td>
<td>The concept of exchange appreciates that there are costs involved for an individual to gain the benefits offered by an intervention. Interventions should provide solutions to uncontrolled respiratory symptoms and empower older adults to take control of their health. The primary benefit that would be offered to older adults with respiratory symptoms is the opportunity to improve their health-related quality of life and the ability to participate more fully in the activities they enjoy. However, individuals must give up their time to seek information; there may be costs involved with visiting the doctor; and the new knowledge that their symptoms could indicate asthma could cause psychological distress.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Competition</td>
<td>Health promotion interventions must compete for audiences’ time and attention. In this instance, other local and national health promotion interventions conducted in the same timeframe are considered the primary competition. Unfortunately, commercial advertising also competes with health promotion efforts, often promoting negative health behaviors that hinder the attainment of optimal health. For example, advertisements for cigarettes and fast food encourage smoking and increase obesity, both of which have been linked to asthma and respiratory symptoms more broadly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Methods Mix</td>
<td>Interventions are most effective when a combination of appropriate methods and theories are integrated to best understand and reach the older adult audience. This can be achieved by using best-practice methods for data collection in formative phases and then determining the most effective marketing mix to promote asthma to older people; addressing the 4Ps of product, price, place, and promotion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Segmentation</td>
<td>Health promotion interventions are rarely effective when target audiences are assumed to have the same perceptions and behaviors. Older adult audiences need to be segmented according to relevant variables. In the case of asthma promotion, these variables could include asthma threat perceptions, recent experience of respiratory symptoms, and the presence of an asthma diagnosis, among other demographic, socioeconomic, and psychographic characteristics. Segmentation enables targeted messaging to specific groups of older adults on the basis of their distinct asthma knowledge and perceptions.</td>

<p>Social marketers must be consumer oriented from the planning stage through to evaluation of an intervention; older adults must be involved to ensure maximum engagement with intervention messages and targeted behaviors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713476951">Table 2</xref>). This means consulting with the target audience in an open, participatory manner to understand their experiences and needs in relation to respiratory health. Moreover, insight into the asthma knowledge and perceptions of older individuals is crucial to intervention success (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713476951">Table 2</xref>). Andrews and Jones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129713476951">14</xref></sup> gained a preliminary understanding of older adults’ asthma perceptions; they tended to perceive that they were not susceptible to developing asthma and did not perceive asthma as a particularly serious disease.</p>
<p>The social marketing framework highlights the need to incorporate behavior change theories into intervention development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713476951">Table 2</xref>). The most effective interventions that result in sustained, voluntary healthy behaviors are underpinned by evidence-based behavior change theories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2150129713476951">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2150129713476951">50</xref></sup> Individuals will not engage in intervention activities without receiving something in return; an exchange must occur (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713476951">Table 2</xref>). Older adults might take action and see their doctor about their respiratory symptoms if they perceive that they will gain something that they value, for example, a greater ability to participate in physical activities.</p>
<p>Social marketers must be aware of competing campaigns and messages that are aimed at older adults and take into account the possible effects that these could have on their perceptions and actions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713476951">Table 2</xref>). As in all marketing efforts, the social marketing mix of product, price, place, and promotion of asthma must be carefully considered to address the needs of older adults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713476951">Table 2</xref>). Social marketers must offer a valued product focused on respiratory health, for a price that older adults are willing to pay, at the right place, and at the right time.</p>
<p>Finally, the meaningful segmentation of the broader older adult population into defined groups is essential for targeting messages and encouraging appropriate asthma-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150129713476951">Table 2</xref>). One evidence-based method for grouping older adults for asthma promotion interventions is to segment the audience on the basis of recent experience of breathlessness and asthma diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2150129713476951">52</xref></sup> This segmentation defines two distinct target groups of older adults who have had recent respiratory symptoms; one group of individuals that have an asthma diagnosis and another group of individuals with no diagnosis who may benefit from seeking medical advice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2150129713476951">
<title>A Pilot Social Marketing Intervention</title>
<p>Specifically, we recommend the development of a pilot social marketing intervention to target a community of older adults. This intervention should take into account the lessons learned from past asthma awareness programs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150129713476951">Table 1</xref>), beginning with formative research with older adults in order to segment the target audience appropriately and tailor the intervention for a particular community. Asthma educators involved in the planning and development of the pilot intervention should engage target audience members to understand the asthma perspectives of older adults and seek expert advice from peak asthma organizations. Individuals or agencies experienced in marketing and design should then use the formative research to create campaign concepts for pretesting with representative members of the target audience.</p>
<p>The implementation of an intervention requires the involvement of many groups and individuals. Asthma educators should enlist staff and community volunteers to disseminate campaign materials, in addition to organizing paid and/or unpaid advertising within the intervention community. Furthermore, asthma educators should seek to partner with organizations that represent potential partners, such as pharmacists and general practitioners, to ensure materials are distributed throughout the community and that health professionals are aware of the asthma intervention and its objectives. Finally, it is important to attract (news/editorial) exposure in media outlets used by older adults during the campaign to engage the target audience.</p>
<p>Recommended intervention outcomes and associated evaluation measures are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150129713476951">Table 3</xref>. Short-term outcomes of campaign materials recognition, message recall, increase in asthma knowledge, and change in asthma perceptions could be measured by a pre- and post-intervention survey to examine the impact of the intervention, preferably compared to a control group that is not exposed to the intervention. Actions undertaken by individuals as a result of the intervention should also be measured; information seeking behaviors such as calling an information line or visiting a Web site could be measured by the frequency of calls and Web site visits, while visits to the doctor regarding respiratory symptoms and increases in self-management behaviors could be examined with deidentified medical records from general practices and medical centers. In the longer term, changes in perceived health-related quality of life could be assessed by a follow-up survey.</p>

<p>All health promotion interventions face potential obstacles to the attainment of intervention objectives. From the perspective of the asthma educator, funding and the costs of developing and delivering effective interventions are often the primary obstacles. Lack of resources and funds may prevent the full incorporation of all evidence-based development, implementation, and evaluation elements of an intervention. Asthma educators should ensure that goals for specific intervention outcomes are realistic and achievable taking into account the resources at their disposal. Additionally, there are potential obstacles faced by the older adults in the target audience. Issues concerning access to medical advice, barriers to seeking information, and older adults’ asthma knowledge and perceptions can affect the success of an intervention. Asthma educators should ensure that these potential obstacles for older adults are identified and addressed in the development of an asthma awareness intervention.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Importance to Asthma and Allergy Educators</title>
<p>Older adults are an important target group for asthma-focused health promotion. The severe impact of the disease on this population, combined with a general lack of asthma knowledge and commonly held misperceptions about asthma, provides a compelling case for the necessity of asthma awareness activities directed at those aged 55 years and older. Asthma and allergy educators need to be aware of undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and undertreated asthma in older persons and make it a priority to raise community awareness that asthma can develop in later years and that the experience of respiratory symptoms is not a normal part of the ageing process. The social marketing framework is recommended to address the issue, by aiming asthma promotion at the community level and involving older adults throughout the process of development and implementation of interventions. The aim of interventions should be two-fold: to identify cases of undiagnosed asthma and to encourage individuals to manage their respiratory symptoms, whether or not they have an asthma diagnosis. The impact of interventions needs to be evaluated initially by examining changes in asthma knowledge and perceptions and, in the longer term, improvements in the respiratory health and quality of life of older people in the target communities.</p>
