<p>This article explains two components in the review process of a university’s principal preparation program. A superintendents’ focus group session and an analysis of other universities’ program profiles revealed a need to eliminate dated courses, include certification in the degree requirements, update the program curriculum with best practice, standards-based content and skills sets needed to succeed in the predominantly Hispanic schools, and create flexible schedules to accommodate the students’ home and professional lives.</p>

<p>The emphasis on the achievement of diverse public school student groups and on high stakes testing necessitates effective and quality leadership preparation programs at the university level. Leadership preparation programs need to produce leaders who can improve and transform schools to higher levels of achievement. To meet this challenge, universities must redesign or innovate programs to better prepare future leaders with the appropriate skill sets to create high-achieving schools through quality and effective leadership. Added to this challenge is the daunting task of preparing leaders to address the needs of the growing minority populations, such as Hispanics.</p>
<p>Researchers in the field of educational leadership have made tremendous progress in understanding the features of university-based leadership preparation programs that are associated with effective leadership practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1538192712441207">University Council for Educational Administration [UCEA], 2011</xref>). Moreover, a growing body of empirical evidence demonstrates that the quality of leadership provided by school and district leaders is highly dependent on the quality of their preparation experiences at the university. Hence increasing numbers of educational leadership programs, particularly those that are members of the University Council of Educational Administration, are engaged in restructuring programs to reflect these new research findings and to make programs more efficacious for the leaders they prepare.</p>
<p>The Educational Leadership faculty at the University of Texas Pan American (UTPA) engaged in a review and redesign of its program to align it to the most recent findings in principal preparation literature and best practices across the nation. The faculty undertook the challenge to better prepare and develop the leadership skill sets needed by its graduates, who serve and lead South Texas schools with predominantly Hispanic enrollment. This case study outlines the department’s collaborative relationship with local superintendents in the initial steps for evaluating and improving the program and coursework of the UTPA principal preparation program.</p>
<sec id="section1-1538192712441207">
<title>The Geographic and Demographic Context of South Texas</title>
<p>UTPA serves the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) of Texas, an area located along the U.S.–México border and populated by 1,533,713 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">Texas Education Agency [TEA], 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538192712441207">Figure 1</xref> provides a map of the RGV region. Thirty-nine public school districts serve 409,469 students in this exceptionally high-need area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>). According to the Texas Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS), 85% of the RGV student population live in poverty in comparison to the State’s 59% student poverty rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>). Hispanic students make up 97% of the public school enrollment in the RGV, compared to a 49% school enrollment of Hispanics statewide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>). Finally, limited-English-Proficient-students are enrolled at almost double the state percentage rate, 36% versus 17% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>). Percentages of LEP students vary within the Region 1 Service Center area, with some schools more segregated and economically disadvantaged than others. The combined impact of poverty and youth of its population give this area a high child poverty rate, in addition to a third significant challenge faced by regional educational leaders—the English language profile children bring to school (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).</p>

<p>This area also suffers from the isolation of being both rural and removed from major population centers in Texas and the United States. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>). Some communities lack the basic amenities that attract employees such as health care facilities, cultural arts venues, movie theaters, and recreational and shopping facilities. Because of this socioeconomic climate, school districts find it difficult to attract talent from other parts of the nation that are well prepared to deal with the challenges being faced by these districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>). There is a scarcity of expertise on how to shape the organization of high poverty schools so that they might be more effective and able to address the academic, social, and other needs of students. Thus the school districts have turned inward in search of their leadership talent within their own ranks of teachers, teachers-leaders, and highly effective counselors and curriculum specialists.</p>
<sec id="section2-1538192712441207">
<title>Poverty Conditions</title>
<p>Studies of hundreds of schools conclude that the socioeconomic status (SES) of a school is the single most important factor affecting student achievement, even stronger than individual student SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1538192712441207">Rumberger &amp; Palardy, 2005</xref>). Although other researchers have compiled their own lists of variables affecting student achievement, the consensus is that the strongest impact comes from socioeconomic status and the factors associated with this trait. Among those factors are mobility, lack of resources, health and social development, and learning opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712441207">Barton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192712441207">Marzano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192712441207">Padron, Waxman, &amp; Rivera, 2002</xref>). South Texas schools have the highest percentage of low-income students in the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Issues Affecting Leaders of Predominantly Hispanic Schools</title>
<p>School leaders must be cognizant of the poverty, the language, the position of power, and the culture of Hispanics and the impact of these issues on a student’s success in the classroom. Being knowledgeable of the culture of Hispanics and best instructional practices for that group provide the impetus for school leadership to initiate instructional practices to improve this group’s academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712441207">Banks &amp; Banks, 2010</xref>; Glickman, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538192712441207">Marzano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192712441207">Padron et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1538192712441207">
<title>The Impact of Poverty on Schools and Children</title>
<p>The Center for Research on Education, Diversity, and Excellence in its 2002 report, <italic>Educating Hispanic Students: Obstacles and Avenues to Improved Academic Achievement</italic>, notes that the lack of certified teachers, the inadequacy of teacher-preparation programs, the presence of inappropriate teaching practices, and school environmental factors affect the performance of Hispanic students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712441207">Barton (2004)</xref> reiterated that less experienced teachers are more frequently found in high minority, low-income campuses. In addition to employing less experienced teachers, high-minority, low-income schools also tend to have more “out-of-field” teachers in their classroom, which is a third factor in student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712441207">Barton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712441207">Ferguson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192712441207">Fuller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712441207">Haycock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1538192712441207">Skrla, 2001</xref>). The availability of certified teachers and effective programs for teacher preparation are crucial to at-risk student success. Yet, less qualified teachers are more likely to be found in high minority or economically disadvantaged schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1538192712441207">Valverde &amp; Scribner, 2001</xref>), such as those found along the Texas–México border area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538192712441207">
<title>English Language Proficiency</title>
<p>Proficiency in the English language is another obstacle impeding Hispanic student achievement. Although many Hispanic students receive their primary school education in Spanish, most Hispanic students are taught in English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712441207">Bets, Zau, &amp; Rice, 2003</xref>), in spite of having limited academic knowledge of the language. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712441207">Bets et al. (2003)</xref> concluded that being a second language learner and being economically disadvantaged were factors causing most of the achievement gap for Hispanics. The Texas–México border area has the highest percentage of English Language Learners (ELL) students and of economically disadvantaged students in the state of Texas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>). Because limited English proficiency has been found to play a role in this group’s inability to match White student performance on state assessment instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1538192712441207">Valdes, 2001</xref>), researchers would expect the Texas–México border area to be low-achieving. However, Texas assessment data identifies more high-performing schools with predominantly Hispanic, low-income ELL enrollment in this area than throughout the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1538192712441207">TEA, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538192712441207">
<title>Empowerment</title>
<p>A third factor in the success of Hispanic and LEP students is their empowerment in the school system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192712441207">Cummins (2000)</xref> identifies four areas of interaction that affect student empowerment. These four areas are (a) academic inclusion of the student’s language and culture, (b) encouragement of the minority in community involvement, (c) encouragement to use language actively, and (d) advocacy for minority students by test creators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192712441207">Cummins (2000)</xref> contends that minorities, such as Hispanics, have not been able to join in the political dialogue due to the lack of power, much of which comes by simply being allowed access to the table of discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1538192712441207">
<title>Cultural Values</title>
<p>A fourth obstacle Hispanics face in the classroom is the clash between the values of a minority culture, specifically the Mexican American culture of south Texas, and the values of the dominant group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1538192712441207">Valladares, 2003</xref>) The Hispanic culture teaches obedience and a hierarchical model of power, translating to the recognition of the teacher as the person in charge of their learning, rather than the students being responsible for their own learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192712441207">Padron et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1538192712441207">Valladares, 2003</xref>). Hispanic children must accommodate their learning to the school setting. In addition, a student’s success for learning can be affected by the way he approaches situations presented to him (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538192712441207">Padron et al., 2002</xref>). Hispanic children have lower percentages of these skills of staying focused on their activities, on being eager to learn, and in paying attention to a speaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192712441207">National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2003</xref>). The result is the continuation of a pattern of low achievement, unless instructional leaders recognize the need for structure and direct instruction until the child experiences success and is motivated to initiate his own learning, when he can be guided into a constructivist setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538192712441207">Roberts, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1538192712441207">
<title>The Imperative to Change Principal Preparation</title>
<p>The accountability requirements both at the state and national level with the No Child Left Behind law, place tremendous pressure on principals to improve student achievement. In this era of high stakes testing, the role of the principal has evolved to become one of an instructional leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712441207">DiPaola &amp; Hoy, 2008</xref>). The principal’s role is more defined in the area of instructional leadership to include expertise in instruction, curriculum, assessment, data analysis, and data-driven decision making. If the role of the principal has evolved from manager to a greater emphasis on instructional leadership, are leadership programs in graduate schools of education adequately preparing new principals to handle these obvious increasing responsibilities? And, are they preparing leaders to address diverse populations, particularly Hispanics?</p>
<p>Because of the great emphasis on a continuous increase of student achievement and school improvement, there is much debate whether leadership preparation programs have stayed abreast of the changing demands of the field. Several studies have documented the resulting lack of preparedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192712441207">Archer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712441207">Azzam, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192712441207">Hess &amp; Kelly, 2005</xref>). In 2003, 67% of the principals surveyed revealed that leadership training in schools of education did not prepare them for their role as instructional leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192712441207">Farkas, Johnson, &amp; Duffett, 2003</xref>). Again in 2007, 69% of the principals shared the same sentiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192712441207">Darling-Hammond, LaPointe, Meyerson, &amp; Orr, 2007</xref>). To add to the discourse, a 2006 survey by Public Agenda, a nonprofit research organization that reports public opinion and public policy issues, found that nearly two thirds of principals felt that typical graduate leadership programs “are out of touch” with today’s realities.</p>
<p>Principal preparation programs place too much emphasize on lectures and theory and not enough on application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192712441207">Martin &amp; Papa, 2008</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1538192712441207">Southern Regional Education Board (2005)</xref> states that, “traditional models of training principals are still out of sync with the challenges faced by today’s leaders” (p. 3). More field-based experiences would provide real-world situations, which would provide the opportunities to apply the theory learned in classroom lectures. Therefore, it is prudent that principal preparation programs become more innovative and include intensively authentic coursework and field experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538192712441207">Orr, 2006</xref>). Principal preparation programs can provide instructional leaders with knowledge, skills, and attributes needed to analyze and interpret data to make informed decisions toward student achievement. To improve current leadership capabilities for our future leaders and followers, the researchers designed this study to identify leadership skills to be taught in principal preparation programs for effective leaders of predominantly Hispanic public schools. The following research questions guided this study:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To prepare for the review of the current leadership preparation program, the researchers compiled a list of all Texas public universities and reviewed the list for the presence of educational leadership preparation programs of study; specifically, a principal preparation program. If such a program existed, various components of the program were noted, such as the number of hours to complete a master’s degree, length of internship, course content, certification requirements, and use of cohort groups. Ten universities were then selected based on demographics most similar to UTPA’s for further review of their programs. The researchers’ intent was to develop a program to include, but not necessarily limit, the courses to those provided by other programs.</p>
<p>The courses in the program were listed and tallied based on program titles and descriptions. In addition, courses that did not appear on the UTPA program were noted, as were those courses which appeared in the UTPA program, but not in any other programs. The list of most frequently occurring courses was compared to the courses included in the UTPA program. The intent was to determine how aligned the courses were to those of similar universities in Texas.</p>
<sec id="section10-1538192712441207">
<title>The Program Review Process</title>
<p>To include research-based best practices, the study looked to literature from UCEA. UCEA identified various components for effective leadership preparation programs. Among the elements are “supportive organizational structures to facilitate student retention, engagement and placement,” “strong, collaborative relationships with local school districts”, and “a systematic process for evaluating and improving programs and coursework” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1538192712441207">UCEA, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1538192712441207">
<title>UTPA’s Current Principal Preparation Program</title>
<p>A summary of the current UTPA principal preparation program is important to the context of this study. Currently, students interested in becoming certified as principals must first acquire a master of education degree in educational leadership. Completion of this 36-hr degree allows students to pursue principal certification, which consists of 9 additional hours. Therefore, students, in reality must complete a 45-hr program before applying for certification. The content in the master’s courses has remained the same for the past three decades. Beyond the principal certification, graduates must expend additional dollars to acquire certification for teacher evaluation and development, which is required by the state of Texas. This economic impact on tuition costs of a 45-hr principal preparation program was also considered in the review of the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1538192712441207">
<title>Review of Other Texas University Programs</title>
<p>The researchers also reviewed the institutional profiles of 42 Texas colleges and universities. The profiles consisted of five components: number of program hours, course content, principal certification requirements, internship, and use of cohorts. The results of that review are summarized below. On completion of the review of institutional profiles, universities with similar demographics were selected for in-depth study.</p>
<sec id="section13-1538192712441207">
<title>Number of program hours</title>
<p>Slightly more than four fifths of the 42 universities offered 36-hr master’s programs in principal preparation. The remaining programs varied in the number of hours, ranging from 37 to 60 hr; the University of Texas Pan American identifies with the 36-hr group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1538192712441207">
<title>Course content</title>
<p>The review indicates that approximately three fourths of the universities offered similar content in their preparation courses. Common content included educational law, instructional leadership, curriculum and instruction, organizational leadership, community leadership, data analysis, and leadership for change. Other common content included ethics, budgeting, human resources, self-awareness, and certification in Instructional Leadership Development (ILD) and the Professional Development and Appraisal System (PDAS). The University of Texas Pan American lacked content in the latter five areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1538192712441207">
<title>Principal certification</title>
<p>Approximately half of the reviewed programs included principal certification within the master’s degree. The other half of the universities offered principal certification after completion of a master’s degree. The University of Texas Pan American’s program was similar to the latter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1538192712441207">
<title>Internship</title>
<p>The review indicated that more than three fourths of the programs required only 3 hr of internship for principal certification. The remainder of the programs required 6 or more hours. The University of Texas Pan American’s program is aligned with the 3 hr of internship required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1538192712441207">
<title>Cohorts</title>
<p>Slightly less than one fourth of the universities used the cohort model to progress students through their coursework. The University of Texas Pan American followed the cohort model.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1538192712441207">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Based on the review of the five areas, the researchers found that (a) principal certification is overwhelmingly included within a master’s program for leadership; (b) almost all programs are 36-hr programs; (c) most universities do not follow a cohort model; (d) most universities have a 3-hr internship course; and lastly, (e) most universities’ course content is aligned to the Texas principal certification competencies. In addition, many of the universities embedded the Texas-required Instructional Leadership Development (ILD) and Professional Development and Appraisal System (PDAS) certification into their program. UTPA’s program needed updating in the areas of course content, principal certification requirements, and the use of cohorts as compared to other Texas universities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1538192712441207">
<title>Superintendents’ Voices</title>
<p>In addition to reviewing the programs of study of 10 specific universities, the researchers used a focus group method to collect data from local superintendents in the review of the current leadership preparation program. The researchers invited the Rio Grande Valley superintendents to respond to a set of three open-ended questions. Qualitative data was collected from 16 superintendents. Faculty recognized that any program redesign should include the superintendents’ perspectives on how well the program prepared the graduates to execute their responsibilities as effective campus leaders. The superintendent input was considered crucial in the review and possible restructure of the principal leadership development program.</p>
<p>The superintendents answered the following focus group questions, which set the tone for the discussion of this article.</p>

<p>The questions, which were open-ended, allowed the superintendents maximum freedom to provide feedback for the review process. The superintendents responded to the questions individually and then shared those responses within their group. Their responses were posted on charts to look for similarities and to provide a venue for additional comments or explanations. Patterns emerged from the responses and were noted by the researchers. The following section provides the results of the data gathered.</p>
<sec id="section20-1538192712441207">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The described case study was conducted during the 2009-2010 academic year using the focus group method as the main data collection technique. It involved the participation of 16 superintendents who lead districts along the Texas–México border. Demographic data of the participants included ethnicity, gender, age, and position. All participants were Hispanic, of whom only two were female, coinciding with the almost total predominance of men in superintendency positions in the Rio Grande Valley. Participant ages varied between 44 and 66 years.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Quite distinct themes surfaced in the superintendents’ responses to the three focus group questions presented to them, which aided in answering both research questions of the study. The results are presented in two sections based on the research questions of the study.</p>
<sec id="section22-1538192712441207">
<title>Results for Research Question 1: Essential characteristics for successful leadership of predominantly Hispanic schools</title>
<p>The superintendents identified specific leadership strengths of UTPA program graduates. Patterns emerged suggesting that UTPA graduates knew the local population and culture, were innovative thinkers, knew curriculum well, knew how to use data, and knew how to implement delivery models for special programs at their campuses. One superintendent stated, “UTPA graduates understand South Texas students, like their financial circumstances. They are familiar with Bilingual Education. They can identify curriculum needs and can lead planning with teachers.”</p>
<p>Knowing the needs of local populations helps in differentiating curriculum. Differentiating curriculum based on students’ needs is important for school change and to increase student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192712441207">Glickman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192712441207">Marzano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1538192712441207">Schmoker, 2006</xref>). Understanding the impact of the local population and responding to cultural practices aids in helping students feel a sense of belonging and acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712441207">Glickman, Gordon, &amp; Ross-Gordon, 2009</xref>). “The graduates are familiar with the experiences of the students in our districts because many of them came from these same areas. They are culturally knowledgeable and culturally sensitive,” stated one superintendent, while another added, “They have awareness of the needs and strengths of the local population. They are culture cognizant.”</p>
<p>The use of data in decision making is imperative if school leaders truly want to improve student achievement. By analyzing various types of data, such as performance scores, demographics, delivery of instruction, and school processes, schools can make better decisions on how to meet the students’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712441207">Bernhardt, 2009</xref>). The superintendents felt UTPA graduates were adept in analyzing data, as evidenced by the following comment, “The students are data-aware and are familiar with data disaggregation. They are technology savvy and can create graphs and reports as decision makers.”</p>
<p>The superintendents also voiced leadership skills UTPA graduates needed to further develop while enrolled in the principal preparation program. Their responses produced the following themes:</p>
<list id="list3-1538192712441207" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Increasing personal leadership skills, such as exhibiting assertiveness;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Knowing how to address parents;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Applying their knowledge to work situations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Understanding accountability;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Preparing budgets;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Knowing and using current best practices; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Evaluating and developing teachers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Effective principals are assertive and use their communication skills in working with teachers and the community to reach the school’s goals and vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192712441207">Glickman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538192712441207">Marzano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1538192712441207">Strong, Richard, &amp; Catano, 2007</xref>). Members of the focus group stated that “We need them (the graduates) to show personal assertiveness” and “They need to develop a strong grip with student discipline management.” Participants at one table wrote, “They need persistence and assertiveness. They need counseling skills in addressing concerns with staff and parents.”</p>
<p>Not only does a principal need to be an instructional leader, he or she is expected to possess managerial skills. One of those very important skills is the development of the budget. Principals adhere to budget planning and allocations based on student data analysis of state assessment results for regular and special populations of the school. The superintendents suggested more emphasis on this skill. One response was, “The graduates need to balance management and instructional leadership needs. They need to be strong in both. Like budget preparation and staff development needs.” Another response echoed the sentiment, with “They need more work in budget preparation and the whole process.”</p>
<p>School principals must ensure every child is receiving good instruction from an effective teacher. Most school districts in Texas use the Professional Development and Appraisal System (PDAS) for this purpose. Principals conduct observations, then, use this instrument to guide teachers through professional development and improvement. The participating superintendents related that the graduates should “show consistency in evaluations and PDAS.” They included that they wanted “follow-up and documentation, and growth plans for teachers” as part of the preparation program</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1538192712441207">
<title>Results for Research Question 2: Components essential to a quality principal preparation program</title>
<p>The superintendents had various concerns regarding UTPA’s accommodation of the program students’ class schedules, stating that the superintendents’ greatest priority and that of the graduates is always the success of the districts’ children. They suggested flexibility and options when classes met to accommodate the graduates students’ employment responsibilities; for example, having classes meet all day on Saturdays, or meeting on Friday afternoons and Saturday mornings to maximize learning time in the courses taken. In addition, they stated that weekday classes should begin later than the current schedule of 4:30 p.m. They felt that beginning classes after 5:00 p.m. and before 6:30 p.m. would provide students with less stress and perhaps better attendance due to commuting time and family responsibilities. UTPA is largely a commuter school where the majority the Educational Administration students teach at local schools and attend the university after working hours. Because the majority of students commute daily to the university and the program is scheduled for students to enroll in classes as cohorts, the superintendents also felt that meeting at the cohorts’ districts would benefit the students logistically, as well as encourage communication and collaboration between the districts and the university.</p>
<p>Flexibility in the delivery of instruction was also thought to benefit students’ schedules. In this case, the flexibility was in combining face-to-face and online courses. The department currently provides the majority of its classes in traditional face-to-face classroom format. Several reduced-seating classes have been developed to allow students some autonomy in choosing their preferred learning setting. As in the public school setting, differentiation allows instructors to meet the needs of more students.</p>
<p>The superintendents suggested increasing the amount of time in field-based strategies within the program’s coursework. Literature encourages the use of field-based strategies within the schools and school systems to prepare future leaders for real-world problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538192712441207">Orr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538192712441207">Reames, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1538192712441207">UCEA, 2011</xref>), such as developing a plan to increase student achievement or working with a teacher to improve the delivery of instruction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538192712441207">Reames (2010)</xref> writes that, “There must be organizational commitment from all parties to include the voices from the field in instruction, intern experiences, and maintenance and evaluation of the program” (p. 447).</p>

<title>Recommendations and Conclusions</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to review and improve the current principal preparation program at the University of Texas Pan American. One component of this process included using the findings from a local superintendents’ focus group session. Although previous studies have been conducted by other universities to redesign similar programs, no studies were available for leaders of schools with predominately Hispanic students.</p>
<p>The findings from this research were highly suggestive that the department should use the superintendents’ feedback in the review of its principal preparation program as it aspires to prepare leaders for predominantly Hispanic schools. The findings suggest that the selection of current program courses is leaving gaps in graduates’ skills sets needed to become more effective school leaders. Currently superintendents have to provide additional training and development of graduates to ensure total preparation for leadership in the local schools.</p>
<p>In response to the superintendents concerns, university courses must be reinvented to provide the additional skills sets needed for quality leadership. More field experiences must be incorporated into the program to allow the principal candidates to be mentored as they apply their knowledge of best practices. To accommodate the principal candidates’ work and family responsibilities class schedules need to be examined and adjusted. Changes in class schedules will align with the family values and the strong work ethic of the principal candidates’ culture. The delivery of instruction by the university faculty should be varied to include face-to-face classroom instruction, reduced seating classes, online classes, weekend classes, and school-based seminars at the local school districts. Curriculum should include delivery models of bilingual education in response to the targeted Hispanic population. By accommodating the graduates’ schedules and the local student population’s needs, the university will also enhance its partnership with local school districts.</p>
<p>The study also revealed essential components for a quality preparation program and essential leadership skill sets for successful leaders of predominantly Hispanic schools. In conclusion, this study revealed the need for stakeholder input in devising changes in the principal preparation program. Consideration of the findings suggests the following recommendations be considered in redesigning its principal preparation program for leaders of predominantly Hispanic schools:</p>
<list id="list4-1538192712441207" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Complete the in-depth review of university principal preparation programs within Texas to provide a more comprehensive background and support for a program redesign.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complete the review of the current principal preparation program to determine which courses are aligned to the results of the review and the Texas Examination of Educator Standards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The program should be redesigned to incorporate the findings of the study and the results of the program evaluation using UCEA’s theoretical framework for producing quality principal preparation programs. Those features include</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Vigorous recruitment and selection;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A strong curriculum focus on instruction and school improvement;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coherent curriculum that is tightly integrated with fieldwork;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Active learning strategies;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quality internships; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Knowledgeable faculty.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, the redesigned program should align with the leadership models of universities serving similar demographics. The redesign of the program should include course content in budgeting, human resources, and self awareness. The program should also embed principal certification and ILD and PDAS certification into its content.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This study proved to be invaluable to the educational leadership department, as it collaborated with local school districts to improve its leadership preparation program and coursework to meet its goal of retaining, engaging, and developing quality leaders before placing them in the predominantly Hispanic schools. This new program for principal preparation can support issues that affect leaders of predominantly Hispanic schools. The new program will better prepare leaders who are sensitive to the cultural issues of poverty, language, position of power, and how these issues affect the student achievement of Hispanic students along the Texas–México border. Finally, this can be accomplished through the redesign of course content and alignment activities incorporating the findings of this study.</p>
