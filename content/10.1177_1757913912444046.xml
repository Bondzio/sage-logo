<p>Is anyone interested in a section on water related public health topics? I would have thought that a discussion on water and development issues; good source protection techniques; changes on thinking on drinking water standards; the benefits of water safety plans; and risk assessment would be a good idea. There could also be a useful part to play for discussions on any news items or research that has happened - like slugs carrying O157! What do you think?</p>

<p>I am keen to know whether there is much appetite for any discussions on the impact of physical activity/exercise on public health? Despite the World Health Organization noting that low physical activity levels were the fourth most significant controllable risk factor for mortality in 2004 (with more deaths attributed to it than obesity, high cholesterol or low fruit and vegetable intake), it often feels to me that this is a neglected area of health promotion advice (or one in which the benefits are wrongly attributed as being solely secondary to changes in other biometric markers).</p>
<p>So, does anyone have any interesting questions about physical activity/exercise and prevention of disease, its therapeutic role in diseases or how to advise patients on appropriate levels of activity?</p>

<p>We all understand that poor housing = poor health, overcrowding = increased stress and that young people cannot afford to leave home and start their own families and that there is a lack of affordable homes for key workers in major cities.</p>
<p>Yet, government policy seems to be aimed at reducing the amount of funding available to ‘social landlords’ - a network which is not perfect but must be seen as a tried and tested, cost-effective delivery system and which doesn’t need any new infra-structure spending. They also have the advantage of being able to manage their investment over a longer period than a parliamentary term.</p>
<p>Instead, policy seems bent on directing funding straight to large building contractors [who, on the whole, build smaller homes of a lower build standard - ‘in order to get people onto the housing ladder’] In my opinion, this will artificially increase the cost of small first time homes as the price edges up to meet the increased funding.</p>
<p>Why the emphasis on buying?</p>
