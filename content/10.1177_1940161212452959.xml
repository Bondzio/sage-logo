<p>This issue focuses on the structure and performance of the news media in Central and Eastern Europe, and their interaction with the political world. It aims to map and explain some of the curious, if not problematic, features of a media landscape that has emerged in the region alongside the rapid transition to democracy and a market economy. The intellectual agenda for this special issue was designed as part of a large international project on this topic sponsored by the European Research Council. (For more details see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mde.politics.ox.ac.uk">http://mde.politics.ox.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1940161212452959">
<title>Regional Paradox</title>
<p>We find a curious paradox when we examine the relationship between the media and democracy in Central and Eastern European countries. All of the countries are said to be consolidated democracies, and thus they represent a favorable environment for the media to act as a free and unbiased provider of information, to counterbalance political bias through independent and critical reporting, and to serve as an arena for public discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212452959">Klingemann et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161212452959">Zielonka 2001</xref>). Yet numerous studies talk about the capture of the media in the region by a variety of political and business actors. For instance, despite extensive regulatory efforts and parliamentary controls, the media have hardly been freed from political interference. Various studies of electoral campaigns show the degree to which the broadcast media (public service and commercial) is manipulated politically by ruling parties either from the right or from the left. A great swath of the media is in the hands of a few large international media conglomerates that prevent small independent actors from entering the market, and much of the media output is geared toward entertainment rather than provision of information. Local media tycoons are also gaining prominence across the region. Some of them use the media as a means of enhancing their political career and others as a vehicle for generating profits in the other businesses they own with detrimental implications for the independence of their media outlets. Journalists in Central and Eastern Europe seem to be too weak to resist political and economic pressures. While some choose to ally with economic and political leaders operating in an informal mode of “dirty togetherness” others are passive bystanders trying to keep their jobs under very difficult political and economic circumstances. The journalistic profession as such is disintegrated and lacks a clear and strong identity.</p>
<p>Of course, the situation is not identical in the individual countries of the region. Slovenia’s GDP per capita is nearly three times higher than Romania’s with numerous implications for the media. For instance, on average journalists earn around €1,500 a month in Slovenia, but only €500 in Romania. Foreign investment in the media sector is high in Hungary and Estonia, but relatively low in Slovenia and Latvia. Poland in particular seems to defy most common patterns, partly because of its size and partly because of its unique political history. Newspapers such as <italic>Gazeta Wyborcza</italic> are more prosperous than all the other newspapers throughout Central and Eastern Europe. The average viewership rate of public service broadcasters in Poland is much higher than in other countries in the region. Political and business parallelism also seems to be less pronounced in Poland, as well as in Slovenia, than in the other new democracies in the region. In fact, individual countries score quite differently on the Freedom House index of media independence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1940161212452959">
<title>Transitory Pressures</title>
<p>However, despite all these differences there are also some notably similar patterns. Most especially, all of these countries are very much in transition. Of course, one can argue that transition is a common human condition, but in Central and Eastern Europe the transition is profound, multidimensional, and condensed into a relatively short period. First, the newly established democracies are under numerous pressures, which prompt constant corrections and adjustments. Although all these countries have new democratic constitutions in place, political parties are still very much in flux and they try to manipulate the existing rules through either formal or informal channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212452959">Ekiert et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161212452959">Grzymała-Busse 2003</xref>). Second, joining the European Union has also generated an enormous transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212452959">Cremona 2003</xref>). To join the EU, candidates had to adopt some 20,000 EU laws and regulations, including those dealing with the media. Third, a transition has been prompted by the financial crisis that started with the fall of Lehman Brothers, but was soon followed by the crisis of the European single currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212452959">Orenstein 2009</xref>). Some countries such as Hungary and Latvia experienced a sharp fall in their GDP (25% in the case of Latvia), but even those countries that fared relatively better had to follow the EU-imposed austerity measures that particularly affected public service broadcasting. And there is also a transition from the “old” to “new” media, forcing many printed media outlets out of business. The spread of the Internet was much more remarkable in most of the Central and Eastern European countries than in the Western, and especially Southern European ones. For instance, in 2009 Internet penetration was 68.3% in Estonia and 45.9% in Greece (Nordicom, International Media and Communication Statistics 2010).</p>
<p>Thus we are analyzing a group of countries where political organizations appear and disappear in a very short period and where political figures may attain glory within a few months and then suddenly fall out of grace. We are dealing with countries where ownership of the media was completely in the hands of the state and is now chiefly (but not fully) in the hands of multinational and local tycoons. (Not only print media, but also the public service broadcasting in the region, is heavily dependent on advertisement from the private sector). We are dealing with countries where laws are in flux and often contradictory, where the administration is relatively sizable but inefficient, and where the justice system is weak or in some cases even corrupt. In this climate of profound, chaotic and never-ending transition, informal rules tend to dominate over formal ones. State structures are easy targets for political and economic manipulation and business relations are nontransparent and underregulated.</p>
<p>In the absence of political stability and durable institutional arrangements, political and economic actors stick to well-established cultural patterns of patrimonialism, particularism, and favoritism. In this volume, Peter Gross describes the Romanian case in detail where “the troika of pile” (a metaphor for smoothing the way for yourself, relatives, and friends as a <italic>pile</italic>, a tool that smoothens metals), <italic>cunostinte</italic> (acquaintances), and <italic>relatii</italic> (connections) dominate every aspect of life, public and private. These social and cultural patterns were known in Romania long before the communist regime became established and remained in place during the regime’s life when “pile, <italic>cunostinte, relatii</italic>” spelled out the acronym PCR for the Partidul Comunist Roman and was the source of many political jokes. Romania may well be an extreme case here, but even in Poland with its relatively well-functioning economic and democratic system, politicians are constantly talking about “układ,” an informal network of business and political figures exchanging favors, fencing off competition, and promoting partisan regulatory standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1940161212452959">
<title>Media in the Age of Transition</title>
<p>The media have not been passive actors in this process of transition. They have been either victims or predators—or both, depending on circumstances. Central and Eastern European political parties lack members, dynamic organization, and traditional programs. Consequently, they need the media in order to connect to the volatile, if not confused, electorate in the region. This gives the media powerful leverage over the parties, but it also makes the parties eager (or even desperate) to control the media to their own ends. The weakness of civil society across the region has left the media relatively free from public scrutiny, but it has also made it easier for parties to “colonize” the media. The weakness of state structures has given the public media a chance to extract material resources from the state, whereas the private media has benefited from inadequate regulation of their market. However, weak states offer the media little protection against political interference or business manipulation.</p>
<p>So far, it has proved difficult for journalists to develop a strong and clear professional identity in the constantly changing political, economic, and social environment of the postcommunist region. Journalists’ diffuse and frequently overlapping social roles have generated confusion and a lack of coherence. Ongoing legal and regulatory reforms have created uncertainty and a lack of security. The professional status of journalists is still poorly defined in the region. For instance, journalists’ rights in terms of source confidentiality or access to information are unclear. Employers are seldom able or willing to guarantee a proper legal defence for their journalists when cases go to trial. Journalists’ salaries are relatively low in most cases and are often variable. For instance, in most of the countries, royalties based on the “author’s rights” represent a significant but floating part of a journalist’s income. Codes of ethics do exist, but are often not universally recognized by professional journalistic bodies. (A case in point is Estonia, where there is not one but two separate ethics commissions that receive complaints about journalism from the public, and these ethics commissions to some extent act as rivals in the public arena.) The overlap between journalism and other professional activities, such as PR, appears to be widespread and frequent. Indeed, in many Central and Eastern European countries, the majority of student journalists end up in PR. The form of recruitment does not seem to be properly defined and stable, and frequently depends on networks of family or friends. Nor is professional education reflected in the recruitment process in any significant way.</p>
<p>The identity of professional journalists is imprecise, not least because very frequently they are part of volatile clientelistic networks. Some journalists are involved in corrupt activities while others are subjected to economic or even physical threats. Despite the passage of more than two decades since the fall of the communist regimes, journalists in the region have not been able to establish a rooted corpus of skills, practices, and rules. They often fail to differentiate their journalistic profession from other activities, for example, in PR or as party activists.</p>
<p>The nature of most communication enterprises is itself blurred. Oligarchs, who own and use the media to support their private business in the realm of politics and to shape laws and administrative decisions, are quick to promote overlap between the mass media, business, and politics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1940161212452959">
<title>Interpretive Categories</title>
<p>One wonders whether well-established theories commonly applied to politics and the media can be used for analyzing the peculiar circumstances described above. Consider, for instance, the concept of political parallelism, which suggests that media outlets mirror political divisions in individual countries, chiefly along party lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212452959">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>). Media outlets can hardly mirror Central and Eastern European political parties as they are in flux. In other words, media outlets and political parties can seldom overlap in a situation of permanent transition. Nothing is parallel in such a world. True, some media entities establish links with individual political figures to gain protection and extract resources. However, this does not amount to the political parallelism known in such countries as Italy or Spain. In this sense, the situation in Central and Eastern Europe is more akin to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212452959">Duncan McCargo (2012)</xref> called “partisan polyvalence” in the East Asian context. In both regions, the media serve a mixture of economic and political goals, and this distorts their identity and that of their professionals.</p>
<p>In his contribution to this issue, Peter Gross also questions the utility of institutional theories based on a notion of political and media systems. He contends that the silent question is not just what the architecture of a political and media system looks like or how it works, or even what its connecting fibres are (e.g., its rules, regulations, ideologies). If we want to understand how the system really works in a country such as Romania, we must explore the collective and individual ethos of the individuals making them work. The Romanian political and media system may resemble its Western counterparts, but the values and behavior of key actors are quite different. In Romania, according to Gross, the important cultural component of what Western scholars call rational-legal authority is the inclination to evade rules and laws if it is in one’s personal interest and if political connections or economic wherewithal make it possible.</p>
<p>This leads us to another concept frequently applied in the literature: clientelism. The concept is chiefly used to describe the set of relations between politicians and voters or parties and the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212452959">Hallin and Papathanassopoulos 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212452959">Kitschel and Wilkinson 2007</xref>). The concept focuses on the exchange of a citizen’s vote for direct payments or continuing access to employment, goods, and services. It also assumes fairly stable patterns of relations between politicians and parties on one hand, and citizens and the media on the other. However, Henrik Ornerbring’s contribution to this volume shows that in countries undergoing profound transition clientelism is not just an instrument for the distribution of resources but it is essentially an occasion for elite-to-elite communication. Moreover patterns of clientelistic relations are neither institutionalized nor stable. “Advertorials” are used for promoting the interests of the own network and <italic>kompromat</italic> is used to smear rival network members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212452959">1</xref></sup> Such practices occur with regularity outside the election cycle as they serve other network needs, such as positioning allied companies and actors to get public tenders; placing allies in strategic positions in policy making, the legislature, and public administration; and in general affect policy making and policy decisions. A broader definition of clientelism is therefore suggested to take into account the fluidity of political and media institutions and the widespread informal elite-to-elite communication.</p>
<p>This brings us to the issue of the power of the media. In their contribution to this volume, Tworzecki and Semetko reach a very important conclusion: In transitional democracies where the Weberian “threshold of depersonalization,” has not been passed, mass media play a major role in focusing the political debate around individual political figures. This is because political parties are weak and volatile and the media are able to take advantage of this and support or attack individual politicians for their own partisan purposes. Thus on one hand, the media represent the only channel of communication between politicians and citizens, and on the other hand, they are active players in the ongoing political bargaining. This is why economic and political battles over the media are so frequent and important in the region.</p>
<p>The situation in Central and Eastern Europe also demands rethinking the patterns of the relationship between politicians and journalists. The existing literature emphasizes the interdependency between the two sets of actors who need each other’s resources to achieve their objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212452959">Blumler and Gurevitch 1995</xref>). This interdependence is reinforced by frequent personal contact and socialization. The end result is a high degree of cooperation between politicians and journalists notwithstanding that the latter formally perform the role of a watchdog of the former. However, in their contribution to this volume, Voltmer and Pfetsch show that in Central and Eastern Europe the pattern of collaboration between journalists and politicians is different from that usually assumed in the literature. For instance, Bulgarian journalists and politicians hold rather hostile and dismissive views of each other even though they are also involved in a close network of relationships that at times threatens the integrity of journalistic independence. The most worrying aspect of their interdependence is the apparently widespread practice of paid news coverage that involves both politicians exerting pressure through bribes and journalists expecting favors for their services, that is, positive coverage of the commissioning politician or damaging attacks on his or her opponent. These patterns of interlocking relationships correspond with Bulgaria’s broader political culture that emerged from a legacy of “patrimonial communism” and is unknown in Western political culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212452959">Kitschelt et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Two other important differences between Central and Eastern Europe and Western Europe are stressed by Kiss in his contribution to this volume: In transitional democracies, social changes take place faster than in well-established democracies because of the general precariousness of most of the existing institutions and the framework of interpersonal relations. This, as already mentioned, affects the entire political system with parties as well as individual politicians emerging and disappearing quickly. The media is also changing rapidly as exemplified by the development of internet usage in the region. The rapid diffusion of the new media generates a fragmentation of the media system as such. Indeed, since the fall of the Communist regime and the fading of most of the communist-controlled newspapers, hardly any other news organization has been able to reach a large portion of the population. Moreover the weakness of the public broadcasting service (with the exception of Poland) has also caused the fragmentation of television audiences. This fragmentation has obviously curbed the influence of the media. They remain the primary channel of communication, but their relative weakness and dispersion prevents them from acquiring a dominant position within the overall political and economic system in these countries.</p>
<p>In his contribution, Vaclav Stetka sheds light on the role played by the media owners, especially those who own large enterprises. He maps the changing patterns of media ownership in the region focusing on both domestic and foreign owners. While the picture is not uniform from country to country, local business elites are becoming increasingly interested in acquiring media outlets and utilizing them for a variety of economic and political purposes. Not surprisingly therefore there is a growing body of literature pointing to “Italianization” or “Mediterreanization” of the media in Central and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212452959">Wyka 2008</xref>). While conceding that there are certain parallels between Western and especially Southern European moguls and their equivalents in Central and Eastern Europe, Stetka suggests that post-Soviet Eastern Europe offers a more plausible and insightful comparative framework here. It is particularly in Russia and Ukraine where the concentration of media, business, and political power is most prominently in the hands of significant individuals—commonly called oligarchs—made possible by the abrupt fall of communism. It is also there where the practices of instrumentalization of newly privatized media by various “patrons” are an integral part of the local political and media cultures.</p>
<p>Indeed, if the West represents the ideal benchmark, we could say, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212452959">Curran and Park’s (2000)</xref> well-known expression, that a process of “de-Westernization” is also in place that leaves space for the hybridization between the influence of Western professional journalism with the impositions deriving from local conditions and cultural habits. However, it is debatable whether the West does indeed represent the ideal benchmark. After all, Silvio Berlusconi and his Mediaset or Rupert Murdoch and his <italic>News of the World</italic> are Western too. It is therefore more plausible to talk about models related to specific features of the media and politics such as the extent of state intervention in media or dominant patterns of political culture. The case of Central and Eastern Europe urges us to differentiate between relative stable sociopolitical environments and those undergoing profound transitions. It also suggests looking at hybrid systems that combine features of various paradigms and models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1940161212452959">
<title>Which Lessons?</title>
<p>We can learn several lessons from the articles in this special issue. The first is that the interpretive categories used to study social and political realities in such countries as Germany, France, or the United Kingdom are not always appropriate for studying social and political realities in Hungary, Poland, or Estonia. We have already mentioned that the concept of media professionalism developed in the mainstream literature over the past decades cannot be easily applied to the new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. A similar observation was made regarding the concept of political parallelism. This concept makes little sense if applied to countries where political parties are neither strong nor stable, leaving space for individual political figures and a mixture of interests to influence news media. Other categories have also been constructed with reference to established democracies and need to be adjusted to the rapidly changing environment of Central and Eastern Europe. The support of scholars from these countries is essential to build on or adapt the existing categories in the field. This last remark may also be one of the lessons to draw from this special issue.</p>
<p>We also learn that it is impossible to isolate the media from the more general political and social context within which they function. A good knowledge of political science literature (and other literatures in the field of social sciences too) is necessary to place the news media in context and avert the risk of a self-referential approach that detracts from a correct understanding of their role in relation not just to democracy but to other social systems as well.</p>
<p>Research is needed into specific subjects that are not usually encountered outside the countries studied in this special issue: oligarchs in these countries appear to be very different from tycoons well known elsewhere. Up until now the influence of oligarchs has not been sufficiently investigated and it should certainly be examined despite all the problems relating to the patchy available evidence. The process of hybridization between local and “external” practices appears to be another promising area of investigation. The so-called “threshold of depersonalization” that transects both political science and media studies is proposed as a topic that could explain many specific practices in politics and the media.</p>
<p>Several papers in this collection have stressed the issues of fragmentation and volatility in politics and the media: it is assumed that recent technological changes will increase the speed and the importance of fragmentation. This is yet another topic that needs to be addressed both in relation to the particular socioeconomic contexts of these countries and to the specific consequences of technological innovations.</p>
<p>The importance of informality has been stressed by several authors in this issue: we think that this matter, to which neither media scholars nor political scientists have devoted particular attention, also needs further investigation. Indeed the interplay between formality and informality appears to be one of the main factors affecting the relationship between mass media and democracy in the region. Does it just affect this part of the world? Or is informality a dimension that has been neglected in other countries as well? The answer could represent another lesson to be learned from this collection.</p>

<p>According to Ornebring, “advertorials” are a form of media content oriented toward promotion and “positive” content, whereas “kompromat” refers to a form of media content oriented toward smearing and negativity. Both forms of content are nontransparent; that is, they are commonly either paid for or ordered by political or business interests, but for all intents and purposes appear like regular news content.</p>
