<p><italic>Objectives</italic>. To determine the cost of treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OP SCCA) with transoral surgery with concomitant neck dissection (TOS), TOS with adjuvant radiation therapy (TOS + RT), TOS with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (TOS + CRT), and primary chemoradiation therapy (CRT).</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Case series.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Two tertiary care teaching hospitals.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Using the databases of 2 teaching hospitals, patients were identified who had OP SCCA treated with TOS, TOS + RT, TOS + CRT, and primary CRT in 2009 to 2010. Costs were analyzed from an institutional perspective looking at reimbursement. Patients with government payers and patients with private payers in each group were identified, and net revenue data obtained for the 3-month period from diagnosis were calculated and averaged for each group. Cost was defined as the reimbursement for all charges surrounding the 3-month episode of treatment. All revenue associated with inpatient and outpatient care, including pharmacy charges, was included.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. The mean cost of TOS (private payers/government payers) was $37,435/$15,664 (range, $22,486-$48,746/$13,325-$16,885). The mean cost of TOS + RT (private payers/government payers) was $74,484/$34,343 (range, $72,400-$84,825/$31,565-$40,810). The mean cost of TOS + CRT (private payers/government payers) was $191,780/$53,245 (range, $145,450-$217,220/$49,400-$58,325). The mean cost of CRT (private payers/government payers) was $198,285/$57,429 (range, $168,216-$298,945/$52,900-$59,545).</p>

<p>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OP SCCA) suggest definitive radiation therapy (RT) or surgical excision of the primary tumor with ipsilateral or bilateral neck dissection (S ± adjuvant RT) or chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for early and advanced stage disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437534">1</xref></sup> The logical choice would be to offer that treatment offering the highest chance of oncologic cure. The literature contains multiple retrospective reports of cure rates for OP SCCA treated with S ± RT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437534">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812437534"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437534">4</xref></sup> and primary CRT with surgical salvage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812437534">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812437534">6</xref></sup> Comparisons of survival by treatment modality are challenged by the lack of randomized prospective data analyzing primary S vs primary nonoperative therapy of OP SCCA. The radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) randomly assigned patients with OP SCCA to treatment with preoperative radiation, postoperative radiation, or definitive radiation with surgical salvage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812437534">7</xref></sup> The authors stated that “the number of patients accessioned to this portion of the study was so small that no definite conclusions can be drawn.”</p>
<p>In the absence of a consistent proven survival advantage, many people argue that patients are best served by using quality-of-life and functional outcomes data to determine treatment superiority.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812437534">8</xref></sup> Again, there are multiple studies demonstrating speech and swallowing results for surgical treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437534">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437534">10</xref></sup> and nonoperative treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812437534">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812437534">12</xref></sup> These studies vary somewhat in the reported preservation of speech, swallowing, and airway function, but so many variables influence the quality-of-life outcomes that it makes comparison of the treatments difficult. The only prospective trial of surgery vs nonoperative treatment found no differences in the complication rates of these 2 treatment arms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812437534">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>When several treatment options exist, and these treatment arms offer apparently equivalent survival and quality of life without significantly different complication rates, then the treating physician might rely on secondary and tertiary treatment differences. When faced with a similar situation of cancer treatments offering equivalent survival and quality of life, some physicians have analyzed the costs of these treatments to help determine a preferential therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437534">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437534">14</xref></sup> In a medical environment where the rate of medical care expenditure is rising at an unsustainable 2.5 times the rate of the general economy, it would seem sensible to choose the least expensive of the equivalent treatments for any disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812437534">15</xref></sup> Unfortunately, data regarding the expense of care for oropharyngeal care in the United States are extremely limited.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the cost of care to society (the reimbursement for care) associated with TOS, TOS ± RT, TOS ± CRT, and primary CRT for OP SCCA.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812437534">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>The research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and by the Institutional Review Board of Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. Using the prospective institutional review board–approved databases for oropharyngeal cancer at 2 Mayo Clinic sites (Rochester, Minnesota, and Scottsdale, Arizona), patients were identified who underwent complete treatment for cure at those sites for OP SCCA from January 2009 to July 2010. Patients were divided into treatment groups of transoral surgery (TOS = transoral laser microsurgery [TLMS] or transoral robotic surgery [TORS]) alone, TOS + RT, TOS + CRT, and primary CRT. Most likely secondary to the surgical focus of our institutions, we did not have a patient group who received radiation alone. Patients were included until there were at least 5 patients in each group. All patients underwent their initial evaluation and staging work-up, consultations, surgical treatment and hospitalization, adjuvant therapy or primary chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and peri-treatment care at 1 of the 2 Mayo Clinic sites. Patients were offered primary operative therapy and nonoperative therapy, and the treatment decision was based on a combination of patient preference and physician preference.</p>
<p>The TOS-alone patients had T1 to T3 tumors and N0 to N2a neck disease. All patients underwent complete surgical excision of the primary tumor and simultaneous unilateral or bilateral neck dissection consistent with our practice for surgical treatment of OP SCCA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812437534">16</xref></sup> Patients were selected for surgical candidacy based on the assumption that a complete surgical removal could be achieved as evidenced by the extent of their tumor on clinical examination and imaging. All patients in the study achieved negative surgical margins by submitting all margins for frozen-section analysis and continuing the surgical resection until the frozen-section analysis confirmed tumor-free margins. The frozen-section accuracy was confirmed by final pathology margin analysis on every surgical patient. It is critically important to achieve negative margins during the surgical procedure in this manner to avoid the need for full-course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in the patient. The average hospital stay was 2.4 days. The decision to withhold adjuvant therapy was based on negative margins, N0 to N1 neck disease, and patient preference (2 patients).</p>
<p>The TOS + RT and TOS + CRT patients had T1 to T3 tumors and N1 to N2c neck disease. Patients underwent complete surgical excision of the primary tumor with negative surgical margins and unilateral or bilateral simultaneous neck dissection. The average hospital stay was 2.4 days. The decision to treat with adjuvant RT was based on multiple nodes. The decision to treat with CRT was based on the presence of extracapsular nodal disease and lymphatic or vascular microinvasion. Adjuvant RT consisted of 6000 Gy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) delivered to the primary site and at-risk nodal stations as an outpatient over 6 weeks, and CRT consisted of similar RT with concurrent 3 cycles of cisplatin delivered as an outpatient or inpatient on days 1, 21, and 43.</p>
<p>The CRT patients had T1 to 4 tumors and N0 to N2c neck disease. Patients underwent 7000 to 7200 Gy of IMRT in 35 fractions as outpatient therapy with outpatient or inpatient concurrent cisplatin (planned 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> × 3 doses). All but 2 patients undergoing primary chemoradiation therapy received a percutaneous gastrostomy tube.</p>
<p>Cost was determined by summing the actual reimbursement for bills for <italic>all</italic> inpatient and outpatient care and pharmacy charges for the patients from the moment of diagnosis and treatment initiation up to a date 90 days after their treatment was initiated. Charges included outpatient consultations, imaging studies, laboratory fees, inpatient procedures, hospitalization, outpatient procedures, emergency room care, and medications. Ninety days was chosen as an end point of the immediate care of oropharyngeal carcinoma (ie, completion of primary chemoradiation therapy or adjuvant therapy and first posttreatment oncologic visit). Patients were divided into treatment groups of TOS, TOS + RT, TOS + CRT, and primary CRT, and these groups were split into government payers and private payers. The sum of the gross revenue was averaged for each group. Statistics were performed with use of the χ<sup>2</sup> test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test for comparison between groups when appropriate.</p>

The costs were universally lower for government payers compared with private payers. Costs increased as the number of treatment modalities increased. Surgery alone had the lowest cost of treatment for both payer groups ($37,435, $15,664). The largest cost surrounding surgical therapy was the global cost of the procedure and hospitalization. If the mean cost associated with treating OP SCCA with surgery alone is assigned a basis value of 1, then the addition of radiation therapy increased the cost to a basis value of 1.98 for private payers and 2.19 for government payers.

<p>The addition of chemotherapy increased the cost of treatment. Patients undergoing S + CRT had a cost basis value of 5.12 for private payers and 3.39 for government payers. The highest cost was for primary CRT, with a cost basis value of 5.29 for private payers and 3.66 for government payers. It was somewhat surprising in this analysis that CRT alone cost more than S + CRT. This may be secondary to the percutaneous gastrostomy tube that every patient being treated with CRT alone received and the associated gastrointestinal physician, nutrition, and anesthesia consults. Also, the hospital admissions for hydration, treatment of mucositis, and treatment of medical issues were higher in this group.</p>
<p>No patients died of cancer, treatment-related causes, or unrelated causes during the study period. Patients were admitted to the hospital for complications related to treatment in the S + RT groups (n = 3), the S + CRT groups (n = 6), and the CRT (n = 6) groups. Complications increased the cost of treatment in each group. Complications related to treatment that necessitated inpatient hospital admission included bleeding (n = 3), dehydration (n = 9), neutropenia (n = 2), and pulmonary embolus (n = 1). The average cost increase over the mean treatment cost if a patient required inpatient treatment of complications was 19.3%.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The estimated annual expenditure on health care in the United States is $2 trillion, equaling 16% of gross domestic product.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812437534">15</xref></sup> This figure is constantly rising, and when we are faced with seemingly equivalent treatment choices, it is not only rational but imperative for health care survival to assess the relative costs of these treatments and to act in a cost-effective manner. Other groups have applied this reasoning and analysis to situations where there is disparity and choice in treatment of a disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437534">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437534">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812437534">17</xref></sup> In the head and neck, cost analysis has been applied most rigorously to treatment of early glottic cancer.

Foote et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437534">13</xref></sup> performed a comparison of radiotherapy to transoral endoscopic surgery and partial vertical laryngectomy and concluded that for both Medicare and non-Medicare patients, radiotherapy held the best overall value. This discrepancy highlights some of the fundamental difficulties in evaluating cost of a treatment: what to include in the cost analysis and how to accurately estimate these costs? Some studies have used billing fees associated with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes commonly used in the evaluation and treatment of a disease to determine costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437534">13</xref></sup> The limitation of these studies is that reimbursement schedules vary greatly between payers, so charges may only be loosely associated with costs. To avoid this problem, we used the actual reimbursement associated with treatment. This figure gets closer to the actual amount paid by society (the third-party payer and the patient) to deliver a treatment. By looking at this absolute reimbursement over the course of treatment, we avoided artifact in the cost data that can arise from discrepancies in coding, varying reimbursement from different providers, and bundled reimbursement for multiple charges. Some studies have included fixed equipment costs and secondary costs such as lost wages during time off work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437534">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812437534">17</xref></sup> We did not include these variable estimates that are more dependent on variations in patient demographics such as proximity to the treating facility and treating physician preference such as use of cautery or laser.</p>
<p>An additional challenge in this type of financial analysis is determining the optimal time frame to capture costs. Some studies have chosen to look at only the immediate care period, whereas other studies have estimated charges over an entire year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812437534">19</xref></sup> In a determination of costs associated with esophageal cancer, Kuppusamy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437534">14</xref></sup> looked at a 90-day period from treatment initiation and included all the costs during this period. We used a similar time period with the recognition that patients were typically diagnosed, staged, and treatment initiated at our institutions within a period of 2 to 5 days. If they received primary surgical therapy with adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy, that treatment was usually completed within a 10-week time period. Choosing the 90-day period allowed us to incorporate the major treatment-related costs, and continuing the study period to the first posttreatment visit allowed us to incorporate the costs associated with treatment-related complications that might occur in the immediate posttreatment period.</p>
<p>Treatment costs escalated with each additional treatment modality. This is in agreement with the results of other studies that have looked at surgical vs nonsurgical treatment of cancer in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437534">14</xref></sup> The least expensive therapy of all the groups studied was surgery alone, which cost one-fifth as much as primary chemoradiation therapy in private-payer patients. This is in direct contradiction to the results of cost for treatment of OP SCCA performed in Europe. Preuss et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812437534">20</xref></sup> analyzed the lump-sum costs associated with the German DRG system in 2007 and found that primary chemoradiation therapy cost 10 times less than surgery with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. This difference can be explained almost entirely from regional and cultural differences in postoperative inpatient stay. The average postoperative stay for patients undergoing transoral oropharyngeal cancer at our institution is 2.4 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437534">9</xref></sup> In the Preuss et al study, the average postoperative inpatient stay was 21 days. Nidjam et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812437534">21</xref></sup> looked at the cost of care of OP cancer in the Netherlands and found that brachytherapy was less expensive than CRT and that surgery + radiation therapy was the most expensive of all. In their study, surgery patients spent an average of 21 days in the hospital for postoperative care, and they spent a total of 31 days in the hospital for complications. In our study, the surgery-alone group spent the fewest days in the hospital for treatment-related complications (0), whereas the chemoradiotherapy group spent the most days in the hospital (14) for complications. In addition, these other studies have reported tracheostomy tube rates as high as 25% and gastrostomy tube rates as high as 30% in their surgical patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812437534">20</xref></sup> Our patients treated surgically for OP SCCA receive temporary tracheostomy tubes at a rate of 16% and gastrostomy tubes at a rate of 14%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437534">4</xref></sup> The gastrostomy tube placement represented the third highest cost in the CRT group and was placed in every patient undergoing primary chemoradiation therapy.</p>
<p>There are limitations of this type of study. Patients are not randomized into these groups, so there is significant ability to introduce selection bias. With the nonrandomized nature of a retrospective database review, there is concern from the internal validity standpoint. Many times elderly and sicker patients opt for nonsurgical treatment options. This selection bias may contribute to increased hospital stay, higher complications rates, and higher need for supportive care (ie, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy [PEG] tube, which seemed to add significant cost to the CRT group). In this study, the performance index of the patients was not markedly different between the groups, nor was their tobacco and alcohol abuse, but the patients were not enrolled prospectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812437534"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Another problem with a study of this type is that there is selection bias in treatment based on stage. Our study did not include patients treated with radiation alone, as this is not a commonly recommended treatment at our institution for low T stage oropharyngeal carcinomas. The surgery-alone group had lower stage tumors than the other groups, and this could influence the cost of treatment. Still, the surgery-alone group did contain more advanced overall stage (stage III/IV) tumors than early stage (stage I/II) tumors, and the stage distribution in the other groups was not statistically dissimilar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812437534"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). The hospitalization rate for complications and the overall costs seemed to be more influenced by treatment modalities than patient stage. The use of radiation therapy and chemotherapy as primary or adjuvant therapy is driven by the stage of disease and characteristics of the neck metastasis, so it would be a mistake to assume that all of these treatments are optional and that the lowest cost treatment should always be chosen. That being understood, this study did comprehensively include all medical and surgical charges surrounding the complete treatment of OP SCCA in a manner in which many other studies were only able to estimate. Some institutions do not offer surgical therapy at all to patients secondary to lack of adequate experience and expertise, so selection bias in treatment does exist in real-world clinical situations.</p>
<p>Treatment of OP SCCA needs to be individualized to the specific characteristics of the tumor, desires and expectations of the patient, and skill of the provider. In previous studies examining treatment of OP SCCA, we have found that patients presenting for OP SCCA treatment can undergo primary surgical therapy approximately 25% of the time and require adjuvant therapy 75% of the time if we applied the NCCN guidelines for adjuvant therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437534">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437534">9</xref></sup> If we apply these statistics and the cost data from this study, then we can develop cost differential estimates for different treatment protocols. For instance, if we took 10 government patients with OP SCCA and individualized their therapy with 25% receiving surgery alone and 75% receiving surgery + RT or surgery + CRT, then our treatment costs for these patients would be approximately $329,158. If we took the same 10 patients and treated them all with CRT, then the treatment cost would be $574,290, or an additional $245,132, over the individualized approach.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The literature does not clarify an oncologically superior treatment for OP SCCA, and often secondary factors guide the choice. In a comparison of costs of these treatments from an institutional perspective, we found that the least expensive treatment was surgery alone. Adding more treatments increased cost. Chemoradiation therapy was 5.29 times more expensive than S alone for nongovernment payers and 3.66 times as expensive as S for government payers.</p>
