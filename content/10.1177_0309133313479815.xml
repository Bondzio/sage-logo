<abstract>
<p>One feature of high-latitude areas is the formation of ice clusters attached to the beds of rivers, lakes and the sea. This anchor ice, as it is widely known, plays an important role in mobilizing bed sediments, as well as ecological roles as a food source, habitat and potentially fatal environment. Much work has been devoted to fluvial anchor ice in the Northern Hemisphere, yet comparatively little work has described anchor ice in polar marine environments, despite its description by Antarctic expedition scientists over a century ago. In this paper, we review the current understanding of anchor ice formation in polar marine environments. Supercooled water is a necessity for anchor ice to form and frazil adhesion is the most likely common mechanism for initial anchor ice growth. Strong biological zonation has led some authors to suggest that anchor ice does not form to depths of greater than 33 m, yet in Antarctica there appear to be no physical reasons for such a limit given the production of supercooled water to substantial depths associated with ice shelves. Future work should focus on the potential extent of anchor ice production and identify the key oceanographic, glaciological and meteorological conditions conducive to its formation.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Anchor ice has been extensively studied in high-latitude rivers, but processes leading to its formation, initial deposition and subsequent transport in all aqueous environments are still poorly understood. Anchor ice in rivers has a significant impact on infrastructure, navigation and water supply in northerly latitudes, and as a result has been the focus of a large body of work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309133313479815">Altberg, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309133313479815">Barnes, 1906</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309133313479815">1908</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309133313479815">Bisaillon and Bergeron, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309133313479815">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309133313479815">Martin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133313479815">Tsang, 1982</xref>). By contrast, anchor ice formation in polar marine regions is poorly described despite its importance to biological, glaciological and marine sedimentation studies. In the polar marine context, anchor ice develops when frazil ice crystals that are formed in a supercooled water column adhere to the seabed. The continued presence of supercooled water allows these initial ice crystals to grow rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309133313479815">Osterkamp and Gosink, 1984</xref>) and form delicate leaf-like ice structures that clump together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309133313479815">Kempema et al., 1993</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309133313479815">Figure 1</xref>). This results in a patchy covering of ice that provides a lair for benthic species and is a potentially fatal environment for shallow water benthic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133313479815">Denny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309133313479815">Gutt, 2001</xref>). These ice clusters can grow large enough to become buoyant and detach from the sea floor, lifting any adhered sediment, flora or fauna into the overlying ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133313479815">Dayton et al., 1969</xref>).</p>

<p>The presence of mirabilite (hydrous sodium sulphate) and marine fossils on the surface of the Ross Ice Shelf was first described by Hartley Ferrar of the British National Antarctic Expedition of 1901–1904, who remarked ‘<italic>Balanus </italic>shells and sponge-spicules occurred upon the ice … [this phenomenon] is a freak of Nature which is difficult to explain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309133313479815">Ferrar, 1905</xref>: 348), and was later expanded on by numerous sightings around McMurdo Sound by Frank Debenham of Scott’s 1910–1913 British Antarctic Expedition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309133313479815">Debenham (1919</xref>) interpreted the marine muds on the surface of the ice shelf as the result of the ice shelf grounding on the sea floor and entraining the material via bottom freezing. In the discussion of Debenham’s paper is the suggestion by the then President of the Geological Society (Lamplugh, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309133313479815">Debenham, 1919</xref>: 74) that such deposits may also be embedded into the ice shelf via anchor ice – a suggestion that Debenham eventually supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309133313479815">Debenham, 1965</xref>). Since these early observations, anchor ice has been commonly used to explain the presence of embedded marine shells, fish, boulders, marine silts and clays in ice shelves (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133313479815">Glasser et al., 2006</xref>), moraines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133313479815">Fitzsimons et al., 2012</xref>) and sea ice (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133313479815">Darby et al., 2011</xref>), as well as reconstructing past climates of the Arctic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309133313479815">St John, 2008</xref>). However, none of those studies are based on in situ observations of anchor ice on the seabed, but rather from remnant fragments of marine organisms and sediments that are interpreted as evidence of anchor ice. Thus, there is a multidisciplinary body of research that infers anchor ice processes, despite a dearth of observations or insights into anchor ice formation in the marine environment. The objectives of this paper are: to review the physical processes that drive anchor ice formation and are specific to marine polar environments; to assess the multidisciplinary importance of anchor ice to polar research; and to identify future research questions pertaining to anchor ice.</p>

<title>II Anchor ice formation</title>
<p>Anchor ice is a broad term that has been liberally used to describe any ice attached to the bottom of a river or sea floor, despite it being less dense than the surrounding water. The term anchor ice is generic; that is, it does not inform an understanding of the processes that operate to form such a deposit. Part of the challenge of understanding the environmental significance of anchor ice is navigating the many ice terminologies, each of which is at least partially dependent on discipline. There is inconsistency in the ways that the terms ‘frazil’, ‘platelet ice’, ‘anchor ice’ and even ‘marine ice’ are used in the literature, often interchangeably. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309133313479815">Smith et al. (1999</xref>) noted differing uses of the term ‘platelet ice’ in the literature, and more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133313479815">Hunt et al. (2003</xref>) initially described the onset of ‘anchor ice’ growth on a pressure logger, but then later made reference to ‘platelet ice’. For simplicity, the definition of anchor ice used here (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0309133313479815">Table 1</xref>) is generic: submerged ice attached to a substrate, for example the bed of a river, lake or sea.</p>

<title>1 Experimental studies of anchor ice formation</title>
<p>Derived from both field- and laboratory-based observations, there is now a wealth of data on anchor ice formation, although much of this work stems from freshwater experiments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133313479815">Doering et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309133313479815">Kerr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133313479815">Tsang, 1982</xref>). Anchor ice is a derivative form of frazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133313479815">Daly, 1994</xref>), both of which depend on supercooling for ice formation. A fluid is supercooled when its temperature is lower than the in situ freezing point (specifically the freezing temperature of the surrounding water mass) but remains in a liquid state. In the context of frazil ice formation, the degree of supercooling required is of the magnitude of hundredths of a degree C below the freezing point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133313479815">Tsang, 1982</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133313479815">Tsang (1982</xref>) anchor ice initially forms in one of two ways: by supercooled water directly nucleating on a substrate to form a continuous ice coating, or frazil crystals that coalesce into anchor ice; and by frazil formation in a supercooled water column followed by adhesion to a substrate (such as the seabed) which forms delicate, interfingered masses of anchor ice crystals on a substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309133313479815">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133313479815">Tsang, 1982</xref>). A substrate composed of fine sand inhibits the growth of anchor ice as the buoyancy of individual frazil crystals is sufficient to lift these grains from the bed, thus no noticeable amount of anchor ice will form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309133313479815">Tsang, 1982</xref>), although this assertion has been challenged by field-based observations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309133313479815">Kempema and Ettema, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309133313479815">Pearse, 1962</xref>). The most conducive substrates for anchor ice initiation and growth are boulders, rocks, gravel and weeds.</p>
<p>Experimental work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133313479815">Doering et al. (2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309133313479815">Kerr et al. (1997</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309133313479815">Terada et al. (1998</xref>) described the formation of anchor ice and its growth rates in freshwater as a function of flow velocity and depth (parameterized using Froude and Reynolds numbers). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309133313479815">Kempema (2002</xref>) disputed such observations, arguing that the technique of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309133313479815">Doering et al. (2001</xref>) was flawed since the ice density varied between experiments. These freshwater experiments have provided useful insight into anchor ice morphology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309133313479815">Kempema and Ettema, 2009</xref>), as well as the role that turbulence due to surface roughness and flow velocity has on initiating riverine anchor ice. In flume studies of seawater, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309133313479815">Kempema et al. (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309133313479815">1993</xref>) reported less anchor ice formed in the salt-water experiment than in the freshwater experiments as the adhesiveness of saline water frazil was much less than that of the freshwater frazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309133313479815">Hanley and Tsang, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309133313479815">Tsang and Hanley, 1985</xref>). Thus, the processes of freshwater anchor ice formation and growth may not directly relate to processes that likely operate in marine environments.</p>

<title>2 Supercooling and frazil ice formation in marine waters</title>
<p>Supercooled water is essential for frazil ice formation and for the growth of anchor ice. In polar marine environments, frazil ice forms under several conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309133313479815">Daly, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309133313479815">Martin, 1981</xref>) where supercooling of the ocean occurs:<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Surface cooling:</bold> Low atmospheric temperatures above seawater (that is, in contact with the atmosphere, e.g. polynyas) leads to heat loss to the atmosphere. Seawater density increases as it cools, so this heat loss drives convection within the mixed layer. High winds can then induce turbulence in the mixed layer that brings cold, relatively dense water back to the surface where it can lose more heat. Under sustained stormy conditions, eventually part or all of the mixed layer can become supercooled. The dense supercooled water sinks down towards the seabed where anchor ice growth may be initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309133313479815">Figure 2a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309133313479815">Reimnitz et al. (1987)</xref> suggested that the maximum depth of marine anchor ice is limited to the mixed layer depth.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Interface of two fluid layers:</bold> There are several subtypes of this formation process, dependent on the mechanisms for generating fluids of different salinities and temperatures, however, these processes may be geographically isolated or episodic in nature. Examples include:<list list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Freshwater drainage from rivers and estuaries:</italic> At the boundary between near-freezing water masses of differing salinities, for example, fresh meltwater at ∼0°C situated above seawater at –1.8°C. Heat transfers from the warmer freshwater to the colder seawater faster than the mass transfer of salts from the seawater to the freshwater (100 times faster on a molecular basis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309133313479815">Martin, 1981</xref>). This results in supercooling of the upper (freshwater) layer as it is cooled faster than its freezing point temperature is depressed by the introduction of salts. Since this freshwater occurs at or near the ocean surface, it is unclear what contribution this may have to anchor ice formation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Brine drainage:</italic> The drainage of cold dense brine episodically produced during sea ice formation leads to the growth of frazil ice beneath the sea ice. As sea ice forms, brine is ejected from the overlying ice mass. Because the brine has a higher density and lower freezing point it sinks. As it descends, it mixes with less saline water, resulting in supercooling of the water parcel. Under calm conditions, the supercooled brine may form brine icicles (or ‘brinicles’ as filmed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309133313479815">BBC, 2011</xref>) and ice stalactites (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309133313479815">Dayton and Martin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309133313479815">Martin, 1981</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309133313479815">Figure 2b</xref>). As much as 50% of the ice formed from the cold brine flow develops into frazil ice crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309133313479815">Dayton and Martin, 1971</xref>). When these ice stalactites (or frazil crystals) reach the seabed, isolated strings of anchor ice may form on the sea floor.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Groundwater seeps and subglacial drainage:</italic> At the coastal margin, fresh groundwater is periodically discharged to the near-shore zone below sea level, if sufficient hydrostatic head is present. Similarly, freshwater may also be ejected from the base of ice streams from subglacial drainage channels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309133313479815">Horgan et al., 2012</xref>). Under such conditions, freshwater springs or seeps enter the sea and the latent heat released by the freezing freshwater is absorbed by the colder seawater (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309133313479815">Wu and Mastro, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309133313479815">Sadler and Serson, 1981</xref>), allowing frazil and anchor ice to grow.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<bold>Ice pump:</bold> Saline seawater beneath an ice shelf (or large iceberg) will tend to melt the base of the ice shelf because the freezing point of seawater is lowered with increasing depth in the ocean. This results in the generation of a buoyant plume due to the diffusion of fresher meltwater into the surrounding seawater, which will hug the bottom of the ice shelf as it ascends towards the sea surface, entraining additional seawater as it rises. Due to the pressure dependence of seawater's freezing point temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309133313479815">Foldvik and Kvinge, 1974</xref>), the freezing point temperature of this rising plume will increase, which can lead to this plume becoming supercooled (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309133313479815">Leonard et al., 2011</xref>). If this plume, possibly containing small frazil crystals, such as the frazil-laden plumes modelled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309133313479815">Bombosch and Jenkins (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309133313479815">Smedsrud and Jenkins (2004)</xref>, intersects the sublittoral zone, anchor ice growth may be initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309133313479815">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

(c) Antarctic anchor ice formation through production of potentially supercooled water plume at depth associated with ice shelves.

(2001</xref>). During 2003, conditions in McMurdo Sound were unusual with thick sea ice observed, which has been attributed to the presence of blocking icebergs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309133313479815">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309133313479815">Leonard et al.’s (2006)</xref> study revealed significant supercooling beginning in the middle of May with a magnitude of 0.006±0.004°C increasing to 0.015±0.004°C on 9 September. Brine rejection occurs as sea ice forms, therefore salinity increases as winter progresses, and the resulting decrease in the freezing point temperature facilitates further cooling of the water column. Salinity, temperature and depth measurements were used to determine the thickness of the supercooled layer under the ice-water interface. These measurements indicated that an approximately 10 m deep layer of supercooled water in May had increased to 40 m by September 2003. These observations, together with measured oxygen isotope ratios, suggested the continued presence of ice shelf modified waters during the observation period, hence the supercooling was attributed by the authors to the ice pump mechanism (`c') above, i.e. the near-surface water was likely to have originated from the cavity beneath the nearby McMurdo Ice Shelf.</p>

<p>Rising plumes of supercooled water are frequent precursors to frazil ice formation by the ice-pump process. If those plumes, which are associated with ice shelf water (ISW) processes, coincide with the near-shore sublittoral zone, the necessary precursors for anchor ice formation are put in place. Thus, it appears that marine frazil ice is able to form in different environmental circumstances than freshwater frazil because there are various heat sinks to absorb the latent heat of freezing. Fresh water frazil requires heat loss from the water column to the atmosphere; whereas in marine environments there are indirect methods (e.g. `interface between two fluids' and `ice pump' mechanisms) that can lead to supercooling. For example, marine water can become supercooled via the `ice pump' mechanism so frazil ice generation can occur in the water column below a solid ice cover, thus the `surface cooling' mechanism is not required to produce supercooled water.</p>

<title>III Direct observations of marine anchor ice</title>
<p>Despite the early inferences of anchor ice at work in the marine environment e.g. ice accumulation on equipment during the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309133313479815">Wright and Priestly (1922)</xref> during Scott’s British Antarctic Expedition (1910–1913), anchor ice was not extensively observed in McMurdo Sound until the early 1960s. During an ecological study of McMurdo Sound, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309133313479815">Pearse (1962</xref>: 12) noted ‘large patches (up to several square metres) of ice crystals frozen to the mud and pebble bottom’. The ice crystals were loosely adhered to each other and the sea floor, and large masses would break off and rise to the surface when agitated. Such observations were used by Pearse to explain that this ‘sea floor ice’ was likely responsible for incorporation of benthic organisms into surface sea ice and ice shelves.</p>
<p>The first comprehensive study of anchor ice formation in Antarctica was by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133313479815">Dayton et al. (1969</xref>) in McMurdo Sound. Anchor ice was observed during underwater dives to form in early winter where a thick (5–40 cm) mat of anchor ice was noted a depth of 15 m. Isolated clumps of anchor ice occurred to a depth of 33 m, but no deeper, seemingly marking the depth limit that anchor ice forms in McMurdo Sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133313479815">Dayton et al., 1969</xref>). The anchor ice would form within a matter of hours and persist for weeks, with the last anchor ice observed in early summer (December). Several studies have observed the formation of ice on ropes and lines suspended in McMurdo Sound (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309133313479815">Barry, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309133313479815">Mahoney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309133313479815">Stevens et al., 2009</xref>), and in the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309133313479815">Hunt et al. (2003</xref>) sufficient ice accumulated to cause the logger to float up. Anchor ice was also observed on the delta by Explorer’s Cove (Point 13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309133313479815">Figure 3</xref>), on the western margin of McMurdo Sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309133313479815">Murray et al., 2013</xref>), who photographed suspended scallops trapped in the sub-ice platelet ice layer beneath multiyear sea ice. They suggested that anchor ice may also play a role in cementing the delta sediments to sustain a steep angle of repose, allowing riverine sediment to flow further offshore. In that study, anchor ice was observed during dives between 7 and 25 m depth.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309133313479815">Reimnitz et al. (1986</xref>), one of the most important influences on the sedimentary flux from shallow Arctic waters is anchor ice, yet the lack of direct observations of anchor ice prompted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309133313479815">Reimnitz et al. (1987</xref>) to investigate further. After five days of ideal conditions for supercooling, with cold air temperatures and strong winds, a series of underwater dives observed pillow-shaped conglomerations of anchor ice 10–40 cm in diameter and 5–8 cm high at depths of greater than 1 m. The anchor ice was best developed 3–4 m deep on either side of a 2 m sand bar 90 m offshore, and the lower depth limit for anchor ice growth in the Beaufort Sea was estimated at ∼20 m, as this was the inferred depth of the supercooled layer.</p>
<p>From these direct observations of anchor ice formation, it appears that both the Arctic and Antarctic anchor ice have only been observed to depths of 33 m or less, with the greatest concentration of anchor ice being observed at depths of between 5 and 20 m. As such, the sublittoral zone associated with the landward margin represents the most likely geographic distribution of anchor ice formation. However, frazil ice formation may occur at much greater depths than 30 m in Antarctica, so does this limit reflect a physical-processes limit, or simply a limit of observations? Furthermore, there are fundamental differences in the ice formation processes between the Arctic and Antarctic, where the Arctic is dominated by the shallow surface cooling mechanism, and Antarctica is likely dominated by deeper supercooled water production associated with the ice pump mechanism.</p>

<title>IV Multidisciplinary significance of anchor ice</title>
<p>From the discussion above, it is evident that many different studies have observed or investigated the role of anchor ice in the marine environment. The formation of anchor ice, both in the Arctic and Antarctic, plays a role in ice disturbance of benthic communities, as well as mobilizing seabed sediments and fossils into overlying ice masses, and potentially transporting sediment away from the near-shore zone. Anchor ice has been invoked as a method of entraining sediment into overlying glacial ice in a number of studies. Anchor ice has been described in situations of glaciohydraulic supercooling in subglacial cavities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12a-0309133313479815">Cook et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12b-0309133313479815">Cook and Knight, 2009</xref>). For a comprehensive review of supercooling in this environment see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12b-0309133313479815">Cook and Knight (2009)</xref>. The following section outlines the importance of anchor ice to three disciplines: polar sublittoral benthic ecology, glaciology and marine sedimentation.</p>
<sec id="section7-0309133313479815">
<title>1 Ecology</title>
<p>There is a wealth of work that has investigated the sublittoral benthic communities in Antarctica, and the different coping strategies that species have developed to exist in such a challenging environment, with its cold (but stable) water temperatures, threat of ice disturbance and low light due to sea ice coverage. From this body of work, it has been established that anchor ice plays multiple roles in the ecology of this zone, acting as an important habitat for spawning species and a potential source of sediment and nutrients, as well as a source of potentially deadly ice disturbance. The observations by Dayton throughout the 1960s to 1980s provide some of the most complete observations of the timing, extent and periodicity of anchor ice formation around McMurdo Sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133313479815">Dayton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133313479815">Dayton et al., 1969</xref>). Dayton et al.'s work into the population dynamics of the marine sponge organism <italic>Homaxinella</italic> showed that it was generally injured or killed when encased in anchor ice. The reduction of <italic>Homaxinella</italic> down to 33 m depth in 1967–1968 was attributed to the presence of a large amount of anchor ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133313479815">Dayton et al., 1969</xref>). By contrast, a substantial increase in the population of <italic>Homaxinella balfourensis</italic> in the mid- to late 1970s is attributed to reduced anchor ice extent during this period. Those observations illustrate the effect of anchor ice disturbance on the benthic ecology, as well as indicating considerable annual to decadal variation in the spatial extent of anchor ice. Dayton’s observations provide the basis for the assumption that anchor ice formation in McMurdo Sound appears constrained to depths of less than approximately 30 m. The intermediate sublittoral zone between 5 and 33 m depth is the area in which the benthic community is most subject to disturbance from anchor ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133313479815">Denny et al., 2011</xref>). The observations of Dayton are important, as <italic>Homaxinella </italic>are widely regarded as foundation species, so that years of low disturbance promote a flourishing benthic community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309133313479815">Dayton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133313479815">Denny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309133313479815">McClintock et al., 2005</xref>). Anchor ice is potentially fatal to such benthic communities as it potentially injures or kills organisms that are encased in ice, inhibits suspension feeding and light interception, or potentially detaches the organisms from the sea floor to be permanently encased in the overlying ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309133313479815">Dayton et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309133313479815">Denny et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309133313479815">Pearse, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, anchor ice has also been observed to aid survival of certain species. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309133313479815">Berkman et al. (1986</xref>) observed copepods (a group of small crustaceans) walking on large suspended crystals of anchor ice laced with sediment, and suggested that anchor ice could provide a food source to planktonic herbivores in the austral winter. In recent studies of Antarctic icefish, the eggs of <italic>Gymnodraco acuticeps </italic>were readily observed to survive ice encasement during their 10-month development, suggesting an adaptation suitable to contending with anchor ice growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133313479815">Cziko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309133313479815">Evans et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The prevalence of anchor ice, alongside other ice disturbance factors, was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309133313479815">Thrush et al. (2006</xref>) to be one of the key factors determining the spatial variability in benthic communities throughout McMurdo Sound. Thus, understanding the areas most prone to anchor ice disturbance may play an important role in understanding benthic community diversity and distribution in this region. For example, anchor ice is widely assumed to be limited to the southern Ross Sea where conditions conducive to supercooled water production are favourable. There have been limited published observations of anchor ice in areas such as Terra Nova Bay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309133313479815">Cziko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309133313479815">Thrush et al., 2006</xref>). The anchor ice in Terra Nova Bay was considerably shallower than that of McMurdo Sound with approximately 70% coverage at depths of &lt;10 m, and recent observations suggest that anchor ice in Terra Nova Bay is much more prevalent than previously thought (Vonda Cummings, personal communication, 2012).</p>

<sec id="section8-0309133313479815">
<title>2 Glaciology</title>
<p>Anchor ice studies in glaciomarine environments are scant, and are mostly confined to observations of the McMurdo Ice Shelf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309133313479815">Figure 3</xref>). Early observations on Scott’s 1910–1913 expedition of the puzzling deposits of salts, sediment and marine fossils on the ice shelf led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309133313479815">Debenham (1919</xref>) to consider which ice shelf processes may produce such deposits. The interpretation of these features has been attributed to a variety of different processes including ice shelf grounding. Numerous studies have since investigated the McMurdo Ice Shelf (MIS) dynamics and origin of the extensive debris mantles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309133313479815">Debenham, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309133313479815">Kellogg and Kellogg, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309133313479815">Kellogg et al., 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133313479815">1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309133313479815">Stuiver et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309133313479815">Swithinbank, 1970</xref>). From this body of work, it was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309133313479815">Swithinbank (1970</xref>) who first provided geophysical evidence that the water depth beneath the MIS was sufficiently deep to make it unlikely that the ice shelf grounded on the seabed. The alternative interpretation provided by Swithinbank was that anchor ice was transporting marine sediment and fossils through the water column to the bottom of the ice shelf, and that these sediments and fossils were lifted through the ice shelf by surface ablation.</p>
<p>The significance of anchor ice as the mechanism for entraining marine fossils was challenged on the basis of extensive radiocarbon dating of shells and diatoms recovered from the ice surface by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309133313479815">Kellogg et al. (1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133313479815">1991b</xref>). From their analysis, they identified that samples younger than 2000 years were limited in extent to areas around Bratina, Black and Dailey islands, as well as around Brown Peninsula. From their dating evidence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309133313479815">Kellogg et al. (1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309133313479815">1991b</xref>) argued that adfreezing occurs occasionally when the ice shelf grounds in the shallows, and that anchor ice is relatively unimportant. More recently, an investigation into the ice-cored ridges and cones on the MIS by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133313479815">Glasser et al. (2006</xref>) provided compelling sedimentological and geophysical evidence of modern corals and sponges being added to the ice shelf via anchor ice attaching to the base of the ice shelf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133313479815">Glasser et al. (2006</xref>) suggested that the area between Bratina Island and Brown Peninsula is still an area of active entrainment of benthic fauna via anchor ice freezing to the bottom of the MIS. Furthermore, they suggested that the debris and fossil remnants found on the MIS reflect a mix of relict and contemporary processes, and that the area known as ‘the Swirls’ likely reflects an older deposit associated with a formerly grounded ice tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309133313479815">Glasser et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in an investigation of ice shelf moraines along Minna Bluff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133313479815">Fitzsimons et al. (2012</xref>) attributed the sediment accumulation in these moraines in part to anchor ice processes, in light of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratio evidence and the preservation of fragile marine macrofossils. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309133313479815">Fitzsimons et al. (2012</xref>) also presented isotopic evidence to support ice shelf grounding, so it appears that in the southern section of the MIS there is sufficient evidence to support both entrainment mechanisms, and that the two mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive. Other ice types associated with supercooled water (e.g. ice platelets) have been observed at depths of up to 250 m in Antarctica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309133313479815">Dieckmann et al., 1986</xref>), so there appears no reason that anchor ice could not form at depths of greater than 33 m, if appropriate nuclei are present. Thus, it is difficult to reconcile the strong biological zonation seen in the first 33 m of the water column with the current understanding of the range of conditions that supercooled water (and by inference, anchor ice) occurs.</p>

<sec id="section9-0309133313479815">
<title>3 Marine sedimentation</title>
<p>Since the 1970s, there have been numerous observations of fine sediment and shells with attached benthic organisms in fast ice within the Beaufort Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309133313479815">Reimnitz et al., 1987</xref>), which have mostly been attributed to sediment transport along the frozen seabed during storms. However, anchor ice has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for transporting sediment and shells into fast ice, although it is hard to confirm this from field observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309133313479815">Reimnitz et al., 1986</xref>). Such direct observations of anchor ice are rare (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309133313479815">Nurnberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309133313479815">Reimnitz et al., 1987</xref>), and the extent of anchor ice formation in the Arctic remains poorly constrained. Yet, despite the lack of direct observations, numerous studies have inferred anchor ice rafting of sedimentary sequences in the Arctic, albeit of varying significance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133313479815">Darby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133313479815">Eicken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309133313479815">St John, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133313479815">Darby (2008</xref>) used ferrous iron grain fingerprinting as a proxy record to determine Arctic sea ice extent during the Cenozoic. Grains larger than 200 μm were found in one sea ice sample and interpreted as evidence of anchor ice, since these larger-sized grains were only available near shore where anchor ice can form and bring them up to the sea ice. Further work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309133313479815">Darby et al. (2009</xref>) hypothesized that suspension freezing (i.e. sediment entrainment via frazil crystals) would entrain fine-grain sediment, whereas entrainment via anchor ice is non-selective and transports more poorly sorted sediments, reflecting the original shelf sediments. Thus, the particle size distributions, as well as mineralogical characteristics, have been used as proxy indicators of storminess and sea ice extent in the past (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309133313479815">Stickley et al., 2009</xref>), of which anchor ice has been invoked as a potentially important element. In a review on the historical record of sea ice extent in the Arctic by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309133313479815">Polyak et al. (2010</xref>: 1761), it was noted that anchor ice has been used to explain sediment transport by sea ice, but ‘the relative contribution of anchor ice to the overall Arctic ice cover is not fully understood’. The interpretation of marine sedimentation, particularly in the past, and attributing variations in grain size to process remains contentious, since, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309133313479815">Gilbert (1990</xref>: 116) states, ‘grain size is a poor indicator of the rafting agent’.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133313479815">Darby et al. (2011</xref>) attempted to distinguish between suspension freezing and anchor ice entrainment as the mechanism for producing dirty sea ice in the Arctic. The presence of benthic shells and seaweed along with a layer of sediment was interpreted as evidence of anchor ice entrainment, as opposed to suspension freezing. Concentrations of sediment averaging 1.4 kg m<sup>-2</sup> in dirty sea ice were interpreted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133313479815">Darby et al. (2011</xref>) as probably being transported by anchor ice, suggesting that anchor ice entrainment is more common and extensive than previously thought. Furthermore, they suggest that anchor ice entrainment could rival suspension freezing for the total amount of sediment transport by ice in the Arctic, contrary to the position of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309133313479815">Eicken et al. (2005</xref>). Thus, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309133313479815">Darby et al. (2011</xref>) demonstrates the potential role of anchor ice in entraining marine sediments into ice floes, and its potential contribution to the sediment flux of the Arctic. Understanding the modern-day role that anchor ice has on the sediment flux of the Arctic Ocean bears directly on the interpretation of sedimentary cores to infer past sea ice extent. Ice-rafted debris (which potentially includes anchor ice) and marine sediment facies have been used in numerous studies to establish the extent of sea ice during the Cenozoic (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309133313479815">Darby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309133313479815">Krylov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309133313479815">St John, 2008</xref>). Given the ongoing debate over the significance of anchor ice sediment transport in the Arctic in modern-day processes, such interpretations are contentious. Interestingly, such debates over the role of anchor ice and its significance to marine sedimentation are largely ignored in work undertaken in Antarctica, and seem limited to the debates of the Arctic.</p>

<title>V Conclusion</title>
<p>It is evident that marine anchor ice has been under-appreciated and under-studied despite its importance to oceanography, marine ecology and palaeoclimatology. Although its formation in rivers is now fairly well understood, many questions remain about the physical processes governing its formation in marine waters. Supercooled water is a necessity for anchor ice to form, and frazil adhesion is likely to be the most common mechanism for anchor ice growth. Despite the relevance that anchor ice has in a multitude of disciplines, there remains a sparse collection of observations of the extent and depth to which anchor ice forms. Furthermore, there remains a lack of knowledge surrounding anchor ice formation processes in polar marine environments. In particular, we consider the following points unresolved in the current understanding of anchor ice:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Is there any evidence of the ‘surface cooling’ mechanism of anchor ice formation in Antarctica, or is this mechanism only relevant to Arctic anchor ice formation?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What is the relative importance of `brinicle' drainage compared to the ice pump process for producing anchor ice? Are these processes somehow linked? For example, does brine drainage supply ice nuclei to shallow depths, while the ice pump supplies a mass of supercooled water to act as a heat sink, which absorbs the latent heat of anchor ice formation?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is anchor ice formation restricted to ∼30 m depth? If supercooled water can be produced at greater depths in Antarctica, why has anchor ice not been observed to greater depths? Is it a result of limited observations, or are there some other physical constraints on its formation?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How important is anchor ice as a mechanism for marine sediment entrainment and as a vector for ice-rafted debris? In the absence of a genetic fingerprint of anchor ice sedimentation, how can anchor ice be conclusively invoked as a method for transporting marine sediments or fossils, not only in the Arctic, but also entrainment into Antarctic ice shelves?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Logistical difficulties seem to be the main barrier to understanding the physical constraints on anchor ice formation in the Arctic and Antarctic, and consequently understanding the relative contributions of anchor ice to other sea ice processes cannot be quantified. Further study is warranted into the physical processes of anchor ice formation, and the findings would greatly assist many fields of polar research.</p>
