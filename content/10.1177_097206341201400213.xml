<p>Being self-aware is particularly important for health care professionals who need to manage their cognitive, affective and behavioural self in order to engage effectively in therapeutic relationships. The book is a comprehensive guide on how to develop communication skills. It would be a useful reference for students and qualified nurses who are interested in empowerment, the use of language, developing relationships, stress, aggression, loss and the dynamics of power. This book encourages readers to use their own self awareness as a therapeutic tool to enhance their effectiveness when interacting with patients. Self awareness can serve a foundation for understanding those people who need to access health care services. It includes innovative exercises and useful suggestions to challenge the reader and promote further discussion.</p>
<p>The book is structured in three parts and each part is related to a particular theme, containing relevant tables and figures. The first part is ‘<italic>On Developing Self Awareness: A Way of Engaging</italic>’ which includes one chapter, that is, on self awareness. It provides the basic understanding of self awareness, its com-ponents, and forms, factors affecting self awareness, and its benefits and drawbacks. It demonstrates how it can be a valuable skill in enhancing the efficiency of health care professionals.</p>
<p>The second part of the book is on ‘<italic>Self Awareness and the Person’s Experience of Illness</italic>’ which includes four chapters. Stress and vulnerability are discussed in Chapter 2. Emotions and problem-focused coping styles are two strategies employed in dealing with stressful life events. The next chapter provides an understanding of the concept of power in relation to self and others. The chapter elucidates the ways of empowering patients through effective engagement. Chapter 4 explains the concept of loss and grief and later on discusses the process of managing loss and grief in self and others. The principal theme throughout this chapter in the context of loss and grief is its emphasis on self awareness on the part of the practitioner. Anger and aggression are magnificently expressed in Chapter 5. This chapter focuses on some of the theories which explain anger and aggression.</p>
<p>The last part of the book is on ‘<italic>Communication, Engagement and the Helping Relationship</italic>’. Involving patients in their care (through easy access to information) is regarded as a means of enhancing the quality of services offered to them. The following chapter discusses language in bio-psycho-social perceptive. Later on the author discusses the ways language is expressed within health care practice. Chapter 7 deals with inter-personal communication and self awareness. The author discusses the characteristics and goals of inter-personal communication. Three inter-personal needs are highlighted as inclusion, control and affection; these tend to dictate the way people interact with one another. Effective inter-personal communication has its foundation in the core skills of interpretive, goal, role, self and message competences translated through verbal, non-verbal and para-languages. The last chapter attempts to situate the notion of engagement within the concept of care through a structured approach based on the notion of therapeutic relationship and partners in care. Two barriers pose a threat to the notion of engaging patients in their own care and these are professionals who may choose not to involve patients in the decision-making process and patients themselves who, for their own reasons, may not wish to be involved. This to some extent makes the whole concept of engagement complex. The proposed model, underpinned by the practitioner’s skills, knowledge and attitude that are conducive to the notion of care, attempts to humanize the helping process.</p>
<p>This book emphasizes the need to involve individuals in their own care, thus moving a step closer to addressing the imbalance of power that exists between patients and health care professionals.</p>
