<abstract>
<p>Infant feeding, particularly breastfeeding, is an important public health issue because early feeding methods have been shown to influence health throughout childhood. We investigated how social norms influence first-time mothers’ decisions around feeding methods. We conducted two in-depth interviews with 11 first-time mothers, the first 3 weeks after birth and the second 3 months following birth. We analyzed interview data using a third-level, thematic analysis, using Goffman’s theories of social interaction to guide our analysis. Our results highlighted several issues surrounding breastfeeding in modern society. We propose that nursing mothers are conscious of adhering to social norms of being a good mother, but must also cope with societal views about presenting normal appearances when they need to feed their babies in public.</p>

<p>Numerous researchers have examined the factors that influence infant feeding practices. Many researchers have used quantitative measures with a sociodemographic focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312451873">Brimblecombe &amp; Cullen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312451873">Payne &amp; James, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451873">Scott &amp; Mostyn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312451873">Williams, Innis, Vogel, &amp; Stephen, 1999</xref>) and have aimed to improve the understanding of what influences women’s infant feeding decisions, but they have rarely taken into account the mothers’ lived experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312451873">Ryan, Todres, and Alexander (2011)</xref> provided insight into the experience of breastfeeding mothers using semistructured, narrative-conducting interviews. In our article, we examine new mothers’ lived experiences of breastfeeding, particularly breastfeeding in public, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman’s (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">1971</xref>) theories of social interaction as the basis for our analysis.</p>

<title>Choosing to Breastfeed</title>
<p>Breastfeeding has been described in the literature as a representation of “both a medical gold standard for infant feeding and a moral gold standard for mothering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312451873">Knnak, 2005</xref>, p. 197). This is because human breast milk contains an array of antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunological, and bioactive flora components, which combine to produce superior milk that is tailored for optimal infant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451873">Oddy, 2002</xref>). Despite the health benefits of breastfeeding for both mothers and babies, breastfeeding rates in Australia are well below national guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312451873">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312451873">Binns, 2003</xref>). Binns claimed that there is a negative breastfeeding trend in Australia, whereby as infants increase in age breastfeeding rates decrease.</p>
<p>Researchers have examined reasons why a mother might or might not choose to breastfeed. Common reasons noted for changing feeding methods are doubts about personal milk supply, namely, concerns that it is either insufficient or inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312451873">Binns &amp; Scott, 2002</xref>), attachment troubles, difficulties of breastfeeding in public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451873">Forster &amp; McLaughlan, 2010</xref>), maternal discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312451873">Hauck &amp; Irurita, 2002</xref>), lack of support, paid employment, and the availability and convenience of infant formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312451873">Scott, Binns, &amp; Arnold, 1997</xref>). Other research has indicated that there are social determinants that can influence a mother to breastfeed or not, such as demographic factors, economic conditions and education levels, cultural attitudes and norms, commercial pressures, family convenience, and national policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312451873">Heird, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though authors of articles on breastfeeding have identified influences affecting a mother’s infant feeding decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451873">Crico-Lizza, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312451873">Payne &amp; James, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451873">Scott &amp; Mostyn, 2003</xref>), a limited number have discussed these influences from the perspective of a social theory or known psychosocial behavioral concept. We argue that the use of theoretical perspectives to examine breastfeeding practices can provide a comprehensive understanding of how women see themselves as nursing mothers within society. Such theoretical perspectives provide a more nuanced approach to understanding the lived experiences of breastfeeding women. These perspectives highlight how cultural and social norms have become embodied and restrict women from breastfeeding in public spaces in Australia today. It might be that changing how a nursing mother is seen within society is the key to increasing breastfeeding rates in Australia.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Both institutional and hospital ethics committees granted ethics approval for our study. We recruited 11 first-time mothers by way of purposeful sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312451873">Patton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451873">Pope, Van Royen, &amp; Baker, 2002</xref>) from a hospital in the southern suburbs of an Australian city. We provided an in-depth introductory letter to ward supervisors in the maternity section of the hospital and asked them to nominate new mothers who matched the inclusion criteria of (a) healthy, first-time mothers; (b) mothers who had not experienced complicated births; (c) mothers who had recently given birth, and were 1 to 7 days postpartum; (d) mothers who had given birth to healthy, full-term babies, 37 or more weeks and weighing at least 3 kilograms; (e) mothers who spoke English as their first language; and (f) mothers aged 21 to 41 years.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312451873">Patton (2002)</xref>, participants in qualitative research are often selected using a specific predetermined criterion that allows researchers to capture those who are seen as information rich. Therefore, it was important for the current research purposely to select participants who either possessed characteristics or lived in circumstances relevant to the phenomenon under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451873">Mays &amp; Pope, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451873">Popay, Rogers, &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>). Consequently, we excluded mothers who had previously given birth to a child, mothers who experienced a traumatic labor, mothers with physical and mental health issues, teenage mothers, and Indigenous mothers because it is documented within the literature that these characteristics can influence how a mother decides to feed her child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312451873">Squire, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Once mothers had granted initial verbal permission to the ward supervisor, the first author contacted them approximately 48 hours after they had given birth to their healthy full-term babies. When approaching mothers in the ward, the first author introduced herself as a researcher, not a doctor, nurse, or midwife, briefly explained the research, and outlined what would be required of research participants. The participants lived in a variety of socioeconomic areas including country and metropolitan areas. After consenting to participate, mothers were interviewed twice using a semistructured interviewing technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451873">Liamputtong &amp; Ezzy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451873">Pope et al., 2002</xref>). The first interviews were conducted approximately 3 weeks after birth. This was to capture mothers’ initial feelings about feeding their babies for the first time, including in public. The second interview occurred at 3 months following the birth to determine if the mothers’ intended feeding method had changed and, if so, why it had changed. This interview also focused on public breastfeeding experiences and social influences on intended feeding methods. We encouraged the participants to describe infant feeding as a narrative.</p>
<p>Although the interviews were generally conducted in participants’ homes, three mothers requested a telephone interview. All interviews were approximately 90 to 120 minutes in length, with the exception of interviews conducted over the telephone, which were shorter. Key interview questions from the first and second round of interviewing guided participants’ recall of their decisions about how they would feed their babies, their experiences of infant feeding for the first time, and their opinions on how society then interacted with them (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312451873">Table 1</xref>). We assigned pseudonyms to the participants to protect their identity. The first author captured all interviews using a digital recorder and fully transcribed them. The first author also kept a research diary that included field notes of reflective observations from interviews.</p>

(2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312451873">Silverman (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451873">Grbich (1999)</xref> have suggested that theory in qualitative research supplies the necessary footing for how to consider the social world, by providing the framework for interpretation, critical appraisal, and analysis. To achieve an informative and theoretical description of the data collected from this study, we used a third-level thematic analysis technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451873">Coveney, 2007</xref>) by referring to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman’s (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451873">1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312451873">1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">1971</xref>) theoretical framework. The first author coded all the transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451873">Liamputtong &amp; Ezzy, 2005</xref>) and analyzed them manually, and the second and third authors reviewed them to ensure trustworthiness of the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312451873">Pope, Zeibland, &amp; Mays, 2000</xref>). In keeping with Coveney, we analyzed all transcriptions of first-round interviews before the second round of transcriptions to allow the second round of data to be interpreted in its relevant context. We generated a set of themes until data saturation was achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451873">Morse, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312451873">Patton, 2002</xref>). We recorded 24 categories for the first round of interviews and 18 for the second. We then compared and contrasted the coded data to generate themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451873">Pope et al., 2002</xref>). We developed four key themes from the first round of transcripts and three key themes from the second round of transcripts.</p>
<p>Once we had organized and refined the data, we conducted a second order analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451873">Coveney, 2007</xref>) using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> theory of social interaction as the theoretical framework. Here, we generated theoretically informed perspectives of the data. This required being familiar with Goffman’s work and the various critiques of his ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312451873">Charmaz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312451873">Ellison, Heino, &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312451873">Feldman, Forrest, &amp; Happ, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451873">Johnson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451873">Misztal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312451873">Tseelon, 1992</xref>). We also used this literature to provide evidence of sound theoretical reasoning for our research. Once we had formed a theoretical perspective of our research using Goffman’s theory of social interaction, we completed the third-level analysis (Coveney). During this process we also carefully considered the extent to which the findings related to the literature on infant feeding.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732312451873">
<title>Understanding Goffman</title>
<p>Goffman’s beliefs about face-to-face interactions came to life in his work titled <italic>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</italic> (1959), in which he described such interactions as a theoretical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451873">Ritzer, 2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman (1959)</xref>, people take on a role or act in their interactions with each other. These roles are carefully constructed, rehearsed, and enacted during a social situation to elicit the desired response. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman (1959)</xref> suggested that individuals, as actors in these performances, intentionally and knowingly create an impression of their self while also unintentionally giving off impressions (Ritzer), and he referred to this as impression management. He maintained that individuals constantly monitor all aspects of the behavior of other people. It is for this reason that Goffman made the famous distinction between front-stage and backstage performances of social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451873">Innes, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Front-stage performances are conducted by individuals (actors) who act out in public spaces with the intention to display behavior that is in line with the expectations of the audience (other members of society) and in an appropriate style for the individual to receive a desired response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1959</xref>). Conversely, when out of public view and thus backstage, individuals are not expected to act in a certain way and usually display different behaviors. This style is known as a backstage performance because individuals can behave in a way that is appropriate to their comfort zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1959</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman (1959)</xref> indicated, “the performer knowingly contradicts” (p. 114) his or her front-stage behavior. It is through such interaction with others that humans develop and create not only their own individual world but also the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451873">Boydell, Goering, &amp; Morrell-Bellai, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1959</xref>), in what can be seen as an act of self-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312451873">Walker, 2000</xref>). Both the front stage and the back stage are part of impression management. Goffman’s theory of human behavior in public and social places can draw our attention to shared norms, conventions, and rituals held by members of a particular society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451873">Innes, 2003</xref>). These norms and conventions allow individuals to anticipate how others will react to their actions, making the world predictable. In his later work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">Goffman (1971)</xref> began to extend his understanding of social interactions to the presentation of relationships in public settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451873">Ritzer, 2005</xref>). He extended his theory of presentation of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1959</xref>) to the idea of the self as a sign vehicle and discussed how individuals negotiate their way around public places while trying to appear normal (Ritzer).</p>
<p>We chose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">Goffman’s (1971)</xref> theory of social interaction as the framework for analysis for this research because of its application to public breastfeeding and potential insights into the self-presentation of mothers. Appearances are fundamental to relationships and dealings with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312451873">Elliot, 2001</xref>). His theory of self provides a detailed conceptual account of why this should be so, enhancing the current understandings of how and why mothers think and act the way they do when breastfeeding their babies in public, a social interaction that is essentially front stage.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732312451873">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451873">Coveney (2007)</xref>, a first-level analysis allows researchers to identify themes that are emerging from their data. We have split the emergent themes from this research into two: first, findings obtained from the first round of interviews and, second, those from the follow-up round of interviews. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312451873">Kitto, Chesters, and Grbich (2008)</xref> supported Coveney by suggesting that when a researcher consistently compares the language used by participants to express their experiences, subtle but significant differences can be uncovered that generate profound insights into the phenomena under study. In the current research, coded data generated four key themes from the first round of interviews (breastfeeding for the first time: “it’s not easy”; social construction of motherhood: “being a ‘good’ mother”; breastfeeding in public: “no shame, no gain”; and communication about breastfeeding difficulties: “it’s just not spoken about”) and three key themes from the second round (the experience of breastfeeding at 3 months: “it gets easier”; persistence and goal setting: “persistence leads to sustainable breastfeeding”; and breastfeeding in public: “the experiences”).</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312451873">
<title>Themes: First-Round Interviews</title>
<sec id="section6-1049732312451873">
<title>Breastfeeding for the first time: “It’s not easy.”</title>
<p>Once the new mothers arrived home from hospital, they claimed that they were “shocked” by the difficulty of initiating breastfeeding. Moreover, once they had given birth, they realized that “breastfeeding was a much larger part of having a baby than [they had] originally thought.” One mother mentioned that she had anticipated breastfeeding “would not come easily” because during her pregnancy she heard that successful breastfeeding was difficult. Despite this, most mothers did not realize that breastfeeding would be so complicated: “I never thought that it would be that complicated. I mean, I thought they’re babies and they go on the breast straight away.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312451873">
<title>Social construction of motherhood: “Being a ‘good’ mother.”</title>
<p>A major theme to emerge from the first interviews was that being able to breastfeed conferred to the women the status of being a good mother. There was a strong belief that this demonstrated to other people that the mothers were able to “provide for their baby” because “society would think they were a failure if they did not breastfeed.” Participants stated that difficulties experienced with breastfeeding left them feeling to “some degree a sense of shame,” and that they were “failing themselves as a mother and the baby” because of the social pressure to breastfeed. Specifically, one new mother claimed,
<disp-quote>
<p>It would be interesting to see how I felt if I needed to bottle-feed him. I think that I would feel quite upset in myself that I couldn’t provide for him and that’s probably sort of a bit of an expectation, a society expectation: you should be able to provide for your baby.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants spoke with a sense of relief that by breastfeeding their babies they were then “pleasing everyone—themselves, their baby, their friends, family and society in general”:
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel a lot of relief because I know that some mothers experience a lot of difficulties with breastfeeding or they just can’t do it for some reason, and I guess that’s your biggest fear becoming a new mum is whether you can breastfeed or not, so yeah, I was really pleased that I could continue on and give my baby the best start in life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to the participants, society supports breastfeeding to the extent that it is “expected that as a mother you breastfeed your baby,” which places undue pressure on mothers at a vulnerable stage in their life as mothers. This finding is clarified by the comment from one participant, who claimed, “Breastfeeding is the normal way to feed a baby. It’s expected; it’s natural.”</p>
<p>Other participants noted that when mothers choose to formula feed it is viewed as “a bad thing.” Furthermore, when participants considered changing to formula feeding, they were aware that “it would not be very well looked upon.” Protecting themselves from a backlash of negative views from those around them could be seen as one of the reasons why participants persisted through the difficulties of initiating breastfeeding:
<disp-quote>
<p>For a millisecond during the pain I kept thinking, stuff it, I’m going to the bottle, like I was threatening her, but then I thought, what would everyone think of me? So I knew I couldn’t do that. I have always felt I need to stick with [breastfeeding] until I get used to it for that very reason.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732312451873">
<title>Feelings toward public breastfeeding</title>
<p>During their first interview, the first author asked participants whether they were happy to breastfeed in public and whether they had already done so. These questions appeared to concern the participants. This response from one new mother sums up the thoughts of the group: “I knew for me even during my pregnancy that breastfeeding in public was going to be the issue. The public side of it really puts me off.” Participants said that members of the public “would find breastfeeding offensive.” Therefore, participants associated public breastfeeding with feelings such as “nervousness,” “anxiety,” “embarrassment,” “uncomfortableness,” and “exposing,” with one adding,
<disp-quote>
<p>I haven’t gone through that experience yet because I haven’t been out and done the social things since he was born. I haven’t done that bit yet. I don’t know how it will go because I know that I will feel uncomfortable exposing myself—exposing me by breastfeeding in public—but at the same time, I think if we have to be somewhere and he has to eat, I don’t really have a choice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was a sense of confusion among participants when contemplating public breastfeeding. Mothers said that they were not sure whether they “should breastfeed in public places” and were concerned about how people would react to them if they did. Some were of the view that members of the public would make them feel uncomfortable by “staring and whispering”:
<disp-quote>
<p>I must admit, like when you’re out in public it’s like, should I or shouldn’t I? I mean, we were just out for lunch and it’s like, well should I breastfeed him or not? Who’s going to spit up, you know? Is anyone going to get upset by it? You’ve still got that in the back of your mind. They [the general public] just think that things like that [breastfeeding] should be done in private. I’ve heard that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It also emerged that the participants felt there is a general consensus within Australian society that breastfeeding babies in public is not acceptable. Participants felt that “breastfeeding is well supported just not so much out in public.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312451873">
<title>The “exposure factor” of breastfeeding in public</title>
<p>When asked why breastfeeding in public was not supported, most mothers said the primary issue was exposing their bare breasts in front of others. This is because they had to show “private skin” in public, which is generally considered rude. As one new mother indicated,
<disp-quote>
<p>The personal hurdles are that you have to get your breasts out in public, which is, as a first-time mother, is fairly intimidating, like that’s quite intimidating, and men don’t do that in any form, you know, and you’re suddenly expected to just do that. I think, really, you have to expose yourself in a way that no one else is, and it’s a really primal thing. You can’t maintain some sort of cool exterior. You’re taking your clothes off and feeding, which is a really base-level thing, you know. I get that sense from mums.</p>

<sec id="section11-1049732312451873">
<title>Communication about breastfeeding difficulties: “It’s just not spoken about.”</title>
<p>Participants indicated they did not feel any direct pressure from family or friends to feed their babies in a particular way, but did describe a distinct lack of communication between family members about breastfeeding difficulties. Participants perceived their families had acted in a manner similar to the broader society, by stating, “I don’t know whether it is society so much or whether it’s more families who are influenced by society.” Some believed this was so because “breastfeeding is supposed to just happen because it’s a natural thing,” and if you are experiencing difficulties then you are seen as “failing yourself as a mother.” These comments demonstrate that successful breastfeeding is strongly related to good mothering, even among close family members. The participants speculated that they could “learn so much more about breastfeeding” if family members communicated their breastfeeding experiences more readily. This lack of communication between family members extends to public breastfeeding:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think there needs to be probably a little bit more discussion within families. Parents need to be educating their daughters about feeding in public and telling them that it is okay, and that our breasts aren’t sexual objects; they’re designed to feed and that’s what their purpose in life is for, and that we shouldn’t really feel embarrassed about pulling them out in public.</p>

<title>Themes: Second-Round Interviews</title>
<sec id="section13-1049732312451873">
<title>The experience of breastfeeding at 3 months: “It gets easier.”</title>
<p>At the second interview, we asked the participants to sum up their experience of breastfeeding since their first interview. All the participants found breastfeeding “much easier” compared to when their babies were first born. When they answered this question, mothers seemed more relaxed compared to their initial interview, and their tone of voice was happy and relieved. Mothers stated that they were “more confident to breastfeed,” “proud of what I have achieved since the birth of my child,” and also “relieved that over time breastfeeding became easier and quicker to conduct”:
<disp-quote>
<p>After the initial period of breastfeeding for the first time, you start to enjoy it a bit more, I think. It’s not so much a hassle or a chore now. I’ve found it easier because he is drinking a lot more, and he knows how to do it better, so it’s a lot faster. I’m not sitting on the couch for 40 minutes or an hour now. It’s only taking, like, 10 or 15, if that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, the participants viewed breastfeeding as “easier,” and many of them realized they had blamed other aspects of infant feeding such as colic and reflux on breastfeeding, rather than thinking that these issues are a natural part of infant feeding in general. For example, one mother admitted to “blaming other things of ‘feeding’ on breastfeeding, like reflux,” but realized at 3 months that these issues would have happened anyway, even if she used infant formula to feed her baby.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732312451873">
<title>Persistence and goal setting: “Persistence leads to sustainable breastfeeding.”</title>
<p>It was noticeable at the second interview that some of the mothers now experienced “joy” from breastfeeding, which appeared to be a result of their persistence despite their difficulties during the early stages of breastfeeding. The sheer determination of many participants to achieve weekly goals and struggle through the arduousness of initiating breastfeeding was evident as they grew into the role of a nursing mother:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m quite pleased with myself, really, quite proud that I’ve actually managed to persevere, because my husband said, “Oh, I don’t think you’ll last very long.” And that made me even more determined to think, yeah, I can do this. Obviously, I wanted to because I knew it was the best for the baby. So I was determined in a way to persevere.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The mothers recognized that commitment and goal setting were their key strategies in continuing to breastfeed past the 8- to 10-week mark. One participant summed this up by stating, “[B]efore you know it, you’ve reached the goal or the milestone and then you can set another one. It’s something, you can’t really just give up on it overnight, I think. You really do need to practice and persist.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732312451873">
<title>Breastfeeding in public: “The experiences” and more</title>
<sec id="section16-1049732312451873">
<title>Parenting rooms</title>
<p>Participants suggested that parenting rooms were a safe haven when they needed to breastfeed in public. They used parenting rooms in shopping centers extensively. One participant stated that “the privacy parenting rooms provide is so important in the early stages,” and that if mothers were in a place without parenting rooms they would often feel self-conscious about “what other people would think” when they were feeding in the “open”:
<disp-quote>
<p>I know some people think you shouldn’t be feeding just anywhere, when it is our right really and we should be able to, but sometimes you just feel like you shouldn’t; rather you should feed only in a feeding room.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mostly, participants felt that members of the general public expected mothers to use parent rooms when they needed to breastfeed in public. This was endorsed by a participant’s recall of her own family, who complained to management when they saw a women breastfeeding on a bench in a prominent place in a shopping center. All participants agreed that in this situation the mothers who have the courage to breastfeed in public are the mothers society “should be supporting” because “they’re the ones that make it better for all of us.”</p>
<p>Participants also claimed they were more comfortable breastfeeding in public if other mothers who were breastfeeding at the same time surrounded them. Two new mothers were particularly vocal, saying that they were more likely to breastfeed in places such as children’s playgroups or mums (mothers) and babies coffee mornings because they were protected by other nursing mothers and described this as having “power by numbers.”</p>
<p>Although participants noted that there were high-quality parent rooms in shopping centers, they said there was a noticeable “lack of facilities for mums in other public places.” As a result, they perceived the only other locations provided for breastfeeding their babies were public toilets, which they viewed as “scungy” and “disgusting.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312451873">
<title>Having to be exposed</title>
<p>The major barrier to public breastfeeding still felt by participants was exposing their bare breasts in public and subsequent feelings of embarrassment. One participant stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Like you wouldn’t go out to a pub and lift up your top, you know. So, it’s just the same with having to breastfeed, I guess. Your breasts are one of your private parts that you don’t show to strangers. But really, when the baby is latched on you can’t see anything anyway. It’s like wearing bikinis down the beach.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mothers said that their breasts were “private” to them physically and emotionally. It is clear that there were wider emotions attached to public breastfeeding than just the demand for breast milk from an infant. Not all participants, however, viewed their breasts in the same way. Some described their breasts as “sexual objects,” whereas others felt their breasts were only a “feeding mechanism.” According to one of the participants, “[W]omen are born with breasts with the intention that one day breastfeeding is what they’ll be used for.”</p>
<p>These opinions could be related to underlying personal values and social beliefs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312451873">Moran and Dykes (2006)</xref> suggested that in contemporary society women’s breasts are primarily viewed as sexual objects and their innate purpose is ignored. This might also be the reason why participants stated that it is only “the nipple and the areola part of the breast” that they really try to hide, and not necessarily the whole breast. Mothers maintained that if breast milk came from another part of a woman’s body that is normally exposed, public breastfeeding would not be an issue:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s purely about that feeling or stigma around breasts. If it was something else, you know, if you had to breastfeed from your fingers or something which is exposed all the time, people wouldn’t even worry about it, so it’s about getting your boobs out in public. Some people are really phobic about it. No one sort of looks at a dog, or a cow, or whatever and kind of goes, ooh that’s really rude. But for women it’s kind of, well it’s considered rude when displayed in public.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732312451873">
<title>Being considered “normal.”</title>
<p>Participants believed strongly that public breastfeeding is not embedded into the Australian culture, and therefore they felt discouraged from breastfeeding in public. All agreed that “if more women breastfeed in public then it would look like the norm rather than ‘me being the odd one out.’” When a mother breastfeeds in public, she “stands out from the crowd,” causing her to feel self-conscious and embarrassed. The notion of “exposure” and the desire to “be normal” are powerful predictors of a women’s breastfeeding behavior. It is apparent that these mores, and the associated feelings, have a negative impact on nursing mothers. This finding suggests that to promote breastfeeding successfully, health professionals need to look “outside the square” and work to increase the acceptance of breastfeeding among the wider community.</p>

<sec id="section19-1049732312451873" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The majority of mothers recalled traumatic difficulties in the early breastfeeding phase, when they underestimated how much the experience of breastfeeding would affect them. They conceded that they thought breastfeeding would be much easier and would “just happen because it is a natural thing.” Yet by their second interview mothers felt experienced and competent with breastfeeding. This account can be interpreted as an attempt to conform to the social norms of appropriate breastfeeding behavior. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">Goffman (1971)</xref> suggested, participants acted in accordance with the normative demands of breastfeeding that have been created within the broader Australian society. To appear as though they were independently “coping” with breastfeeding, mothers continually attempted to be in control of their behavior by displaying a credible performance to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312451873">May, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants worried about societal views, claiming that they would be seen as “not providing for their child” if they did not breastfeed. They also agreed that on becoming a mother they felt an expectation from those around them that “you should be able to provide for your baby.” This finding was evident in that participants felt obligated to breastfeed and felt an expectation to modify their behavior because of societal expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1971</xref>), and confirms that participants were attempting to adhere to expected social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312451873">Sunstein, 1996</xref>). Consistent with the breastfeeding literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312451873">Earle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451873">Forster &amp; McLaughlan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312451873">Grassley &amp; Nelms, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312451873">Ryan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312451873">Sheehan, Schmied, &amp; Cooke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312451873">Stewart-Knox, Gardiner, &amp; Wright, 2003</xref>), nursing mothers continually modify their breastfeeding behavior in response to others around them.</p>
<p>Although the mothers were proud to be breastfeeding, they did not feel that they could rebel against the social mores that disapprove of breastfeeding in public. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451873">Goffman (1961)</xref>, to do so would stigmatize them and construct them as social deviants. The participants’ apprehension regarding public breastfeeding meant many felt they had to “hide the fact” they were trying to be a good mother. Allied to their beliefs around the social disapproval of public breastfeeding, participants consequently appeared to be highly conscious of their self-presentation. Avoidance of public breastfeeding by participants in this way can be seen as a collapse of their “self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1959</xref>).</p>
<p>A potential collapse of the “self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1959</xref>) was particularly relevant to those mothers who avoided public breastfeeding by feeding in toilets or reverting to bottled formula when they went out in public. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman (1959)</xref> noted that the fear of being labeled deviant leads mothers knowingly to contradict their own front-stage behavior by resorting to backstage behavior and hiding to breastfeed in comfort. By choosing to feed their babies with bottled formula or by breastfeeding in toilets away from the public eye, the mothers felt that they were acting in line with social expectations, without the threat of being judged by others.</p>
<p>Participants engaged in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312451873">Goffman (1967)</xref> referred to as “heroic efforts” to avoid embarrassment from public breastfeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312451873">Schwartz &amp; Jacobs, 1979</xref>). Feelings of embarrassment and the fear of displaying abnormal public behavior led to the disruption of breastfeeding when mothers were in public places. Confusion resulted for the participants as they wanted to be identified as “good mothers” who breastfeed their babies but did not want to offend others by breastfeeding in public. This endorses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312451873">Cody and McLaughlin’s (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451873">Goffman’s (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">1971</xref>) claims that although individuals need to seek approval (to be a nursing mother in public), they must also prevent social disapproval (by avoiding public breastfeeding). As one mother said, “[O]ther people find breastfeeding in public offensive. I’ve heard that, so I have to respect that.” Participants faced the dilemma of maintaining their personal identity as a nursing mother, while having to be prudent when breastfeeding in a social space because the exposure of breasts is not considered appropriate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">Goffman (1971)</xref> suggested that social norms are relevant in these situations because those to whom they apply, in this case mothers, believe the social norms to be right.</p>
<p>The mothers consistently reported that exposing their breasts was the major barrier to breastfeeding in public and the reason they did not feel normal or comfortable. Participants admitted that they felt more normal if they were breastfeeding around other nursing mothers and described this as “power by numbers.” This supports our argument that social norms influence nursing mothers and that considerations about front- vs. backstage performances constitute a powerful form of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451873">Goffman, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451873">Innes, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we presented a number of key theoretical perspectives on nursing mothers. The connection between expectations of breastfeeding and the reality of breastfeeding has been disrupted by the social representation of good mothering. The mothers continuously attempted to conform to the social norms about breastfeeding (good mothering), despite the fact that this restricted their capacity to breastfeed their babies when in public. However, an expectation that mothers breastfeed, but not in public, confounds what is understood about good mothering. We propose that nursing mothers are not capable of rebelling against the stigma of public breastfeeding as individuals, given the power of social norms against the public exposure of breasts. To do so would risk a potential collapse of self. The action of breastfeeding is performed in defined roles as either a front- or backstage performance, and we suggest that mothers knowingly contradicted their front-stage behavior by happily breastfeeding backstage. Mothers chose to avoid breastfeeding while front of stage, even if that meant contradicting personal values by feeding their babies in toilets. The main reason for this appeared to be that exposing their breasts caused the nursing mothers to believe that they looked abnormal in public. Nursing mothers are extremely conscious of adhering to social norms, of presenting normal appearances, and knowingly contradict their own beliefs about good mothering to conform to social expectations. Because of the importance of breastfeeding for infants, extended research in the area of social pressures on new mothers to avoid breastfeeding in public should be conducted.</p>
