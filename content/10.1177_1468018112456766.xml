<p>Pensions have played a key role in the Greek sovereign debt crisis. Failure to introduce pension reform proved a central cause and, following the bailout by the Troika (EU, ECB and IMF), pensions were the first target for structural reform. As the crisis has unfolded, pensioner incomes have been repeatedly cut.</p>
<sec id="section1-1468018112456766">
<title>Pensions and the origins of the crisis</title>
<p>Greece stood out among the EU-15 with the largest projected ageing-related expenditure increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018112456766">EPC, 2009</xref>). Even so, this failed to prevent old age poverty. Nevertheless, the country had failed to promote meaningful reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018112456766">Tinios, 2012</xref>). A succession of timorous parametric reforms did not prevent a build-up of deficits among the fragmented pension providers. These were met by direct budget transfers, financed by borrowing. The pension issue was subsumed and ‘hidden’ in wider magnitudes of public debt, essentially removing budget constraints on pensions. Over time, pension transfers became a key determinant of public sector deficits, and thus an issue in the sustainability of Greek debt. Reform became imperative only when Greece threatened the stability of the Eurozone in late 2009; the sovereign debt crisis provided the missing budget constraint on the pension system.</p>
<p>The lack of pension reform can be explained by myopia on the part of the Greek political class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018112456766">Tinios, 2005</xref>). No political adrenaline flowed from a statement that the pension situation would become critical ‘after 2025’; if time is measured in electoral cycles, 2025 was ‘too far ahead to worry about’. Bond traders, nevertheless, take a longer view: to rate the repayment prospects of debt, they have to consider the conditions prevailing when repayment is due to take place. When the EU Open Method of Coordination provided projections allowing such a view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018112456766">EPC, 2009</xref>), markets took notice. Faced with ‘defective telescopic faculty’ on the part of governments, bond markets supplied the missing ‘telescopes’ and <italic>forced</italic> reform to take place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468018112456766">1</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-1468018112456766">
<title>The quality of forced pension reform</title>
<p>When Greece was bailed out in May 2010, pension reform was at the top of the agenda. Indeed, Law 3863/10 of July 2010 was the first piece of Memorandum-inspired structural reform, hailed by the IMF as <italic>‘</italic>a landmark pension reform, which is far-reaching by international standards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468018112456766">IMF, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018112456766">OECD, 2011</xref>). This law had three key features: it rationalized the existing state-run pension system, chiefly by defining a new two-tier system to be implemented gradually after 2015; it raised retirement ages for younger cohorts; and it facilitated restructuring of employment (chiefly in the public sector) by extensive grandfathering, which in some cases amounted to early retirement.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the law do we encounter the slightest hint of encouragement for a second pillar. Commentators, who might have expected the Troika (or at least its transatlantic component) to promote a neoliberal agenda by privatizing pensions, must have been disappointed. The new pension system intended for the long term remains resolutely public-owned, financed and run by the state. A contributor to the <italic>new</italic> state system, who will receive their pension after 2050, can expect around 80% income replacement, which hardly leaves room for supplementary systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468018112456766">
<title>Unreformed pensions and crisis dynamics</title>
<p>On the other hand, the grandfathering provisions of the law mean that Greece is navigating the crisis with an essentially unreformed pension system. Workers nearing retirement are still entitled to (relatively generous) defined benefit pensions, at a time when the labour market is radically insecure. This cyclical behaviour stabilizes effective demand, but at the expense of further borrowing. In a public finance crisis such as the current one, its effect is seriously <italic>destabilizing</italic>.</p>
<p>After May 2010 Greece faces a <italic>single</italic> creditor (the Troika), who supervises public finances on a quarterly basis. Deficit overruns in one quarter need to be made up by equivalent savings within the same calendar year, enforcing a rigidly effective budget constraint. The combination of lax implementation of reforms and cyclical overruns necessitates savings elsewhere, wherever these can be easily found and quickly implemented. Given that public pensions are under the easy control of government, pensions-in-payment are cut repeatedly. Thus, repeated public assurances that no more pension cuts would take place have had to be abandoned in practice.</p>
<p>Under generalized public finance strains, defined benefit pensions did <italic>not</italic> afford pensioners much protection. The inexorable pressures of state near-bankruptcy have, in practice, dictated a disorderly piecemeal <italic>re-</italic>definition of ‘defined benefits’ already granted, of an order (in late 2011) greater than 15% and rising. This unplanned readjustment can be thought of as similar in its effect on real pensions to a ‘retrospective devaluation’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1468018112456766">
<title>Conclusion: the crisis as a case of counterparty risk</title>
<p>In the Greek crisis, the functioning of an unreformed pay-as-you-go defined benefit pension system was a key mechanism in the ‘micro foundations of disaster’. The macroeconomic logic of retrenchment applied to a state-run ‘traditional’ pension system, justified major downward pension adjustments and fed pensioner insecurity. What in a privatized system would have been <italic>financial</italic> risk to pensioners was translated to an equivalent (and no less painful) <italic>political</italic> risk.</p>
<p>The case of crisis-torn Greece may be used as a warning against easy generalizations. No ‘neoliberal agenda’ was forced on pensions; on the contrary, the public character of the system was emphatically reaffirmed. That, however, could not provide pensioners with any significant protection against (seemingly arbitrary) income readjustments.</p>
