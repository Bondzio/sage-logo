<p><bold>Objective:</bold> For patients with dextro-transposition of great arteries (<sc>d</sc>-TGAs), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the common surgical options are palliative arterial switch operation (ASO) or palliative atrial switch operation leaving the VSD open. We evaluated the role of ASO with VSD closure using a fenestrated unidirectional valved patch (UVP). <bold>Methods:</bold> Between July 2009 and February 2011, six patients with TGAs, VSD, and severe PAH (mean age 39.8 ± 47.4 months, median 21, range 8-132 months), weighing 10.7 ± 9.2 kg (median 8.6, range 4.3-29 kg), underwent ASO with VSD closure using our simple technique of UVP. Mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure before the operation was 106 ± 12.7 mm Hg (median 107.5, range 95-126 mm Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance was 9.5 ± 4.22 units (median 9.5, range 6.6-17.1 Wood units). <bold>Results:</bold> There were no deaths. All patients had a postoperative systemic arterial saturation of more than 95%, although there were frequent episodes of systemic desaturation due to right-to-left shunt across the valved VSD patch (as seen on transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiograms). Mean follow-up was 10 ± 7.6 months (median 7.5, range 1-22 months). At most recent follow-up, all patients had systemic arterial saturation of more than 95% and no right-to-left shunt through the VSD patch. In one patient, the follow-up cardiac catheterization showed a fall in pulmonary artery systolic pressure to 49 mm Hg. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Arterial switch operation with UVP VSD closure is feasible with acceptable early results. It avoids complications of palliative atrial switch (arrhythmia and baffle obstruction) and partially or completely open VSD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In developing countries, financial constraints, lack of awareness, and inadequate medical facilities lead to delayed presentation of many patients with congenital heart diseases (CHDs) to the health professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111421939">1</xref>
</sup> By this time, many patients are either in a state of borderline operability or nonoperability due to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) resulting from progressive pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD). This is especially true for anomalies like transposition of great arteries (TGAs) with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and PAH. Severe PAH leads to either bidirectional or reversed shunting across the VSD, and hence a complete patch closure of the VSD may not be tolerated by the patient due to right ventricular decompensation in the postoperative period. Such patients are best operated early in life for optimal outcomes and any delay beyond infancy poses postoperative problems apart from compromising the long-term outcome. The management options for such patients are either a palliative atrial switch or a palliative arterial switch operation (ASO), leaving the VSD open or partial closureof VSD with a fenestrated patch with subsequent closure of the remaining defect by surgical or interventional methods. We report our experience in surgically managing six such patients with a standard ASO with unidirectional valved patch (UVP) closure of the VSD and discuss our results.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>Between July 2009 and February 2011, six patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111421939">Table 1</xref>) with TGAs, VSD, and severe PAH underwent ASO with VSD closure using our simple technique of UVP.<sup>

</sup> Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all children undergoing this operation. The institutional ethics committee waived the need for a formal approval for this retrospective report as the patients are not identified. Mean age of the patients was 39.8 ± 47.4 months (range 8-132 months) and weight was 10.7 ± 9.2 kg (range 4.3-29 kg). The mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 106 ± 12.7 mm Hg (range 95-126 mm Hg) and pulmonary vascular resistance was 9.5 ± 4.22 Wood units (range 6.6-17.1 Wood units). All patients had a preoperative echocardiogram for diagnosis and estimation of pulmonary artery pressures. Cardiac catheterization was performed in five patients. None of the patients was receiving sildenafil or bosentan prior to the operation.</p>

<p>Surgery was performed via a median sternotomy under standard moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with cold cardioplegic arrest. Phenoxybenzamine was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg prior to the institution of CPB at the time of arterial cannulation. After establishment of CPB, the VSD closure was performed first. The VSD was approached through the right atrium. After inspecting the VSD, the UVP was prepared as described by us in our previous publications<sup>

</fig>
<p>Following this, the ASO was performed in the usual fashion. Elective inotropic support consisted of dopamine (5 μg/kg per min), dobutamine (5 μg/kg per min), nitroglycerine (0.5 μg/kg per min), and, in patient # 4, milrinone 0.5 μg/kg per min. Phenoxybenzamine was continued in the postoperative period at a dose of 1 mg/kg eight hourly intravenously till the patient was in the intensive care unit and later was changed to oral phenoxybenzamine capsules thrice daily. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was performed in all patients to assess the repair and to see the direction of shunting across the valved patch. In the intensive care unit, transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on the night of the surgery and repeated if there were episodes of hemodynamic deterioration or systemic desaturation, to confirm the presence and direction of the shunt across the UVP.</p>
<p>Prior to discharge from the hospital, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to assess the UVP. These patients were followed up at one week, one month, three months, six months, and at yearly intervals. Discharge medication usually consisted of oral phenoxybenzamine and diuretics, and in patient nos. 4 to 6, it is oral sildenafil. These medications were continued as required. Patient # 1 underwent a postoperative cardiac catheterization and his pulmonary artery systolic pressure had fallen to 49 mm Hg. A follow-up study with detailed cardiac catheterization and exercise studies is being planned to assess these patients further.</p>

<sec id="section3-2150135111421939">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were no deaths. All patients had postoperative systemic saturation of more than 95%, although there were frequent episodes of systemic desaturation which correlated with right-to-left shunt across the valved patch as seen on transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiograms. Mean follow-up was 10 ± 7.6 months (range 1-22 months). At most recent follow-up, all patients has systemic saturation of more than 95% and no residual right-to-left shunt was observed. In one patient, follow-up cardiac catheterization showed a fall in pulmonary artery systolic pressure to 49 mm Hg. None of these patients has a left-to-right shunt, as the UVP permits only a right-to-left shunt in the event of transient elevation of right ventricular pressure.</p>

<sec id="section4-2150135111421939">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an important adverse consequence of untreated CHD with increased pulmonary blood flow.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111421939">4</xref>
</sup> If timely intervention is not performed in such cases, severe PVOD may develop. Transposition of great arteries is also complicated by early development of PAH, irrespective of the presence or absence of a VSD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111421939">5</xref>
</sup> The accurate calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance is difficult and unreliable in these patients owing to high pulmonary artery saturation, increased bronchial blood flow, and limitations in using the standard cardiac catheterization data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111421939">6</xref>
</sup> In advanced PAH, histological changes develop in the pulmonary vasculature and these patients become high-risk surgical candidates as a complete repair is poorly tolerated in the postoperative period.</p>
<p>The management options for TGAs and VSD with severe PAH are palliative atrial switch or a palliative ASO either leaving the VSD open or partially closed with a fenestrated patch with continued medical management for PAH. All operations are performed under CPB, which leads to a state of systemic inflammatory response syndrome causing constriction of pulmonary vasculature and adding to the risk of pulmonary arterial hypertensive crisis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111421939">7</xref>
</sup> Therefore, these patients often have a stormy postoperative course with the need for substantial inotropic and ventilator support. In addition, they may need inhaled nitric oxide to prevent the acute hemodynamic deterioration, resulting from the pulmonary hypertensive crisis and right ventricular decompensation. In the worst scenario, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support may be required to tide over the postoperative phase. Palliative procedures are aimed at performing a repair to increase the systemic saturation by either an atrial or an arterial level operation and to prevent acute hemodynamic deterioration in the postoperative period. This can be accomplished by performing an atrial switch operation leaving the VSD open or an ASO with the VSD left open or partially closed or by leaving a patent foramen ovale (PFO) at the atrial level. Unidirectional valved patch closure of the VSD has been shown to be safe and effective with acceptable early and midterm outcomes in delayed presenters with left-to-right shunts and PAH in developing countries. Besides the large experience from the Novick group,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111421939">8</xref>
</sup> others have also proposed their own modifications to achieve this objective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111421939">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111421939">10</xref>
</sup> However, the application of these techniques to patients with TGAs, VSD, and severe PAH has not been widely reported. Acceptable results with reduced mortality have been reported after a palliative atrial switch operation with the VSD open,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111421939">11</xref>
</sup> but in the long-term, systemic and pulmonary venous baffle obstruction, recurrent arrhythmias, and systemic ventricular dysfunction tend to curtail the benefits of this operation. Since ASO is well accepted as the procedure of choice for the correction of TGAs, an ASO with a fully open VSD or a partially closed VSD with a fenestrated patch has also been performed for patients with TGAs and severe PAH. In a recent report from China by Lei et al, 21 patients underwent ASO in which VSD was either left open or closed incompletely.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111421939">12</xref>
</sup> At subsequent follow-up, the VSD was closed either surgically or using a device in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Although this approach seems to work well in the management of these patients, the disadvantage is the added cost of an additional intervention. In developing countries, this translates into high cost, increased duration of hospitalization, and consumption of excessive valuable resources which may not be available at all centers.</p>
<p>In our technique of ASO with UVP closure of VSD, the right ventricle can decompress in the immediate postoperative period into the left ventricle whenever the pulmonary artery pressure is raised. This may produce instances of systemic desaturation, but we have found this to be well tolerated without hemodynamic compromise. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms have shown a reduction in the estimated pulmonary artery pressures. This would be associated with reversal of the flow across an open fenestration, but since the valved patch VSD closure allows unidirectional flow only, it closes itself off, preventing any left-to-right shunt. Hence, the burden of an additional procedure can be avoided. Therefore, we believe that our technique is advantageous, compared with that proposed by Lei et al. Our experience with this technique in a limited number of patients has provided good results over a mean follow-up period of 10 ± 7.6 months. This cohort needs to be followed up further to ascertain the long-term benefits of this procedure. There may be a role for drugs like bosentan or sildenafil in further reducing the pulmonary pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111421939">13</xref>
</sup> however, we do not have any specific protocol at this time for using these drugs perioperatively or postoperatively; sildenafil was used postoperatively in some of these patients and is being continued. However, the optimal duration of therapy is uncertain. Later with more experience and follow-up, we may be able to answer this question. Another reason these patients are not treated preoperatively with pulmonary vasodilators is that these patients often come from a rural background and have already come to us late. So the bias is to operate on them earlier and administer dilators postoperatively rather than starting them well before the surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135111421939">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>The main limitations of this study are the limited number of patients and limited duration of follow-up. Follow-up cardiac catheterization has been performed in only one patient and is planned in the remaining. As mentioned above, a follow-up study with detailed cardiac catheterization and exercise studies is being planned to assess these patients further. Moreover, no comparison has been made between patients undergoing ASO with a complete VSD closure versus VSD closure with a UVP and also between those undergoing palliative atrial switch versus palliative ASO with UVP closure of VSD. However, such comparative studies may not be ethically justifiable, and it is difficult to conduct a prospective randomized trial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2150135111421939">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Arterial switch operation with UVP closure of VSD is feasible with acceptable early results. It avoids the complications of palliative atrial switch such as long-term baffle complications, arrhythmias, and systemic ventricular dysfunction and also avoids the complications of a complete or a partially open VSD. Moreover, in developing countries, avoidance of the need for repeated intervention makes the procedure more acceptable and helps in the efficient use of available resources.</p>
