<p>Response to intervention (RTI) is a topic of growing interest in fields related to early childhood care and education, and has been a topic of interest for K-12 education for some years. Although no single definition exists, RTI has been described as a tiered framework for improving student success through high-quality instruction for all children and additional supports for some children who need them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1096250612466419">1</xref></sup> The resources below provide details about this approach as well as examples of how to use it.</p>

<title>CONNECT Module 7: Tiered Instruction</title>
<p>This online module describes tiered instruction and illustrates its use in early childhood settings to promote young children’s social emotional development and academic learning. The module shares a decision-making process that may be used to determine whether and how to implement the key components of tiered instruction: formative assessment and instruction and targeted interventions. The module includes many video clips demonstrating key components, and all module materials are available at no cost in English and Spanish.</p>
