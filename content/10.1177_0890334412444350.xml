<sec id="section1-0890334412444350">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Most US hospitals distribute industry-sponsored formula sample packs. No research has examined outcomes associated with sample pack removal as part of a hospital intervention to eliminate sample distribution postpartum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412444350">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To examine prospectively hospital-based and breastfeeding outcomes associated with removal of industry-sponsored formula sample packs from the hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412444350">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We enrolled mothers postpartum at Cooper University Hospital, an urban New Jersey hospital, in 2009-2010. For the first 6 months, all women received industry-sponsored formula samples packs (control group); for the next 6 months, all postpartum women received hospital-sponsored bags with no formula at source (intervention group). Research assistants blinded to the design called subjects weekly for 10 weeks to determine feeding practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334412444350">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>We enrolled 527 breastfeeding women (284 control; 243 intervention). At 10 weeks postpartum, 82% of control and 36% of intervention women (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) reported receiving formula in the “diaper discharge bag.” Kaplan-Meyer curves for any breastfeeding showed the intervention was associated with increased breastfeeding (<italic>P</italic> = .03); however, exclusive breastfeeding was not significantly different between intervention and controls (<italic>P</italic> = .46). In post hoc analysis, receiving no take-home formula in bottles from the hospital was associated with increased exclusive breastfeeding in control (<italic>P</italic> = .02) and intervention (<italic>P</italic> = .03) groups at 10 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0890334412444350">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Although the hospital-branded replacement contained no formula at source, many women reported receiving bottles of formula from the hospital. Change in practice to remove industry-sponsored formula sample packs was associated with increased breastfeeding over 10 weeks, but the intervention may have had a greater impact had it not been contaminated.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Exclusive breastfeeding rates in the United States (US) fall far short of national goals. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, but only 13% of US infants are exclusively breastfed at 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412444350">1</xref></sup> In 2007, 91% of US hospital maternity services distributed industry-sponsored formula sample packs to new mothers when they and their infants were discharged from the postpartum unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412444350">2</xref></sup> By 2010, this rate had fallen to 72%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412444350">3</xref></sup> This marketing strategy violates the WHO International Code for the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412444350">4</xref></sup> and in a range of studies, it has been shown to undermine duration of exclusive breastfeeding, especially in vulnerable populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412444350">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412444350"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412444350"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412444350"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412444350">9</xref></sup> The practice is widely criticized by organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412444350">10</xref></sup>; the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412444350">11</xref></sup>; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412444350">12</xref></sup>; and the Government Accountability Office.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412444350">13</xref></sup> The US Preventive Services Task Force states, “Commercial discharge packs provided by hospitals that include samples of infant formula. . . are associated with reducing rates of exclusive breastfeeding.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412444350">14</xref></sup> Nonetheless the vast majority of US hospitals continue to distribute industry-sponsored formula sample packs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412444350">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412444350">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although several studies using randomized methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412444350">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412444350"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412444350"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412444350">8</xref></sup> or retrospective designs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412444350">9</xref></sup> have demonstrated that for women who receive industry-sponsored formula sample packs, breastfeeding is undermined, the effect of actually removing them from a hospital maternity setting, both in terms of breastfeeding rates and changes in hospital practice, has not previously been investigated. This is an important area of study, given the increasing numbers of US hospitals that are discontinuing sample pack distribution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412444350">3</xref></sup> Presumably, hospitals discontinue sample pack distribution in order to decrease the influence of industry, to restrict formula sample distribution, and to increase breastfeeding prevalence. At the present time, there is no evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of discontinuation of formula sample packs as a hospital change in practice intervention. Our goals were thus to measure the effectiveness of an intervention to change practice around sample pack distribution and thereby to determine (1) what hospital-relevant changes in practice occurred when sample packs were eliminated, and (2) whether discontinuation of formula sample pack distribution was associated with a change in breastfeeding practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0890334412444350" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our intervention removed formula sample packs completely from the hospital and educated staff for this change in practice, as an initial step in a service-wide decision to increase support for breastfeeding mothers. Between June 2009 and July 2010, a trained research assistant (RA) received consent from and enrolled breastfeeding women within 72 hours of birth, on the maternity service at Cooper University Hospital (CUH), an urban teaching hospital in Camden, NJ, with approximately 2300 births per year. Eligible women spoke English or Spanish and had given birth to a healthy term singleton infant. Ineligible women included those who did not speak English or Spanish, were incarcerated, were sick, had no phone, or had infants with prematurity, multiples, or illness, or who had spent &gt; 48 hours in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The RA collected baseline information, including maternal demographics. All infant feeds in the hospital were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as receiving only mother’s milk and no formula.</p>
<p>For the first 6 months of the study (the control period), subjects received industry-sponsored formula sample packs at discharge from the maternity service with their infants. These sample packs have been shown to be detrimental to breastfeeding rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412444350">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412444350">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412444350"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412444350">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412444350">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412444350">16</xref></sup> but the study was deemed ethical because their distribution was standard-of-care practice at CUH prior to the start of the study. Although sample packs were still being distributed, reflecting the “real-life; real-time situation,” the principal investigator (PI) at CUH worked during this time with maternity and pediatric staff in preparation for the change in practice, and with the hospital marketing department to develop a new, CUH-sponsored diaper bag to replace the industry-sponsored formula sample pack at discharge. Staff and patients were surveyed to determine preferred items to be included in the CUH-sponsored diaper bag; final content was based on survey responses and cost analysis. All of these measures were undertaken during the control period, because in this real-life situation, we needed to educate staff and make system-wide adjustments in order to prepare for the change.</p>
<p>Education sessions for CUH mother/infant maternity unit staff were conducted to explain the study and to provide practical solutions to potential problems. This process included providing information on how to support breastfeeding, and how to respond to potential requests for the industry-sponsored formula sample packs. This step was necessary, because formula companies send coupons to pregnant women with instructions to redeem the coupon for a “diaper bag” on the postpartum unit of the delivery hospital. Staff members were educated to explain why the coupons could not be honored, and what women would receive instead.</p>
<p>At the end of the 6-month control period, CUH stopped accepting shipments of industry-sponsored formula sample packs, which were being supplied by multiple companies, to the off-site warehouse. A 1-month washout period ensued to ensure that all these packs were removed from all units including maternity, the NICU, and the pediatric inpatient service. All of the formula sample packs were completely eliminated by the end of the 1-month washout period.</p>
<p>In late January 2010, the washout period ended, enrollment restarted for the 6-month intervention period, and subjects immediately began to receive the new CUH-sponsored diaper bag instead of the industry-sponsored formula sample pack. The bag was a medium-size, over-the-shoulder, black diaper bag with bright green accents, the Cooper logo, and the message, “Families begin at Cooper.” It was made offsite, and it contained a changing pad, multiple compartments for cups and water bottles, as well as nursing pads, baby wipes, breast milk storage containers, a bib, a water bottle for the mother, and breastfeeding information. It did not contain any formula or formula-related products.</p>
<p>Of note, <italic>all</italic> mothers at Cooper hospital, regardless of whether they were enrolled in the study or not, received industry-sponsored formula sample packs as standard of care prior to December 31, 2010. Subsequently, all mothers discharged from the hospital, regardless of whether or not they were in our study, received the CUH-sponsored diaper bag, which represented the new standard of care and a culture shift for hospital practice. At the same time, however, the hospital continued to accept free formula and supplies from the formula companies. Most US hospitals receive free formula intended for in-hospital use, as well as various other supplies such as water, sugar water, pacifiers, growth charts, developmental screening forms, and bassinet baby-name cards. The intervention did not include any changes to these ongoing practices.</p>
<p>This was a collaborative research project between Cooper Hospital and Boston Medical Center (BMC) in Boston, MA, and all follow-up took place from the Boston office. Research assistants blinded to the study design telephoned control and intervention subjects weekly for 10 weeks from BMC to determine feeding patterns and practices. As we were calling all subjects weekly, questionnaires were short, for feasibility. We asked a categorical closed feeding question: “Please can you tell us what your baby ate in the past 48 hours?” with possible answers as: (1) only breast milk; (2) mainly breast milk, but some formula (specified as ≥ 50% breast milk); (3) mainly formula, but some breast milk; and (4) only formula. For the analyses, these categories were combined; the “any breastfeeding” group was created from those who answered with 1, 2, or 3 above (exclusive plus mixed feeders). We did not ask about use of other fluids or solids. We also asked where the mother obtained any formula, with a list of possible responses and an “other” category for an open response. At 10 weeks, the RA asked more detailed questions, including “When you went home from the hospital with your baby, did someone at the hospital give you a gift bag (like an infant diaper bag with things inside)?” “Can you tell us two things that were in the gift bag?” “Did you find the gift bag useful?” and “Did the hospital give you any bottles of infant formula to take home with you that were NOT in a gift bag, just bottles?” We used the same descriptive phrases for intervention and control groups. Formula sample packs are popularly referred to as “diaper bags” or “gift bags”; we felt this language would be understood by the study population, and as RAs were blinded, this language ensured they did not know which type of bag they were asking about. Some women were lost to follow-up; women were removed from the study if they did not respond to at least 3 calls per week for 3 consecutive weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412444350">Figure 1</xref>). Institutional Review Board approval for the study was obtained from both BMC and CUH.</p>

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>A total sample of 402 mothers, 201 control and 201 intervention, was required to achieve 80% power for a 2-sided log-rank test of differences in breastfeeding between control and intervention groups. For any breastfeeding (breastfeeding with or without supplementation with formula), the sample analyzed (N = 438) provided 83% power. For exclusive breastfeeding, the sample analyzed provided 52% power. This result was linked to an unexpectedly low rate of exclusive breastfeeding at 10 weeks (70 days) in the sample.</p>
<p>Differences between control and intervention group means and percentages for maternal and infant characteristics, “diaper bags,” and miscellaneous variables were tested for significance by independent-sample <italic>t</italic> tests (continuous) or Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> (proportions). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were log-rank tested for significant differences between the control and intervention group in any and exclusive breastfeeding with Breslow <italic>P</italic> values for each.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412444350">17</xref></sup> Survival curves were analyzed up to 10 weeks. Marital status and smoking were tested for unique influence on breastfeeding differences between treatment and intervention groups using Cox proportional hazards and survival analysis. When we became aware of the level of contamination of the intervention, we ran an additional post hoc analysis using Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> to compare exclusive breastfeeding in the proportion of mothers who did not recall receiving formula from the hospital in control and intervention periods. Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 15.0.1 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, 2006).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We assessed 1517 breastfeeding women; 862 did not meet eligibility criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334412444350">Figure 1</xref>). We enrolled 527 eligible breastfeeding women (284 control; 243 intervention), representing a primarily minority population of low socioeconomic status. The control group had a higher proportion of mothers who ever smoked (<italic>P</italic> = .03) and of unmarried women (<italic>P</italic> = .03) than the intervention group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412444350">Table 1</xref>). Women lost to follow-up were significantly different than women not lost (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). We lost fewer whites than other races, and more women receiving benefits under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), more single women, more women who smoked during pregnancy, more US-born women, more receiving Medicaid, and more women with fewer years of education. However, there was no significant difference between women lost to follow-up in the control versus intervention groups.</p>

<title>Practice Outcomes</title>
<p>Approximately 80% of women recalled receiving a “diaper bag” at discharge, in both control and intervention groups. Based on data from the Week 1 telephone questionnaire, in the control period, 35% of women reported feeding infants formula from the industry-sponsored formula sample pack in the first week postpartum, and in the intervention period, 19% of women reported feeding formula from the CUH-sponsored diaper bag in the first week (<italic>P</italic> = .001). Based on data from the Week 10 questionnaire, when the “diaper bags” were industry-sponsored formula sample packs (control group), 82% of women reported receiving formula in the bag; when they were CUH-sponsored diaper bags (intervention group), 36% reported receiving formula in the bag (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Also based on Week 10 data, 85% of women found the industry-sponsored formula sample pack “useful” and 91% of women found the CUH-sponsored diaper bag “useful” (<italic>P</italic> = .72). In the control group, 51% of women reported receiving bottles of formula to take home that were <italic>not</italic> contained in the sample pack; in the intervention group, 56% reported receiving them (<italic>P</italic> = .39; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412444350">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the 2 questions regarding receipt of bottles of formula in the bag, or bottles from the hospital but not in the bag, were not mutually exclusive, we also assessed the proportion of women who did not report receipt of any formula at all to take home from the hospital. In the control period, 11 (7%) women reported that they did not receive formula to take home, either in the bag or in bottles not in the bag. In the intervention group, 35 (23%) women did not report receipt of any formula from the hospital, either in the bag or in bottles that were not in the bag (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>The cost of replacing the industry-sponsored formula sample pack with a hospital-sponsored diaper bag was approximately $14,000 for the 6-month intervention period, for all mothers giving birth at the hospital (not just study subjects). Given that 2500 infants are born annually at CUH, this is a cost of approximately $5.60 per birth. The hospital’s marketing department decided to continue to support this cost indefinitely after the study ended, with the CUH-sponsored diaper bag becoming the new standard of care. Administrators of the NICU selected specialty formulas and included purchase of these formulas in their budget in order to supply specialty formulas for NICU infants to take home at discharge, because it was determined during the course of the study that the NICU relied on industry-sponsored formula sample packs to provide these specialty formulas at discharge.</p>
<p>Cooper University Hospital met with strong resistance from formula company representatives who, during the period before industry-sponsored formula sample packs were removed, met multiple times with hospital administrators and research staff. Representatives argued against discontinuing the samples, stated that formula given to the hospital for inpatient use was not to be taken home, and they stated that the new measures would not allow the representative to perform her job. However, these protests were overruled, and at the same time, CUH implemented new policies and procedures for all pharmaceutical company representatives, restricting their access to patient areas and requiring them to make appointments, to eliminate contact with students and trainees, and to wear specific identification. During this same period, formula industry representatives approached the obstetric and pediatric practices affiliated with the hospital and supplied these ambulatory sites with samples, diaper bag/sample packs, and formula feeding supplies. In addition, they provided coupons to be distributed to pregnant mothers to be presented at the hospital in exchange for an industry-sponsored formula sample pack.</p>

<title>Breastfeeding Outcomes</title>
<p>Based on survival analysis, mean duration of any breastfeeding was 58 days in control versus 62 days in the intervention period. Forty-five percent were still breastfeeding at 70 days in the control period versus 49% in the intervention period (<italic>P</italic> = .03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0890334412444350">Figure 2</xref>). However, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in terms of exclusive breastfeeding. Mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 44 days (control) and 47 days (intervention; <italic>P</italic> = .46; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0890334412444350">Figure 3</xref>). At 1 week, 95% of the control group and 93% of the intervention group were doing some breastfeeding (“any breastfeeding”), whereas 14% of the control group and 18% of the intervention group were exclusively breastfeeding (out of the entire study population). At 10 weeks, 44% (102/227) of the control group and 49% (103/211) of the intervention group were doing some breastfeeding, whereas 8% (18/227) of the control group and 10% (22/211) of the intervention group were exclusively breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Given the difference between smoking and marital status in the control versus intervention periods, with fewer smokers and more married women in the intervention periods, we conducted additional post hoc analyses to determine the effect of the intervention on smokers and single women. Considering subjects with a history of smoking and being single, the intervention resulted in higher rates of any breastfeeding using survival analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .04), and the intervention on exclusive breastfeeding remained insignificant (<italic>P</italic> = .83)</p>
<p>After finding that 36% of women in the intervention group reported having received formula in their CUH-sponsored diaper bag, we performed a post hoc analysis on women who did not report receipt of any bottles of formula at all from the hospital. Among control group women who reported receiving formula, 9% (13/151) were exclusively breastfeeding at 10 weeks, whereas among control group women who did not report receiving formula, 36% (4/11) were exclusively breastfeeding at 10 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = .02) Among intervention group women who reported receiving formula, 8% (9/119) were exclusively breastfeeding at 10 weeks, whereas among intervention group women who did not report receiving formula, 22% (8/35) were exclusively breastfeeding at 10 weeks ( <italic>P</italic> &lt; .03).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although no formula samples were included at source in the CUH-sponsored diaper bag, 36% of women who received CUH bags (intervention group) reported receiving formula in the bag, and 19% reported feeding their babies formula from this bag during the first week of life. This rate represents a significant decrease in receipt of formula in the bag among the intervention group, however, the expectation was that <italic>no</italic> women in the intervention group would receive formula in the bag. Quality checks were ongoing during the study, and they confirmed that all industry-sponsored formula sample packs were removed from the maternity service and were no longer delivered or accessible to staff or patients after December 2009. It is possible that some mothers in both control and intervention groups misremembered some details, however, we believe clinicians either misunderstood the intention of the study or deliberately undermined the initiative, and placed formula samples into over one-third of the CUH-sponsored diaper bags.</p>
<p>In survival analysis, removal of industry-sponsored formula sample packs from the maternity service was significantly associated with increased breastfeeding over 10 weeks. No association was seen, however, between removal of these packs and exclusive breastfeeding. This finding is in contrast to results of other studies that have randomized women to receive—or not—industry-sponsored formula sample packs and have found an association between non-receipt of a sample pack and increased duration of exclusive breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412444350">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412444350"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412444350"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412444350">8</xref></sup> In post hoc analyses, women who did not report receiving formula either in or not in the bag were statistically significantly more likely to exclusively breastfeed than women who reported receiving formula; this finding is consistent with previously published research demonstrating that if mothers receive no formula at discharge, they will have an increase in exclusive breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412444350">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412444350"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412444350"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412444350"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412444350">9</xref></sup> Therefore, contamination of the intervention, together with increased pressure from industry representatives with aggressive marketing strategies in affiliated health centers and prenatal clinics, appears to have mitigated breastfeeding outcomes. These barriers and outcomes presumably did not emerge in the more experimental medium of the randomized controlled trials used in other studies conducted in this field.</p>
<p>We believe that the staff education part of the intervention was only partially successful and that such change requires time to become fully implemented. Staff resistance to change included comments like, “We serve mothers from a poor community, and we don’t want to see these mothers feeding water or cola if they cannot get their hands on formula.” Although CUH eliminated industry-sponsored formula sample packs, CUH continued to provide free formula for in-hospital use, and more than half of women in control and intervention groups reported being given samples to take home that were neither in the industry-sponsored formula sample packs nor in the CUH-sponsored replacement diaper bags. In other words, bottles of formula were widely distributed, regardless of the change in practice.</p>
<p>Of note, we did not anticipate such pervasive undermining of the change in practice. Our questionnaires to mothers pre- and post-intervention were identical, in large part because we needed to blind follow-up study staff to the type of bag received by the mother, thus pre and post, we asked if they received formula in the bag. In retrospect, we could have included more stringent questions regarding formula distribution to the intervention group and followed up more precisely on how this question related to breastfeeding practice, had we expected such rife undermining. As it was, our follow-up on why this undermining happened was largely post hoc. After the study was completed and the data reviewed, the NJ principal investigator (LFW) interviewed maternity service management, who investigated and determined that formula was being freely distributed postpartum, despite the hospital’s attempt to educate about the bags and a decision to move toward Baby-Friendly certification. At this point, more dramatic action was taken. Senior nursing management placed formula into a locked unit to be accessed only by request and staff signature.</p>
<sec id="section15-0890334412444350">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We met our required sample size to reach statistical power for analysis of any breastfeeding among the entire study population. However, because of the unexpectedly low rate of exclusive breastfeeding, this study leaves open the possibility that removal of the industry-sponsored discharge bags was associated with exclusive breastfeeding. In addition, there was insufficient power to eliminate a false-negative association between the intervention group and control group after adjusting for marital and smoking status.</p>
<p>We also note that even when all women were, in theory, receiving industry-sponsored formula sample packs (control period), only 82% of women actually reported receiving formula in the “gift bag.” Since we know that all industry-sponsored formula sample packs contained formula, we assume the discrepancy is a result of underreporting associated with women recalling events that occurred 10 weeks earlier. Similarly, when 36% of the intervention group remembered receiving formula in the gift bag, this number may have underrepresented the actual proportion of women receiving formula in the CUH-sponsored diaper bag at discharge.</p>
<p>Recent research has shown that increasing numbers of US hospitals are discontinuing the practice of distributing industry-sponsored formula sample packs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412444350">15</xref></sup> The assumption would be that doing so reduces the amount of formula samples being distributed to new mothers, however, in the case of our study, it did not eliminate their distribution. We caution other sites that similar issues may arise, even after removal of industry-sponsored formula sample packs, and that these practices may be hidden unless strenuous measures are in place to monitor and control them.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Removal of industry-sponsored formula sample packs from an urban hospital was associated with increased breastfeeding over 10 weeks, but in contrast with findings from randomized controlled trials, it was not associated with increased exclusive breastfeeding. This result may be because the intervention was heavily contaminated by ongoing distribution of infant formula by hospital staff. We believe staff put formula into diaper discharge bags during the intervention phase. Increasing numbers of hospitals in the US are removing formula sample packs, presumably to improve breastfeeding promotion and support, but this removal needs to be accompanied by ongoing examinations of staff practices. Especially where formula is freely available on the postpartum ward, counterproductive practices may mean that removing formula sample packs is only marginally effective at improving breastfeeding rates. Adopting a standard for using formula only when medically indicated or specifically requested by mothers who are breastfeeding, as outlined in the new Joint Commission’s Perinatal Care Core Measures Set, as well as implementing a hospital policy that requires purchase of formula, are potential strategies to increase exclusive breastfeeding.</p>
