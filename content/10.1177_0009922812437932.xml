<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 10-year-old Caucasian female with a history of asthma and allergic rhinitis presented for evaluation of poor linear growth. She had been treated simultaneously with inhaled fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (Advair HFA 115/21) via a valved holding chamber at 2 puffs twice daily and with fluticasone propionate nasal spray (Flonase) at 2 sprays in each nostril once daily for the past 3 years. Since 9 years of age she had decreasing linear growth velocity, poor weight gain, and fatigue. She had never taken oral steroids, nor did she have any Cushingoid features.</p>
<p>Laboratory evaluation for causes of her poor growth and fatigue showed a random cortisol level that was undetectable with otherwise normal routine screening labs for short stature. Follow-up testing revealed a low baseline ACTH of 8 pg/mL (normal = 10-60 pg/mL) with no cortisol response (cortisol &lt; 0.2 µg/dL) to 250 µg of ACTH. Adrenal antibodies were negative. Her mineralocorticoid axis was unaffected. Given these findings, she was diagnosed with central adrenal insufficiency secondary to suppression from inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use.</p>
<p>Because of the severity of her symptoms, the patient was started on physiologic steroid replacement with hydrocortisone. Her linear growth improved markedly and her fatigue resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812437932">Figure 1</xref>). The inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids were stopped, with adequate control of her asthma and rhinitis achieved with montelukast (Singulair) monotherapy. She received 6 months of oral hydrocortisone treatment followed by a 2-month taper. A subsequent cortisol level was normal at 32.3 µg/dL after her taper was completed, indicating recovery of her adrenal axis.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 3-year-old male was noted to have poor linear growth. He had a long-standing history of moderate persistent asthma, initially treated at 18 months of age with fluticasone propionate (Flovent) inhaler 44 µg at 2 puffs twice daily. Because of continued symptoms, his fluticasone dose was increased to 110 µg, 2 puffs twice daily, at 2 years of age. His mother also reported frequently increasing his dose to 4 puffs twice daily when he was having perceived asthma exacerbations.</p>
<p>Laboratory evaluation for causes of his poor growth showed a random cortisol level of 0.02 µg/dL with otherwise normal routine screening labs for short stature. During this evaluation it was noted that his asthma symptoms had improved, and his inhaled fluticasone was weaned to 110 µg at 1 puff twice daily in addition to starting montelukast. His morning cortisol level improved to 6.1 µg/dL and his linear growth improved dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922812437932">Figure 2</xref>). Ultimately, he was weaned off ICS completely.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The systemic side effects of oral glucocorticoids, particularly the development of Cushingoid features and suppression of linear growth, are well known. Pediatricians, therefore, tend to prescribe oral glucocorticoids sparingly in the management of asthma. On the other hand, there continues to be an emphasis on the chronic use of ICS for asthma controller therapy. The most recent recommendation in the NHLBI 2007 asthma guidelines is that they be the preferred agents even when treating mild persistent asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812437932">1</xref></sup> The systemic effects of ICS are usually considered inconsequential when treating asthma, as the potential risks of ICS are well balanced by their proven benefits. Numerous studies have demonstrated that although growth deceleration and mild adrenal suppression can occur from taking standard doses of ICS, these effects are usually transient and final adult height is not compromised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812437932">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812437932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812437932"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812437932">5</xref></sup> Because of the transient nature of these changes, providers may not be diligently monitoring linear growth during routine follow-up visits for patients with asthma who are on chronic ICS therapy.</p>
<p>Although uncommon, symptomatic adrenal insufficiency from suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis secondary to ICS use in asthmatics has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812437932">6</xref></sup> It is thought that chronically increased levels of inflammatory mediators in patients with asthma and other atopic disorders causes a decreased responsiveness of the HPA axis, on which is superimposed the effects of systemically absorbed ICS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812437932">7</xref></sup> Fluticasone propionate in particular appears to have the most potent suppressive effect on the HPA axis among the different ICS based on integrated plasma cortisol measurements. It has a large volume of distribution, a strong relative binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (18 times that of dexamethasone), and a prolonged receptor binding half-life (10.5 hours), all of which make it more likely to cause adrenal suppression from chronic use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812437932">8</xref></sup> Prolonged treatment with fluticasone can also decrease adrenocortical reserve (as demonstrated by low-dose ACTH stimulation test) even in cases where normal basal cortisol levels are maintained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812437932">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our cases are unusual in that the patients paradoxically developed manifestations of adrenal insufficiency while still on treatment with ICS, while at the same time not manifesting any Cushingoid features or signs of glucocorticoid excess. A suggested explanation for this paradoxical complication is that some patients show differential tissue sensitivity to corticosteroids and that polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor affect corticosteroid sensitivity in a tissue-specific manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812437932">9</xref></sup> In our patients it was likely that their ICS dose was sufficient to suppress the more sensitive HPA axis but was not adequate enough to prevent the systemic symptoms of hypoadrenalism, such as fatigue, weight loss, and growth failure.</p>
<p>Providers caring for children with asthma should be cognizant of the standard dosing ranges for the various ICS, as detailed by the NHLBI guidelines. For example, whereas a dose of fluticasone propionate 440 µg/d (Flovent 110, 2 puffs twice daily) is still considered medium-dose ICS for patients aged 12 years and older, a dose above 352 µg/d is already in the high-dose range for children younger than12 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812437932">1</xref></sup> Prolonged use of ICS at high doses could increase the risk of adrenal suppression. Furthermore, although poor adherence with chronic ICS therapy commonly serves to protect patients from this risk, providers must recognize that some families may be extraordinarily adherent, and close monitoring of dosing and growth is particularly important in these cases. Both our patients described above were given their fluticasone very consistently at prescribed doses that were well above what would be considered as high dose. The concomitant use of intranasal corticosteroids for the treatment of rhinitis in the first patient may have even further increased her risk of adrenal suppression and serves as a reminder that both inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids will have some degree of systemic absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812437932">10</xref></sup> Following the NHLBI guidelines with regard to regularly trying to step down the amount of controller therapy once control of asthma is established may avert this suppression of the HPA axis.</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922812437932">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>These cases emphasize the need to use the lowest possible dose of ICS therapy when managing asthma and rhinitis in order to minimize potential adverse effects on the HPA axis. Increased vigilance is needed for early detection of adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic children requiring chronic ICS use, as they may present in a nonclassic manner.</p>
