<abstract>
<p>Biologists call highly cooperative and socially integrated animal groups like beehives and ant colonies “superorganisms.” In such species, the colony acts like an organism despite each animal’s physical individuality. This article frames human sociality through the superorganisms metaphor by systematically reviewing the superorganismic features of human psychology. These features include (1) mechanisms to integrate individual units, (2) mechanisms to achieve unity of action, (3) low levels of heritable within-group variation, (4) a common fate, and (5) mechanisms to resolve conflicts of interest in the collective’s favor. It is concluded that human beings have a capacity to partly and flexibly display each of these superorganismic properties. Group identification is a key mechanism that activates human superorganismic properties, and threats to the group a key activating condition. This metaphor organizes diverse aspects of human psychology (e.g., normative conformity, social identity processes, religion, and the “rally around the flag” reflex) into a coherent framework.</p>

<p>What is it about beehives that captures the social imagination of so many? From Aristotle to Shakespeare, beehives have been invoked repeatedly as a metaphor and an ideal for human groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1088868311430834">Farrell, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1088868311430834">Ralph Waldo Emerson (1904)</xref> relied on the beehive image to refer to the futility of self-interested pursuits in human groups: “No matter how you seem to fatten on a crime, there can never be good for the bee which is bad for the hive” (p. 189). Mormons, who see beehives as the symbol of societal harmony, nicknamed Utah “the Beehive State” and put a beehive on the state’s flag. This article looks at human sociality through the lens of the beehive metaphor and systematically reviews its hive-like features.</p>
<p>Beehives are quintessential examples of the many coexisting in harmony. Despite each bee’s physical individuality, a colony acts like an organism unto itself: The bee colony is “a mammal in many bodies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr287-1088868311430834">Tautz, 2008</xref>, p. 3). The queen and drones represent the female and male reproductive organs, respectively, and worker bees carry out the remaining bodily functions. The mammalian body’s division of labor among organs is paralleled by the division of labor among cleaner bees, builder bees, brood care bees, guard bees, and foragers. The beehive’s functional unity is also apparent when it collects food: The foraging activity of 20,000 or so bees in a colony is coordinated such that surrounding areas are surveyed most efficiently for nectar and pollen. The nutrients are collected both in the precise quantities needed by the colony and in the nutritionally optimal mix. In short, the hive is an integrated “unit of function” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr250-1088868311430834">Seeley, 1995</xref>) that demonstrates a “correlation and cooperation of parts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr314-1088868311430834">Wheeler, 1911</xref>, p. 324). Biologists call such highly integrated entities like beehives superorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1088868311430834">Hölldobler &amp; Wilson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Superorganismic species are rare emergences in the history of life, yet when they emerge they are extremely successful. This is because solitary individuals and uncoordinated groups are no match for them. Given their size advantage, ability to aggregate information, and efficiency that comes from a massive division of labor, superorganismic colonies gain the ecological upper hand. As a result, in the more than 100 million years over which they have existed, no family of ultrasocial insects is known to have become extinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr324-1088868311430834">E. O. Wilson, 1990</xref>). Even though such insects make up just 2% of the approximately 900,000 known insect species, they are believed to compose more than half of the total insect mass. Ants alone are estimated to equal human beings in mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1088868311430834">Hölldobler &amp; Wilson, 2009</xref>). Beyond sheer numbers, social insects have pushed solitary insects (e.g., cockroaches and grasshoppers) away from the best nest sites on vegetation and ground, to remote and less stable sites, such as peripheral twigs, leaf surfaces, and mudflats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr324-1088868311430834">E. O. Wilson, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Are Human Groups Superorganisms?</title>
<p>The human ecological dominance is reminiscent of the superorganismic species. Recently, a number of biologists claimed that human groups also are (at least partially) superorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1088868311430834">Foster &amp; Ratnieks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr277-1088868311430834">Stearns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr323-1088868311430834">D. S. Wilson &amp; Wilson, 2007</xref>). They argued that human beings have made an evolutionary transition from primate colonies to a superorganismic existence. If human groups are superorganisms, this should be evident first and foremost in their social behavior. Social psychology is thus in a privileged position to evaluate whether human groups display any superorganismic traits. Some social psychologists have indeed suggested that a superorganism perspective can help explain various social-psychological phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1088868311430834">Brewer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088868311430834">Brewer &amp; Caporael, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr322-1088868311430834">D. S. Wilson, van Vugt, &amp; O’Gorman, 2008</xref>). This article systematically reviews how and when human groups display superorganismic properties. Based on a wealth of psychological evidence, I conclude that human psychology is characterized by numerous mechanisms that make superorganismic social structures possible. Identification with a group is the switch that activates these mechanisms, and superorganismic features are magnified under threat to the group. Human groups thus have superorganismic potential that is manifested opportunistically and flexibly. This account of the human superorganismic capacity is neither a denial nor a rejection of human traits that are not superorganism-like. Selfishness, conflict, and competition are facts of many human groups. Without question, human groups are nothing like superorganisms in many ways. Still, I argue that superorganismic capacity is part of human psychology and that the superorganism metaphor is a useful heuristic to explain human sociality.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows: I first revisit the history of social psychology to discuss how the idea of human groups as superorganismic structures was lost in psychology. I then review ideas from evolutionary science on superorganisms to set the stage for the psychological evidence on human superorganisms. In the article’s major part, I discuss how human psychology and social phenomena resonate with the design of superorganismic species.</p>

<sec id="section2-1088868311430834">
<title>The History of the Superorganism Idea</title>
<p>The idea that human groups resemble organisms can be found in ancient India, where Hinduism’s four major castes were described as having descended from different body parts of a god-created primal giant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr221-1088868311430834">O’Flaherty, 1981</xref>). The implication is that all castes must work together, as do the parts of one body. A similar idea occurs in Plato’s <italic>Republic</italic>, where Socrates made the extended analogy that a city-state is like a man (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088868311430834">A. Bloom, 1991</xref>). He described justice in an ideal city-state (which involves each caste doing its job well and for the common good) to segue into his discussion of justice in a man (in which each part of the psyche does its job well and for the common good).</p>
<p>As these examples show, superorganismic conceptions of human society are ancient. Moreover, numerous social thinkers have conceived of human societies as organisms that need to be understood on their own terms rather than as a mere collection of individuals (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr187-1088868311430834">MacLay, 1990</xref>). The term <italic>superorganism</italic>, which was later appropriated by biologists, was first used by 19th-century thinker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr276-1088868311430834">Herbert Spencer (1876/1969)</xref> to describe human groups. Like the Hindu sages and Plato, he thought that human groups’ interdependence is similar to a body’s functional integration:
<disp-quote><p>When we see that in a mammal, arresting the lungs quickly brings the heart to a stand; that if the stomach fails absolutely in its office all other parts by-and-by cease to act; that paralysis of its limbs entails on the body at large death from want of food, or inability to escape; that loss of even such small organs as the eyes, deprives the rest of a service essential to their preservation; we cannot but admit that mutual dependence is an essential characteristic. And when, in a society, we see that the workers in iron stop if the minders do not supply the materials; that makers of clothes cannot carry on their business in the absence of those who spin and weave textile fabrics; that the manufacturing community will cease to act unless the food-producing and food-distributing agencies are acting . . . we are obliged to say that this mutual dependence of parts is similarly rigorous. (p. 12)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Spencer was a sociologist, and the idea that groups are more than their parts’ sum is foundational to sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1088868311430834">Durkheim, 1895/1950</xref>). Psychology, in contrast, seldom goes beyond the individual unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr223-1088868311430834">Oishi, Kesebir, &amp; Snyder, 2009</xref>). And yet the history of psychology also has included organismic conceptions of human groups. Wilhelm Wundt divided psychology into individual psychology, which would rely on experimentation, and <italic>Völkerpsychologie</italic>, which would study psychological processes in historical and cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr330-1088868311430834">Wundt, 1912/1916</xref>). He defined <italic>Völkerpsychologie</italic> as the study of “those mental products which are created by a community of human life and are, therefore, inexplicable in terms merely of individual consciousness since they presuppose the reciprocal action of many” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr330-1088868311430834">Wundt, 1912/1916</xref>, p. 3). His 10-volume <italic>Elements of Folk Psychology</italic> covered such topics as language, religion, cults, customs, morals, and myth. Wundt believed that these collective phenomena would not fully lend themselves to experimentation, and the experimental project of psychology was thus a limited one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1088868311430834">Farr, 1996</xref>). Soon after these volumes were published, however, <italic>Völkerpsychologie</italic> was declared outdated and too philosophical to be relevant to psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1088868311430834">Eliot, 1917</xref>). Wundt’s deviation from experimentalism was not received kindly and prompted the “positivist repudiation of Wundt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1088868311430834">Danziger, 1979</xref>). This backlash was a harbinger of the reductionism and methodological individualism that would soon dominate social psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1088868311430834">Cahan &amp; White, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1088868311430834">Farr, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-1088868311430834">Jahoda, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another organismic brand of psychology, the “group mind,” appeared around the turn of the 20th century, when large collectives such as labor unions and socialist organizations began to play significant roles in public life. Scholars responded to the social and political changes of the times. Some believed that there was a distinct psychology of group behavior that could not be fully captured through the psychology of the isolated individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1088868311430834">Freud, 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-1088868311430834">Le Bon, 1896/1920</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr195-1088868311430834">McDougall, 1920</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-1088868311430834">Gustave Le Bon (1896/1920)</xref> specifically invoked the society-as-organism metaphor to argue this point:
<disp-quote><p>The psychological group is a provisional being formed of heterogeneous elements, which for a moment are combined, exactly as the cells which constitute a living body form by their reunion a new being which displays characteristics very different from those possessed by each of the cells singly. (p. 30)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr195-1088868311430834">William McDougall (1920)</xref>, the author of social psychology’s first textbook, similarly believed that the discipline’s proper subject was “the general principles of collective mental life which are incapable of being deduced from the laws of the mental life of isolated individuals” (pp. 7-8).</p>
<p>But this organismic view of groups was also rejected. In his seminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088868311430834">1924</xref> textbook, Floyd Allport wrote, “There is no psychology of groups which is not essentially and entirely a psychology of individuals. . . . Psychology in all its branches is a science of the individual. To extend its principles to larger units is to destroy their meaning” (p. 4). He rejected any metaphysical notion of the group mind, noting that “the actions of all are nothing more than the sum of the actions of each taken separately” (p. 5). Historians of psychology have remarked that this was a non sequitur: Rejecting the metaphysical aspect of the group mind concept does not necessitate the rejection of a group psychology that emerges from the interactions of individuals and is irreducible to individual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1088868311430834">Greenwood, 2004</xref>). Yet this rejection was the next critical step toward the reign of methodological individualism in social psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr226-1088868311430834">Pepitone, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr247-1088868311430834">Sampson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr252-1088868311430834">Semin, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Particularly since World War II, American social psychology has distanced itself from sociological approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr223-1088868311430834">Oishi et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, group studies have relied heavily on small groups of strangers, and group behavior has often been modeled as the aggregate of individual processes. Group cohesiveness, for example, has been operationalized as the average attraction of group members to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1088868311430834">Hogg, 1992</xref>). This reductionist treatment and neglect of emergent collective phenomena was a major trigger of the “crisis in social psychology” during the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1088868311430834">Cartwright, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr196-1088868311430834">McGuire, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr238-1088868311430834">Ring, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr256-1088868311430834">Sherif, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr278-1088868311430834">Steiner, 1974</xref>). The crisis has since abated, but individualism and reductionism remain dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr240-1088868311430834">Rodrigues &amp; Levine, 1999</xref>) despite such notable exceptions as research on social identity that will be reviewed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr284-1088868311430834">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>), research on cultural psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr259-1088868311430834">Shweder, 1991</xref>), and research on dynamic social psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-1088868311430834">Latané &amp; Bourgeois, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr219-1088868311430834">A. Nowak &amp; Vallacher, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As a discipline, social psychology is located between the individual and social levels of analysis. This position presents the challenge of bridging the two levels. As we have seen, social psychology opted for methodological individualism early in its history, which led to the neglect of emergent social phenomena and reciprocal determination between individual and social levels. Given the trends just described, social psychology today—particularly in the United States—is theoretically and methodologically disinclined to look at individuals as units of a superorganism. Current perspectives from evolutionary science, however, provide some analytical tools that are conducive to conceptualizing human sociality in such terms. I next review these evolutionary ideas to set the stage for the discussion of superorganismic human features.</p>

<title>Major Transitions in Evolution and the Emergence of Superorganisms</title>
<p>Life forms are organized in nested clusters. Genes are bundled in chromosomes that occur in cells. Cells are joined together in multicellular organisms, and some multicellular organisms, such as bees and ants, live in societies. This hierarchical organization strongly suggests that the amazing diversity of life forms is partly the result of the grouping of biological units into higher-level units. Although this idea has been endorsed since the end of the 19th century, it has not been part of the mid-20th-century evolutionary synthesis, most likely because it has lacked a strong theoretical underpinning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088868311430834">Bourke, 2011</xref>). Since then, however, a modern view of life’s hierarchical organization has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088868311430834">Bonner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1088868311430834">Buss, 1987</xref>). The dynamic underlying the hierarchical organization of life forms has been called <italic>major transitions in evolution</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-1088868311430834">Maynard Smith &amp; Szathmáry, 1995</xref>). A major transition in evolution occurs when individual organisms become so integrated that they transform into a higher-level organism in their own right. There are multiple obstacles to such integration: Integration requires communication among individual units, capabilities for coordination, and suppression of competition at the lower level. This is why major transitions are rare.</p>
<p>Major transitions are among the most important events of the last 4 billion years because they have been key propellers in the history of life. At every level of biological organization, a closer look reveals cooperative communities. Yesterday’s aggregates become today’s integrates by joining into survival alliances and suppressing competition at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr186-1088868311430834">G. O. Mackie, 1986</xref>). Self-replicating molecules have given way to self-replicating complexes (e.g., chromosomes). The eukaryotic cell is a symbiotic community of previously autonomous bacteria, some of which have given up their reproductive independence to join the eukaryotic cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr189-1088868311430834">Margulis, 1981</xref>). Multicellular organisms are collections of individual eukaryotic cells that work together as a highly cooperative unit. And finally, such multicellular organisms as ants, termites, honeybees, and naked mole rats transitioned from groups of solitary individuals to colonies that act much like one organism: a superorganism. Superorganisms have a division of labor resembling the organ systems in a body, and some individuals forgo reproduction, much like somatic cell lineages in multicellular bodies that do not pass genetic material to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1088868311430834">Buss, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-1088868311430834">Maynard Smith &amp; Szathmáry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr201-1088868311430834">Michod, 1999</xref>). Major transitions demonstrate how at any level of organization, consolidating power by cooperating with other units at the same level may lead to a huge competitive advantage (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088868311430834">H. Bloom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1088868311430834">Corning, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr329-1088868311430834">Wright, 2000</xref>). As a result, life is full of such alliances.</p>
<p>This article explores how far the superorganism metaphor can take us in capturing aspects of human sociality. It should be noted at the outset that this metaphor is applied to specific human groups, and not to humanity in general or such temporary aggregations as crowds. Here, a group is defined as any collection of individuals that allows its members to switch from “me” to “us.” In social scientific terminology, this is any collection of individuals who share a social identity. As such, a group could be based on religion, nationality, race, political party, or sports team. Among others, it could take the form of a tribe, a street gang, a family, a troop, a fraternity or sorority, a clique, or a work team.</p>
<p>I use two strategies to establish the analogy between human groups and superorganisms. First, I ask what superorganismic features are evident in human psychology and human groups. Second, I look at two major phenomena of human sociality (religion and morality) to identify how they embody superorganismic principles.</p>

<p>The following discussion identifies these superorganismic features in human psychology and human groups.</p>
<sec id="section5-1088868311430834">
<title>1. Integration of Lower-Level Units Through Communication</title>
<p>Integration is defined as the forging of connections among disconnected parts. Connectedness among lower-level units is an elemental requirement for any organism. In the words of a prominent honeybee expert, “[T]he formation of a higher-level unit by integrating lower-level units will succeed only if the emerging organization acquires the appropriate ‘technologies’ for passing information among its members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr250-1088868311430834">Seeley, 1995</xref>, p. 247). All living organisms have internal communication and coordination systems. Human cells, for example, communicate through nervous and hormonal systems in addition to cell-to-cell contact. Unlike cells in a body, bees are physically dispersed yet integrated through various chemical and tactile signals such as the “waggle dance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr310-1088868311430834">von Frisch, 1967</xref>). In human beings, this function is fulfilled through the uniquely versatile means of symbolic communication and communication through the bodily expression of internal states.</p>
<sec id="section6-1088868311430834">
<title>Integration through symbolic communication</title>
<p>One means of human communication is the use of symbols with shared meanings. This ability allows us to access other minds so we can offer information, make an argument, request something, make a promise, give advice, challenge a claim, and engage in countless other speech acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr249-1088868311430834">Searle, 1969</xref>). As the biographies of feral children suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr214-1088868311430834">Newton, 2002</xref>), the human brain requires immersion in a complex symbolic web to realize its potential. This human dependence on group culture is symptomatic of a superorganism as it reflects the functional integration of parts into the whole for their existence. Just as a cell cannot exist outside the body, and a bee cannot exist outside the colony, human beings cannot meaningfully exist outside symbolic culture. Human cognition is instead distributed between the individual mind and the symbolic culture in the sense that human cognitive processes heavily rely on cultural input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1088868311430834">Donald, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1088868311430834">Hutchins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr253-1088868311430834">Semin, 2004</xref>). Culture that is transmitted via shared symbols connects individuals to their societies’ cognitive models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr258-1088868311430834">Shore, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Language is a major medium of human communication that deeply pervades human sociality. The remarkable generativity of language injects extraordinary versatility into human interactions and unlocks collective possibilities not available to species with less flexible communicational means. The discussion of symbolic communication in this section briefly touches on all human superorganismic aspects to be reviewed later, for symbolic communication is essential to each of them.</p>
<p>First, language aids coordination and planning, which, in turn, facilitate cooperative joint action. Experimental studies of social dilemmas show that participants are more likely to commit to a cooperative strategy if they can talk to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1088868311430834">R. M. Dawes, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-1088868311430834">Kerr &amp; Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994</xref>). Moreover, because language allows people to transcend the here and now, it increases cooperation through the social control device of reputation. Gossip, a very effective means of reputation transmission, allows individuals to monitor group members, so they can selectively interact with cooperators and withhold benefits from or punish noncooperators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311430834">Dunbar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr200-1088868311430834">Merry, 1984</xref>). Gossip not only exposes noncooperators but also communicates norms and values by revealing acceptable and unacceptable behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088868311430834">Baumeister, Zhang, &amp; Vohs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr244-1088868311430834">Sabini &amp; Silver, 1982</xref>). Like gossip, folktales, legends, and proverbs also convey cultural values and norms. Anthropologists have noted that however primitive its material technology, no society exists without these folkloric forms that express group values and norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088868311430834">Bascom, 1953</xref>). In sum, language facilitates coordination, planning, and commitment; enables social control through reputation transmission; and serves as a carrier of cultural values and norms.</p>
<p>Symbols also promote group identity and cohesion by defining who is “in” and who is “out.” In other words, they draw the group’s boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1088868311430834">Giles, Coupland, &amp; Coupland, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr248-1088868311430834">Scherer &amp; Giles, 1979</xref>). Why are there so many languages? Why do languages keep changing? And why is Esperanto not taking off as the language of the masses? A clue to all these puzzles is that language variation serves group formation and maintenance by making it costly to enter and exit groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr213-1088868311430834">Nettle, 1999</xref>). Consciously or unconsciously, people modify their speech to expand and shrink social boundaries: Positive and cooperative interactions are associated with a convergence of speech styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1088868311430834">Giles &amp; Smith, 1979</xref>). In contrast, people whose identity is being threatened rely more heavily on linguistic features that make their speech distinctive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088868311430834">Bourhis &amp; Giles, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-1088868311430834">Labov, 1972</xref>). People also react more negatively to those who speak different languages, dialects, or accents (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088868311430834">Bradac, 1990</xref>). This preference for native speakers emerges early in life. Infants who are 5 months old prefer to look at native speakers, 10-month-old infants preferentially accept toys from native speakers, and preschool children are more likely to choose to befriend a native speaker. Moreover, all of these age groups prefer speakers with a native accent over speakers with foreign accents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-1088868311430834">Kinzler, Dupoux, &amp; Spelke, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Symbolic group markers are so potent that they can uphold very abstract groups such as nations. Nations are in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088868311430834">Benedict Anderson’s (1983)</xref> words “imagined communities.” They are imagined because never, not even in the smallest nation, can citizens know all their compatriots. Yet despite the impossibility of intimate personal bonds with fellow citizens, many people have a strong sense of allegiance to their nation. What gives power to the idea of nation is an elaborate set of shared symbols and meanings. Research on nation building shows how newly independent nation-states immediately embark on massive symbolic projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088868311430834">Birch, 1989</xref>): Nation builders declare an official language and create national paraphernalia such as a flag, a national anthem, and new military uniforms. They rename towns, buildings, and capital cities. They create and cultivate distinctive myths, memories of an ethnic past, and traditions that, at times, may be more invented than real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr262-1088868311430834">A. D. Smith, 1999</xref>). These symbolic processes serve to create an identity and a sense of solidarity among people who will always remain strangers. Nation-building cases from around the world illustrate the extent to which symbolic processes can integrate groups.</p>
<p>In sum, symbolic communication is foundational to human sociality. Symbols play a crucial role in fulfilling each requirement for a superorganismic formation: They foster coordination and cooperation by facilitating planning, information sharing, norm enforcement, and boundary marking. Clearly, language is not an exclusively cooperative tool for it may be used to lie, mislead, insult, and threaten. Still, symbols afford enormous capabilities for joint action and collective problem solving. Language multiplies what individuals can gain by cooperating, rather than ignoring, competing with, or attacking each other, and allows the attainment of collective goals that are beyond the reach of any single individual. It significantly amplifies the potential for non-zero-sum interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr263-1088868311430834">E. A. Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr329-1088868311430834">Wright, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1088868311430834">
<title>Integration through synchronous movement</title>
<p>Symbolic communication is not the only way to bridge the gulf between individual minds. Human beings also communicate through their bodily expressions. Mirror neurons are activated when someone both does an action and observes someone else perform it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr239-1088868311430834">Rizzolatti &amp; Craighero, 2004</xref>). Consequently, corresponding internal states can be achieved between two people in the absence of any symbolic exchange. This phenomenon is held to precede symbolic communication evolutionarily and ontogenetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr254-1088868311430834">Semin, 2007</xref>). In this section, I review the evidence on the role of bodily communication in human group formation and maintenance, and in particular the importance of synchronous activities as a means of group integration.</p>
<p>One form of synchronous activity is dancing. Although dancing does not figure prominently in modern societies or in psychological theorizing, it has been a major cultural element throughout human history. The anthropological record shows that festive dancing was a very significant aspect of prehistoric human life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1088868311430834">Ehrenreich, 2006</xref>). Archaeologist Garfinkel asserted that dancing scenes “were a most popular, indeed almost the only, subject used to describe interaction between people in the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1088868311430834">Ehrenreich, 2006</xref>, p. 22). Festive dancing is also documented to be ubiquitous in the small-scale societies studied by anthropologists. Participants report that submitting oneself bodily to the music and dance creates an altered state of consciousness—a deeply satisfying sense of being incorporated into a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr235-1088868311430834">Rappaport, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr300-1088868311430834">V. Turner, 1969</xref>). Anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr230-1088868311430834">Radcliffe-Brown (1933/1948)</xref> wrote on dancing among the Andaman Islanders,
<disp-quote><p>As the dancer loses himself in the dance, as he becomes absorbed in the unified community, he reaches a state of elation in which he feels himself filled with an energy of force immensely beyond his ordinary state . . . finding himself in complete and ecstatic harmony with all the fellow-members of his community, experiences a great increase in his feelings of amity and attachment towards them. (p. 252)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Dancing is often accompanied by drumming. Anthropological works consistently refer to the ritualistic use of drumming to alter consciousness and induce transcendent spiritual states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr191-1088868311430834">Maxfield, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr328-1088868311430834">Woodside, Kumar, &amp; Pekala, 1997</xref>). Clinical applications have also shown that drumming reduces stress and creates a sense of connection to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088868311430834">Blackett &amp; Payne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1088868311430834">Friedman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr326-1088868311430834">Winkielman, 2000</xref>). In one study, participants in a small group reported more attraction toward each other after a hand-drumming session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-1088868311430834">C. D. Kaplan, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Military drill also creates ecstatic joy, similar to the one experienced through ritualistic dance and drumming. Here is how historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr198-1088868311430834">William McNeill (1995)</xref> described the blissful feelings caused by military drill:
<disp-quote><p>Words are inadequate to describe the emotion aroused by the prolonged movement in unison that drilling involved. A sense of pervasive well-being is what I recall; more specifically, a strange sense of personal enlargement; a sort of swelling out, becoming bigger than life, thanks to participation in collective ritual. (p. 2)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The evidence, then, strongly suggests that rhythmic entrainment leads people to an ecstatic state of union with others, wherein the self seems to merge with something larger. Neurophysiologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1088868311430834">Freeman (1995)</xref> described dance and music as the biotechnology of group formation because they are so effective in triggering a collective mental state of we-ness. This sense of unity is not communicated in symbols; rather, participants experience it physically as they move in sync.</p>
<p>Despite the plethora of historical and anecdotal evidence on the effects of synchronous activity in integrating groups, empirical work is scant. We know that interactional synchrony is linked to rapport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088868311430834">Berneiri, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1088868311430834">Cappella, 1997</xref>), and experimental tests of the role of synchronous activity have found that singing and moving together lead to more cooperative behavior in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr325-1088868311430834">Wiltermuth &amp; Heath, 2009</xref>) and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-1088868311430834">Kirschner &amp; Tomasello, 2010</xref>). The rich anthropological evidence and partakers’ passionate accounts suggest that synchronous activity may be an ancient group-bonding technology as well as a fundamental human experience that is largely missed by modern people and modern psychologists.</p>
<p>In sum, integration of units through various communicational means is a critical aspect of superorganisms. Human groups have at least two means of integration, symbol use and bodily communication.</p>

<title>2. Unity of Action: Shared Intentionality, Social Identity Processes, and Deference to Legitimate Authority</title>
<p>Integration of units is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for superorganism formation. Units may be highly interconnected, and yet they may not have the capacity to act as a functional unit. The millions of computers connected through the World Wide Web provide an example of dense interconnection without unity of action. The capacity to act as a functional unit is another key feature of a superorganism.</p>
<p>Beehives are functional units thanks to their capacity for self-organization. Self-organization refers to decentralized organization achieved without an external controller or an internal control center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr250-1088868311430834">Seeley, 1995</xref>). It is common in biological systems made of numerous subunits that yet lack the communicational or computational abilities required for centralized control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr251-1088868311430834">Seeley, 2002</xref>). In these systems, high-level organization emerges as units respond to local cues. A magnolia tree, for example, efficiently allocates resources to growing and maintaining its roots, trunk, branches, leaves, and flowers, in the absence of central oversight by any of the tree’s parts. The interactions of bees are similarly governed by local environmental stimuli that activate genetically given properties. Because these properties have been finely tuned over evolutionary time, the emerging pattern is adaptive for the hive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1088868311430834">Camazine et al., 2001</xref>). As a result, the beehive acts as a functional unit when it distributes its workforce among the hive’s needs, collects its nutrients, regulates its temperature, selects a location to colonize, or builds honeycombs.</p>
<p>Self-organization also accounts for the emergence of coordination, order, and social patterns in human groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-1088868311430834">Kenrick, Li, &amp; Butner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr219-1088868311430834">A. Nowak &amp; Vallacher, 1998</xref>). The human capacities for sharing intentionality and identifying with a group create bottom-up functional integrity through self-organization. In addition to these bottom-up processes, human psychology also lends itself to establishing functional integrity top-down, owing to the human willingness to submit to legitimate authority. I next review these three capabilities that enable united action in human groups.</p>
<sec id="section9-1088868311430834">
<title>Shared intentionality</title>
<p>Human beings can engage in collaborative action because they can form joint goals and effectively coordinate the roles involved in goal pursuit. Consider a joint action as deceptively simple as two people moving a couch from one corner of the room to the other. To successfully complete this task, the two individuals must each form an intention to move the couch, know that they share this intention, be motivated to cooperate, and be able to initiate collaborative action. Once they begin the task, they need to adjust their behavior instantaneously to their partner’s actual and anticipated behaviors as well as the task environment. Although the origins of such collaborative undertakings are evident in chimpanzees, our closest genetic relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr199-1088868311430834">Melis, Hare, &amp; Tomasello, 2006</xref>), human beings are extraordinary collaborators, able to undertake collective actions involving thousands or even millions of people. What accounts for this exceptional capacity?</p>
<p>The ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals is called <italic>shared intentionality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr293-1088868311430834">Tomasello, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr294-1088868311430834">Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, &amp; Moll, 2005</xref>). Shared intentionality involves forming corresponding mental states regarding aspects of the world (<italic>common ground</italic>) along with mutual knowledge of this correspondence. What is crucial here of course is not the correspondence of mental states, which could be achieved incidentally by any two organisms, but the mutual awareness of it. This mutual awareness is the base from which communicative exchange and joint action is launched.</p>
<p>Joint attention is the most elemental skill of human collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr208-1088868311430834">Moore &amp; Dunham, 1995</xref>). It has precedents in nonhuman primates, but human beings take joint attention to qualitatively new levels. Before 9 months of age, infants dyadically interact with objects or people, such as when they grasp and manipulate an object, or have proto-conversations with a caregiver. In this period, attention is singularly focused on one object or person at a time. At around 9 months something revolutionary happens: Infants develop a capacity for triadic interactions—a capacity to coordinate their attention between another person and an external object. They, for example, start to follow an adult’s gaze by alternately looking at the adult and the target of the adult’s attention. Infants also point to or hold up an object for an adult to see, thereby attempting to direct the adult’s attention to it. A baby will, for example, point to a flitting butterfly that dazzles her, and check the adult’s face. She will want the adult to look at the butterfly and then back at her, not being satisfied if the adult looks only at her or only at the butterfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr183-1088868311430834">Liszkowski, Carpenter, Henning, Striano, &amp; Tomasello, 2004</xref>). At around this time, infants also start participating in joint engagements involving an object, such as rolling a ball back and forth. All of these activities involve a triadic coordination of attention among the infant, a social partner, and an external object. This capacity for triadic coordination of attention is the foundation of human cultural cognition that is based on symbolic exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr292-1088868311430834">Tomasello, 1999</xref>). At the minimum, a symbol is a triadic act involving two people and an external object: It represents a mutually recognized convention between at least two people on how to communicate about an object.</p>
<p>Chimpanzees who lack cultural cognition also lack the capacity for joint attention. Like human beings, they can follow the gaze of other chimpanzees. But, they rely on head movements, whereas human beings track eye direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr295-1088868311430834">Tomasello, Hare, Lehmann, &amp; Call, 2007</xref>). This reliance on eye direction is afforded by the human eye’s unique morphology. Human eyes seem to be designed to enhance the gaze signal, whereas nonhuman primate eyes seem to be designed to camouflage it. An analysis of primate eyes found that out of a sample of 81, only human eyes showed a high color contrast with the surrounding skin. Of all species, human beings had the highest ratio of exposed sclera in the eye outline and the most horizontally elongated shape. Moreover, human eyes were the only ones to have white sclera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-1088868311430834">Kobayashi &amp; Kohshima, 2001</xref>). These features all serve to more effectively communicate attentional focus to conspecifics: They facilitate joint attention. Chimpanzees, unlike human infants, also are not interested in establishing joint attention by pointing. This is not for a want of pointing capacity—captive chimpanzees do sometimes point to demand an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-1088868311430834">Leavens, Hopkins, &amp; Bard, 2005</xref>). They just do not seem to have any desire to use pointing to share an interest with a conspecific. Joint attention thus sets human beings apart from other primates.</p>
<p>Joint attention, the first step toward joint action, allows individuals to start from a common ground with shared representations of objects and events. After all, how can people jointly manipulate their environment if they cannot first focus on the same aspect of the world? But that is not all, for joint action also requires coordination of activities. Coordination involves a division of labor and mutual awareness of each party’s different role and perspective. As mentioned above, language is an extremely powerful coordination tool. Interestingly, though, very young children can coordinate roles before they can talk. Children 18 months old are able to reverse their roles in a game involving an object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1088868311430834">Carpenter, Tomasello, &amp; Striano, 2005</xref>). In one study, the experimenter put a Big Bird toy on the floor and covered it with a cloth, asking the child, “Where is Big Bird? Can you find him?” After doing this three times, the experimenter gave the toy and the cloth to the child saying, “It’s your turn now.” For this particular task, 18-month-olds were more likely than 12-month-olds to hide the Big Bird under the cloth and look at the experimenter, presumably in anticipation of her role fulfillment. This capacity to reverse roles suggests that the infants had a global representation of the joint activity as well as a sense of the roles involved. In children’s ability to mentally represent an activity with its differentiated roles, we find the developmental origins of collaboration and division of labor.</p>
<p>All of that shows that people are capable of joint attention and engagement. But just as importantly, they take delight in it. When children point to an object, they want others to respond enthusiastically. When a mutual engagement is broken, they want to reestablish it. In one study, children aged 14 to 24 months and three human-raised juvenile chimpanzees were presented with instrumental tasks that required collaboration with the experimenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr311-1088868311430834">Warneken, Chen, &amp; Tomasello, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr312-1088868311430834">Warneken &amp; Tomasello, 2007</xref>). In the midst of these joint tasks, the experimenter suddenly stopped participating. Human children reacted to this disengagement very differently from the chimpanzees: They waited for reengagement, and when it was not forthcoming they actively tried to reengage the experimenter by establishing eye contact, gesturing, and making sounds. No chimpanzee, on the other hand, made any attempt to reengage the experimenter. Once the experimenter disengaged, so did the chimpanzees. Moreover, some human children apparently found collaboration so rewarding that they turned the instrumental task into a social game: They placed the reward back into the apparatus to start the activity over.</p>
<p>This readiness to turn an instrumental task into a game should not come as a surprise, for children’s vast appetite for play reflects an eagerness for joint creation and joint action. Play often involves establishing a shared universe inhabited by play partners. The universe has distinctive roles (“I’m the doctor and you’re the patient”), rules (“everybody will hide until ‘it’ counts to ten”), functions for objects (“the bed sheet is my cape and the umbrella is my sword”), and meanings for actions (“wetting with a water pistol means killing”). Through play, children exercise their capacity for building and functioning in shared social realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr231-1088868311430834">Rakoczy, 2006</xref>). In other words, they exercise shared intentionality. The ubiquity and appeal of such play unequivocally illustrate the human ability and motivation for binding oneself to shared social constructions. Without this motivation to share emotions, activities, and conventions, collaborative action could not occur.</p>
<p>We saw that people differ from other primates in their capacity for shared intentionality. Still, this comparison fails to convey fully what it would mean for a human being to lack this capacity. One group of human beings, unfortunately, exhibits exactly this condition. Autistic individuals have low levels of skill and motivation for joint attention and engagement. They are mostly unable to infer conclusions from gaze direction, such as the referent of an uttered word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088868311430834">Baron-Cohen, Baldwin, &amp; Crowson, 1997</xref>) or an individual’s mental state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088868311430834">Baron-Cohen, Campbell, Karmiloff-Smith, Grant, &amp; Walker, 1995</xref>). Autistic children are unlikely to offer something to another person’s attention for the sake of sharing an interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr210-1088868311430834">Mundy, Sigman, Ungerer, &amp; Sherman, 1986</xref>) or to engage in pretend play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088868311430834">Baron-Cohen, 1987</xref>). They also have difficulties with language development. According to one estimate, about half of the autistic population never acquires functional linguistic skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088868311430834">Bailey, Phillips, &amp; Rutter, 1996</xref>). Autistic individuals, in other words, are not adequately in tune with their social environment and are short on the skills needed to respond to it adaptively. Their predicament highlights the significance of the shared intentionality skill set for human sociality. Without those skills, human beings could not show the initiative and responsiveness required to act together.</p>
<p>In sum, human beings have a unique capacity for joint action. This is possible because they are able and willing to coordinate attention on aspects of the world with others and take on roles with attached expectations and obligations. Division of labor is crucial for any superorganism’s effective functioning, and shared intentionality is the most elemental building block underlying human division of labor in joint goal pursuit.</p>

<title>Social identity processes</title>
<p>The previous section described the micro foundations of the human capacity for joint action that allow two people to collaborate. This section and the next one describe how human beings achieve unified action at larger scales of social organization. A group of people can succeed in facing challenges and achieve goals to the extent that they can merge their forces for a common purpose and act “one for all and all for one.” In human groups, this happens through social identification processes, by which individuals adopt group goals and display preferential treatment and loyalty to group members.</p>
<p>To understand what makes groups act in unison, consider the times people do not take collective action even if the conditions call for it. Political scientists have noted the curious lack of political cohesion in some highly visible groups such as the Chinese in Indonesia, native people in Argentina, and North Africans in Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1088868311430834">Huddy, 2003</xref>). Why do these people fail to work in solidarity for their group’s benefit? The answer is that political coalescing requires more than objective membership in a demographic category. In each of these cases, the missing ingredient is a subjective sense of belonging to the group. Because they do not feel strong ties to their group, these people do not form a united front. Identification with a group is what allows individuals to adopt group-level goals and get mobilized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr283-1088868311430834">Tajfel (1981)</xref> defined social identity as an individual’s “knowledge of his membership in a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance attached to the membership” (p. 255). Research inspired by social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr283-1088868311430834">Tajfel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr284-1088868311430834">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>), and its subsequent elaboration social categorization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1088868311430834">Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr299-1088868311430834">J. C. Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>) explains the basic mechanisms that bind people to groups and coordinate their collective actions.</p>
<p>Social identity theory is based on the premise that group processes cannot be reduced to interpersonal processes among group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr299-1088868311430834">J. C. Turner et al., 1987</xref>). When they identify with a group, individuals not only like group members and feel similar to them, but they also incorporate the group into their self-concept by self-categorizing as a group member. Consequently, a shift happens “towards the perception of the self as an interchangeable exemplar of some social category and away from the perception of self as a unique person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr299-1088868311430834">J. C. Turner et al., 1987</xref>, p. 50). This shift increases people’s perceived similarity to their group members and perceived dissimilarity to members of other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr261-1088868311430834">Simon, Pantaleo, &amp; Mummendey, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The incorporation of the group into the self-concept marshals the same cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes associated with the self. Cognitively, groups become included within people’s mental representation of themselves. For example, people are faster to say that a particular trait describes them if it applies to both themselves and their group, compared to when there is no match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr267-1088868311430834">E. R. Smith &amp; Henry, 1996</xref>). Conversely, reporting on the ingroup’s characteristics is facilitated to the extent that those characteristics match one’s own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr266-1088868311430834">E. R. Smith, Coats, &amp; Walling, 1999</xref>). Notably, this representational self-group overlap is as strong as the representational overlap with a spouse, as measured by the response speed to traits describing oneself versus the spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088868311430834">Aron, Aron, Tudor, &amp; Nelson, 1991</xref>). People who identify closely with a group are also more likely to take extreme action on behalf of their group, when either their personal or social identity is activated, suggesting that their mental representations of themselves and of their group have fused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr282-1088868311430834">Swann, Gómez, Seyle, &amp; Morales, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Group identification has affective consequences, too. According to intergroup emotions theory, identifying with a group makes the group part of a person’s self-concept and thereby a significant source of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr185-1088868311430834">D. M. Mackie, Devos, &amp; Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr264-1088868311430834">E. R. Smith, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr265-1088868311430834">1999</xref>). When a group identity is salient, events concerning the group will evoke emotions in accordance with the event’s implications for the group and not necessarily its implications for the individual. Consistent with this theory, group-based emotional reactions are sometimes distinct from reactions based on individual concerns, such as when people feel guilt over their nation’s colonial past or record of genocide, even though they did not partake in these historical episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1088868311430834">Doosje, Branscombe, Spears, &amp; Manstead, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr268-1088868311430834">E. R. Smith, Seger, &amp; Mackie, 2007</xref>). As a result of the group’s incorporation into the self-concept, group-relevant events also affect emotions and cognitions about oneself. For example, male basketball and soccer fans experience a testosterone surge after their team’s victory and a testosterone drop after the team’s defeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088868311430834">Bernhardt, Dabbs, Fielden, &amp; Lutter, 1998</xref>). People who strongly identify with a sports team also lose faith in their own mental and social abilities after their team loses a game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1088868311430834">Hirt, Zillman, Erickson, &amp; Kennedy, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Identification with a group also leads to preferential treatment of group members. The minimal group paradigm strikingly demonstrates the human readiness to identify with a group and favor one’s group over other groups (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1088868311430834">Diehl, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr285-1088868311430834">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>). People discriminate in favor of their ingroup even when their individual gains do not depend on allocations by ingroup or outgroup members, suggesting that this preferential treatment of ingroup members owes to more than considerations of reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1088868311430834">Gagnon &amp; Bourhis, 1996</xref>). Further supporting the idea that group identification cannot be fully explained by self-interest, diverse lines of research find that political behavior is driven by collective rather than individual interests. Research on relative deprivation shows that people’s perception of their group’s deprivation, as opposed to their personal deprivation, best predicts their political attitudes and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1088868311430834">Guimond &amp; Dubé-Simard, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-1088868311430834">Kawakami &amp; Dion, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr306-1088868311430834">Vanneman &amp; Pettigrew, 1972</xref>). Southern black college students’ participation in the civil rights movement, for example, was predicted more strongly by their feelings about the treatment of black Americans in general than by their discontent with their own lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr225-1088868311430834">Orbell, 1967</xref>). Voting and public opinion show a similar pattern. Reviewing decades of public opinion research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-1088868311430834">Kinder (1998)</xref> concluded,
<disp-quote><p>Interests, it is now clear, do have a part to play in public opinions—that is, interests that are collective rather than personal, group-centered rather than self-centered. In matters of public opinion, citizens seem to be asking themselves not “What’s in it for me?” but rather “What’s in it for my group?” (as well as “What’s in it for other groups?”). (p. 808)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The stronger the identification with the group, the stronger the group’s grip on the individual. People who closely identify with a group are more likely to invest their own resources in the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1088868311430834">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1088868311430834">De Cremer &amp; Van Vugt, 1999</xref>), more likely to engage in discretionary cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr302-1088868311430834">Tyler &amp; Blader, 2000</xref>), less likely to exit the group when presented with an attractive option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088868311430834">Abrams, Ando, &amp; Hinkle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1088868311430834">Ellemers, Spears, &amp; Doosje, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr308-1088868311430834">Van Vugt &amp; Hart, 2004</xref>), and more likely to show ingroup bias and ingroup pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-1088868311430834">Jackson &amp; Smith, 1999</xref>).

<title>Status hierarchies and deference to legitimate authority</title>
<p>Identifying with a group provides the basic internal mechanism that connects individuals with their group and motivates them to act on group interests. Whereas social identity processes regulate group behavior by providing individuals with emotional and cognitive incentives to think, feel, and act in unison with their group, the human tendency to defer to legitimate authority allows the top-down regulation of lower-level units. Leadership is born out of a need for effective collective action. Eminent leadership thinker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1088868311430834">John Gardner (1993)</xref> wrote, “The larger topic of which leadership is a subtopic is the accomplishment of group purpose” (p. xvi). Importantly, leadership is firmly tied to social identity processes. An effective leader is someone who can create a powerful sense of “us,” who is perceived as “one of us,” and who is able and willing to advance “our” interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1088868311430834">Haslam, Reicher, &amp; Platow, 2010</xref>). A leader’s reliance on coercive means suggests a failure at mobilizing the social identity processes that cause group members to follow a leader voluntarily and enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Deference to legitimate authority is a fundamental aspect of human psychology, as demonstrated by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr203-1088868311430834">Milgram (1974)</xref> studies. Milgram wrote that “even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority” (p. 6). This deference may seem like a form of submission to dominance; however, the Milgram studies did not involve the use or threat of force. In general, within human groups deference is freely given based on status rather than obtained through coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1088868311430834">Henrich &amp; Gil-White, 2001</xref>). Human status hierarchies differ from the dominance hierarchies common in social primates and some nonprimate species. Whereas dominance hierarchies determine the allocation of a fixed amount of resources such as food and mates, human hierarchies often also aim to accomplish group goals that might expand the group’s resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr243-1088868311430834">Rubin, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Status hierarchies facilitate collective decision making and intragroup coordination toward goal pursuit, as low-status individuals defer to high-status individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1088868311430834">De Kwaadsteniet &amp; Van Dijk, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr309-1088868311430834">Van Vugt, Hogan, &amp; Kaiser, 2008</xref>). This differentiation of roles among group members is a form of division of labor that parallels the division of labor within organisms. But such status differentiation will expand the resource pie and increase the group’s efficiency only if status is granted to those who exercise their influence for the group’s benefit. Research suggests that this is often the goal. High status is usually bestowed on those who are expected to contribute most to valued group goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088868311430834">J. Berger, Cohen, &amp; Zelditch, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088868311430834">J. Berger, Fisek, Norman, &amp; Zelditch, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr301-1088868311430834">Tyler, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr318-1088868311430834">Willer, 2009</xref>). In one study, the group’s most altruistic members were accorded the highest status. Moreover, as the costs of altruism increased, the status rewards also increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1088868311430834">Hardy &amp; Van Vugt, 2006</xref>). As a result, individuals pursue status by enhancing their apparent value to the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088868311430834">C. Anderson &amp; Kilduff, 2009</xref>). Conversely, people detest leaders who do not serve group goals and band together against that leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088868311430834">Boehm, 1993</xref>). By offering status and respect to those who exert themselves for valued group goals, well-functioning status hierarchies also serve to align individual goals with group goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr188-1088868311430834">Magee &amp; Galinsky, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of hierarchies, it should also be noted that hierarchies may under certain circumstances hamper group performance and morale (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088868311430834">C. Anderson &amp; Brown, 2010</xref>). Status differences among group members may suppress effective information transmission and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr202-1088868311430834">Milanovich, Driskell, Stout, &amp; Salas, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr290-1088868311430834">Thomas-Hunt &amp; Phillips, 2004</xref>), groups may fail to assign status to most competent members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088868311430834">C. Anderson &amp; Kilduff, 2009</xref>), and even when they do, power may corrupt those at the top of hierarchies or make them reckless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088868311430834">C. Anderson &amp; Galinsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-1088868311430834">Kipnis, 1972</xref>). Nevertheless, status hierarchies are functional for coordinating goal pursuit and motivating individuals to contribute to the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1088868311430834">Halevy, Chou, &amp; Galinsky, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, shared intentionality, social identity processes, and deference to legitimate authority constitute the basic mechanisms that allow human groups to undertake united collective action. These psychological processes align individuals with the group, enable division of labor, and make joint goal achievement possible.</p>

<title>3. Low Levels of Heritable Variation Among the Superorganism’s Units</title>
<p>Barring mutations, cells in a body are genetically identical. Bees in a hive are not genetically identical, but they are highly related. As a result of this genetic homogeneity, the cells of one organism are genetically far more similar to each other than they are to the cells of a different organism, and members of one hive are more similar to each other than they are to members of other hives. Moreover, these shared genetic properties are heritable. An organism is genetically more similar to its parent organism(s) than to other members of the same species. Similarly, a hive is genetically more similar to its parent colony than to other bee colonies. In other words, the level of heritable variation is low within members of a hive. This section discusses aspects of human psychology that reduce within-group heritable variation and increase between-group variation.</p>
<p>Human groups do not have the genetic relatedness of ant and bee colonies. Migration and intermarriage rates are high, and human genes often mix across group boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr242-1088868311430834">Rogers, 1990</xref>). It would thus be hard to make a case for genetic homogeneity among members of any human group. And yet human beings do have means to reduce heritable variation within groups, for, unlike other animals, phenotypical variation in human groups is largely the result of culture. Human culture thus functions like a social “inheritance” mechanism that promotes phenotypical similarity in somewhat the same way that genetic inheritance promotes phenotypical similarity in bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088868311430834">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1088868311430834">Jablonka &amp; Lamb, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Social learning is the mechanism underlying the emergence of between-group cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1088868311430834">Henrich &amp; Boyd, 1998</xref>). Cultural differences arise and persist because human beings readily absorb language, attitudes, skills, and norms from members of their groups. Compliance with social norms is a fundamental aspect of human psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1088868311430834">Cialdini &amp; Trost, 1998</xref>). Young children become upset when an experimenter breaks a norm, such as the rules of a game or the word used to refer to an activity, even if the norm was established minutes ago in the lab. When this happens, children protest, criticize the norm breaker, try to teach the correct norm, and sometimes tattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr232-1088868311430834">Rakoczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr233-1088868311430834">Rakoczy, Warneken, &amp; Tomasello, 2008</xref>). These behaviors illustrate the early ontogenic origins of conformity to a socially constructed reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088868311430834">P. L. Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1966</xref>).</p>
<p>The power of normative influence was recognized in classical studies of social psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088868311430834">Asch, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1088868311430834">Deutsch &amp; Gerard, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr255-1088868311430834">Sherif, 1936</xref>). More recent studies have shown repeatedly that what other group members do, approve of, and care about are vastly important determinants of human behavior. The most reliable way of getting people to do something is to make others around them do it: Telling people that their neighbors are conserving energy is a better way of getting them to conserve energy than appealing to their sense of social responsibility, desire to save money, or hope to safeguard the Earth for future generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr218-1088868311430834">Nolan, Schultz, Cialdini, Goldstein, &amp; Griskevicius, 2008</xref>). What people will and will not do closely mirrors what they think others do and do not do: People’s perception of how much their friends cheat on their partners is positively related to how much they are willing to cheat themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1088868311430834">Buunk &amp; Bakker, 1995</xref>). In addition, people care about what others around them care about: The strongest predictor of eating disorders among elementary and middle school girls is the importance their peers place on weight, trumping factors such as the girls’ self-confidence, actual weight, or desire to look like women depicted in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr288-1088868311430834">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The psychological evidence on the power of norms is corroborated by the anthropological record. In his analysis of 25 randomly picked cultures from the Human Relations Area Files, David Sloan Wilson found that even though cultural norms varied widely, every group had clearly defined and vigilantly enforced norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr271-1088868311430834">Sober &amp; Wilson, 1998</xref>). For example, one record on the Mbuti people who live in the Congo region of Africa said, “Even the most insignificant and routine action in the daily life of the family is potentially a major concern to the band as a whole. . . . It is important that there should be a pattern of behavior that is generally accepted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr298-1088868311430834">Turnbull, 1965</xref>, p. 118, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr271-1088868311430834">Sober &amp; Wilson, 1998</xref>, p. 165).</p>
<p>Part of the reason why people are so eager to follow norms is that those who stand against the majority are perceived negatively, disliked, and rejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088868311430834">Bassili &amp; Provencal, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-1088868311430834">J. M. Levine, 1989</xref>). Furthermore, resisting normative influence feels uncomfortable as a study of brain activity suggested. In this study, more activation was observed in participants’ amygdala, which is associated with negative emotions, when they disagreed with the confederates in an Asch-type setting by giving the correct answer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088868311430834">Berns et al., 2005</xref>). These adverse reactions to norm violators and norm violation ensure that people will adhere to group norms lest they suffer the internal and external consequences.</p>
<p>Importantly, people follow only their own group’s norms and not just any norms that come their way. The key determinant in norm compliance is identification with the group. In line with the previous discussion of social identity processes, people who identify with a group conform more to group attitudes and behavior. In one Asch-type study, psychology students conformed 58% of the time to other psychology students but only 8% of the time to ancient history students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088868311430834">Abrams, Wetherell, Cochrane, &amp; Hogg, 1990</xref>). In another study, participants were much more responsive to the canned laughter of ingroup members than the laughter of outgroup members: They laughed more and for longer, smiled more, and rated the material as more entertaining when the canned laughter was attributed to students from the same university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr227-1088868311430834">Platow et al., 2005</xref>). Participants were also more likely to cheat to get money when they had seen an ingroup member cheat blatantly. Yet when they had seen an outgroup member cheat, they were less likely to cheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1088868311430834">Gino, Ayal, &amp; Ariely, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Along the same lines, the more people identify with a group, the keener they are to observe group norms and have other members observe the norms, too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1088868311430834">Hyman &amp; Singer, 1968</xref>). In one study, the intention to exercise regularly was most strongly associated with the perceived norms of a reference group for participants who identified highly with that reference group but not for weakly identified participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr289-1088868311430834">Terry &amp; Hogg, 1996</xref>). In another study, greater identification with a group was associated with more positive emotions toward members who conformed to group norms compared to members who violated them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1088868311430834">Christensen, Rothgerber, Wood, &amp; Matz, 2004</xref>). People also care more about group members’ norm compliance: According to the “black sheep effect,” we are generally less tolerant toward a norm transgressor when this person belongs to an ingroup rather than an outgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088868311430834">Abrams, Marques, Bown, &amp; Henson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr190-1088868311430834">Marques &amp; Yzerbyt, 1988</xref>). Norms, therefore, are primarily binding for group members, and, in turn, adherence to them is an indicator of commitment to the group.</p>
<p>In sum, cultural learning is the basis for low heritable variation in human groups. The susceptibility to the normative influence of fellow group members reduces within-group heritable variation and increases between-group differentiation.</p>

<title>4. A Common Fate</title>
<p>Another property of superorganisms is the commonality of individual fates. Common fate aligns the interests of individual subunits. In a multicellular body, for example, the organism’s reproductive fate coincides with the fitness interests of its cells. Since these cells all share the same genes, the interests of one cell are identical to those of the next one. Although bees in a hive are not genetically identical, a strong alignment of individual interests is ensured by their high levels of relatedness. In these cases, because individual outcomes are highly correlated, what is good for one unit is often also good for the other. In the absence of such an alignment, a higher-level entity would either not emerge or be unstable and collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088868311430834">Bourke, 2011</xref>). What, if anything, ensures common fate in human groups?</p>
<sec id="section14-1088868311430834">
<title>Egalitarianism</title>
<p>Human groups, as noted, do not have the genetic homogeneity of cells in a body or bees in a hive—reproductive interests do not overlap much within a group. Do human beings have alternative means of leveling the variation in individual fates? The answer is yes. To understand these means, we need to shift our gaze from major transitions that involve related individuals to those that do not. Some major transitions affected nonrelated parties that subsequently retained their ability to reproduce. An example of this is the emergence of meiosis, a form of cell division whereby each daughter cell gets half the parent cell’s genetic material. This is an egalitarian process in that every allele has just about the same chance of ending up in the sperm or egg. Because this process is mostly fair, there is not much individual alleles can do to increase their chances of representation in future generations—except for cooperating to make a finer organism together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr177-1088868311430834">Leigh, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-1088868311430834">Maynard Smith &amp; Szathmáry, 1995</xref>). These transitions involving nonkin are known as “egalitarian” transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr229-1088868311430834">Queller, 2000</xref>), and they ensure an alignment of interests through an egalitarian distribution of outcomes. I argue below that human groups also have a preference for egalitarianism, and this preference helps to even out the variation in individual fates to some extent.</p>
<p>The major factor sustaining egalitarian outcomes in human groups is the sense of fairness. This sense runs so deep that people might feel guilty for surviving catastrophes when others have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr215-1088868311430834">Niederland, 1961</xref>). This “survivor guilt” syndrome has been observed among survivors of the Holocaust and Hiroshima, workers whose colleagues have been laid off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1088868311430834">Brockner, Davy, &amp; Carter, 1985</xref>), and sexually active gay men who tested HIV negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr313-1088868311430834">Wayment, Silver, &amp; Kemeny, 1995</xref>). In experimental setups, people are willing to pay from their own pockets to secure egalitarian outcomes for others, taking from the rich and giving to the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311430834">C. T. Dawes, Fowler, Johnson, McElreath, &amp; Smirnov, 2007</xref>). The aversion to inequality is apparent in children, too, and it seems to be stronger in older children than younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1088868311430834">Fehr, Bernhard, &amp; Rockenbach, 2008</xref>). In one study children had to choose between getting two stickers for themselves versus getting one sticker for themselves whereas their play partner would also get one sticker. By 5 years of age, children were far more likely to opt for an egalitarian distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr291-1088868311430834">Thompson, Barresi, &amp; Moore, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Another emotion that sustains egalitarian outcomes is envy, which generates ill will and hostility toward those perceived to have advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr269-1088868311430834">R. H. Smith &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>). The human propensity to envy helps level inequalities, as potential targets of envy try to deflect the “evil eye” by sharing their fortunes or engaging in other acts of appeasement. A study found that people provided more help to someone whom they thought might be maliciously envying them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr305-1088868311430834">van de Ven, Zeelenberg, &amp; Pieters, 2010</xref>). Envy thus also plays a role in evening out the distribution of outcomes.</p>
<p>Egalitarian emotions and cultural practices align individual fates within a group from the bottom up. Variation in individual fates may also be reduced from the top down as egalitarian principles get embodied in the practices by which people govern themselves, such as when all citizens are granted equal rights before the law and when these laws mandate an egalitarian distribution of benefits and burdens (e.g., universal suffrage and universal conscription).</p>
<p>Egalitarianism seems to be characteristic of hunter–gatherer and horticulturalist societies that are living in conditions of economic uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1088868311430834">Cashdan, 1980</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088868311430834">Boehm (1993)</xref> described several leveling mechanisms in hunter–gatherer societies that keep leaders in check and prevent them from obtaining too much power. For example, members of these societies accept leadership only in areas of expertise, and chiefs are publicly criticized, ignored, or even ostracized if the group does not approve of their actions (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088868311430834">Boehm, 1999</xref>). One consequence of the preference for equality is that men often do not acquire enough wealth to have more than one wife even when polygamy is socially accepted. Anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr211-1088868311430834">Murdock (1949)</xref> concludes, “An impartial observer employing the criterion of numerical preponderance . . . would be compelled to characterize nearly every known human society as monogamous, despite the preference for and frequency of polygyny in the overwhelming majority” (pp. 27-28). Practices and norms that level the fitness differences within a group, such as monogamy, are called mechanisms of “reproductive leveling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088868311430834">Alexander, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088868311430834">Bowles, 2006</xref>). Food sharing, another such mechanism, is common among human hunter–gatherers and many forager–horticulturalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-1088868311430834">H. Kaplan &amp; Gurven, 2005</xref>). Such egalitarian norms and practices serve to even out inequalities in a group.</p>
<p>Of course, inequalities characterize past and current civilizations. Throughout history, complex societies with a more specialized division of labor were as a rule richer and more powerful. At the same time, these societies were more stratified and unequal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr197-1088868311430834">J. R. McNeill &amp; McNeill, 2003</xref>). Does that mean that egalitarian practices are dispensable for human groups? The social patterns accompanying inequality suggest otherwise. A large body of evidence, for example, indicates that social harmony is threatened in societies with high levels of income inequality. These societies do not have much social capital: People trust each other less and participate less in community life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-1088868311430834">Kawachi, Kennedy, Lochner, &amp; Prothrow-Stith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr228-1088868311430834">Putnam, Leonardi, &amp; Nanetti, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr304-1088868311430834">Uslaner, 2002</xref>). The low levels of social capital are also evident in higher levels of violent crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1088868311430834">Hsieh &amp; Pugh, 1993</xref>). In fact, the level of income inequality seems to be the strongest environmental predictor of homicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr212-1088868311430834">Neapolitan, 1999</xref>). More equal societies, in contrast, are happier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr222-1088868311430834">Oishi, Kesebir, &amp; Diener, 2011</xref>) and healthier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1088868311430834">Deaton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr316-1088868311430834">Wilkinson &amp; Pickett, 2006</xref>). These findings have been replicated within and across nations, cross-sectionally, and longitudinally (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr315-1088868311430834">Wilkinson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although correlational, these patterns are consistent with the idea that an alignment of individual outcomes is more conducive to social harmony in human groups. Deviations from egalitarian arrangements in contrast, seem to disrupt effective group functioning and divide communities.</p>

<title>Intergroup warfare</title>
<p>Common fate is a matter of degree in human groups, and perhaps nothing aligns individual fates more compellingly than warfare. Although bee colonies do not fight, warfare among ant colonies can be ferocious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1088868311430834">Hölldobler &amp; Wilson, 1994</xref>). At the battlefield, ants spray poisons over their opponents, cut off their limbs, and stab them with their stings. Some ant genera have soldier castes that are idle until threat is impending, and others conduct cannibal wars. Survival is at stake since whole ant colonies can get annihilated in the hands of another colony. Warfare may be similarly consequential for human groups. A defeated group might perish, lose the freedom of self-governance, or have to concede valuable resources such as territory and material wealth. The group’s women may be coerced to sexual intercourse. To the extent that intergroup warfare has been part of the human experience, we can claim that a high degree of common fate characterizes some human groups. Was warfare historically a prevalent phenomenon?</p>
<p>Humanity’s distinctive social nature is said to have evolved within the context of a hunter–gatherer lifestyle during the Pleistocene Epoch, which spans the period from 2 million years ago to about 11,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr296-1088868311430834">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 2005</xref>). Given that material evidence is rare and ambivalent, archeologists are reluctant to make generalizations about warfare in this era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1088868311430834">Gat, 2006</xref>). To study warfare in the Pleistocene, researchers instead turn to anthropological evidence from contemporary hunter–gatherer societies. This strategy, of course, is also fallible since the hunter–gatherer societies anthropologists study have had contact with modernity and are marginalized groups today. As such, they are hardly representative of the hunter–gatherer societies of the Pleistocene in which we are interested. A partial work-around is studying Australian Aborigines, who had no contact with modern civilization and had not been marginalized until the European arrival at the end of the 18th century. The picture of the hunter–gatherer lifestyle they provide is thus as close to the Pleistocene lifestyle as we can ever hope to get.</p>
<p>Before the Europeans arrived in Australia, about 300,000 hunter–gatherers lived in some 400 to 700 regional groups. It turns out that these aboriginal groups were highly territorial and lived in a constant state of warfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1088868311430834">Gat, 2006</xref>). Papua New Guinean hunter–gatherers were similarly unexposed until recently, and like the Australian Aboriginal groups, they fought frequently. Regarding the Papua New Guinea tribes, anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1088868311430834">LeBlanc (2003)</xref> wrote that “this last place on Earth to have remained unaffected by modern society was not the most peaceful but one of the most warlike ever encountered” (p. 151). Studies based on larger samples of hunter–gatherers affirm these trends. A study of 99 hunter–gatherer societies found that almost all of them were engaged in warfare at the time they were studied or had been so in recent past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1088868311430834">Divale, 1972</xref>). Evidence, although not airtight, suggests that warfare was common during the Pleistocene.</p>
<p>Moving to the Holocene Epoch, which began about 11,000 ago when the last continental glaciers retreated, the evidence for warfare is reliable and unequivocal. The Holocene covers the period when agriculture took off and human social structures grew far more complex. The evidence for warfare includes defensive location choices for settlements such as hilltops surrounded by fortifications; highly concentrated numbers of arrowheads outside these fortifications (particularly at the gates); mass graves with extraordinarily high rates of death by projectiles; evidence of burning in entire communities; caches of weapons, shields, and armor; and finally empty zones between clusters of communities, which were presumably contested no-man’s-lands too dangerous to inhabit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-1088868311430834">Keeley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr174-1088868311430834">LeBlanc, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The anthropological evidence from these two epochs suggests that warfare was common in human prehistory. In addition to the anthropological data, population genetics research provides striking evidence on the occurrence and consequences of intergroup conflict. Studies show how groups of men have reproductively replaced other groups of men over time. One study mapped the genetic patterns of a Columbian population established in the 16th to 17th centuries, comparing maternal and paternal lines of inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1088868311430834">Carvajal-Carmona et al., 2000</xref>). This population’s maternal ancestry was more than 90% South American, yet the paternal line was 94% European, suggesting that coalitions of European men had replaced South American men. Similar, though less stark, differences have been found for other populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088868311430834">Bortolini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr303-1088868311430834">Underhill et al., 2001</xref>). These findings underscore the importance of intergroup competition for reproductive fate, especially for men (on this latter point, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1088868311430834">Geary, Byrd-Craven, Hoard, Vigil, &amp; Numtee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr307-1088868311430834">Van Vugt, De Cremer, &amp; Janssen, 2007</xref>). Overall, evidence strongly suggests that intergroup warfare was a stable element of human history, with drastic consequences for the group as a whole.</p>
<p>In sum, egalitarian emotions, norms, and practices serve to bring individual fates closer together within a group. Egalitarian institutional practices such as the rule of law also equalize outcomes. A paradigmatic case of common fate is intergroup warfare, where much is at stake for the group as a whole. The evidence suggests that warfare was an integral part of human history.</p>

<title>5. Mechanisms to Resolve Conflicts of Interest in Favor of the Collective: Prosocial Emotions, Norms, and Institutions</title>
<p>Collective enterprises can easily be undermined by individuals who selfishly impose costs on the group or enjoy the benefits of public goods without bearing their fair share of the costs. For cooperative alliances to take off and endure, free riding needs to be minimized. A common fate reduces conflicts of interests by aligning them, yet such conflicts are never fully eliminated. Although shared genes ensure a very high coincidence of interests, conflicts of interests remain even in multicellular organisms. For instance, cancer occurs when mutations in some somatic cells cause them to multiply at the expense of other cell lineages and, eventually, at the expense of the whole body. In honeybees, too, the coincidence of fitness interests is not complete, and worker bees could increase their own fitness by laying eggs. But this rarely happens because many worker bees restrain themselves from laying eggs. Moreover, they are coerced by the policing behavior of other worker bees that eat worker-laid eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr236-1088868311430834">Ratnieks &amp; Visscher, 1989</xref>). Turning to human groups, we similarly find various forms of both self-restraint and coercion that help resolve interest conflicts in favor of the collective. This section discusses how human groups counter the free-rider problem and promote within-group cooperation by building on the other capabilities discussed so far, including language, a strong propensity to comply with group norms, and an intense need for belonging and approval.</p>
<p>Human interactions are coordinated by a variety of emotions that orchestrate social behavior. Of particular interest to us are moral emotions that provide internal rewards for cooperation and internal costs for noncooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1088868311430834">Fessler &amp; Haley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1088868311430834">Haidt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr286-1088868311430834">Tangney, Stuewig, &amp; Mashek, 2007</xref>). For example, the anticipation of shame, embarrassment, and guilt makes individuals resist the temptation of acting in nonnormative or noncooperative ways. Similarly, distress at others’ suffering prevents us from harming others, whereas gratitude motivates us to reciprocate benefits. The importance of moral emotions to cooperation and social order is highlighted by the portraits of those who lack them. Psychopaths have a deficiency in feeling moral emotions such as guilt, shame, and distress at others’ suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088868311430834">Blair, 1999</xref>). This deficiency makes them a major source of social trouble. Even though they make up less than 1% of the population, they commit more than 50% of the most serious crimes such as serial murder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1088868311430834">Hare, 1993</xref>). Moral emotions thus serve as self-restraint mechanisms.</p>
<p>Moral emotions also fulfill a coercive function. One important emotion that keeps free riders in check is moralistic anger toward noncooperators. In economic games, people are eager to punish defectors even if they have to pay for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1088868311430834">Fehr &amp; Gächter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1088868311430834">Henrich et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, people’s dorsal striatum is activated when they punish those who do not cooperate. This brain part is implicated in the processing of rewards, suggesting that people derive satisfaction from punishing noncooperators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1088868311430834">de Quervain et al., 2004</xref>). This punishment, in turn, has been shown to uphold cooperation levels in a public goods game, in the absence of which cooperation quickly disappears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088868311430834">Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1088868311430834">Fehr &amp; Gächter, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A remarkable aspect of moral emotions is that they are concerned with third parties. We are not just inclined to punish those who cheat us and reward those who cooperate with us. We also have moral reactions to events that do not directly concern us. For example, many people feel uplifted when they hear about someone who risks his life to save a stranger from being run over by a train or someone who dedicates her life to providing medical care to the underprivileged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1088868311430834">Haidt, 2003</xref>). People also react negatively to moral transgressions that do not directly affect them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr220-1088868311430834">M. A. Nowak &amp; Sigmund, 2005</xref>). In one study, participants included as third parties in dictator or prisoner’s dilemma games had the option of punishing other players by paying out of their own endowment. Of the participants, 60% punished violators of fairness and cooperation norms, even though these participants were not affected by the transaction and had to pay to punish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1088868311430834">Fehr &amp; Fischbacher, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Sanctions may entail very little or no cost to the punisher when they take the form of social disapproval or exclusion. People are deeply averse to criticism, ridicule, and ostracism and strongly motivated to get others to approve and like them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088868311430834">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-1088868311430834">Leary, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr319-1088868311430834">Williams, 2001</xref>). Our sense of self-worth is contingent on our perception of how much we are socially accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr172-1088868311430834">Leary, Tambor, Terdal, &amp; Downs, 1995</xref>). Moreover, social exclusion activates brain areas that are also associated with physical pain, suggesting that social pain may be just as compelling and consequential as physical pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1088868311430834">Eisenberger, Lieberman, &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr182-1088868311430834">Lieberman &amp; Eisenberger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr184-1088868311430834">MacDonald &amp; Leary, 2005</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr331-1088868311430834">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>). Disapproval and exclusion are thus low-cost mechanisms to encourage cooperation.</p>
<p>Given that people care about norm violations and are willing to impose sanctions, concern with one’s reputation is critical to both individual social success and the sustenance of cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr204-1088868311430834">Milinski, Semmann, &amp; Krambeck, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr205-1088868311430834">2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr272-1088868311430834">Sommerfeld, Krambeck, Semmann, &amp; Milinski, 2007</xref>). Information about others’ reputations is also highly valuable as it allows us to navigate the social world more adroitly. Reflecting this high premium on social information, people keenly seek out gossip and sensational news. According to one study covering eight countries and three centuries, cheating and violence were the most common themes of sensational front page stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1088868311430834">Davis &amp; McLeod, 2003</xref>). This attention to the social behavior of third parties, coupled with the willingness to impose sanctions on them, renders the pursuit of self-interest at the expense of others an ineffective strategy and serves the group as a whole.</p>
<p>All human groups value cooperative norms (e.g., honesty, reciprocity, generosity, and hospitality) and teach them to their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088868311430834">Brown, 1991</xref>). Given the crucial role of normative influence in shaping human behavior, this prevalence of cooperative norms provides another layer of incentives for cooperation. Importantly, though, it has been repeatedly shown that people are more likely to act cooperatively toward ingroup members than outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1088868311430834">Hornstein, Masor, Sole, &amp; Heilman, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr179-1088868311430834">M. Levine, Cassidy, Brazier, &amp; Reicher, 2002</xref>). In one study, supporters of the Manchester United soccer team were encouraged to think of themselves as Manchester United fans. When they were next exposed to a staged emergency, they helped an injured stranger wearing a Manchester United shirt more than they helped an injured stranger wearing a plain sports shirt or a fan wearing a Liverpool shirt. But when they were first encouraged to think of themselves as soccer fans, they helped the strangers wearing either team’s shirt but not the stranger wearing a plain shirt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr180-1088868311430834">M. Levine, Prosser, Evans, &amp; Reicher, 2005</xref>). Like normative conformity, then, cooperation is more common and robust when ingroup members are involved.</p>
<p>In sum, human psychology is configured to make cooperation with group members rewarding and noncooperation distressing. In addition, cultural practices that build on capabilities such as language and normative compliance serve to align individual interests with collective interests. As a result, cooperation is often a win-win strategy for members of a group, whereas selfishness is often self-defeating.</p>
<p>This concludes the section on the superorganismic aspects of human psychology and human groups. The discussion indicates that each superorganismic feature is in some form present in human beings. Moreover, different superorganismic features act in concert and sustain each other. For example, symbolic communication is crucial to social identity processes, coordination and division of labor, propagation of group norms, and reputation mechanisms that keep free riders in check. Similarly, social identity processes determine which norms will be followed and enforced and who will be helped. Norms, in turn, often prescribe fairness and cooperation as well as loyalty to the group. Human psychology thus presents an array of interlocking features that synergistically work to support superorganismic structures.</p>

<title>Superorganismic Aspects of Human Social Phenomena</title>
<p>So far, I have discussed the features characterizing superorganisms and reviewed the evidence on their occurrence in human beings. Each of these features was treated in isolation. This section presents two emergent social phenomena, religion and morality, that present a confluence of multiple superorganismic components.</p>
<sec id="section18-1088868311430834">
<title>Religion</title>
<p>Several social scientists have argued that religion’s primary function is to foster group cooperation and solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1088868311430834">Durkheim, 1915/1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr234-1088868311430834">Rappaport, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr235-1088868311430834">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr300-1088868311430834">V. Turner, 1969</xref>). Durkheim noted that a religion’s symbols and beliefs are secondary to its role in forging a community. According to him, understanding religion requires looking beyond a religion’s specific beliefs and zeroing in on what it does to a group of people—namely, affirming and sanctifying its normative order:<disp-quote><p>[S]omething eternal in religion . . . is destined to survive all the particular symbols in which religious thought has successively enveloped itself. There can be no society which does not feel the need of upholding and reaffirming at regular intervals the collective sentiments and the collective ideas which make its unity and its personality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1088868311430834">Durkheim, 1915/1967</xref>, pp. 474-475)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr235-1088868311430834">Rappaport (1999)</xref> similarly remarked on religion’s unifying role:
<disp-quote><p>[H]igh-order meaning . . . is grounded in identity or unity, the radical identification or unification of self with other. It is not so much, or even at all, intellectual but is, rather, experiential. It may be experienced through art, or in the acts of love, but is, perhaps, most often felt in ritual and other religious devotions. (p. 71)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These accounts suggest that religion is a distinctly effective means of binding groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1088868311430834">Graham &amp; Haidt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr320-1088868311430834">D. S. Wilson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical research supports the idea of religion as a group-binding mechanism. A study of 19th-century American communes shows that religious communes were more stable and durable than their secular counterparts. Every year, utopian communes with religious convictions were 2 to 4 times more likely to survive than secular communes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr273-1088868311430834">Sosis, 2000</xref>). When religious people interact with fellow group members, they achieve higher rates of cooperation than do members of a matched secular group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr274-1088868311430834">Sosis &amp; Ruffle, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with the idea of religion as a superorganismic regulator, religious beliefs flexibly adjust to a society’s cooperation needs. Religiosity flourishes more readily under conditions of threat and scarcity, when regulation of individual behavior is particularly crucial to the group’s existence. In a sample of societies included in the Human Relations Area Files, celestial deities were more common in societies under resource stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1088868311430834">Hayden, 1987</xref>). Other research shows that societies with water scarcity are more likely to have moralizing gods, thereby promoting more prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr270-1088868311430834">Snarey, 1996</xref>). Deities also become more powerful, punitive, and moralistic with increasing group size, presumably because social regulation becomes harder as groups grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr241-1088868311430834">Roes &amp; Raymond, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, humanity’s various religions seem to serve group bonding through subordination to a sacred authority and/or belief system that regulates individual action for the common good. This authority demands cooperative behavior from group members. Religion also provides people with a strong social identity, prosocial norms, and incentives to abide by those norms. As such, religions simultaneously strike multiple chords of the human superorganismic psychology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1088868311430834">
<title>Human Morality</title>
<p>Across cultures, superorganismic features are incorporated into moral codes. Based on their anthropological work in India, Shweder and colleagues proposed the ethics of autonomy, community, and divinity to account for different moral systems across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr260-1088868311430834">Shweder, Much, Mahapatra, &amp; Park, 1997</xref>). The ethics of autonomy, the moral code of autonomous individuals, is concerned with harm, rights, and justice. The ethics of community and divinity, in contrast, presume an individual who is deeply implanted in a role-based social structure within a sacred order and whose preferences are subordinated to communal obligations and demands of the sacred domain. The moral codes of community and divinity capture issues such as proper gender roles, observation of traditions, obedience to authority, and respect for the natural order.</p>
<p>Haidt and his colleagues have extended Shweder’s theory by identifying five domains of morality, corresponding to five moral “taste receptors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1088868311430834">Haidt &amp; Joseph, 2007</xref>). The first two, harm/care and fairness/reciprocity, correspond to the ethics of autonomy. The harm/care foundation derives from our evolutionary history as a mammalian species with an attachment system. It underlines the basic moral capacity to feel and dislike the pain of others. This capacity, however, can be suspended when outgroup members are concerned, such as in warfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088868311430834">Bandura, 1999</xref>). The fairness/reciprocity foundation underlies the human concern with egalitarianism.</p>
<p>The remaining three foundations are ingroup/loyalty, authority/respect, and purity/sanctity. Each of these foundations expresses an affirmation of one or more superorganismic features and serves the cause of tighter groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1088868311430834">Haidt &amp; Graham, 2009</xref>). The ingroup/loyalty foundation is about valuing one’s group, putting it before personal interests, and being hostile toward free riders and traitors. It is concerned with sharpening group boundaries, prioritizing the group over individuals, and creating a united front. A manifestation of this foundation is the outrage evoked by traitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088868311430834">Baumeister, 1999</xref>, pp. 194-197; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr190-1088868311430834">Marques &amp; Yzerbyt, 1988</xref>). The enmity bestowed on traitors far exceeds that bestowed on enemies. In Dante’s Inferno for example, traitors are found in the lowest level of hell, below even the nonbelievers, the lustful, the violent, the murderous, and the fraudulent. In experimental games, people inflict harsher punishments on noncooperating group members than noncooperating outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr257-1088868311430834">Shinada, Yamagishi, &amp; Ohmura, 2004</xref>). This foundation is about placing the group (the whole) above individuals (the parts). Such primacy of the whole over the part is a major characteristic of any superorganism.</p>
<p>The moral foundation of hierarchy/duty calls for respectful submission to legitimate authorities, institutions, traditions, and restraints. Even though Western liberals sometimes equate hierarchy with subjugation and oppression, this is a restricted vision of the authority/respect foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1088868311430834">Fiske, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1088868311430834">Haidt &amp; Graham, 2009</xref>). Legitimate authority creates mutual obligations and is conceptually the opposite of power, which is the one-sided exercise of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr217-1088868311430834">Nisbet, 1966/1993</xref>). As we saw, respect for authority serves coordination and unity of action within a group. Respect for institutions and traditions also is a form of conformity to time-honored group norms.</p>
<p>The purity/sanctity foundation is related to concerns about sacredness and preservation of the natural order of creation. It is about respect for conventions defining the proper ways of living as prescribed by a sacredly held cultural system. The goal is to protect the sacred domain from any encroachment of the profane. Any such encroachment would violate the sacred authority to which the group has subordinated itself and thereby threaten the meaning system and the unity of the people sharing the conceptions of the sacred.</p>
<p>Cultures and individuals vary in their endorsement of these last three moral foundations. In modern societies, liberals are less likely to endorse them, and conservatives are more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1088868311430834">Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 2009</xref>). Although not uniformly recognized as virtues in modern societies, these three group-serving foundations were highly valued in many groups studied by historians and anthropologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1088868311430834">Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1088868311430834">Haidt, Koller, &amp; Dias, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr206-1088868311430834">Miller &amp; Bersoff, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr207-1088868311430834">Miller, Bersoff, &amp; Harwood, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr260-1088868311430834">Shweder et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, all five moral foundations are associated with superorganismic features. In particular, the foundations of ingroup/outgroup, hierarchy/duty, and purity/sanctity are functional for forming and sustaining tightly bound groups. They demand loyalty to the group as well as respect for its values, traditions, and institutions. They also demand cooperation from individuals to achieve group goals, even if doing so means that they have to subordinate their own interests or sacrifice themselves.</p>
<p>Religion and morality thus both engage various superorganismic aspects of human psychology. Consequently, they can be instrumental in the formation of superorganismic social structures.</p>

<title>The Group Reflex</title>
<p>We have seen that superorganismic capabilities are part of humanity’s psychological repertoire and are evident in the major social phenomena of religion and morality. At the same time, their manifestation varies across time and place: Human behavior reflects a constantly shifting balance between individual and group concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088868311430834">Brewer &amp; Caporael, 2006</xref>). We repeatedly saw, for example, how the activation of superorganismic human traits is conditional on group identification. This section describes the factors associated with variations in the endorsement of superorganismic principles across time and place.</p>
<p>Immediate ecological conditions set an organism’s motivational priorities, and many evolutionarily adaptive mechanisms need environmental triggers to become active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-1088868311430834">Kenrick, Griskevicius, Neuberg, &amp; Schaller, 2010</xref>). An instructive case comes from slime molds: When food is abundant, slime molds are invisibly dispersed on damp forest soils and wander around as single cells. But when the conditions deteriorate, these cells secrete chemicals that make the individual cells coalesce into a multicellular body. This body then crawls as a single superorganism, and once a better spot is found, cells are dispersed again and return to their single-cell life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088868311430834">Bonner, 2008</xref>). Slime molds bear a striking resemblance to human beings in the way they oscillate between individualistic and superorganismic behaviors. Binding to a group is an optional strategy for human beings that is prompted by external threats and relaxed under conditions of peace and plenty.</p>
<p>A threat to the group is a major trigger for social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088868311430834">Branscombe, Ellemers, Spears, &amp; Doosje, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1088868311430834">Brewer &amp; Campbell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1088868311430834">Dion, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr181-1088868311430834">LeVine &amp; Campbell, 1972</xref>). The threat may be realistic (e.g., a competing outgroup or failing leadership), psychological (e.g., a challenge to the groups’ status and prestige), or symbolic (e.g., challenges to the group’s normative order, shared values, beliefs, and morals). All these threats fuel ethnocentrism, conformity, outgroup discrimination, and stronger ingroup bias in those who strongly identify with the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088868311430834">Bobo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr237-1088868311430834">Riek, Mania, &amp; Gaertner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr280-1088868311430834">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2000</xref>). When they feel that their group’s status is under threat, people who closely identify with their group become more likely to derogate outgroup members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088868311430834">Branscombe &amp; Wann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1088868311430834">Grant, 1993</xref>), to see their ingroup as homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1088868311430834">Doosje, Ellemers, &amp; Spears, 1995</xref>), and to self-stereotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr275-1088868311430834">Spears, Doosje, &amp; Ellemers, 1997</xref>). A review of the literature concluded,
<disp-quote><p>Group-level threat combined with high group commitment is associated with perceptual, affective, and behavioral reactions aimed at the group reasserting itself in terms of either value or distinctiveness. This may lead to a high degree of self-stereotyping, expressions of strong ingroup loyalty, and a readiness for collective action. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1088868311430834">Ellemers, Spears, &amp; Doosje, 2002</xref>, p. 178)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Note again, how group identification is a key moderator.</p>
<p>Venturing beyond social psychology, other disciplines reach parallel conclusions on the solidarity-inducing role of threat. Sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr216-1088868311430834">Nisbet (1953/1990)</xref> wrote, “Society attains its maximum sense of organization and community and its most exalted sense of moral purpose during the period of war” (p. 35). Political scientists who have investigated the effects of external threats on the public named the patriotic reactions to external threats the “rallying around the flag” reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr176-1088868311430834">Lee, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr209-1088868311430834">Mueller, 1973</xref>). This reflex manifests itself as increased support for leaders during times of war or international crisis. For example, according to Gallup polls, immediately after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, George W. Bush’s approval rating catapulted from 51% at the beginning of September 2001 to his all-time high of 90% at the end of the month. Moreover, between 2001 and 2004, his approval rating went up every time the terror alert levels were raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr317-1088868311430834">Willer, 2004</xref>). This “rallying around the president” phenomenon in times of crisis is likewise a well-established empirical pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1088868311430834">Brody, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Perceived threats to the group often also increase authoritarian tendencies that seek to eliminate diversity and deviance. Authoritarianism refers to a concern with uniformity and group authority over diversity and individual autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1088868311430834">Duckitt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr279-1088868311430834">Stenner, 2005</xref>). According to political scientist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr279-1088868311430834">Stenner (2005)</xref>, authoritarianism “tends to produce a characteristic array of stances, all of which have the effect of glorifying, encouraging, and rewarding uniformity and of disparaging, suppressing, and punishing difference” (p. 16). As such, authoritarianism is a marker of relative emphasis on group concerns over individual concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088868311430834">Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088868311430834">Altemeyer, 1981</xref>). In her book <italic>The Authoritarian Dynamic</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr279-1088868311430834">Stenner (2005)</xref> argued that authoritarianism is best understood as a dynamic response to societal conditions and not as a stable trait. Perceptions of threat to the group’s oneness and sameness trigger the authoritarian response, and societal threats are empirically associated with increases in authoritarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr193-1088868311430834">McCann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr246-1088868311430834">Sales, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr327-1088868311430834">Winter, 1996</xref>). Research in the United States shows that periods of societal threats, such as economic downturns, saw higher conversion rates to fundamentalist church dominations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr245-1088868311430834">Sales, 1972</xref>), more censorship attempts, and a higher willingness to express prejudiced attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1088868311430834">Doty, Peterson, &amp; Winter, 1991</xref>). Experimental studies similarly find that exposure to normative threats such as lack of social consensus increase authoritarian attitudes and decrease support for democratic values (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr279-1088868311430834">Stenner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Conservatism is related to, but conceptually distinct from, authoritarianism. As noted, conservatives are more concerned with group-oriented moral foundations than are liberals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1088868311430834">Graham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1088868311430834">Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007</xref>). Therefore, if threats to social stability foster a group-oriented mentality, they may also move people to the political right. Indeed, people who were in or near the World Trade Center on 9/11 were more likely to subsequently shift away from liberalism toward conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088868311430834">Bonanno &amp; Jost, 2006</xref>). When reminded of 9/11, people also reported higher endorsement for George W. Bush and his policies over his liberal opponent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-1088868311430834">Landau et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, a Spanish study conducted before and after the 2004 Madrid terrorist attack found higher levels of prejudice against outgroups, support for authoritarianism, and attachment to traditional conservative values after the attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1088868311430834">Echebarria-Echabe &amp; Fernández-Guede, 2006</xref>). More generally, a meta-analysis showed that one of the two strongest predictors of conservatism is perceptions of threatened social stability, with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-1088868311430834">Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, &amp; Sulloway, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted above, nowhere is threat to a group’s existence more acute than in intergroup combat, and that is exactly where the highest amount of self-sacrifice occurs. Warfare therefore represents the pinnacle of human superorganismic potential. People put their lives at risk—sometimes with full knowledge of their impending death—as in suicide attacks. Such attacks are not an invention of our times. From the Jewish sect of Zealots who organized suicide attacks on the Roman Empire to the Japanese kamikaze pilots, they have been part of intergroup conflict throughout history. Suicide attackers are neither psychologically sick individuals nor motivated by a sense of personal desperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr194-1088868311430834">McCauley, 2007</xref>). Yet they not only sacrifice themselves for their group but often do so with a sense of joy, as evinced by writings and interviews they leave behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr224-1088868311430834">Oliver &amp; Steinberg, 2006</xref>). A Hamas militant, for example, asked his family to receive the news of his martyrdom “with elation and chants to God for it is a day of celebration” (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1088868311430834">Hafez, 2006</xref>, p. 177). Two scholars who interviewed suicide bombers noted, “These guys knew they’re going to die. . . . At the same time, we get the feeling that life has never seemed better to them—so intense, so exuberant, so full of meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr224-1088868311430834">Oliver &amp; Steinberg, 2006</xref>, p. 118). Apparently, suicide attackers derive meaning and satisfaction from sacrificing themselves for their group.</p>
<p>Similarly, at least some men report the ease of sacrificing themselves for their comrades during combat. Comradeship reaches its peak during battle, and attachment to one’s buddies and refusal to let them down is a major motive in combat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr281-1088868311430834">Stouffer et al., 1949</xref>). Philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1088868311430834">Glenn Gray (1959)</xref>, who fought in World War II, described the ease of self-sacrifice on the battlefield:
<disp-quote><p>Such sacrifice seems hard and heroic to those who have never felt communal ecstasy. In fact, it is not nearly so difficult as many less absolute acts in peacetime and in civilian life, for death becomes in measure unreal and unbelievable to one who is sharing his life with his companions. (p. 46)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Whether in suicide attacks or during combat, when one’s group is under severe threat, self-sacrifice seems to come easily, at least to some. Referring to the ease with which “brothers in arms” are ready to sacrifice themselves, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr321-1088868311430834">D. S. Wilson and Sober (1994)</xref> wrote, “Quibbles about the definition of altruism aside, nothing more is required to convert a social group into an organism” (p. 601). Just as cells are expendable for a body and individual bees are expendable for the hive, human beings, under some circumstances, are expendable for their group.</p>
<p>Whereas threats to the group bond people together, the lack of external threats weakens group solidarity. Writing on the history of northern Africa, 14th-century Arab thinker Ibn Khaldun noted that tribes would conquer states on the northern coast thanks to their high level of group solidarity. But these tribes soon would be replaced by other conquering tribes, as this solidarity declined after successive generations of settled life (Ibn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-1088868311430834">Khaldun, 1969</xref>). Building on this theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr297-1088868311430834">Turchin (2006)</xref> showed that empires almost always form on frontiers between religious or ethnic groups. This is presumably because the frontiers are where constant threats from other groups enable the buildup of strong solidarity necessary to displace other groups. However, this military success, driven by the willingness to die for one’s group, eventually sets in motion processes that reduce the group’s solidarity. The lack of an external threat, combined with rising inequalities within empires, leads to higher within-group competition and a decline in group solidarity. Solidarity thus seems to melt away in the absence of external threats. Recently, psychological research has also shown that the loss of individual control over one’s fate leads to a heightened belief in the legitimacy of controlling sociopolitical institutions or an interventionist God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-1088868311430834">Kay, Gaucher, Napier, Callan, &amp; Laurin, 2008</xref>). The combined evidence thus strongly suggests that higher-level regulatory systems lose their appeal to the extent that people have control over their lives, such as when they are not constricted by intergroup threats, poverty, or natural disaster.</p>
<p>In sum, converging multidisciplinary evidence suggests that threats to the group trigger group cohesiveness. Perceptions of threat set off psychological processes that enable group members to face the threat as a unified body. Whereas people bond together in response to a threat, similar to the way slime molds transition to a superorganismic state, the lack of adversity atrophies group cohesiveness.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has used the superorganism metaphor to reflect on human sociality. I have reviewed the evidence for superorganismic aspects of human sociality and argued that multiple psychological and cultural mechanisms make human groups resemble superorganisms: Human beings have versatile means of integration through communication as well as mechanisms to achieve united action and to promote cooperation. Religions and morality present rich ensembles of superorganismic features as well as the tensions intrinsic to human groups.</p>
<p>Superorganismic conceptions of human psychology, as noted, have not featured prominently in social psychology. Unfavorable reactions to Wundt’s <italic>Völkerpsychologie</italic> or to the group mind idea, although partly justified, have resulted in a psychology that has neglected the vision of the individual as an element within a larger whole. Looking at human societies through a superorganism lens allows for a clearer appreciation of the full scope of human existence. A unifying narrative emerges for phenomena that are treated piecemeal within an individualist paradigm. According to this narrative, cultural meaning systems, shared intentionality, norm compliance, deference to authority, social identity processes, religiosity, and morality can be understood parsimoniously as manifestations of the same dynamics that create superorganism-like social structures. Superorganisms thus offer a useful heuristic around which to organize our understanding of human sociality.</p>
<p>Despite the heuristic’s usefulness, it is important to be clear on how human groups are <italic>not</italic> like beehives, or any other superorganisms. Human groups are fuzzier and less solid than beehives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088868311430834">Campbell, 1958</xref>). Unlike bees, most modern human beings are not particles of one all-encompassing social structure. Human groups are fluid and human loyalties are multiple. People can simultaneously identify with various groups and break their attachment to them at will. At any time, one of multiple identities may be salient and shape behavior. Honeybees do not have such flexibility. What characterizes human beings is thus not membership in one discrete superorganism but a capacity to create and function in superorganismic structures.</p>
<p>Granting this human capacity for building superorganismic structures, there is also no question that most human groups are much less superorganismic than a beehive. Selfish motives are pervasive and conflict is frequent within groups, as individuals compete over mates, resources, and power. Subversion from within threatens all groups. Nepotistic tendencies and narrow interest groups distort political systems and undermine the collective good. Individuals constantly negotiate the tension between individuality and group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088868311430834">Brewer &amp; Caporael, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr279-1088868311430834">Stenner, 2005</xref>). On a larger scale, this fundamental tension between individual and group concerns is reflected in the culture wars between conservatives and liberals or religious people and atheists. The superorganism metaphor is thus obviously not perfect—its success is qualified.</p>
<p>The task of this article has been describing <italic>how</italic> and <italic>when</italic> human groups are like superorganisms. The answers raise a third question that I have not addressed: <italic>Why</italic> are human groups like superorganisms? The <italic>why</italic> question invites an evolutionary explanation. Specifically, we have to ask whether the superorganism metaphor works because humans actually have gone through a major evolutionary transition to arrive at superorganismic capacity. Do we have in our hands a case of convergent evolution rather than just a surface resemblance? Even though this article has not sought to make an evolutionary case for a major transition account, the reviewed evidence speaks to the possibility of a major transition for two reasons. First and simply, the abundance of superorganismic human features suggests that a major transition might have taken place. If human groups act like superorganisms in so many ways, we have to consider the possibility of a major evolutionary transition.</p>
<p>Second, the existence of superorganismic human traits might itself have facilitated a major evolutionary transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088868311430834">Bourke, 2011</xref>). Major biological transitions often involve positive feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1088868311430834">Crespi, 2004</xref>). The idea here is that superorganismic traits might trigger dynamics that will lead to their further proliferation and thus accelerate the transition. We can imagine a straightforward example involving human warfare. Intergroup warfare would select for more superorganismic groups that are better able to muster their collective capacity to defeat an enemy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr297-1088868311430834">Turchin, 2006</xref>). At the same time, higher levels of collective capacity could be directed toward expropriating other groups’ resources, thus promoting more intergroup warfare. An autocatalytic process would ensue by which superorganismic capacity leads to warfare and warfare selects more superorganismic groups over generations. Another example of a positive feedback loop involving human superorganismic traits is the coevolution of cooperative cultural norms and genes for cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1088868311430834">Henrich, 2004</xref>). Cultural norms that discourage cheating would favor the proliferation of genes that make individuals more cooperative as noncooperative individuals would be excluded from valuable coalitions. Once these genes were selected, the carriers of these cooperative genes would more vigorously observe cooperative cultural practices, leading to further proliferation of cooperative genes. As these two examples indicate, superorganismic traits could set in motion positive feedback loops. This is why the psychological evidence reviewed here is relevant to the evolutionary account of human sociality yet to emerge in full shape.</p>
<p>As noted in the opening paragraph, beehives have often been invoked as symbols of utter harmony and models for the ideal human society. Not all artistic representations of beehives were so favorable, though. Beehives have also inspired chilling society portraits in science fiction, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1088868311430834">Frank Herbert’s (1973)</xref> book <italic>Hellstrom’s Hive</italic>. Of course, one need not consult science fiction to discern the dark side of human superorganisms. The long history of warfare and the fascist regimes of the 20th century in particular teach us how ugly things get when superorganismic human features rule the day. Although this article implies that the quickest way to unite humanity would be an interstellar attack, there is power in knowing the hivish mind’s intricacies. What sets human groups apart from other superorganisms is the flexibility with which superorganismic potential is exercised. Human moral imagination is not bound by narrowly constructed group identities, as evinced by the existence of organizations with universal moral commitments, such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Doctors Without Borders. If we grant that hivishness is part of who we are, the human challenge becomes converting it into a force for good, based on what social scientists have uncovered about its workings.</p>
