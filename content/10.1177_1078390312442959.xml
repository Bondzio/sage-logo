<p>The APNA Board of Directors launched their 2012 agenda with a focus toward the future. The work of our first face-to-face meeting this year was to develop APNA’s 2012 strategic plan. However, to be effective, planning for the future must include a review of the past. We began this next strategic plan development cycle by reviewing our progress toward achieving our current strategic plan goals developed in 2009 for the time period through 2014. To ensure that APNA continues to be an inclusionary and transparent organization, it is my plan to share with you in the upcoming Board of Directors columns the process and outcome of our 2012 strategic plan development. In this issue, I would like to summarize for you the Board of Directors’ view of our progress in meeting the goals laid out in the 2009 strategic plan.</p>
<p>A strategic plan is the outcome of “strategic thinking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390312442959">Crouch, 2012</xref>), the goal of which is to establish a clear direction, guide the allocation of resources, and assist in focusing and aligning the organization’s goals. The plan is not an operational plan that simply outlines what is needed to maintain the current activities of the organization. Rather, a strategic plan is a roadmap to change. It outlines the organization’s prioritized goals for the future and as such directs the decision making, choices for involvements, and allocation of resources for our organization.</p>
<p>The 2009 Strategic Goals, designed to be accomplished by 2014, include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1078390312442959" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>APNA will be the indispensable resource for member networking and professional development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>APNA will be financially secure and stable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>APNA will be the leader in creating strategic alliances with key stakeholders.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>APNA will be recognized as the expert voice for psychiatric-mental health nursing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A review of our annual reports for the past few years offers concrete evidence that we are accomplishing these, and while they are not static but dynamic and ongoing, the current Board and senior staff are confident that we are in a sound position to move forward and revise/add to our goals, if desired and needed by our members. For each of the goals the plan provided milestones to help measure our progress; the full version of the status of the plan is available to our members at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.apna.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3287">http://www.apna.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3287</ext-link>.
