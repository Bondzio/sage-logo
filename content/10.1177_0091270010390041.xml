<abstract>
<p>A simulation-based comparison study on the relative merits of dose-control trials (DCTs) with exposure–response analysis versus concentration-control trials (CCTs) for drugs with narrow therapeutic index showed that DCT designs are more informative about the exposure–response relationship. The authors revisit the question employing optimal design methodology and propose strategies for designing ethically attractive trials for these drugs, balancing between individual–collective risk and informativeness. An optimal study was performed considering a hypothetical immunosuppressant agent with 2 clinical end points. Different scenarios were optimized applying cost-based designs (unwanted events vs number of subjects/trial or maximal individual risk). Dose/exposure targets and number of subjects per trial/arm were optimized. Prior information inclusion on baseline risks was evaluated. DCTs were more informative, needing smaller studies to provide the same information as CCTs. Using the number of unwanted events—rather than subjects—as cost resulted in ethically more attractive designs. Including prior baseline risk information reduced the number of subject/events and allowed the use of targets closer to the optimal. Designing dose-finding trials for some narrow therapeutic index drugs may be improved by using DCTs with exposure–response analysis, cost-based designs, prior information, and optimal design analysis providing information on the ethical trade-off between individual risk and information gain.</p>

<p>The cost of developing and launching a new drug into the market has dramatically increased in the last decade,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010390041">1</xref></sup> and the largest portion of these costs come after phase II trials are completed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010390041">2</xref></sup> However, the rate of success in phase III is remarkably low, with an approximately 42% failure rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390041">3</xref></sup> This is partly because phase II does not provide adequate information for the correct dose selection in phase III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010390041">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010390041">5</xref></sup> For drugs that are expected to have a narrow therapeutic index, particular developmental challenges with respect to dose-finding strategy appear. The main goal in dose-finding studies is to establish the dose (exposure)–response relationship, but for ethical reasons patients may not be treated with subtherapeutic doses or highly toxic ones. Thus, a relatively narrow dose or exposure range is available for dose-finding studies in patients. Most often, the dose-finding studies are designed as randomized dose-control trials (DCTs). Increasingly, such studies include concentration measurements with exposure–response analysis as a further basis for dosing decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010390041">6</xref></sup> Two decades ago it was suggested that randomizing subjects by predetermined drug concentration levels (ie, concentration-control trials, or CCTs) was a more informative design than the DCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010390041">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010390041">8</xref></sup> The idea of performing CCTs is that randomizing patients to predefined concentrations, as opposed to dose, makes it possible to reduce the within-group variability in the response variable in relation to the randomization variable, since the randomization point is moved closer to the clinical end point. From this, a better characterization of the exposure–response relationship inside a safe range is expected. Performing CCTs has some drawbacks, as each patient needs to be titrated by some adaptive feedback strategy to ensure the desired concentration, which is complicated and costly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010390041">9</xref></sup> In spite of this, the CCT has been applied in several studies, in particular for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010390041">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091270010390041">10</xref></sup> Several authors have conducted theoretical studies to compare the 2 design types, some tending to favor the DCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010390041">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010390041">11</xref></sup> and others the CCT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010390041">8</xref></sup> Recently, a simulation-based comparison study focusing on the relative merits of the DCT with exposure–response analysis and the CCT for drugs with expected narrow therapeutic index was performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010390041">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010390041">13</xref></sup> It showed that when studying the exposure–response relationship for a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, a DCT design is more informative than a CCT.</p>
<p>In the present study, which uses optimal design methodology, we revisit the question of relative merits of DCT and CCT designs. However, the main aim is to propose and illustrate strategies for designing ethically attractive trials for drugs with narrow therapeutic index. A typical design question would ask how one can optimize the trial for characterizing the exposure–response relationship, given constraints in dose/ concentration range and number of subjects. In the present study, we have illustrated and explored the properties of study designs (DCT, CCT) using a hypothetical immunosuppressant that, with increasing exposure, will reduce the probability of acute rejection episodes but at the same time increase the risk of clinically significant infections. This leads to ethical dilemmas that can be difficult to overcome, such as the risk one is willing to take in the trial in order to learn about the best dose for future patients. Treating everyone at the present best guess of an optimal dose/exposure will lead to poor learning regarding the best dose. On the other hand, to improve the information obtained about the exposure–response relationship, the designs can result in high individual risks.</p>
<p>A way to deal with these ethical questions is to apply a particular type of cost-based design. Most commonly, cost-based designs are optimized for the main financial cost of the study, usually the number of subjects to enroll in the study, but also treatment duration and sample costs. Alternatively, the occurrence of an unwanted event (rejection or infection) can be seen as a cost. In the present study we explored these different possibilities by using penalty functions. Additionally, to reach the desired individual–collective balance, it may be useful to have quantitative information about the trade-off between capping the individual risk and the total number of expected events in the trial for a given amount of information about the exposure–response relationship. This possibility is also explored in the present study. Finally, to diminish the costs of obtaining new knowledge from a trial (in terms of subjects, unwanted events, or maximal individual risk), the incorporation of prior information in the optimization process is assessed.</p>

<title>Optimal Design Methodology</title>
<p>Optimal design methodology is typically based on the Cramer-Rao inequality, which states that the inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) is the lower bound of the variance–covariance matrix of any unbiased estimator of the parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270010390041">14</xref></sup> This important assertion offers the opportunity to define the optimality criterion as a function of design parameters in order to design optimal experiments.</p>
<p>Different optimality criterions are defined to extract specific information from experiments. For example, we can find locally optimal designs, which assume that the model parameters are well known (eg, A-optimal, D-optimal),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010390041">15</xref></sup> or globally optimal designs, which assume that the model parameters have uncertainty around them (eg, ED-, EID-, API-optimal).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010390041">16</xref></sup> Both locally and globally optimal designs may be considered when using prior information before study initiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390041">3</xref></sup> Both methods yield nonoptimal designs when the prior information is misspecified, but the global is more robust than the local optimal design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010390041">17</xref></sup> In spite of this, local optimization is more common in the pharmaceutical area, mostly because of run-times. Thus, in this work we use a criterion (objective function value, or OFV) similar to the local D-optimality criterion as our optimality measure:</p>

<p>where PIM is the population information matrix, n<sub>j</sub> is the number of individuals in the design group j, n<sub>g</sub> is the number of design groups, x represents a response model (ie, a rejection model [rej] or an infection model [inf]), and P<sub>x,i</sub> and θ are defined in the section below and refer to the probability of having a rejection/infection and relationship parameters, respectively. This is a simpler optimization criterion than the usual FIM, chosen for simplicity and speed. Here, the optimization considers the sensitivity function with respect to the parameters. However, the method described in this article holds for an extended criterion (eg, dependent of the FIM). Furthermore, a global method, including uncertainty in parameters, was used to incorporate prior information on parameter values (see the section on including prior information below).

<p>The different designs were optimized using point estimates for the PD parameters (Binf, Sinf, Brej, and Srej) and across a log-normal CL distribution that individualized the AUC<sub>i</sub>. The typical value for clearance was 20 L/h with 45% interindividual variability, and CL<sub>i</sub> was assumed to be determined without imprecision. Further CL<sub>i</sub> was excluded from the PIM, which allowed the optimization to exclusively focus on the PD parameters. The following values were adopted: Binf = −3.5, Sinf = 15, Brej = −1, and Srej = −12. No random effects in the exposure–response relationship were considered, and therefore fewer approximations were needed in the estimation process.</p>
<p>Two randomized design types with 2 arms (2 dose/exposure levels) were considered in the different scenarios: (1) a randomized DCT or (2) a randomized CCT, where targeted exposures correspond to the expected typical exposure in the corresponding DCT. One observation per individual was made for all variables (dose, exposure, and clinical end points). It was assumed that the targets (dose for DCTs and exposure for CCTs) were perfectly achieved without considering any imprecision. The design variables, which were simultaneously optimized, were the dose/exposure targets and the number of subjects to include in the trial or in each arm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270010390041">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>to find the design Ξ* with a criterion function OFV used in the optimization (eg, D-optimal, ED-optimal, etc) and with <italic>c</italic>(.) as a constraint/cost function, Ξ is the current design, θ is the parameters of the model <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(.), and ζ is the maximum allowed cost. Below, the different cost restrictions considered in the current work are presented.</p>
<sec id="section7-0091270010390041">
<title>Restrictions on the number of subjects</title>
<p>The allowed cost ζ can refer to a maximum number of subjects (Nsubj) to include in the trial. In this case, we have explored scenarios considering Nsubj = 200 as the maximum to be allowed in a trial with equal-size arms. The optimization was performed with respect to 2 levels of doses/exposures (no upper restriction on dose/exposure) and number of subjects to include in the trial. In this case, the cost function c() was simply restricting the design space; that is, c() was equal to the number of individuals included in the optimization iteration i, preventing the number of individuals to exceed Nsubj = 200.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0091270010390041">
<title>Event-restricted designs</title>
<p>The allowed cost ζ can also refer to maximum number of unwanted events allowed to occur in the trial. We explored scenarios in which the maximum total number of expected events allowed to occur in a study with equal-size arms was 60 (or 30 events in some scenarios), again performing an optimization with respect to 2 levels of doses/exposures (no upper restriction) and number of subjects to include in the trial, again without restriction. The cost function c() is now a bit more intricate because it is not directly restricting the design space. Instead, c() is equal to the number of expected events that may occur with a design Ξ, dependent on the individual probability of having an event P<sub>x,i</sub>. This cost function will now implicitly restrict the design space (ie, the number of individuals and doses/exposures).</p>

<sec id="section9-0091270010390041">
<title>Trade-off between capping the maximal individual risk and total number of events in the trial for a given information</title>
<p>To obtain information about the exposure–response relationship, the optimal designs can theoretically result in a high individual risk of having an event. Throughout the article we will refer to individual risk as the probability of having an unwanted event (PSUM) for an individual. A design that minimizes the individual risk (PSUM) will likely lead to including more patients in the study to get the same amount of information as in studies not including the individual risk in the optimization. We can quantify the trade-off between confining the individual risk and the total number of events for a given amount of information about the exposure–response. In this case, the allowed cost ζ would constrain both the expected number of events and the individual risk (PSUM). For such scenarios, different constraints on PSUM were tested: 22%, 25%, 30%, and 35%. Thus, doses/exposures and Nsubj to include in the trial were optimized for the different PSUM limits, while always constraining the expected number of events in the trial to 30. Under these conditions, both designs with equal-size arms and different-size arms were explored.</p>
<p>Restrictions in PSUM were translated into doses and exposures for DCT and CCT, respectively. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091270010390041">Table I</xref> shows, for the different PSUM considered, the corresponding dose and exposure limits. For instance, when considering PSUM = 22%, search spaces for doses/exposures are limited to 1.24 to 2.04 mg (DCT) or 0.062 to 0.102 mg·h/L (CCT), these figures corresponding to the doses (in a typical individual) and exposures that give rise to a probability of having an unwanted event of 22% in the considered exposure–response relationship. If we take higher risk, 35%, then the limits become wider around the true optimal exposure for our relationship. Similar to the event-restricted case, c() is now dependent on the current design, the individual probability. Furthermore, c() is now both explicitly (by dose restrictions) and implicitly (by event restriction) restricting the design space.</p>

<title>Prior Information</title>
<p>When defining a dose-finding design, one is usually able to draw prior information previous steps in the drug development process or from other therapies in the same patient population. Such information generally contributes to optimize the design of the dose-finding study. To decrease the costs of gaining new knowledge, we may use such prior information in a formal manner to contribute to the parameter estimates of the exposure–response relationship. For introduction of the prior information, a prior PIM was added to the current PIM and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0091270010390041">Equation 5</xref> was updated to maximize the sum of the matrices:</p>

<p>where PIM<sub>prior</sub> only has information on the diagonal elements corresponding to the baseline frequencies for rejections and infections (Brej and Binf), and the other elements in the matrix were set to 0. PIM<sub>prior</sub> was constant during the optimization and precalculated by a design considering that weak information regarding the baselines for rejections and infections was available. This information was considered to be rescued from a design with 3 arms (20 patients/arm), where fixed doses of 0.5, 1.5, and 3 mg were administered. To incorporate the appropriate weight and uncertainty to the prior information on baselines, sampling for baselines from a uniform distribution was performed, when evaluating this prior design. The uniform distribution was inside the range −1.44 to −0.51 for Brej and −4.09 to −3.00 for Binf.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270010390041">Table II</xref> summarizes the optimal designs under restriction of max(Nsubj) = 200 or total number of expected events (max(Nevents) = 60), in both cases considering equal-size arms (as described in the Methods section). As expected, in both cases the maximum allowed number of subjects or events was found to be optimal. A placebo arm was found to be optimal in both the DCT and CCT, whereas the higher dose/concentration differs somewhat between the 2 design types, being higher for the CCT. For both scenarios, the DCT is more informative as indicated by a higher OFV. It is noteworthy that by treating each event, rather than participating patient, as the main cost of the trial, an almost equally informative trial can be achieved but at a markedly lower number of events. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010390041">Figure 2</xref> uses 2-dimensional plots to display the relative information of the different designs, further illustrating that restricting number of subjects or restricting number of expected events will have a profound impact on the design space.</p>

</fig>
<p>These 2-dimensional plots show how informative any design inside the restricted optimized space is. The strength of the color represents the OFV value for each optimized design—the lighter the OFV value the more informative it is.</p>
<p>As we are optimizing on 2 levels of doses/exposures, the axes represent the 2 levels of doses (dose 1 and dose 2).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010390041">Figure 2</xref>, the left top panel shows, under a restriction of 200 subjects to include in the trial, all possible designs that have been optimized according to this restriction and their corresponding OFV. The panel shows a design with one dose of 0 and the other dose of 3.52 mg (corresponding to the lightest area of the plot), giving the highest OFV and therefore being more informative.</p>
<p>The plots are symmetric, and therefore <italic>dose-1</italic> can be either 0 or 3.52 mg, being then <italic>dose-2</italic> 3.52 or 0, respectively. If we go further apart, for instance, toward a design of a 0- and a 2-mg dose, then this design wouldn’t give as much information about the exposure–response relationship (the area becomes darker, corresponding to a lower OFV).</p>
<p>The other panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010390041">Figure 2</xref> can be interpreted in a similar way, under other restrictions. First, restricting Nsubj = 200 for CCTs will translate into optimal designs with increased doses/exposures compared with DCTs, not reaching the same level of informativeness (as shown by the OFV in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270010390041">Table II</xref>). Second, when restricting Nevents, the space of search is slightly reduced and more ethical designs are found to be optimal with doses going away from 0 and reaching higher OFVs.</p>
<p>Results from target level optimizing when adding a restriction on the maximal individual risk (PSUM) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091270010390041">Table III</xref>. The DCT is more informative than the CCT for all investigated limits of the individual risk. The lower information from trials with lower limits for individual risk can be seen from the trend of decreasing OFV with decreasing PSUM limits. Thus, a DCT with the restriction of PSUM ≤22%, compared with a study with PSUM ≤35%, will need to enroll more subjects (124 vs 98) and yet have a lower OFV. To make the former DCT (PSUM ≤22%) as informative as the latter (PSUM &lt;35%) by increasing its size, one would need to enroll 165 patients and have an expected number of events of 40. Thus, limiting the individual risk will be associated with the necessity of running a larger trial with an overall higher number of unwanted events to reach the same information about the dose–response relationship.</p>

<p>The introduction of prior information changes the optimal design, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091270010390041">Table III</xref>. In general, the lower doses/concentrations are no longer close to zero. With a similar size study and the same number of unwanted events, the introduction of prior information substantially reduced the expected information of the exposure–response parameters. Not only the baseline parameters will be estimated with higher precision but also the drug-related slope parameters. Especially the design with strong restrictions on the maximum individual risk benefitted from the introduction of the prior information. Indeed, for DCT designs, the optimal doses resulted in low maximal individual risk even without constraints on this aspect of the design (not shown).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0091270010390041">Figure 3</xref> shows the design space when the restriction was Nevents = 30 and prior information was considered. The addition of prior information in the baselines made the optimal doses to move toward higher values: 2.42 and 2.50 mg for DCT and 1.98 and 4.23 mg for CCT (which correspond to the lighter area in the plot) as opposed to 0 and 2.51 mg for DCT and 0.36 and 3.57 mg for CCT, when no prior information was considered (the latter not shown graphically). For situations where no prior information is used, the relative informativeness of different designs, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010390041">Figure 2</xref>, will not change with study size. When prior information is used, the relative informativeness will depend on the study size. When increasing the study size, the patterns displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0091270010390041">Figure 3</xref> will become increasingly similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0091270010390041">Figure 2</xref>. So, as the planned study size increases, the contribution from the prior information diminishes and the study designs become more similar to designs without use of prior information. This was evidenced by the less attractive optimal targets found when restricting the total Nevents to 60—meaning increased size of study—as opposed to the restriction of 30 events, with use of prior information in baselines. For DCT (restriction = 60 events), doses of 0 and 2.73 mg were found to be optimal, whereas 2.42 and 2.50 mg were the optimal ones when restricting on 30 events. Besides, in the former case, these were not much more attractive than the optimal ones when not including the prior information (0 and 2.74 mg). This reflects the need for lower targets to give information about the baseline parameters when higher sizes of study are considered, in spite of including the prior information.</p>

<p>To allow a comparison of informativeness between different designs, optimal designs given different constraints (DCT or CCT, use of prior information or not, equal arm size or not, and different levels of PSUM) were estimated such that the size of the trial was varied until all provided the same value for the OFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270010390041">Figure 4</xref>), using as comparator the OFV from an optimal DCT design when restricting on total Nevents = 30, PSUM of 35%, and prior information on the baselines was incorporated (OFV = 6.4E-4). From these results it follows that DCTs are more informative under all conditions studied, needing lower sizes of study to provide the same information about the exposure–response relationship. It is also seen how the inclusion of prior information translates into smaller trials with fewer expected number of events. There is a small gain when relaxing the assumption of having equal-size arms (even groups), but this gain is not reflected in a lower number of events. Constraining the maximal individual risk to higher levels leads to more informative designs, needing lower sizes of trials. However when prior information is used, the difference between trials with high and low individual risk is small for CCTs and absent for DCTs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a previous simulation-based work it was shown that contrary to what had been previously stated for drugs with narrow therapeutic index, there is no gain in information regarding the exposure–response surface when performing CCTs compared with DCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010390041">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010390041">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010390041">13</xref></sup> In the present work the exploration was expanded to estimating optimal designs as well as investigating cost-based designs, constraints on individual risk, and the benefit of using prior information. When doing so, DCTs again showed consistently higher information, for the same cost, regardless of whether the latter is based on number of events or number of subjects enrolled.</p>
<p>Sanathanan and Peck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010390041">8</xref></sup> stated that the wider the ranges of concentrations explored (compared with the width of the therapeutic range), the greater the efficiency of the CCT. However, in the case of only 2 target dose or exposure levels, there are upper and lower target limits beyond which information gained decreases as targets are further separated. In this study the lower target, when unconstrained with respect to individual risk and without the use of prior information, was generally close to zero. The optimal upper target was generally estimated to be no more than 3 times the optimal dose, mainly because higher doses would result in poor information about the exposure–response relationship for rejections.</p>
<p>Defining cost at the level of number of events rather than number of subjects resulted in almost as informative designs with the same number of subjects but with considerably fewer events. However, with either of these constraints, the DCT resulted in a dose at or as close to zero as optimal (the CCT with event restrictions did not have a placebo dose; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0091270010390041">Table II</xref>). As a placebo dose is clearly ethically unacceptable for narrow therapeutic index drugs, further considerations were made: the first was to constrain the individual risk, the second to use prior information of baseline frequencies of events, and third to use a combination of the 2.</p>
<p>As Pocock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010390041">20</xref></sup> has pointed out, “Each clinical trial involves a balance between individual and collective ethics,” this balance is never simple. Physicians have responsibilities to science and to their patients, so that one has to find the cost–benefit balance that translates into what is best for current patients in the trial and what is best for future patients who will benefit from its results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010390041">21</xref></sup> However, we also need to be aware that to favor the individual gain in detriment of the collective, by allocating patients to the presently estimated “best dose,” would result in poor learning about the exposure–response relationship, which is the final aim of a dose-finding design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010390041">22</xref></sup> There have been some attempts to formalize the goal of a dose-finding study as a penalized D-optimal design problem, like the one from Dragalin and Fedorov,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270010390041">23</xref></sup> trying to maximize the information under the control of the total penalty for treating patients in the trial. In their work they developed a flexible adaptive model-based design able to identify the optimal safe dose in phase I/II combination trials based on binary efficacy and toxicity response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270010390041">23</xref></sup> In spite of the clear benefits that can be gained from performing adaptive designs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010390041">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091270010390041">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270010390041">24</xref></sup> which incorporate the accruing information for updating treatment allocation and give subjects a better chance of receiving a superior treatment, in the present work this alternative has not been considered. The aim in this work, even if exemplified in the concrete case of an immunosuppressant drug, was to generalize to other possible situations with different disease progressions. Therefore, adaptive designs, although appropriate for many trials, cannot be applied, for instance, in long-term survival trials where the end point cannot be ascertained in a short period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010390041">21</xref></sup> We wanted to confine ourselves to a more traditional situation, where a fixed design is considered but penalty functions are incorporated and prior information is used in the design optimization.</p>
<p>To explore the individual–collective ethical balance, design optimizations with restrictions in total number of events and maximal individual risk in the trial were performed, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091270010390041">Table III</xref>. Results show how the gain in information increases as the PSUM increases. In addition, fewer subjects are recruited. Across all scenarios, the DCT is shown to gain more knowledge with less cost (in terms of either number of subjects or events). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0091270010390041">Figure 4</xref> provides a quantitative picture about the ethical trade-off between maximal individual risk and number of subjects and unwanted events per trial with a given amount of information about the exposure–response relationship, for both DCT and CCT. This type of quantitative information about the balance between individual risk and information gained may be of use when designing dose-finding trials for narrow therapeutic drugs.</p>
<p>When the prior information in baselines is incorporated, both higher and lower doses are generally clustered closer to the optimal dose. This is because there is less need to obtain information about baseline parameter, as some information is already provided in the prior information. The inclusion of prior information considerably diminishes the costs of gaining new knowledge, in this case translated into a reduction in the total number of unwanted events per trial.</p>
<p>Obviously, the strength of the prior information will play a large role in study design. In this work, although the designs with respect to target doses remained the same regardless of the size of the study when no prior information was used, this was not the case when prior information was used. As the planned study size increases, the contribution from the prior information diminishes and the study designs become more similar to designs without use of prior information. At lower study sizes, the design may differ considerably between using prior information or not, as evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091270010390041">Table III</xref>.</p>
<p>Optimizing over an objective function dependent on the sensitivity function of the model (chosen for simplicity and speed) does not incorporate the variance in the model and hence is not a true lower bound of the expected information from a maximum likelihood estimator. However, for the purposes of this article the simplified metric was used to explore a wide variety of design questions. At a higher computational cost, all of the issues in this article may be addressed using the FIM instead.</p>
<p>Although typical clinical trial design involves arms intended to be of equal size,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010390041">21</xref></sup> the impact of different-size arms was explored here. No differences with regard to optimal dose/exposure targets were found compared with equal-size designs; however, although CCT equally allocates patients into the 2 arms, DCT mainly allocates subjects in the highest dose (data not shown). In general, differences in terms of subjects needed to enroll and number of expected events were small for equi-informative designs with equal or unequal arm allocation, in particular for CCTs.</p>
<p>The present study was performed under the assumption that there exists no covariance between PK and PD parameters. In the presence of such a covariance, the relative merits between DCT and CCT become more subtle to ascertain, as shown in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270010390041">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the main findings of this study are: (1) when exploring a wider range of possible designs, using the previously described objective function, DCT outperformed the corresponding CCT; (2) designs for which the cost is based on number of events can be equally informative and result in fewer unwanted events compared with designs that base cost on number of subjects; (3) the quantitative trade-off between individual risk and number of events for a given amount of information about exposure–response can be mapped and may form a decision basis in designing trials; and (4) the use of prior information on baseline frequencies of events can lead to considerably more informative and ethically attractive designs.</p>
