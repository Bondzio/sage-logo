<abstract>
<p>The temporal dimensions of Internet use have been primarily examined as daily or weekly totals in the literature, which ignores other important structural dimensions of time and the contextual nature of Internet use. Using event history analysis, this study provides a nuanced analysis of the timing and duration of Internet use with an Internet-activity diary dataset collected in Columbus (Ohio, USA) in 2003–2004. Compared to the analysis of daily totals, the fine-grained analysis reveals that besides social, demographic, and geographic factors, the attributes of Internet episodes, such as activity purpose, also significantly affect both the timing and duration, and these temporal dimensions of Internet use are also connected.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961463X11421359" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 15 years, the social implications of Internet use have attracted significant attention in media studies, sociology, geography, and related disciplines. The temporal dimensions of Internet use have featured in at least two ways in the related literatures. First, some researchers have argued that time spent online is a meaningful indicator of digital inequalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11421359">DiMaggio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X11421359">Barzilai-Nahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0961463X11421359">Van Dijk, 2006</xref>), and others have actually used it in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11421359">Davidson and Cotton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X11421359">Dholakia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961463X11421359">Livingstone and Helsper, 2007</xref>). This reflects that simplistic and binary indicators of access/non-access and use/non-use have increasingly been replaced by measures of the degree of inequality along multiple dimensions, including time online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961463X11421359">Rice and Katz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0961463X11421359">Van Dijk and Hacker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961463X11421359">Warschauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X11421359">Crang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, a debate about whether the Internet takes away time from other forms of media use and social contact was triggered by influential studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X11421359">Kraut et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961463X11421359">Nie and Erbring (2000)</xref>. The former proposed that new Internet users experienced lower levels of face-to-face communication with friends and family; the latter found that Internet users had less offline contact with family and friends and spent less time on TV and print media. While subsequent studies also found that Internet use displaces the use of traditional media (especially TV watching) and sleeping, the evidence about the impact of the Internet on social participation is more mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X11421359">Boase and Wellman, 2006</xref>). Other empirical research nonetheless indicates that Internet positively relates to interactions with friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961463X11421359">Shklovski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0961463X11421359">Wang and Wellman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the attention to the temporal dimensions of Internet use, these studies have not truly engaged with the very notion of time itself. The ontology of time has been taken for granted, and time has been equated to the amount of clock-time people spend online. Yet time has been interrogated and re-conceptualized in philosophy, sociology, and geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X11421359">Adam, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X11421359">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X11421359">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961463X11421359">May and Thrift, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0961463X11421359">Schwanen, 2006</xref>), and work along these lines can be used to reconsider the temporal complexities of Internet use. One useful framework is Adam's notion of ‘timescape’. Here, time is a multifaceted social construct that is closely interrelated with both space and matter. It is embodied in a specific and unique context and thus inherently <italic>contextual</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X11421359">Adam, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X11421359">2008</xref>). Key structural dimensions of Adam's conception of time include: time frame (scale, e.g. minute, hour, year, lifetime, epoch), temporality (process, irreversibility), timing (when), tempo (pace, intensity of activity), duration (length, extension), sequence (order, succession), and temporal modalities (past, present, future).</p>
<p>In this study, we do not attempt to examine all the above temporal dimensions of Internet use, but rather focus on its ‘timing’ and ‘duration’. The former has received little attention in the Internet usage literature – we are only aware of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0961463X11421359">Spennemann's (2006)</xref> work about daily usage curves for Australia and the US West Coast. While insightful, Spennemann's approach does not allow the context of Internet use to be analyzed in great detail. More insight in the timing dimension is nonetheless required, as it may reveal additional layers of inequality in Internet use, especially when individuals face constraints that restrict such use to particular times of the day.</p>
<p>As the above discussion suggests, duration has only been examined as daily or weekly totals. Hence, important attributes of the contextuality of duration are lost. One way to foreground this contextuality is to analyze the duration of individual <italic>Internet activity episodes.</italic> In this study, an Internet activity episode is defined as a continuous stretch of (clock) time online devoted to a particular purpose, such as online shopping for household needs or web browsing for personal information needs. An activity episode approach is appropriate because it ‘emphasizes the context (the why, when, where, with whom, duration and sequence) of activity participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X11421359">Bhat and Koppelman, 1999</xref>: 125) and is thus commensurable with Adam's timescape framework.</p>
<p>In short, this study focuses on the two important themes that have not been fully examined in the literature on Internet use. First, the study addresses the timing and duration of Internet use, examining how these temporal dimensions differ according to a broad range of factors. However, given the multi-modal distribution of timing and duration of individual Internet episodes and interdependence among Internet episodes, conventional regression analysis is not appropriate. Instead, event history analysis was used in the study. Second, by using event history analysis, the study provides a fine-grained analysis of the temporal dimensions, which furnishes a more nuanced understanding of Internet use than the total time or the binary indicator of use/non-use. For example, the duration of an Internet episode not only relates to the characteristics of the Internet user, but also depends on the Internet usage of its previous episode and the timing of this Internet episode. Data were drawn from a two-day activity-Internet diary survey conducted in Columbus (Ohio, USA) in 2003–2004. The remainder of this paper begins by outlining an interdisciplinary framework for understanding differences in the timing and duration of Internet activities. This will be followed by a detailed description of the data and methods used. Section 4 describes the results and then the paper concludes with discussion of findings.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0961463X11421359"><title>Timing, duration and Internet use</title>
<p>Various lines of literature can be used to formulate expectations about factors that may be related to the timing and duration of online activity episodes. These include the aforementioned literature about the social implications of the Internet and studies of activity participation in the offline world in transport studies, sociology, and human geography.</p>
<p>One lesson learned from research about offline activities is that various attributes of activity episodes – duration, timing, location, purpose, and so on – tend to be interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961463X11421359">Burnett and Hanson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X11421359">Kitamura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961463X11421359">Schwanen et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, the starting time and duration of offline activity episodes are shown to be correlated with each other. While the associations are complex, it appears that offline activities for household needs and recreational purposes tend to last longer if conducted in the evening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961463X11421359">Pendyala and Bhat, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961463X11421359">Schwanen, 2004</xref>). Further, durations of different offline activities conducted at the same day are often related to each other. Some studies have suggested saturation effects in activity engagement: the time that people have already spent for a certain activity purpose on a given day may reduce the duration of later episode of the same purpose, presumably because their need for that type of activity has already been satisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X11421359">Kitamura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961463X11421359">Schwanen, 2004</xref>). It may well be that the observed interactions between attributes of offline activity episodes extend to online episodes.</p>
<p>Within the literature about the social implications of Internet use and digital divides, a number of studies have suggested that such usage comprises multiple, interdependent contextual dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11421359">DiMaggio et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X11421359">Barzilai-Nahon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0961463X11421359">Van Dijk, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X11421359">DiMaggio et al. (2004)</xref>, for instance, proposed five broad dimensions of inequalities in Internet use. These dimensions include technical apparatus, autonomy of use or the control people have over their Internet use, skills, availability of social support, and purpose of use. We expected at least four of these dimensions to be associated with the timing and duration of Internet activity episodes. All else being equal, a better technical apparatus, more autonomy of use and better skills may be associated with longer episodes and online activities starting earlier in the day. With regard to purpose of use, our expectations were less clear-cut. However, based on transport studies of activity participation in the offline world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961463X11421359">Niemeier and Morita, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11421359">Bhat and Steed, 2002</xref>), we expected Internet episodes for recreational purposes, <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>, to last longer and to be undertaken later during the day than episodes for other purposes.</p>
<p>It is evident from the literature that the above dimensions of inequality in Internet use are related to people's socioeconomic status, gender, age, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X11421359">Hargittai and Shafer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0961463X11421359">Zillien and Hargittai, 2009</xref>). However, socioeconomic position, age, and gender have been found to affect Internet use directly after equipment, skills, availability of social support, and motivations are controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0961463X11421359">Zillien and Hargittai, 2009</xref>). Studies of time online have also shown that these variables have direct impacts on the time online, though the effects vary across studies and not all studies controlled for equipment, skills, social support or autonomy of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X11421359">Davidson and Cotton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X11421359">Dholakia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X11421359">Goldfarb and Prince, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961463X11421359">Loke and Foo, 2010</xref>). Further, socioeconomic status, age and gender significantly influence the timing and duration of activity episodes in the offline world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961463X11421359">Niemeier and Morita, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11421359">Bhat and Steed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961463X11421359">Pendyala and Bhat, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961463X11421359">Schwanen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0961463X11421359">Schönfelder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961463X11421359">Pinjari and Bhat, 2010</xref>). We therefore included them in the analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to these factors, offline activities may also affect the timing and duration of online activities. Geographers and transport researchers have extensively studied the interactions between offline and online activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X11421359">Kwan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X11421359">Kwan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X11421359">Dijst et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961463X11421359">Ren and Kwan, 2009b</xref>). Their work suggests that the relations between online and offline activity episodes are strong, complex, contextual, and can take different forms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961463X11421359">Salomon (1986)</xref> proposed an influential typology of interactions between online and offline activities: neutrality (no interaction), substitution (online activity replaces offline activities or vice versa), generation (online activity generates new offline activities or vice versa), and modification (online activity modifies one or several dimensions of offline activities and vice versa). The last type is most relevant to this study. The need to conduct particular activities in the offline world (e.g. childcare and housework) may result in online activities being undertaken at other times of the day or for a shorter duration. In this way, gender roles in the physical world and the social processes through which housework and childcare responsibilities are primarily assigned to women may impose greater restrictions on the Internet use of women and/or those individuals who undertake many housework and childcare activities.</p>
<p>Further, a number of studies have indicated that geographic context affects people's use of the Internet to complete a specific task. For example, studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X11421359">Farag et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961463X11421359">Ren and Kwan (2009a)</xref> have shown that people's inclination to engage in online shopping decreases when more diverse brick-and-mortar stores can be reached within a limited travel time from their residences. We may therefore expect that longer online episodes are more likely to be performed outside the opening hours of shops and recreational facilities or in the areas where accessibility to such places is low.</p>
<p>In summary, we anticipated the timing and duration of Internet episodes to vary according to:

<sec id="sec3-0961463X11421359"><title>Data and methods</title>
<sec id="sec4-0961463X11421359"><title>Rationale</title>
<p>The dataset used in this study was collected by Kwan and Ren through a paper-based activity-Internet diary survey in the Columbus metropolitan area (Ohio, USA) in 2003–2004. The survey was originally developed and aimed at collecting data to answer important research questions related to Internet use, including the impact of Internet use on people's space-time constraints, activity-travel patterns, and share of household responsibilities. It also sought to examine the gender differences with regard to the interactions between these dimensions and Internet use.</p>
<p>Because the data were collected in 2003–2004, they do not allow us to explore the recent growth in Internet use via mobile devices and in social networking and social media applications (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) in great depth. We nonetheless believe the data have considerable value and relevance even today. First, to the best of our knowledge there is no other dataset that includes the kind of detailed information about households (e.g. sharing of different household tasks) and participants' physical and online activities (e.g. geographic location and spatial and temporal fixity). The data make it possible to examine hitherto under-examined substantive issues about the relations between space-time constraints, offline activities and the many dimensions of Internet use, using an equally under-utilized but highly appropriate methodological approach (event history analysis – see below) to examine the temporal dimensions of Internet use. Second, findings of this study can provide a useful point of departure for future work on the different factors that shape people's Internet use in the mobile communications era. They can be used, for instance, as a reference point for comparisons. It should also be noted that Internet activities using mobile devices are not entirely free from the influence of the contextual factors revealed in the study (e.g. household responsibilities) and this study can aid in designing future research about constraints on wireless Internet activities. Finally, the category of online leisure activities may to some extent be comparable to social networking via the web.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961463X11421359"><title>Sample collection</title>
<p>The survey began with the creation of a stratified random sample of 32,000 households in the study area using a commercial-grade and highly accurate residential address list purchased from Haines &amp; Company. This sampling method ensured that all the sub-areas of the study area were covered. Screening packages were then mailed to the 32,000 randomly selected households, inviting households of couples with/without child(ren) or single parents with child(ren) to participate in the project. Eight hundreds and seventy five households agreed to participate and were sent a survey package that included activity-Internet diaries of all adult household members. When returned surveys were incomplete or had inconsistencies, follow-up calls were made to correct the inconsistencies and fill in the missing information.</p>
<p>Besides collecting household, individual, and Internet use information, the survey instrument also contained two-day activity-Internet diaries for all adult members of a household. The diary collected detailed data about participants' physical and Internet activities for two designated survey days (weekdays only). All respondents were also provided with two activity record sheets, which they used to record when and where all of their activities were undertaken for the two survey days. This greatly helped them to recall all the activities at the end of the day when they filled in the activity-Internet diaries. In the diary, the respondents answered more detailed questions regarding the activities undertaken on a specific survey day, including the reasons why they conducted a particular activity, the start time and duration of the activity, travel time associated with the activity, the travel mode used, and so on. With regard to the primary purpose for undertaking an activity, six purposes were included in the survey: work or work-related activities, essential household needs, personal needs, leisure or recreational activities, social activities, and other types of activities. It is possible that a given activity was classified in several ways. For example, shopping can be as a household chore or a leisure activity. We let the respondents decide which purpose each activity mainly fulfilled, given the specific situation in which it was undertaken. The respondents also needed to differentiate the primary and secondary activities when multitasking occurred. The following analysis only considers the primary activities.</p>
<p>Completed diaries from 420 individuals were eventually obtained. Since the number of non-Internet users in the final sample is very small (<italic>n</italic> = 28), this study focuses only on the Internet users in the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 392). As each Internet user kept two diaries for two weekdays, there are 784 diaries for the following empirical analysis. The subsample of 392 Internet users includes 256 women (65%) and 136 men. Most are white (93%), highly educated (80% are college or graduate degree holders), and rely on their own automobile (97%). Further, 42 percent of the households in the subsample had an annual income above $80,000; only 14 percent of the households earned less than $40,000 per year. Obviously, women, whites, highly educated and high-income individuals are over-represented in the sample, which reflects a self-selection process with highly educated and high-income individuals being more inclined to participate. This is understandable given the complexity of the 36-page diaries. Due to these characteristics of the sample, we do not intend to generalize the empirical results reported in this paper to the entire population of the study area. Further, the analytical methods used in the study may still be applicable for examining other population groups when such data are available.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0961463X11421359"><title>Operationalization of timing and duration of Internet use</title>
<p>Among the 9244 primary activity episodes obtained via the activity-Internet diaries, there were 1307 Internet activity episodes.

<p>In the empirical analysis, we draw a distinction between the first Internet episode and subsequent episodes on a given day. This is because subsequent episodes are likely to have different behavioral underpinnings and may be affected differently by certain factors. In transport studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X11421359">Bhat and Misra (2002)</xref> and others have argued and verified that decisions about whether and when to undertake the first (out-of-home) activity episode are driven by different factors than those for subsequent episodes. We thus assume in our analysis that choices with regard to subsequent episodes are dependent on previous online activities.</p>

<p>The indicators of attributes of online episodes and autonomy over the Internet were derived from the activity-Internet diaries. In line with the literature, time availability was operationalized through two general indicators – the number of hours in paid employment per week and the ratio of children per adult in the household. Gender role was evaluated via a series of indicators that measure respondents' self-rated contribution to specific housework and childcare tasks. These measures thus captured subtle differences in the gender division of household labor between spouses or partners.</p>
<p>Accessibility to places for offline activity participation was evaluated in two ways. First, three accessibility measures of the cumulative opportunity (CO) type were used, measuring the number of urban opportunities that can be reached within specific travel times from respondents' home location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11421359">Kwan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0961463X11421359">Weber, 2003</xref>). The number of urban opportunities was derived from the Franklin County land parcel dataset maintained by the Franklin County Auditor. Twenty-eight categories of a total of 4996 parcels were considered as urban opportunities where people might conduct daily maintenance and leisure activities in the offline world. Generally, they include various types of stores, entertainment opportunities (such as night clubs, cinemas and parks), banks, restaurants and sports facilities. Using these parcels as representative of urban opportunities, we calculated the CO indices for 5-, 10-, and 15-minute driving times respectively for each home, using a specialized geographic information system (GIS) software (ArcGIS Network Analyst). Second, we used population density at the neighborhood level as an indicator of offline interaction opportunities in the study area. In this way, we can account for the greater availability of opportunities for offline activities in the neighborhoods that have a higher population density. People in such neighborhoods may more actively interact with their friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>Finally, socioeconomic position was operationalized through five indicators. These include income and education, as well as occupation (since certain occupations do not lend themselves well for using the Internet for personal purposes during employment hours). Two indicators of the neighborhoods where respondents live were also included. This is because social polarization between neighborhoods is rather pronounced in the Columbus metropolitan area.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0961463X11421359"><title>Event history analysis</title>
<p>Event history analysis (EHA) or survival analysis was used to examine differences in the timing and duration of Internet episodes. This method examines the occurrence of a significant event in a certain period under the assumption that the probability of it occurring depends on the time-span that has elapsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961463X11421359">Allison, 1984</xref>). Hence, unlike linear regression analysis, EHA takes duration dependence in the occurrence of events into account. Death is the classic example of an event in medical research, and the probability of its occurrence increases when the lapse of living (surviving) lasts. However, social scientists have employed survival analysis to understand the (non)occurrence of many other and less harmful events. The term ‘survival’ in these applications refers to the cases that have not experienced the given event. For example, survival analysis can be used to analyze the probability that a person becomes employed (equivalent to the death earlier) as a function of the time-span he/she has been unemployed (equivalent to the survival earlier) and such covariates as age, gender, and education. EHA is particularly helpful in explaining why certain individuals have a higher risk of experiencing an event under consideration than others.</p>
<p>Event history analysis usually starts with a descriptive analysis of the distribution of events across the time period considered. To this end, the time period is divided into discrete intervals. Based on tests with our data, 15-minute intervals were used for the timing analysis and 5-minute intervals for the duration analysis. For each interval <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>, the number of cases at risk (i.e. cases that have not experienced a given event at the beginning of <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>) and the number of survived cases at the end of <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic> need to be calculated. Using these two values, the proportion of cases that survived (not experiencing the event) through <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic> is then computed. By plotting the proportion of survived cases for each interval, a s<italic>urvival curve</italic> is obtained, which shows the survival probability at different times. The inverse of survival probability is called the <italic>hazard rate</italic>, which indicates the probability that a case may experience the event at the end of <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>. Thus, with regard to timing, the hazard rate measures the probability that an episode starts by the end of <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>; for duration, it indicates the likelihood that an episode ends by the end of <italic>t<sub>j</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>Various linear, regression-type models have been developed to examine which covariates affect how the hazard rate changes over time. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for this analysis as it requires no prior knowledge about the probability distribution of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X11421359">Cox, 1972</xref>). Because it is quite general and nonrestrictive, it has been widely applied in the study of offline activity participation in transport studies and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961463X11421359">Niemeier and Morita, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961463X11421359">Schwanen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X11421359">Ettema et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec10-0961463X11421359"><title>General Internet use</title>
<p>The subsample contains 392 respondents and 748 diaries for the two survey days. After averaging the total time spent on online maintenance and leisure activities, we obtained 308 respondents who engaged in at least one Internet episode for either maintenance or leisure purposes. On average, the 308 respondents spent 34 and 30 minutes per day on online maintenance and leisure activities. While these averages do not differ significantly from each other (<italic>p</italic> = 0.35), the share of respondents who participated in online maintenance activity is considerably higher than that for online leisure: 60 percent against 48 percent. This may reflect that there are more maintenance tasks to complete in everyday life and they are more mandatory than leisure activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961463X11421359">Schwanen et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In keeping with the literature on the social implications of Internet use, linear regression analysis was used to analyze which factors are associated most strongly and directly with the total time spent online for maintenance and leisure purposes combined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961463X11421359">Table 2</xref>). Weekly employment hours, an indicator of time availability, is correlated most strongly with time online for these purposes. As expected, people who work longer hours on a weekly basis tend to spend less time on maintenance and leisure activities on the Internet. Other factors that previous studies have shown to be related to total time online, such as technical equipment (connection speed), Internet skills, accessibility to places in the offline world, socioeconomic status, age, and gender, yielded no statistically significant results for our respondents.

<p>In addition, logistic regression was used to analyze the profiles of respondents participating in online maintenance and leisure activities respectively. We further specified two linear regression models for the total time online for maintenance purposes with the respondents engaging in this activity, and for the total time online for leisure with those who undertook this activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961463X11421359">Table 2</xref>, the indicators of time availability feature prominently in all four models; as respondents work longer hours, they are less likely to engage in online maintenance or leisure activities and spend less time on maintenance activities. The number of children per adult in the household has a strong negative association with the total time dedicated to online leisure, which likely reflects that many childcare-related activities, such as transporting children to school and helping with homework, cannot be completed over the web and thus reduce time available for recreational Internet use.</p>
<p>Although the total time spent on maintenance activities does not vary by gender, the logistic regression analysis indicates that women are more likely to engage in these activities than men. These findings concur with expectations. Because of women's greater responsibility for housework and childcare, they are more likely to conduct online activities related to these roles. At the same time, domestic responsibilities make it difficult for the women in the sample to spend much time on online activities. As with total time online, technical equipment, Internet skills, accessibility to places offline, socioeconomic position and age are not significantly related to participation in and total time spent on either maintenance or leisure activities on the web.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0961463X11421359"><title>Timing of Internet activity episodes</title>
<p>For the analysis of timing of the Internet episodes, starting an Internet episode is defined as the event under consideration, and ‘survival cases' refers to the people who have not started the Internet episode. We began the analysis of the timing dimension by plotting the survival curves for the first online maintenance and leisure episode for all 784 diaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961463X11421359">Figure 1</xref>). The log-rank test can be used to test whether the difference between curves is statistically significant. The test result shows this to be the case (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
<fig id="fig1-0961463X11421359" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Survival curves for the starting time of the first Internet episode, by purpose (<italic>n = </italic>784).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961463X11421359-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Further, two main differences between the two survival curves are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961463X11421359">Figure 1</xref>. First, the survival curve of the first online maintenance activity episodes drops more rapidly in the morning, which implies that people are more likely to get online earlier for maintenance activities, such as checking email or weather, than for leisure purposes. This observation is consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0961463X11421359">Spennemann (2006)</xref>. Second, the percentage of survivals at the end of the 24-hour period is higher for online leisure activity episodes, which verifies that fewer respondents engaged in this type of activities than in online maintenance.</p>
<p>The timing of Internet activity episodes was also analyzed for women and men separately. The left graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961463X11421359">Figure 2</xref> clearly shows that more women (50%) than men (38%) engaged in online maintenance activities. Moreover, the fact that the survival curve drops faster in the morning (between 7am and 11am) for women indicates that they tend to start their first online maintenance activity earlier than do men. However, no statistically significant difference between men's and women’s survival can be identified for online leisure activities. As the right graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961463X11421359">Figure 2</xref> suggests, these curves virtually overlap. It seems, therefore, that the timing of online maintenance activities is gendered more strongly than online leisure episodes.
<fig id="fig2-0961463X11421359" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Survival curves for the starting time of the first Internet episode, by purpose and gender.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961463X11421359-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>To better understand the above differences in timing, a series of statistical tests using Cox regression methods were conducted. The final model specifications, which only contain covariates that significantly improve the overall model fit, are summarized in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961463X11421359">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961463X11421359">5</xref>. When interpreting the results in these tables, it is important to bear in mind that a <italic>negative</italic> coefficient means a lower hazard rate of starting the first online episode and therefore a <italic>later</italic> starting time. Conversely, a <italic>positive</italic> coefficient means a higher hazard rate and an <italic>earlier</italic> starting time.

<p>When the timing of the first online activity episode is considered (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961463X11421359">Table 3</xref>), activity purpose is the strongest predictor. An episode for maintenance purposes is likely to start earlier during the day than a leisure episode, which is consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961463X11421359">Figure 1</xref>. Activity location also matters; if the first online episode is performed at home, it tends to start earlier.</p>
<p>Time availability also seems to be relevant. Respondents who worked longer hours per week started their first Internet activities for maintenance or leisure purposes later. This finding is consistent with expectations; employment activities are more obligatory than many other types of activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961463X11421359">Schwanen et al., 2008</xref>) and tend to be conducted more frequently in the morning and (early) afternoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X11421359">Kitamura et al., 1997</xref>). Respondents in households with more children per adult also went online later, presumably because they had more childcare responsibilities, such as to prepare and transport children to school in the morning. Finally, older respondents tended to start their Internet activities later than younger respondents did.</p>
<p>Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961463X11421359">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961463X11421359">5</xref> summarize the results for the starting time of the first maintenance and leisure activity episodes, respectively. Similarly to the previous model, the location where the Internet is used affects the timing of the first episode; home-based episodes tend to be conducted earlier during the day. There are also some differences between the two activity purposes. First, gender is associated with the timing of the first maintenance episode but not for leisure purposes, which matches the survival curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961463X11421359">Figure 2</xref>. Suggested by the negative coefficient of the variable of men (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961463X11421359">Table 4</xref>), men tend to start the first online maintenance activities later than women. Because both gender and indicators of the share of housework are strongly correlated with each other, the result hints that most of the differences in timing of the first online maintenance episode reflect the gender division of household labor. It is unlikely these differences between men and women are due to differences in Internet skills, technical equipment, and place of Internet use, as these were controlled for in the analysis.
</p>
<p>Second, time availability (employment hours and number of children per adult) and age only affect the timing of the first leisure activity episode (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961463X11421359">Table 5</xref>). This result seems to reflect that online leisure activity episodes are more discretionary in the sense that their timing is more severely restricted by the need to conduct paid work and domestic work in the offline world. In contrast, the timing of online maintenance activities is more clearly associated with the type of occupation a person holds. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961463X11421359">Table 4</xref> shows that people working as operators, fabricators, managers, or professionals tend to go online for maintenance purposes later. People in these occupations may have fewer chances to work alone on a computer at the workplace. It is also possible that Internet use for non-working purposes at the workplace is not encouraged for employees in those positions.</p>
<p>As for the timing of succeeding online maintenance and leisure episodes, the Cox regression models confirm the expectations regarding the dependence on previous episodes. If the first Internet activity episode occurs at a later time of the day, the time-span to the subsequent Internet episode will be slightly shorter. However, the time-span to the subsequent Internet episode will be longer if the previous episode has the same purpose. With the exception of the location where the Internet episode is conducted, none of the tested variables significantly relate to the timing of subsequent Internet activity episodes. The lapses between home-based succeeding activities tend to be shorter, presumably because people feel less controlled and freer to use the Internet at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0961463X11421359"><title>Duration of Internet activity episodes</title>
<p>For the analysis of duration, terminating an Internet episode is defined as the event of interest, and ‘survival cases' refer to the episodes that have not ended. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0961463X11421359">Figure 3</xref> depicts the survival curves of the duration of the first online maintenance and leisure activity episodes, and they overlap for the most part. They also drop fastest within the first 60 minutes. There were only about 20 percent of first episodes that had survived by the end of the 60 minutes, meaning about 80 percent of the first online episodes lasted less than one hour.
<fig id="fig3-0961463X11421359" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Survival curves for the duration of the first Internet episode, by purpose.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961463X11421359-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0961463X11421359">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the probability distribution of the duration of the first online maintenance and leisure activity episodes for men and women separately. The left graph shows that the men’s survival curve drops faster than women’s in the first 45 minutes, implying that men tend to conduct shorter Internet episodes for maintenance purposes. After one hour, however, the two curves overlap and the log-rank test shows no significant differences between men and women (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Similarly, the duration of the first online leisure episode does not differ significantly between men and women (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). About half of the first online leisure episodes lasted up to 10 minutes and less than one-fifth lasted longer than 30 minutes.

</fig></p>
<p>Three Cox regression models were specified for online maintenance and leisure episodes combined, for online maintenance only, and for online leisure only. As the second and third models strongly resemble the first, we only discuss the first model (the one for the two purposes combined). Unlike the coefficients in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961463X11421359">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0961463X11421359">5</xref>, a <italic>negative</italic> coefficient in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0961463X11421359">Table 6</xref> means a lower hazard rate of terminating the first Internet episode and therefore a <italic>longer</italic> duration.

<p>With regard to Internet use, we see that the start time of the first online episode is weakly related to its duration; as the episode starts later during the day, it tends to last longer. Autonomy of Internet use is also relevant; online episodes undertaken at home last longer, presumably because surveillance is weaker at home. Finally, and also in line with expectations, technical equipment matters as well. The association between the duration of the first Internet episode and connection speed is large; for people with broadband access, the probability of terminating the first online episode is more than 30 percent higher than for those with a telephone modem. In other words, online activity episodes are considerably shorter if people have access to broadband Internet.</p>
<p>Four indicators of time availability are included in the final specification of the Cox regression model, and three of these relate to the distribution of domestic responsibilities within the household. Interestingly, the inclusion of gender role indicators produces superior models in a statistical sense (i.e. higher <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values) than when gender is included. This probably reflects that the gender role indicators are more successful in capturing differences in the household division of housework and childcare responsibilities between men and women (as also shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11421359">Kwan, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0961463X11421359">Table 6</xref> shows that a greater responsibility for grocery shopping and care-giving to babies – activities that are generally difficult to conduct via the web – reduces the duration of the first online episode. These offline activities thus impose more extensive constraints on and displace online activity episodes. In contrast, if a person carries a greater responsibility for the household’s financial management, his/her first online activity tends to be longer. This is not surprising given that the Internet can contribute to such management. The coefficient of the fourth indicator, weekly employment hours, suggests that people who allocate more time to paid labor on a weekly basis tend to have shorter online activities.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic position is represented in the model through household income and education level. The result shows that online maintenance and leisure episodes are shorter as people occupy a higher position on the socioeconomic ladder. Finally, living in a high-density neighborhood is included as an indicator of accessibility to interaction opportunities and places for offline activities. Its coefficient indicates that online maintenance and leisure episodes tended to be shorter among respondents who live in higher density neighborhoods. While this finding is in line with expectations, it is noteworthy that the cumulative opportunity indicators of accessibility yielded no statistically significant results. This suggests that density does not so much reflect convenient access to such places as stores, entertainment venues, restaurant and parks, but rather seems to signify the effect of easy access to friends and others with whom offline (leisure) activities can be undertaken.</p>
<p>As for the succeeding Internet episodes, they tend to last somewhat longer than the first episodes; the average duration of the former is 47 minutes against 41 minutes for the latter. The difference between first and subsequent episodes is much more pronounced for leisure than for maintenance activities: the averages are 43 against 56 minutes and 40 against 43 minutes, respectively. These average values suggest not only that the respondents in this study had more spare time later in the day, but also spent more time on online leisure activities. Similar to the timing dimension, the Cox regression analysis suggests that the duration of succeeding Internet episodes is dependent on the characteristics of the first episode. The results are, however, rather complex. If a succeeding episode has the same purpose as its previous episode, it tends to be shorter, which reflects saturation of the need for a given type of activity. Yet the duration of the succeeding episodes is positively correlated with the duration of their preceding ones. This reflects that certain respondents used the Internet heavily throughout the day, presumably out of habit (or even addiction). There are also significant geographical variations in the duration of subsequent online activities. For subsequent episodes, the cumulative opportunity measures of accessibility yield statistically significant results; the episodes tend to be shorter as residential locations provide better access to stores, entertainment venues, parks and so on.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0961463X11421359" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The empirical analysis of the timing and duration of Internet use for maintenance and leisure purposes contributes to the existing literatures in various ways. First, our analysis both complements and extends the existing literature about Internet use in showing that context matters to the explanation of differences in how people use the Internet. While indicators of time availability and autonomy over Internet use affect both the timing and duration of Internet episodes, the timing is also associated to the purpose of Internet use, people’s skills, and their occupation type. In contrast, the duration of online episodes is related to the equipment used to access the Internet and accessibility to places in the offline world. Socioeconomic position also bears more strongly on the duration than on the timing of online episodes. Further, the analysis has indicated that later starts of online episodes primarily reflect restrictions on Internet use imposed by the participation in paid work, housework, and care-giving to children. We therefore conclude that the timing and duration of Internet use, which have hitherto remained relatively unexamined in the literature, are important dimensions of digital inequalities and thus have significant implications for any study of the digital divide. Digital inequalities are not only influenced by people’s socioeconomic status. They are also shaped by geographic and temporal contexts in a highly complex manner and those contexts should be key concerns in studies of the social implications of the Internet. Policies that aim at addressing these digital inequalities but ignore these factors are unlikely to be effective.</p>
<p>Second, event history analysis has proven to be a useful tool for understanding systematic differences in the timing and duration of Internet use. It enables a fine-grained analysis of Internet use at the episode level that provides more nuanced explanations of the differences between people than the relatively simple indicator of the total time spent online on a given day. A comparison of Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961463X11421359">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0961463X11421359">6</xref> shows that many systematic differences along the duration dimension of Internet use become visible only when an episode-level perspective is adopted. The benefit of this fine-grained perspective is also evident from the differences in the factors associated with the timing of the first episode and subsequent episodes. This study thus suggests that event history analysis and the episodic perspective may be powerful tools for examining the complex interactions among people’s use of mobile communications (e.g. smart phones), interaction technologies (e.g. SMS, Twitter), and their activity-travel behavior in the latest phase of technological evolution.</p>
<p>Third, by combining the literature about the social implications of the Internet with studies of offline activity participation in transport studies, sociology, and human geography, we are able to reveal close interactions between how people use the Internet and what they (can) do in the offline world. We have, for instance, found ample and robust evidence of time displacement effects of paid work, housework, and childcare on participants’ Internet use (thus corroborating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X11421359">Kwan’s [2002]</xref> earlier observation). Likewise, we have shown that spatial variations in Internet use are not limited to the simple distinction between urban and rural areas or to differences between metropolitan areas. Fine-grained geographical differences exist between and within neighborhoods, which seem to reflect differential access to services, facilities and other places in the physical world (‘competition effects’).</p>
<p>In general, like other geographers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0961463X11421359">Valentine and Holloway, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X11421359">Crang et al., 2006</xref>), we find that online activities do not occur in a vacuum and are not separated from the offline realm. Instead, they are situated in and closely entwined with the socio-material world. This is also borne out in our findings regarding the gendering of the timing and duration of Internet use, which align closely with processes in the offline world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X11421359">Kwan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0961463X11421359">Schwanen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961463X11421359">Schwanen et al., 2008</xref>): women undertake more online maintenance activities for more hours per day and earlier during the day, while at the same time most housework and childcare-related activities reduce their time for online leisure activities. It thus appears that the Internet is indeed another site where processes of social stratification along lines of gender take place (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X11421359">Dholakia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961463X11421359">Madge and O’Connor, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There are limitations in this study that might be addressed in future work. The transferability of our findings to other geographic contexts and social groups needs to be verified. This is because the study participants were mostly middle-class white Americans in Columbus (Ohio) relying on their own cars for transportation. The data used are also not current and the empirical evidence from the analysis may not necessarily reflect current Internet use patterns. However, the analytical method used in this study can be applied to other studies. Also, while we found technical equipment, autonomy of Internet use, skills, and purpose of Internet use to be associated with the timing and duration of online episodes, more refined indicators for each should be used in future research. Further, the timing and duration dimensions can be examined further. For instance, we have considered each dimension only in quantitative terms, drawing on the measurement system of clock-time. While convenient, this measurement system offers little insight in the phenomenological experience and meaning of the timing and duration of activities over the Internet.</p>
