<p>Virgil Scudder, whose name may be familiar for his quarterly column in PRSA’s magazine <italic>The Strategist</italic>, has teamed with son Ken Scudder to produce a useful guide to effective communication for corporate CEOs and organization leaders. It summarizes advice the elder Scudder has provided for twenty years as a public relations counselor and communication coach to organizational leaders in twenty-six countries on five continents.</p>
<p>Scudder has earned his bona fides. Before founding his own firm, Virgil Scudder &amp; Associates, in 1990, he spent time in the C-suite as senior vice president at both Carl Byoir &amp; Associates and Hill &amp; Knowlton. Scudder has also earned media stripes as a news broadcaster for WINS all-news radio, NBC, and ABC News. From the outset, Scudder acknowledges what the work is and isn’t:
<disp-quote>
<p>This book is not intended to be a textbook, though it might well serve as one. It was conceived as a practical guide to success for CEOs, those who wish to be CEOs, and people such as public relations and investor relations professionals who support them. (p. xvi)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>How important are the lessons provided in the book? According to Scudder, the average tenure of a CEO is a mere three and a half years. And it’s estimated by some that 90 percent of a CEO’s job is communication. Yet CEOs are oftentimes the worst communicators in any organization, unable to connect with even their most important publics in meaningful ways. And so Scudder has developed a trademarked system called The Scudder Method™, built around helping CEOs solve both common and not-so-common communication challenges.</p>
<p>This model builds in part upon the route journalists use to communicate stories clearly. From starting points of taking in vast amounts of information and data, for example, reporters must be able to condense, simplify, and explain it to varied audiences. And this, Scudder maintains, is a method executives must learn to adopt if they want to be truly effective leaders. Instead of operating under the principle that an effective message is one the executive wants to make, the key to successful communication is for the executive to understand it “is not what you know or what you say; it’s what the other person takes away” (p. 9).</p>
<p>Thus, Scudder’s book provides practical advice on how to use his model in numerous settings. While much of the book is information that will not surprise most readers—such as the importance of custom and culture, word usage, and listening in any strong communication strategy—other parts would find practical application in preliminary discussions on public relations and its crucial function within any organizations.</p>
<p>The second part of the book is concerned with particular land mines and opportunities that exist within three crucial publics: investors, employees, and boards. But it was within discussion of other crucial publics, the mass media, that Scudder’s advice might be most valuable to beginning executives and high-level CEOs who still fail to appreciate the concomitance among organizations and outside media sources. Drawing on his skill as a broadcaster, Scudder provides simple but overlooked advice on how to prepare for interviews, how to frame messages, and how to find appropriate media trainers.</p>
<p>While nearly every “how to” communication book includes a section on handling crises, Scudder provides advice I’ve not seen before on how to handle communication during three crucial times: hostile takeovers, turnarounds, and testimony before government hearings. This section undoubtedly builds upon the executive training and crisis preparation Scudder has provided during the past two decades for clients such as the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, UPS, Pepsi-Cola, and Kraft.</p>
<p>Even though it’s not a traditional text, <italic>World Class Communication</italic> could be applied in other settings, such as in an executive training workshop or as a primer on CEO skills for an online or extended learning business course. And because each chapter concludes with a “Tips” list of bulleted advice, it would be a valuable read for business and organizational leaders who spend a fair amount of time in flight, especially as they wing their way to a board meeting in Omaha or a congressional hearing in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Of course reading <italic>World Class Communication</italic> is the easy part. Implementing its advice is a commitment only business and organizational leaders themselves can make.</p>
