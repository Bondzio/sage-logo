<abstract>
<p>Coal is the mainstay of electrical power generation in India. In this study, an experimental and theoretical assessment is made of the possibility of retrofitting an existing pulverized coal boiler for operation in oxy-coal mode. Experiments have been conducted using non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis for a typical Indian coal to assess its reactivity under simulated oxy-coal combustion. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of a tangentially fired, 210 MWe pulverized coal boiler of a typical Indian design have been carried out with a typical Indian coal composition to study the relative effect of oxy-coal mode operation on the flow and heat transfer characteristics within the boiler. A process flow diagram has been developed for a 662 MWt power plant to include a retrofitted boiler and CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration. It is concluded that a 70:30 volumetric mix of CO<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub> in the oxidizer composition will leave the essential features of the flow, temperature and heat transfer characteristics more or less unchanged, thus enabling retrofitting. An overall thermal efficiency loss of 11% is estimated for a retrofitted plant which delivers a flue gas which does not require chemical means of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration.</p>

<p>Coal-fired boiler systems generate more than 70% of the electric power generation in India and will continue to be the major source of power in future. Much (&gt;80%) of the recent upsurge and continuing demand for electricity in India is being met from coal-fired thermal power stations. Coal is a heterogeneous complex material that consists of a number of distinct organic (maceral) and inorganic (mineral) entities. Indian power station coals are generally high in ash content (&gt;40 wt%), and also feature relatively high proportion of inter-grown mineral matter besides inter-banded stone layers. Over the years, the indigenous Indian industry has developed the technology to burn these high ash coals to produce electrical power in a sustained manner. Due to the large reserves of coal, it is expected that the current pulverized coal (PC) boilers will continue to form the mainstay of electrical power generation for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>There is all-round appreciation of the effect of using hydrocarbon fuels for energy generation. In particular, the carbon dioxide generated as a result of combustion is identified as a major cause of global warming. Major efforts are being pursued to combat the rise of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration in the atmosphere. One of these is the sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> at the source itself. Coal-based utility boilers offer the best scope for this strategy as they are stationary and elaborate processes can be implemented in place to capture CO<sub>2</sub>. A number of carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes have been discussed in recent reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912459465">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912459465">2</xref></sup> Oxy-fuel combustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912459465">3</xref></sup> is one of the promising technologies for this. Here, oxygen, separated from air, is mixed with treated flue gas to form the oxidant mixture with which a coal is combusted to produce the thermal energy required for electrical power generation. The flue gas from oxy-coal combustion contains primarily CO<sub>2</sub> and steam and thus lends itself to easy CO<sub>2</sub> capture. While oxy-coal combustion facilitates CCS, it brings in significant changes in the combusting environment as the combustion is carried out in a predominantly CO<sub>2</sub> environment rather than in normal air. These include higher gas density and hence lower gas velocities, higher specific heat and different radiation properties of the gaseous mixture. A number of reviews of oxy-fuel technology discussing a variety of aspects have appeared in the recent literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912459465">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912459465">7</xref></sup> The presence of CO<sub>2</sub> in abundant quantities may influence the overall reactivity of coal chars which may be specific to the coal type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912459465">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912459465">10</xref></sup> The changes in the gaseous environment may have an effect on the flow and temperature characteristics within the boiler. Finally, oxy-coal combustion with CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration requires changes to the layout of the plant to account for additional thermal energy requirements for the auxiliary systems such as the air separation unit (ASU) and the CO<sub>2</sub> compression unit and the corresponding costs associated with these. Knowledge of these effects is essential to design boilers for oxy-coal combustion and to consider the retrofitting possibilities of existing boilers to operate in oxy-coal combustion mode so as to facilitate CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912459465">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912459465">14</xref></sup> For a country like India with a burgeoning demand for electricity, retrofitting existing boilers to implement carbon capture technology is an important and necessary condition to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the near future.</p>
<p>Against this background, we report on an investigation of the effect of modification of combusting environment on the processes occurring inside a PC-fired boiler with specific reference to the retrofitting of a boiler of Indian design operating on Indian coals. The study focuses on four aspects related to the option of retrofitting: (a) how the reactivity of Indian coals is changed under oxy-coal combustion, (b) how retrofitting affects the flow and heat transfer characteristics inside a boiler, (c) how the balance of plant is affected by a switch to oxy-coal mode of combustion and finally, (d) what energy penalty will have to be incurred for incorporating CCS. These aspects are investigated as follows. The reactivity of Indian coals, which typically have a large amount of ash and low sulphur (&lt;0.5%), under oxy-coal combustion conditions has been assessed by carrying out non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a simulated oxy-coal boiler environment. The flow and heat transfer in a retrofitted boiler operating in oxy-coal combustion mode have been studied through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a 210 MWe tangentially fired boiler. The changes to balance of plant and the energy penalty incurred have been studied through layout modifications and thermodynamic calculations of a retrofitted boiler and its auxiliary systems. Details of these studies and the results obtained are described below.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0957650912459465"><title>Reactivity studies of Indian coals in oxy-coal environment</title>
<p>Of interest in reactivity studies are the processes of devolatilization and char combustion of a coal particle inside the boiler. Both the extent and the rate of these processes depend on the temperature of the particle and are often estimated through TGA in which the mass loss of the particle (due to pyrolysis or char oxidation) at different temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650912459465">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912459465">17</xref></sup> is taken as a measure of the reactivity. While it does not simulate the consequences of high heating rates experienced by a coal particle during combustion in a furnace, TGA is a reliable and reproducible technique in which the effect of environment can be studied by combusting samples in a controlled environment. This equipment exposes a given mass of coal to a desired environment and records the instantaneous sample mass for a given temperature under a constant heating rate. The resultant burning profile is a plot of the rate of weight loss against sample temperature in a specific gaseous environment. The weight loss curve and the rate of weight loss curve can be used to determine the peaking temperature (the temperature at which the rate of combustion is maximum) and the weighted mean activation energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650912459465">15</xref></sup> can be deduced. The TGA used in this study is TG-50, Shimadzu make, which can go up to 1000 °C with a variable range of heating rate from 1 °C to 50 °C/min.<?twb?> The equipment has the provision for applying various gas ambiences while the sample is combusted. In this study, an Indian sub-bituminous coal, obtained from the Sonepur Bazari mine located on the eastern part of Raniganj mines, West Bengal, is used for analysis. It has an ash content of 38.4 wt% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912459465">Table 1</xref> for proximate and ultimate analysis) and a gross calorific value of 15.4 MJ/kg. Several samples were pulverized and sieved to −38 µm size and characterized for particle size distribution, proximate and ultimate parameters. Using TGA, these samples were subjected to pyrolysis in two different gaseous environments, namely, N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> and were also subjected to combustion in four different gaseous environments, namely, air and three molar mixtures of CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> in the ratio of 80:20, 60:40 and 40:60. The heating rate used in all the experiments was 0.167 °C/s and the maximum temperature was 1000 °C. The rate of gas flow for all experiments was kept constant at 0.66 dm<sup>3</sup>/s.

<p>The results obtained from these reactivity studies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912459465">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912459465">2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912459465">Figure 1</xref> shows the weight loss curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912459465">Figure 1(a)</xref>) and its derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912459465">Figure 1(b)</xref>), during pyrolysis of the coal in pure nitrogen and pure CO<sub>2</sub> environments. It can be seen that, as the temperature increases, the two curves deviate with a marked, earlier rate loss occurring in pure CO<sub>2</sub> environment resulting from the participation of the CO<sub>2</sub> in the coal gasification reaction, also known as the Boudouard reaction (C + CO<sub>2</sub> → 2CO), occurring between the coal (carbon) and CO<sub>2</sub> to produce carbon monoxide. This leads to additional weight loss during pyrolysis in CO<sub>2</sub> environment and the CO<sub>2</sub> curve, therefore, diverges from the N<sub>2</sub> curve. The point of deviation is different for each coal, thus showing possible sensitivity of the coal type to the oxy-coal combustion mode. However, it is known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912459465">18</xref></sup> that the coal gasification reaction with CO<sub>2</sub> is very slow (by a few orders of magnitude) compared to the main combustion reaction in typical boiler environments. Also, the pyrolysis of a coal particle occurs over a very short period; typically it is completed within a few tens of microseconds. Therefore, this high temperature deviation of the weight loss curve is not very relevant in practical boilers. One can then conclude that the devolatilization reaction of the coal is not very sensitive to the presence of large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the boiler and that it would be similar to that occurring in normal air combustion.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912459465">Figure 2</xref> shows the reactivity or the differential weight loss curve in air and in CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures of different molar ratios. Due to the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere, combustion reactions are enabled in these tests. It can be seen that as the oxygen concentration increases, the combustion reaction occurs faster (as indicated by the higher value of the negative peak of the differential weight loss curve) and at a lower temperature. It can be seen that the curves for the molar ratios 80:20 and 60:40 of CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> straddle the curve of air combustion. Thus, for the present coal, a molar mixture of 70:30 of CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> would come close to normal air combustion. These results are in agreement with other coals of Indian origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912459465">19</xref></sup> and other coals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912459465">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650912459465">20</xref></sup> One can, therefore, expect a 70:30 molar ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> to be ideal for the retrofitting of a boiler operating on Indian sub-bituminous coals to work in oxy-coal combustion mode. These results agree with the results from a 300 kW oxy-coal pilot plant reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912459465">10</xref></sup> showing that an oxygen concentration of 35% in the feed gas, the rest being recycled flue gas, produces flame characteristics which are equivalent to those in normal air combustion. Although the present experiments have been carried out only at low heating rates, and are therefore not directly extendable to boiler conditions (where the coal particle heating rates are very high), comparative studies with normal air combustion using the same coal and the same apparatus may be taken as an indication that a 70:30 molar mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> will give a reasonable equivalence in terms of coal reactivity. These are used as the basis for the simulation of a retrofitted boiler of typical Indian design.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0957650912459465"><title>CFD simulations of a 210 MWe boiler operating in oxy-coal mode</title>
<p>Comparative CFD calculations have been done for a tangentially-fired boiler of 210 MWe capacity working in normal air combustion mode and oxy-fuel combustion mode. The boiler is of a standard design typically used in Indian power plants and has primary, secondary and tertiary flow injections which are fired at a 15° downward angle of inclination. The simulations have been carried out using a commercial CFD code (ANSYS-CFX). The calculation methodology is rather well-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957650912459465">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957650912459465">23</xref></sup> and the general outline used in this study has been described in our earlier work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957650912459465">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957650912459465">24</xref></sup> Briefly, the numerical details are as follows. The fluid flow field was calculated using the SIMPLE approach and the standard <italic>k–e</italic> model was used to account for turbulence effects. The mixed-is-burnt model was used to characterize the gas phase combustion. A Lagrangian approach was used to model the movement of the coal particles; representative coal particles were tracked through the domain and their interaction with the continuous phase was calculated in each cell through which the particles passed. The single step devolatilization model of Badzioch and Hawksley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957650912459465">25</xref></sup> and the char oxidation model of Field et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957650912459465">26</xref></sup> were used to account for coal combustion. The domain was discretized using structured, non-uniform cells. The primary and the secondary air inlets were treated as boundaries where a normal velocity was specified while the outlet, located well after the gooseneck, was specified as a constant zero-gauge pressure boundary. The water wall condition of 673 K was used as a Dirichlet thermal boundary condition on the boiler walls. The total coal flow rate and the total primary and secondary air were distributed equally among all the burners at all the six elevations.</p>
<p>A typical sub-bituminous Indian coal with ultimate parameters shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912459465">Table 1</xref> was used as the representative coal in the CFD simulations. Although as discussed earlier, the intrinsic combustion kinetic parameters such as the activation energy, Arrhenius reaction rate constants, etc., are coal-specific and that these are affected by the environment, the assumption is made that these values are largely unaffected by the change of the nature of the oxidant from normal air to carbon dioxide-diluted oxygen. This assumption is supported by the following observations. First, it is known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912459465">9</xref></sup> that the devolatilization of coal is largely unaffected by the substitution of nitrogen with CO<sub>2</sub> in the oxidant. Second, char oxidation in PC boilers is governed mostly by diffusional resistance and not by intrinsic chemical kinetics because the chemical oxidation rate is very high at the high particle temperatures (∼1000 °C) normally encountered in these boilers. The diffusional resistance to oxygen transfer to the char particle depends on the effective diffusivity of the gaseous medium and is incorporated in the CFD calculation methodology. Thus, the kinetics of char combustion are effectively modelled. Further, in a typical PC boiler of Indian design, a large residence time is provided to account for the fact Indian coals have large ash content. It is expected that minor variations of combustion kinetics do not drastically alter the overall burnout pattern, especially for combustion in the CO<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2</sub> ratio of 70:30 which appears to produce air-equivalent flames.</p>
<p>Experiments with high ash coals in the ash content range 36–53 wt%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957650912459465">27</xref></sup> show that the temperature distributions, etc., in the boiler are largely unaffected by amount of ash present in the coal. Thus, the normal air combustion and oxy-coal combustion simulations have the same methodology of calculation, the same overall thermal output and the same fuel (coal) flow rate. They are different only in the oxidant characteristics in terms of both composition and flow rate. In the case of oxy-coal combustion, a higher oxygen volume fraction (of 30%) is used. As Indian boilers are operated at slightly sub-atmospheric conditions, air leakage occurs. Also, some nitrogen will be present in the oxygen supplied by the ASU. Therefore, a leakage of about 5 mol% N<sub>2</sub> has been considered in the overall composition of the oxidant for the oxy-coal case. Dry flue gas recirculation was assumed for modelling oxy-coal combustion in which the moisture in the flue gas was removed before recirculation. Thus, the oxidant for oxy-coal combustion consists of 30% mole fraction of O<sub>2</sub>, 65% mole fraction of pure (i.e. dry) CO<sub>2</sub> and 5% mole fraction of N<sub>2</sub>. The same ratio of coal to oxygen flow rate is maintained in the two simulations; however, the oxidant mass flow rate is different in the two cases. In oxy-coal combustion, the gaseous environment consists largely of CO<sub>2</sub> which is a radiatively participating medium; in normal air combustion, the main constituent is N<sub>2</sub> which has very little absorptivity. In view of this, the radiative heat transfer model has also been sensitized to the presence of participating media (in the form of CO<sub>2</sub>) in oxy-coal combustion using gas emissivity values calculated using the Hottel and Sarofim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957650912459465">28</xref></sup> curves.</p>
<p>The focus of these simulations was primarily on three factors which are important from the point of view of retrofitting: (a) the velocity field, (b) the temperature and the wall heat flux field and (c) the completeness of combustion. The comparison of the velocity field in normal air combustion and oxy-coal combustion is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912459465">Figure 3</xref> in the form of velocity contours on a vertical mid-plane. Compared to normal air combustion, there is a slight reduction in the mass flow rate of the oxidant in oxy-coal combustion and also a far higher increase in the molecular weight of the product gas mixture. Due to this, there is a considerable reduction in the average gas velocity in the radiant zone in oxy-coal combustion. However, the overall flow pattern created by the tangential firing leading to a low-velocity region in the central core is qualitatively similar in both cases. The predicted temperature contours are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912459465">Figure 4</xref>. While the core temperature in the mixing zone in normal air combustion is significantly lower, the gas temperature in the convective pass is almost similar in both cases. It appears that while the lower flow rate has a higher influence in the mixing zone leading to higher temperatures in the oxy-coal case, its higher specific heat capacity allows the gas temperature to get back to the air-equivalent case in the convective pass where the superheaters, reheaters and economizers are located. This ensures that there would be little disturbance to the heat exchanger systems if a normal air mode boiler were to be retrofitted to operate in the oxy-fuel combustion mode.

<fig id="fig4-0957650912459465" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Predicted temperature contours in the mid-vertical plane in normal air combustion (left) and oxy-coal combustion (right).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912459465-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The particle volatile release and the char oxidation profiles are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912459465">Figure 5(a) and (b)</xref>, respectively, for normal air and oxy-coal combustion modes. These show very little difference between the two combustion modes. Complete devolatilization takes place in the vicinity of the burners in both cases while near-complete oxidation of char takes place by the time the particles reach the gooseneck area. Examination of the numerical results shows that complete combustion of the coal takes place in both the boilers although there are differences in the particle trajectories which may be attributable to the lower velocities in the oxy-coal case. Finally, the wall heat flux distributions in normal air and oxy-coal mode are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912459465">Figure 6</xref>. Again, while there are differences, these are once again minor and the heat loss to the wall heat transfer in both cases is fairly similar.

<p>The above results show that the retrofitting of an Indian 210 MWe boiler operating in normal air mode to oxy-coal mode appears to be possible considering the thermal mapping within the boiler. The profiles in respect of velocity, temperature and heat flux distribution appear to be more or less comparable between normal air and 65–5–30 mol% combination of CO<sub>2</sub>–N<sub>2</sub>–O<sub>2</sub> in oxy-coal combustion mode. The reduction in mass flow rate and the modified thermophysical properties of the oxidant/product gas mixture in oxy-coal mode do cause some variations in the particle streamlines, volatile release, char oxidation and wall heat flux distribution. However, these variations are not significant enough to affect the overall boiler performance in respect of coal burn out, energy transfer and outlet flue gas temperature. If anything, the reduced flow velocities in the oxy-fuel boiler may result in less erosion, which is an important consideration for Indian boilers operating with high ash Indian coals.</p>

<p>The differences between a normal boiler and one operating in oxy-coal mode are best understood by comparing the two schematically as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912459465">Figure 7(a)</xref> for a conventional air combustion unit and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912459465">Figure 7(b)</xref> for a retrofitted oxy-coal unit operating on flue gas recycled system. In a normal air combustion plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912459465">Figure 7(a)</xref>), air is drawn from the atmosphere, preheated and is sent to the PC boiler where combustion with entrained coal particles occurs. Part of the thermal energy from the hot flue gases is recovered in the primary energy recovery systems (consisting of an evaporator, a superheater, a reheater and an economizer, which together produce the steam required to drive the low, intermediate and the high pressure (HP) turbines). The flue gases then flow through an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> and SO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> removal unit (as appropriate) and are finally fed to the stack. When the same boiler is retrofitted to burn in oxy-coal model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912459465">Figure 7(b)</xref>), additional units are required. An ASU is needed to separate oxygen from air, which is then mixed with part of the hot exhaust gases at a temperature of 340 °C as in the case study of Kakaras et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912459465">11</xref></sup> and is fed to the boiler. The flue gas generated in this study passes through the primary heat recovery system as in the case of the normal air combustion unit. The flue gases are then sent through a hot particulate removal/gas cleaning system. At the exit, a large portion of the flue is recycled back into the burner after mixing with pure oxygen from the ASU. The rest of the flue gas is sent through a flue gas conditioner where a significant amount of the moisture is removed. The remaining flue gas, now consisting primarily of CO<sub>2</sub>, is sent for compression, sequestration and storage.

<sec id="sec6-0957650912459465"><title>Thermodynamic analysis of the oxy-coal plants</title>
<p>Thermodynamic analysis leading to the evaluation of the flame temperature and the boiler inlet and exit concentrations for two cases has been carried out using a MATLAB code using the methodology outlined in Seepana and Jayanti.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912459465">12</xref></sup> The thermodynamic calculations were based on the assumption of a steady-state operation at the required thermal loading. Each component of the layout was treated as a control volume and mass and energy balance conditions were imposed on it. For reference, a nominally 662 MWt sub-critical pulverized, tangentially-fired coal boiler using a typical high ash coal of Indian origin with proximate and ultimate properties as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912459465">Table 1</xref> is considered. In these calculations, an oxygen purity of 99% was assumed from the ASU, the rest being N<sub>2</sub>. The ash was treated as 75% fly ash and 25% bottom ash, which are typical values for PC boilers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912459465">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957650912459465">29</xref></sup> This meant that 75% of the ash in the incoming coal was carried away by the flue gas and would participate in the heat exchanger process. Finally, since PC boilers are often operated at slightly sub-atmospheric pressures, air leakage into the boiler is a problem. In this study, an air leak, at the rate of 0.01 kg/kg of flue gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912459465">11</xref></sup> was assumed. The overall stoichiometric coefficient (i.e. the ratio of air supplied to that required for complete combustion as per stoichiometry), including the oxygen available in the fuel and in the recirculated flue gases, was maintained at value of 1.07 for oxy-coal combustion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912459465">11</xref></sup> The recirculation rate of the flue gases (enriched or otherwise) was calculated subject to the adiabatic flame temperature being 1710 °C for fixed fuel composition, flow rate and temperatures of the oxidant and recirculation streams. This also fixed the composition of the gases at the inlet and at the outlet. It may be noted that this condition would require higher amount of excess oxygen in the case of an air-fired plant.</p>
<p>The detailed layouts of the two systems, namely, a conventional power plant and an oxy-coal power plant, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912459465">Figure 8(a) and (b)</xref>, respectively. It can be seen that each of them has a three-stage steam extraction/reheating systems and a three-stage HP (at a feed pressure of 190.6 bar), medium pressure (MP; at a feed pressure of 31.8 bar) and low pressure (LP; at a feed pressure of 5.18 bar) turbine system for electrical power generation. Steam is also bled from each turbine for reheating or feedwater heating. In the retrofitted plant, the same layout of the thermal connections among the combustor/turbines and feedwater heaters is maintained so as to minimize alterations related to retrofitting. In addition, the ASU and the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration unit have been thermally integrated into the system. It may also be noted that a hot ESP has been used to remove the particulates from the recycled gas and a wet ESP is used for the stream going into the sequestration unit. Thermodynamic calculations, resulting in the flow rates and compositions of the flue gases at the inlet and the exit of the boiler, turbines, condenser, etc., have been carried out for the case of a coal feed rate of 43 kg/s, which corresponds to a boiler rating of 662 MWt. For normal air combustion, it is assumed that the air enters the boiler at a preheat of 270 °C, while the oxidant enters the oxy-coal boiler at a preheated to 340 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912459465">11</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig8-0957650912459465" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Detailed layouts of (a) conventional and (b) a retrofitted flue gas recycled coal power plant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912459465-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The flow rates and the thermodynamic conditions of the various streams for the air-fired case and the oxy-coal firing case are given in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650912459465">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912459465">3</xref>, respectively. From these, it is possible to determine the electrical power produced by the turbines and the electrical power consumed by various auxiliary components. The energy losses occurring during various processes are estimated (75% isentropic efficiency for pumps and fans and 85% for compressor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912459465">12</xref></sup>) and are deducted from the total energy to calculate the energy efficiency. The results of the net efficiency calculations for the two cases have been summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0957650912459465">Table 4</xref>. In the case of conventional air-fired plants, the gross power production, 270.9 MWe, is slightly lower than that for the optimized CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched recycling plant (273.5 MWe). This is because the sensible heat in the exhaust gas (which is at the considerable temperature of ∼150 °C) is let out into the atmosphere in the normal air case, whereas much of it is recycled back to the boiler in the oxy-coal combustion mode. This results in the slightly higher gross thermal efficiency 41.30% for the oxy-coal plant compared to the value of 40.91% for the air-fired unit. However, the power consumption for the auxiliary units, namely, the ASU and for the CO<sub>2</sub> compression storage unit, is very high and amounts to nearly 18% and 10%, respectively, of the total power produced. As a result, the net thermal efficiency of the retrofitted oxy-coal plant reduces to 27% which is about 11% less than that of the air-fired unit. That is, the retrofitting a coal-fired power plant to work in oxy-coal mode with CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration incurs an energy penalty of ∼11% in the net thermal efficiency which matches closely with the findings reported in the recent literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912459465">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957650912459465">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957650912459465">31</xref></sup> The energy penalty can be reduced somewhat by optimizing the layout or using a higher grade coal.

<p>In this study, an experimental and theoretical assessment is made for the possibility of retrofitting an existing PC boiler for operation in oxy-coal mode. The following conclusions can be drawn from this study.
<list id="list1-0957650912459465" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The intrinsic reactivity of the coal devolatilization and char oxidation of a typical high ash Indian coal is not altered significantly by the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>, rather than N<sub>2</sub>, as the main diluent in the oxidant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>CFD simulations, sensitized to changes in radiative heat transfer and mass-transfer controlled char oxidation rates in oxy-coal combustion, of a 210 MWe PC boiler do not show significant differences in the burnout and heat transfer characteristics kinetics between air firing and oxy-coal firing. Thus, existing boilers can be made to work in oxy-coal combustion mode without requiring significant changes in the boiler layout.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The balance of plant requires addition of new components in the form of an ASU, a CO<sub>2</sub> compression and disposal unit, and a hot ESP, etc.; however, these can be integrated into the existing set of steam generators, turbines and feedwater heaters.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, there is a significant penalty, in the form of an 11% drop in the net thermal efficiency, when an air-fired plant is retrofitted to operate in a near zero-CO<sub>2</sub> emission mode.</p></list-item>
