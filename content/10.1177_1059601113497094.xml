<abstract>
<p>Firms have many reasons to employ ethnic minorities or refrain from employing them. Management scholars focusing on workplace diversity have made several attempts to describe these reasons, but a theoretically grounded framework is still missing. This article outlines a novel approach to this topic based on resource dependence theory. We propose a typology of diversity strategies defined by the kind of critical resources that ethnic minorities provide to organizations. Focusing on business logic, the typology offers many applications for future research on antecedents and consequences of the strategies, a diverse competence pool, and power relations. We suggest resource dependence theory as a fruitful explanatory approach to diversity and describe practical implications for different actors.</p>

<p>Current models of diversity in organizations are for the most part normative rather than explanatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1059601113497094">Yang &amp; Konrad, 2011</xref>). That is, they typically indicate how organizations should react to the challenges associated with sociodemographically diverse work teams or with a diverse workforce as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601113497094">Cox, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601113497094">Shen, Chanda, D’Netto, &amp; Monga, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601113497094">D. A. Thomas &amp; Ely, 1996</xref>). The empirical literature provides a wide variety of reasons why organizations aim at leveraging diversity, thereby also highlighting the relationship of diversity with business goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601113497094">Janssens &amp; Zanoni, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601113497094">MacKenzie &amp; Forde, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113497094">Moriarty, Wickham, Krings, Salamonska, &amp; Bobek, 2012</xref>). However, a theoretically grounded and coherent framework that explains why organizations pursue different diversity strategies is still missing.</p>
<p>This article provides such a framework. Focusing on ethnic minorities as one distinctive sociodemographic group, it proposes a typology of diversity strategies that categorizes organizations’ business rationales to employ hitherto underrepresented groups. Theoretically, the framework is based on resource dependence theory as explicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601113497094">Pfeffer and Salancik (1978)</xref>. This well-established organizational theory posits that companies strive to control critical resources to survive. In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601113497094">Fields, Goodman, and Blum (2005)</xref>, we argue that organizations employ ethnic minorities to obtain critical resources. This basic argument allows us to define different organizational diversity strategies according to the kind of critical resources to be obtained.</p>
<p>Our framework organizes previous models and empirical findings in the fields of research on diversity, labor markets, and strategic human resource management. Given these literatures, we identify ethnic minorities’ potentially critical resources that imply different diversity strategies. With our novel typology of diversity strategies, we contribute to a better theoretical grounding of diversity research (as requested, e.g., by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1059601113497094">Yang &amp; Konrad, 2011</xref>). The article enhances our understanding of firms’ strategic reasons that drive staffing decisions and that result in chances for and barriers to the inclusion of ethnic minorities. In contrast to the mainly sociopsychologically informed diversity literature that focuses on individual attitudes and behaviors to explain minorities’ chances or disadvantages in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601113497094">Shore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1059601113497094">Zanoni, Janssens, Benschop, &amp; Nkomo, 2010</xref>), our framework reconceptualizes chances and inequalities within the business logic. Furthermore, this article contributes to management research in that it suggests an avenue linking the implications of workplace diversity to strategic human resource management. In both regards, we demonstrate the fruitfulness of resource dependence theory to theoretically ground the business case for diversity.</p>
<p>The question examined in this article also has a great deal of empirical relevance. According to statistics from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601113497094">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2013)</xref>, ethnic minorities represent an important part of the workforce worldwide. Ongoing labor migration enhances ethnic diversity, thereby enriching domestic labor forces by low-skilled workers and highly skilled professionals. At the same time, pertinent labor and skill shortages make business companies increasingly dependent on ethnic minority employees. Thus, many countries initiated migration policies to facilitate companies’ recruitment of people from abroad; examples include H1-B visas in the United States, Germany’s Green Card for information technology specialists, and the United Kingdom’s migrant worker schemes. In addition, rising workforce diversity has given new sociopolitical impetus to the enhancement of equal opportunities at work and the inclusion of ethnic minorities in equal opportunity mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601113497094">Klarsfeld, 2010</xref>). Yet still, compared to ethnic majorities, ethnic minorities are more often employed at a level that is below their qualifications, overrepresented in low-skilled work, underrepresented in management positions, and more often faced with unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601113497094">European Commission, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601113497094">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, the context in which decisions on organizational diversity strategies take place is quite complex, and so are the decision makers’ rationales. In the following, we consider the variety of reasons for leveraging ethnic diversity in organizations. We integrate these reasons into one framework that grounds on an overall coherent theoretical reasoning according to the business logic of organizations.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059601113497094">
<title>Theoretical and Empirical Background</title>
<p>The first step in developing our typology of diversity strategies is to introduce the core ideas of resource dependence theory. Second, we analyze previous theoretical models of organizational responses to the diversity challenge and related empirical findings through the lens of this theory.</p>
<sec id="section2-1059601113497094">
<title>Resource Dependence Theory</title>
<p>According to resource dependence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601113497094">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>), the quest to accrue critical resources drives organizational strategies. Resources are critical if they are essential for an organization’s survival, if they are rare, and if their accrual is uncertain. Examples include money, know-how, and technology, as well as individual behaviors, capabilities, and social networks. Organizations are dependent on the actors who control critical resources, that is, who either have access to resources or possess critical resources themselves. Consequently, organizational strategies aim at managing such resource dependencies and reducing them. Hence, decision makers such as top human resources managers and CEOs base their strategic staffing decisions on assessments regarding which critical resources will be gained through the employment of particular individuals. A central assumption of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601113497094">Pfeffer and Salancik (1978)</xref> is that behavior of individuals and groups is constrained, for instance, by cognitive capacities or social influences. Thus, managers’ subjective perceptions and interpretations also influence organizational strategies, perhaps more than the “objective” criticality of resources.</p>
<p>Although resource dependence theory is mainly applied in research into mergers and acquisitions, interfirm cooperation, and board composition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601113497094">Hillman, Withers, &amp; Collins, 2009</xref>, for a review), several studies demonstrate its fruitfulness for the analysis of human resource practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601113497094">Fields et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601113497094">Nienhüser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601113497094">Taylor, Beechler, &amp; Napier, 1996</xref>). Resource dependence theory is especially useful for our purposes because it facilitates the identification of different resources that ethnic minorities control and that may be critical for organizational success. Additionally, it points to the decisive role of organizational decision makers’ subjective perceptions and beliefs in shaping management strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601113497094">Garbuio, King, &amp; Lovallo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To further specify the resource dependence perspective as it regards human resource management, we draw on literature in the field of strategic human resource management. This literature refers to the design and implementation of human resource policies and practices as a means to proactively cope with strategic challenges. Analyses focus on the contribution of human resource strategies to a firm’s sustained competitive advantage. The following three aspects are regarded as crucial for this goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601113497094">Boxall &amp; Purcell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601113497094">Dyer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1059601113497094">Wright &amp; McMahan, 2011</xref>): (a) an optimal combination of individual competences, (b) a fair cost for obtaining performance, and (c) human resource policies and practices that are legitimated by external and internal stakeholders. Consequently, in our framework, we consider critical resources that relate to these three aspects.</p>
<p>In general, the strategic human resource management literature has remained relatively silent regarding the potential competitive advantage through workforce diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601113497094">Lepak &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>). Notable exceptions are the studies by Richard and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601113497094">Richard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601113497094">Richard, McMillan, Chadwick, &amp; Dwyer, 2003</xref>). They show that leveraging ethnic diversity helps to compose a competence pool in such a way that it is valuable, rare, and difficult to imitate.</p>
<p>Close to our approach is a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601113497094">Fields et al. (2005)</xref>, who examined the presence of minorities—especially Black employees—in different hierarchical positions in private sector companies against the background of resource dependence theory. The authors argued that organizations employ minorities if management is dependent on them. Dependence arises from difficulties in attracting and retaining employees, a growth in the number of employees that a firm needs, and a high fraction of professional and technical jobs within the firm.</p>
<p>While their empirical analysis supports these theoretical considerations and while their organization-level approach proves to be very fruitful, the notion of resource dependence needs further clarification for our purposes. Particularly, a differentiation of critical resources that ethnic minorities might control is needed, along with an elaboration of what kind of resources attributed to ethnic minorities implies which staffing strategy. A shortcoming of the approach by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601113497094">Fields et al. (2005)</xref> relates to the question of why organizations refrain from recruiting minorities. The authors concentrated on mechanisms of reluctance, such as discrimination against particular social groups, stereotyped job holder schemas, similarity-attraction processes, and social identity processes. In contrast, while acknowledging the existence of these mechanisms, we additionally propose that this reluctance can be interpreted as an assumed economic necessity to reduce resource dependencies.</p>
<p>Against this background, the rationale for our typology of diversity strategies is as follows. Our main question is why ethnic minorities are employed in organizations or why organizations refrain from employing them. We posit that the employment of ethnic minorities serves to reduce dependencies on critical resources. Relevant organizational actors choose the diversity strategy that best ensures the accrual of critical resources in their view. Which strategy is evaluated to be the most functional depends on the appraisal of resources—that is, on the question of which particular resources organizational decision makers regard as critical and scarce in their organization or its environment.</p>

<title>Reasons to Employ Ethnic Minorities: Previous Models and Findings</title>
<p>Previous research on how organizations treat the employment of ethnic minorities is mainly located in the area of diversity and diversity management, where race, ethnicity, and nationality count as core diversity dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601113497094">Proudford &amp; Nkomo, 2006</xref>). Further relevant literature strands include ethnic entrepreneurship and career research as well as labor migration and labor market literature.</p>
<p>The diversity literature provides several approaches that conceptualize the range of employers’ responses to diversity. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601113497094">Table 1</xref> summarizes these approaches and outlines their similarities and differences with regard to their theoretical and empirical bases. These approaches also inform the typology that we introduce in the remainder of this article.</p>

</table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>The earliest approach is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601113497094">Cox (1993)</xref>, which theoretically draws on cultural adaptation. In work based on insights into early experiences of U.S. companies with diversity initiatives, he discusses organizational models identified as <italic>monolithic, plural</italic>, and <italic>multicultural</italic>. While Cox explains an organization’s response to diversity by the potential of its culture to integrate diversity, business rationales additionally serve as arguments for the benefits of diversity and cultural change. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1059601113497094">R. R. Thomas (1995)</xref> discerns managerial action options that range from <italic>excluding diversity</italic> to <italic>fostering mutual adaptation and cultural change</italic>. He offers no explicit theoretical rationale that explains the choice of different managerial actions.</p>
<p>In their seminal contributions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601113497094">D. A. Thomas and Ely (1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601113497094">Ely &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>) identify three managerial perspectives on diversity—namely, <italic>discrimination and fairness, access and legitimacy</italic>, and <italic>integration and learning</italic>. Case studies in three U.S. firms that direct their services to communities of color form the empirical basis. The authors’ theoretical reasoning refers to the quality of collaboration in diverse teams; yet, they do not provide a coherent theoretical explanation of why the three managerial perspectives on diversity emerge. Whereas managers’ adoption of an antidiscrimination perspective is explained by a moral impetus, the two other perspectives are explained by different business rationales. As signaled by the perspectives’ labels, one rationale refers to organizations’ quest for access to customer bases and stakeholder legitimacy. The other rationale emphasizes the improvement of processes and a quest for organizational learning.</p>
<p>Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601113497094">Oliver’s (1991)</xref> analysis of corporate strategies and institutional processes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601113497094">Dass and Parker (1999)</xref> link three organizational strategic responses to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601113497094">D. A. Thomas and Ely’s (1996)</xref> perspectives: <italic>defensive, accommodative</italic>, and <italic>proactive</italic>. Furthermore, they add the perspective <italic>resistance</italic> and the corresponding strategic response <italic>reactive</italic>. In comparison to the former approaches, Dass and Parker’s is the first that provides a coherent theoretical rationale. Organizational responses to diversity are conceptualized as a consequence of institutional pressures. However, the identified logics that drive these responses strongly vary in quality—from the fearful protection of the status quo to good legal compliance and then to maximizing efficiency and effectivity.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601113497094">Benschop (2001)</xref> identifies a spectrum of organizational reactions to diversity that is marked by the poles <italic>prejudice</italic> and <italic>pride</italic> against the background of two company case studies conducted in the Netherlands. The author grounds the analysis in a strategic human resource management framework that relates workplace diversity to performance impacts. Within this framework, she explains the variance of organizational responses to diversity by psychological mechanisms rather than by business rationales.</p>
<p>In sum, the approaches condensed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601113497094">Table 1</xref> constitute the possible spectrum of organizations’ responses to the diversity challenge; yet, they do not provide a coherent theoretical explanation of why organizations respond in certain ways. At best, they give selective explanations. In contrast, our typology of diversity strategies grounds on a coherent theoretical rationale that focuses on the business logic of organizations and explains the choice of diversity strategies by resource dependencies. To specify our framework, we draw on the following literature strands.</p>
<p>Diversity literature as well as labor migration studies provide insights into the resources that ethnic minorities may control. Proponents of diversity management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601113497094">Cox, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601113497094">Cox &amp; Blake, 1991</xref>) argue for the business case for ethnic diversity due to better information, increased creativity and understanding of different ethnicities or cultures, and different sets of experiences and views of the world. However, while some studies show that ethnically diverse teams work more efficiently compared to homogeneous teams (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601113497094">McLeod, Lobel, &amp; Cox, 1996</xref>), others reveal the contrary (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601113497094">Jackson &amp; Joshi, 2004</xref>). Altogether, research remains inconclusive about the outcomes of ethnic diversity. But scholars agree on the importance of a favorable context, such as positive diversity climate and effective diversity management practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601113497094">Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, &amp; Gilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601113497094">Shore et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Related literature strands refer to ethnic labor capacities. Literature on ethnic entrepreneurship highlights the importance of so-called ethnic resources of self-employed ethnic minorities, particularly their cultural bonds and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113497094">Aldrich &amp; Waldinger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601113497094">Lemes, Almeida, &amp; Hormiga, 2010</xref>). All sizes of ethnic businesses, ranging from single shopkeepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1059601113497094">Zimmer &amp; Aldrich, 1987</xref>) to large, publicly owned information technology firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601113497094">Ndofor &amp; Priem, 2011</xref>), may benefit from such ethnic resources. Ethnic entrepreneurs either possess these resources themselves or have easy access to them. Also, literature on the career experiences and prospects of highly skilled migrants points to the importance of ethnic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601113497094">Al Ariss, Koall, Özbilgin, &amp; Suutari, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601113497094">Cohen, Arnold, &amp; O’Neill, 2011</xref>). This literature also discusses the structural barriers to deploying these resources. For instance, legal regulations may restrict employers’ decisions to recruit and promote ethnic minorities, due to the nonapproval of formal qualifications acquired in foreign countries or refusal of work permits. In addition, employers may lack incentives to leverage ethnic diversity, as in the case of weak equal opportunity legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601113497094">Al Ariss, Vassilopoulou, Özbilgin, &amp; Game, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601113497094">Kamenou, Netto, &amp; Fearfull, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Labor migration and labor market research provides further evidence on employers’ responses to increasing ethnic workforce diversity. The studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601113497094">Bauder (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113497094">Dench, Hurstfile, Hill, and Akroyd (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601113497094">MacKenzie and Forde (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601113497094">Rodriguez (2004)</xref> reveal the following reasons to employ ethnic minorities: (a) compliance with equal opportunity requirements, (b) response to labor and specific skills shortages, and (c) labor cost reduction. This literature also points to employers’ discriminatory practices against ethnic minorities, in particular regarding recruitment and pay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601113497094">Bertrand &amp; Mullainathan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601113497094">Fang &amp; Heywood, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Developing the Typology of Diversity Strategies</title>
<p>We should begin by clarifying the phrase “diversity strategy focused on ethnic minorities.” Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601113497094">Boxall and Purcell (2000)</xref>, we adopt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601113497094">Dyer’s (1984)</xref> foundational definition of an organizational human resource strategy as “the pattern that emerges from a stream of important decisions about the management of human resources, especially those decisions that indicate management’s major goals and the means that are (or will be) used to pursue them” (p. 159). In this article, we focus on the “pattern of strategic choices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601113497094">Boxall &amp; Purcell, 2000</xref>, p. 184) made about the employment of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>In the next steps, we develop the typology of diversity strategies. Given previous findings in the literature, we first classify resources that ethnic minorities may provide to organizations; then, we use the resulting categorization of resources to define five diversity strategies.</p>
<sec id="section5-1059601113497094">
<title>Critical Resources Obtainable Through Ethnic Minority Employees</title>
<p>What exactly are the critical resources to be gained by the employment of ethnic minorities? Literature on labor market inequality shows that ethnic minorities have less access to resources than ethnic majorities. However, even seemingly powerless ethnic minority employees can control critical resources in the sense of resource dependence theory. Note that the resources that we detail in the following are potentially controlled by ethnic minorities, since this social group is heterogeneous regarding competences and other characteristics. In addition, whether organizational decision makers regard particular resources as critical and recognize that ethnic minorities control these resources depends on the decision makers’ subjective assessments.</p>
<sec id="section6-1059601113497094">
<title>Categories of obtainable resources</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601113497094">Figure 1</xref> presents the potentially critical resources that organizations can obtain through the employment of ethnic minorities. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601113497094">Pfeffer and Salancik (1978)</xref>, we distinguish the resources by their origins. We differentiate between potentially critical resources immediately controlled by ethnic minority individuals and critical resources controlled by other providers to which ethnic minority employees facilitate access. Using this basic distinction, we summarize and specify categories of resources discussed in the extant literature, thereby concentrating on resources that are potentially interesting in the eyes of organizational decision makers. Following the logic of resource dependence theory, resources that are beyond the interest of the employing organization are neglected (e.g., competences or other attributes of ethnic minorities).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1059601113497094-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>With regard to resources immediately controlled by ethnic minorities, we discern four categories of resources, as displayed in the matrix at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601113497094">Figure 1</xref>. The two matrix dimensions relate to job requirements. We chose them since all lines of reasoning prevalent in the literature can be traced back to one or both of these two core dimensions. While the horizontal dimension refers to the degree to which an individual’s ethnic background is relevant for fulfilling specific job tasks, the vertical dimension considers the relevance of particular competences. For simplicity reasons, we consider the two rough values “low relevance” and “high relevance” for the two dimensions. Combining the two dimensions yields the four resource categories: <italic>competences related to an ethnic background, competences not related to an ethnic background, mere labor</italic>, and <italic>ethnic background itself</italic>. In the following paragraphs we detail these four categories of immediately controlled resources as well as those of resources to which ethnic minority employees potentially facilitate access (displayed at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601113497094">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1059601113497094">
<title>Competences related to an ethnic (minority) background</title>
<p>Organizations may employ ethnic minorities because of their particular knowledge, skills, and abilities. For example, foreign-language skills related to ethnic backgrounds are valuable to firms with foreign customer bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113497094">Dench et al., 2006</xref>), to small ethnic businesses (e.g., Asian music or herb stores in Western countries; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601113497094">Rodriguez, 2004</xref>), and to bigger companies that direct their products and services to ethnic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601113497094">Ndofor &amp; Priem, 2011</xref>) or conduct transnational businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601113497094">Lemes et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, related cultural knowledge and skills facilitate rapport with clients with similar backgrounds, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601113497094">Ely and Thomas (2001)</xref> observe for U.S. law offices. With regard to service companies in Belgium, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601113497094">Janssens and Zanoni (2005)</xref> point out that the delivery of diversity-customized services designed to satisfy customers’ culture- or language-specific needs requires parallel competences. Examples are hospitals with ethnic minority patients and call centers with international clients.</p>
<p>Closely related to these competences are the personal contacts and social networks of ethnic minority individuals and their ability to collaborate, which qualifies them as special “boundary spanners.” Literature on ethnic entrepreneurship shows that ethnic bonds and networks are particularly important for founding and running a business—in particular if ethnic entrepreneurs focus on an ethnic community as the target market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601113497094">Ndofor &amp; Priem, 2011</xref>) or engage in transnational operations with their home countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601113497094">Lemes et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601113497094">Al Ariss and Syed (2011)</xref> raise similar arguments. They demonstrate how highly skilled Lebanese immigrants in France use their economic, cultural, and social capital in their professional career. With regard to firms with international operations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1059601113497094">Williams (2007)</xref> highlights the usefulness of immigrants’ so-called encultured knowledge—that is, a deep understanding of how firms operate in their countries of origin. Thus, competences related to an ethnic background can be regarded as an important factor for “overcoming the liability of foreignness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1059601113497094">Zaheer, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the ethnically diverse composition of work teams can increase problem solving, creativity, and innovation via individually different perspectives and approaches to job tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601113497094">Kossek, Lobel, &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601113497094">McLeod et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601113497094">Richard, 2000</xref>). These work team characteristics are of high value for organizations that aim at organizational change and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601113497094">Ely &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>) or pursue an innovation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601113497094">Richard et al., 2003</xref>). Especially in global teams or networks, such “cultural precepts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601113497094">Janssens &amp; Brett, 2006</xref>, p. 131)—that is, encultured norms guiding thinking and action—facilitate creative and innovative problem solutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1059601113497094">
<title>Competences not related to an ethnic background</title>
<p>Ethnic minorities’ professional skills can be critical resources. This is mainly the case when organizations face shortages in the labor market, which typically holds for the construction sector, finance, and accountancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113497094">Dench et al., 2006</xref>). These employers purely strive to hire the best-qualified applicants regardless of ethnicity, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601113497094">Janssens and Zanoni (2005)</xref> demonstrate for profession-customized services in a technical drawing company. While this argument applies especially to highly skilled employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601113497094">Al Ariss, Vassilopoulou, et al., 2012</xref>), times of economic growth tend to coincide with lower-skilled labor scarceness, which typically leads organizations to recruit ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113497094">Moriarty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601113497094">Ogbonna &amp; Harris, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059601113497094">
<title>Mere labor</title>
<p>According to the literature, the most prominent reasons to employ ethnic minorities are low labor costs and a supposed “right attitude to work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113497094">Dench et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601113497094">MacKenzie &amp; Forde, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601113497094">Rodriguez, 2004</xref>). Often, ethnic minorities are hired under job conditions unattractive to others, including low wages, poor career prospects, and low reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601113497094">Bonacich, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601113497094">Ogbonna &amp; Harris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601113497094">Rafferty, 2012</xref>). Employers may also profit from smaller social security duties and ethnic minorities’ lower bargaining power, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601113497094">Fellini, Ferro, and Fullin (2007)</xref> show for temporal assignments in the European construction sector and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601113497094">Soltani (2010)</xref> does for long-term employment in Iranian organizations. The “good worker” argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601113497094">MacKenzie &amp; Forde, 2009</xref>) also resonates in the case studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601113497094">Janssens and Zanoni (2005)</xref>. They reveal that firms prefer to staff low-wage routine jobs with low-skilled ethnic minority women because of their presumed high adaptability and flexibility. In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1059601113497094">Zanoni and Janssens (2004)</xref> point out that human resource managers praise ethnic staff diversity, particularly referring to the availability and compliance of ethnic minority employees. That is, while the willingness to do a job that nobody else wants might not appear as a critical resource (especially in comparison with particular professional competences), ethnic minorities can contribute to an organization’s cost effectiveness through their (assumed) higher flexibility and lower career aspirations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059601113497094">
<title>Ethnic background itself</title>
<p>The symbolic effects of ethnic minority employees on internal and external stakeholders can be a critical resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601113497094">Benschop, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601113497094">Kossek et al., 2006</xref>). Regarding internal stakeholders, empirical studies have typically shown negative effects of ethnic diversity on social integration and communication as well as increased conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601113497094">Mathieu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601113497094">Shore et al., 2009</xref>); yet, some studies show that context and time matter. An ongoing collaboration and a perceived openness of team members to diversity diminish the detrimental effects of actual and perceived diversity and can contribute to higher work group cohesion and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601113497094">Harrison, Price, Gavin, &amp; Florey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601113497094">Hobman, Bordia, &amp; Gallois, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601113497094">Van Dick, Van Knippenberg, Hägele, Guillaume, &amp; Brodbeck, 2008</xref>). Employees’ perception of top management and nonmanagement diversity may also drive their perception of corporate performance, which in turn enhances their motivation and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601113497094">Allen, Dawson, Wheatley, &amp; White, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To external stakeholders, the visible presence of ethnic minority employees in corporate brochures and on websites, for instance, signals compliance with equal opportunity and diversity principles. Such visibility positively affects an organization’s public image and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601113497094">Roberson &amp; Park, 2007</xref>). Particularly, this aspect has been highlighted in research on racial and ethnic diversity in corporate boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601113497094">Singh, 2007</xref>). Ethnic minorities in visible positions may also signal an organization’s internationality. For instance, the British employers studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113497094">Dench et al. (2006)</xref> attached importance to the point “that staff reflected their range of international customers” (p. 5). Additionally, ethnic minority employees can signal the authenticity of products and services, as in the case of Asians working in a Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>To sum up, the critical resources attributed to ethnic minorities give strategic reason to employ them. Organizations can reduce dependencies and respond to the quest for competencies, cost-effectiveness, and legitimacy. As a result, ethnic workplace diversity enables the accrual of further resources that other actors control, as depicted at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601113497094">Figure 1</xref> and detailed in the following paragraphs.</p>

<title>Labor market resources</title>
<p>Employing ethnic minorities contributes to the positive image of being an employer that obeys fairness dictates and discrimination prohibitions. This signal, as well as an image of internationality, can attract and retain qualified personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601113497094">Benschop, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601113497094">Newburry, Gardberg, &amp; Belkin, 2006</xref>). These processes may in turn further leverage workplace diversity, as, according to empirical findings, ethnic minorities judge employers with a diversity philosophy as attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601113497094">Avery, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601113497094">Ng &amp; Burke, 2005</xref>). In addition, ethnic minority employees often attract ethnic minority applicants via network recruiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601113497094">Benschop, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601113497094">Rodriguez, 2004</xref>). Also, the internal labor market provides critical resources that can be accrued through the employment of ethnic minorities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601113497094">Rodriguez (2004)</xref> demonstrates how the compatriot bonds among Mexican immigrants in U.S. bakeries led to high performance due to beneficial cooperation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601113497094">Konrad and Linnehan (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601113497094">Benschop (2001)</xref> reveal positive motivational and performance effects resulting from the mere presence of ethnic minorities in management positions.</p>

In addition, private or governmental clients prefer suppliers that employ ethnic minorities, for three reasons: They may value employees’ visible ethnic backgrounds first as a sign of product authenticity or second an organization’s internationality; third, ethnic minorities’ employment addresses concerns that fairness dictates and discrimination prohibitions will be obeyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1059601113497094">Worthington, Ram, Boyal, &amp; Shah, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Supply market resources</title>
<p>Since material and nonmaterial basic resources often are critical to organizations, the selection of suppliers and the management of the buyer-seller relationship are crucial. Employing ethnic minorities in the purchasing function can support purchasing strategies and practices—particularly if organizations engage in supplier diversity initiatives and strive to expand purchase relationships with ethnic minority businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601113497094">Theodorakopoulos, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1059601113497094">Worthington et al., 2008</xref>). For example, ethnic minority employees’ competences (a) facilitate access to domestic ethnic minority suppliers through networks and contacts and (b) enhance communication and collaboration with suppliers’ ethnic minority delivery staff through language and cultural skills. The same competences can be regarded as critical resources in the context of global sourcing, as cultural sensitivity and knowledge are important factors for building solid relationships to foreign suppliers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601113497094">Skarmeas &amp; Robson, 2008</xref>).

<p>As displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref>, we characterize the five diversity strategies as each exhibiting a specific profile of resource criticality, according to our literature analysis. While we assume that the quest to accrue resources from different sources—the labor market, the consumer market, and so on—is common to all five diversity strategies, the choice of a particular strategy depends on the degree of criticality that decision makers attribute to resources that are immediately controlled by ethnic minority employees.</p>
<p>One way to define diversity strategies is to assign one strategy to each of the four resource categories. However, previous research and our theoretical considerations suggest that, for the most part, a combination of two or more resource categories is necessary to contribute to organizations’ strategic goals. Accordingly, we take into account that a diversity strategy can be related to more than one resource category. In addition, organizational decision makers may regard none of the resources controlled by ethnic minorities as critical. Hence, including this nonoption, the four resource categories translate into five diversity strategies. In the following text, we describe the five strategies.</p>
<sec id="section17-1059601113497094">
<title>Exclusion</title>
<p>The <italic>exclusion</italic> diversity strategy means that an organization does not employ ethnic minorities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref> displays this strategy’s profile of resource criticality in the first horizontal line. We left the four spaces in this line empty to indicate that the criticality of all resources potentially controlled by ethnic minorities is assessed as low. Against the background of resource dependence theory, the <italic>exclusion</italic> strategy can be pursued on the basis of two reasons. First, organizational decision makers may not assess the resources controlled by ethnic minorities as critical, nor may they see that ethnic minorities facilitate access to resources controlled by other actors. Instead, ethnic minorities are assessed as lacking necessary competences. Second, decision makers suppose that internal or external stakeholders expect only ethnic majority individuals to be employed in the organization or in a particular job. Hence, in this case, the <italic>exclusion</italic> strategy secures the accrual of resources controlled by other actors. For example, the British employers interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113497094">Dench et al. (2006)</xref> anticipated poor cooperation on the shop floor if migrant workers were employed and decried them as lacking domestic language skills. The immigrants in Australia interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601113497094">Syed and Murray (2009)</xref> also pointed to difficulties caused by English-language deficits. As to external stakeholders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601113497094">Hekman et al. (2010)</xref> found that ethnic minority employees may decrease customer satisfaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601113497094">Cook and Glass (2009)</xref> observed decreasing share prices after the appointment of racial or ethnic minority members to top management positions.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that one of the assumptions of resource dependence theory states that organizational decision makers base their strategy choices on their subjective perceptions. While all decisions regarding the best-suited diversity strategy are affected by the validity of information, stereotypes, or social influence processes, the <italic>exclusion</italic> strategy is particularly prone to reflect racism and subtle discrimination.</p>

<sec id="section18-1059601113497094">
<title>Adding value through mere labor</title>
<p>Adding value through mere labor is a diversity strategy referring to the mere working capacity attributed to ethnic minorities. The highest pillar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref> visualizes our argument indicating that organizational decision makers assess the <italic>mere labor</italic> resource category as highly critical. Organizations that pursue this strategy employ ethnic minorities whenever they are willing to work for low wages or in undesired jobs. Ethnic minorities contribute to the organization’s profit because they accept low wages and job tasks that are unattractive to the ethnic majority. Professional competences are rarely necessary to fulfill these jobs, but sometimes they are important—for instance, in the construction industry or in the care provision sector. In such contexts, professional competences will, as well, be assessed as critical. Thus, medium criticality of this resource category is a secondary characteristic of the <italic>adding value through ethnic background</italic> strategy. In contrast, neither the competences related to an ethnic background nor the background itself is seen as critical resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1059601113497094">
<title>Antidiscrimination</title>
<p>Against the background of resource dependence theory, organizational actors pursue an <italic>antidiscrimination</italic> strategy to gain access and legitimacy with regard to different markets. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref> illustrates, the primary characteristic of this strategy is the high criticality of competences not related to an ethnic background. Organizational actors aim to attract and retain the best-qualified employees, irrespective of their sociodemographic characteristics. Since the enhancement of equal opportunities in a publicly visible way supports this aim, an individual’s ethnic background may be a critical resource in this case (displayed as medium criticality in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref>). Both an organization’s factual policy of discrimination-free human resource practices and the corresponding signal to the public may result in enhanced attractiveness as an employer, supplier, borrower, customer, or other business partner.</p>
<p>Some of the approaches outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601113497094">Table 1</xref> consider antidiscrimination perspectives, too. However, according to these approaches, antidiscrimination is exclusively driven by legal compliance and morality. In contrast, we presume that organizational actors pursue antidiscrimination due to the business rationales associated with market access and legitimacy given by different actors.</p>
<p>The remaining two diversity strategies are also characterized by an antidiscriminatory stance. Yet in contrast to the <italic>antidiscrimination</italic> strategy—which focuses on the contribution of all employees, including those from historically underrepresented groups—the following two strategies strongly focus on competences related to an ethnic background.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1059601113497094">
<title>Adding value through ethnic background</title>
<p>The key characteristic of the <italic>adding value through ethnic background</italic> diversity strategy is that organizational decision makers regard competences related to an ethnic background or the ethnic background itself as highly critical. The two high pillars at the respective resource categories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref> picture that argument. Many examples previously described demonstrate how organizations profit from ethnic minorities’ particular language and cultural skills, personal contacts, and social networks. The ethnic background itself can function as a sign of the authenticity of products and services or the organization’s internationality. Other professional competences may be critical resources, too, notably in high-skill jobs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref> shows this secondary relation by the pillar of medium height.</p>
<p>With regard to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601113497094">Table 1</xref>, this diversity strategy is similar to the access-and-legitimacy perspective described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601113497094">D. A. Thomas and Ely (1996)</xref> as well as the accommodative strategic response to demographic pressures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601113497094">Dass and Parker (1999)</xref>. We specify the arguments of these authors by applying resource dependence theory. We posit that ethnic minority employees facilitate access not only to consumer markets but also to labor, supply, and financial markets as well as interfirm networks. Relatedly, legitimacy is not an exclusive aim of this diversity strategy but one of other diversity strategies as well—in particular, antidiscrimination. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of ethnic minorities’ competences and the ethnic background itself, as required by the job.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1059601113497094">
<title>Learning</title>
<p>Learning, the final diversity strategy, refers to ethnic minorities’ control of one particularly critical resource—namely, new perspectives and approaches to work that are essential for process and product innovations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref>, the leftmost pillar in the rearmost horizontal line visualizes the argument that organizational decision makers assess ethnic minorities’ competences related to their ethnic backgrounds as highly critical resources. As jobs that aim at strategic innovations usually require high skills, other professional competences may turn into critical resources (displayed as medium criticality in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059601113497094">Figure 2</xref>). Accordingly, with the <italic>learning</italic> strategy, organizations also aim at adding value through the employment of ethnic minorities, but in contrast to the aforementioned strategies, neither their mere labor capacity nor their ethnic backgrounds are regarded as critical. Instead, their ways of handling tasks and problems are considered important. A heterogeneous workforce is highly valued because the mixture of perspectives and approaches to work yields synergetic effects and is regarded as a prerequisite for organizational learning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Both the typology of diversity strategies and the underlying categorization of potentially critical resources have several implications for research and practice. We first discuss the theoretical contribution, then highlight implications for the equality and diversity field, before we finally outline the typology’s potential for future research.</p>
<sec id="section23-1059601113497094">
<title>Theoretical Contribution</title>
<p>Previous research has shown that organizations, for many different reasons, employ ethnic minorities in many kinds of jobs—and that they sometimes refrain from employing ethnic minorities. This article provides a novel, theoretically founded categorization of the business rationales for employing ethnic minorities in organizations. Grounding our arguments in resource dependence theory, we elaborate on the entire spectrum of strategic reasons for organizations concerning the employment and nonemployment of ethnic minorities. Which of the five diversity strategies that organizations pursue—exclusion, adding value through mere labor, adding value through ethnic background, antidiscrimination, or learning—is a question of which resources organizational decision makers regard as critical. Each diversity strategy is a strategic response to the challenge of increased ethnic diversity, aiming at the optimal competence combination, cost-effectiveness, and legitimacy. Contrary to existing conceptualizations of organizations’ responses to the diversity challenge, which are mainly descriptive, this article contributes a framework that explains why companies choose which strategy, thereby focusing on business reasons.</p>
<p>One of the main advantages of our framework over previous conceptualizations is that it is grounded on a coherent theoretical rationale. Extant approaches suggest different—and partly contradictory—explanations for the existence of different strategies. For instance, morality may be the explanation for one strategy, legal compliance for another, and culture for the third. In contrast, we consistently explain the strategic choices by the same reason: the business quest to accrue critical resources. In addition, previous approaches do not address the question of how distinctive diversity perspectives or cultures in organizations emerge. The perspectives simply “are there” and prevail throughout the organization. Contrary to these approaches, ours explicitly considers the reasons for the strategies’ emergence. Moreover, since we propose the choice of a strategy to depend on the current assessments of critical resources in a particular context, organizations always have the option of changing their diversity strategies over time. Additionally, they may pursue different strategies in different organizational units at the same point.</p>
<p>An important feature of our typology is that it acknowledges the role of decision makers’ perceptions for the assessment of the criticality of resources and whether specific ethnic minority individuals control these resources. Thus, stereotyping and bias effects due to in-group favoritism or homophily—on which much of the contemporary diversity literature concentrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601113497094">Shore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1059601113497094">Zanoni et al., 2010</xref>)—are not completely excluded; yet, the focus is on the business logic within which stereotyping and bias occur. This interconnectedness was also present in the classical literature on gender and ethnicity at work and has been recently revived in critical diversity studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1059601113497094">Zanoni, 2011</xref>). Previous literature dominated by psychological and cultural theoretical lenses typically neglects structural and context-specific elements as well as the role of organizational actors and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601113497094">Jonsen, Maznewski, &amp; Schneider, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1059601113497094">Zanoni et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, we posit that (a) the social and historical contexts and (b) the organizational actors—with their historical, contextually shaped diversity beliefs—are eminent for the choice of organizational diversity strategies.</p>
<p>Our framework has several strengths in comparison with other theoretical perspectives. In the following, we concentrate on the resource-based view of the firm and institutionalist/neoinstitutionalist perspectives, since they are quite prevalent in management research and closest to resource dependence theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1059601113497094">Yang and Konrad (2011)</xref> elaborate on these perspectives.</p>
<p>The resource-based view of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601113497094">Barney, 1991</xref>) posits that organizations gain sustainable competitive advantage if they have resources that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and difficult to substitute for. Assuming that an ethnically diverse workforce and the related competences are valuable and unique for a company, ethnic diversity is generally supposed to create a competitive advantage for this company (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601113497094">Richard, 2000</xref>). Resource dependence theory provides a more differentiated perspective. Diversity does not automatically imply a competitive advantage, but this is a question of resource criticality.</p>
<p>By suggesting consideration of external factors and the organizational decision makers’ subjective assessments, resource dependence theory provides an explanation for the value of diversity. Relatedly, it explains which factors may cause organizations to refrain from capitalizing on this potential benefit. The resource-based view offers no satisfying answer why ethnic minorities are often relegated to the secondary labor market, employed beneath their qualifications, or not recruited by employers. In contrast, resource dependence theory suggests a theoretical explanation of these phenomena, as we demonstrate by the strategies of exclusion and adding value through mere labor.</p>
<p>Institutionalist perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601113497094">Scott, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1059601113497094">Tolbert &amp; Zucker, 1983</xref>) focus on the social environment of organizations. The core argument is that the survival of organizations depends on receiving legitimacy. Therefore, organizations conform to their environments as an answer to various environmental pressures. The main difference between institutionalism and resource dependence theory is that the former focuses on mechanisms that lead organizations to comply with a template and converge in practices whereas resource dependence theory accounts for active choice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601113497094">Oliver, 1991</xref>). Resource dependence theory calls attention to the mutual relationships between human resource strategies and sociopolitical factors, such as labor shortages, equal opportunity legislation, and governmental migration policy. By stating that external factors codetermine what decision makers think, how they act, and how they legitimize their actions, resource dependence theory explicitly accounts for different options of coping with dependencies. Thus, resource dependence theory facilitates explaining the variance of strategic choices and the possibility of noncompliance with laws or other regulations.</p>

<title>Implications for Equality and Diversity Initiatives</title>
<p>Owing to its focus on the business logic, we propose that the framework can be conducive to equality and diversity purposes. Previous research has shown that it is especially the business case argument that helps to achieve workplace equality and incorporate legal imperatives into organizational routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601113497094">Kirton &amp; Green, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1059601113497094">Tomlinson &amp; Schwabenland, 2010</xref>). A caveat is at hand here, as critics argue that the business logic glosses over political and social aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601113497094">Litvin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601113497094">Noon, 2007</xref>); yet, our analysis demonstrates that such disregard need not be the case. For instance, morality and a quest for legal compliance here do not count as reasons apart from business logics but rather as forces decisively shaping these logics. In addition, we indicate two failings of the extant “business case for diversity” rhetoric and related research: the neglect of economic rationales for the use of low-paid labor and the avoidance of diversity. Consequently, our framework provides a differentiating view on the multifaceted business case. We highlight which business logics undermine equality issues (tied to the strategies of exclusion and adding value through mere labor) and which business logics may contribute to promote equal opportunities and inclusion (tied to the strategies of antidiscrimination, adding value through ethnic background, and learning).</p>
<p>While we are far from neglecting the tensions inherent in the equality and diversity field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601113497094">Tatli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601113497094">Verbeek, 2011</xref>), we propose that diversity scholars and practitioners can both use our framework to promote equality and diversity initiatives. Human resource and diversity managers, as well as works council or union representatives and policy makers, can further draw on our arguments; yet, we should warn that not all diversity strategies outlined in our typology are thought of as “best practices.” Along with the strategies of exclusion and adding value through mere labor, the strategy of adding value through ethnic background can be disadvantageous for ethnic minorities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601113497094">Bendick, Egan, and Lanier (2010)</xref> analyze the practice of U.S. companies demographically matching the workforce with the customer base. They show that the preferential assignment of African American employees and managers to community retail stores did not entail favorable employment outcomes. In general, a special treatment of ethnic minorities—which might accompany the diversity strategy of learning—can reinforce stereotypes and the reproduction of a social hierarchy defined by ethnicity. In sum, even diversity strategies and practices that seemingly benefit ethnic minorities bear subtle discriminatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601113497094">Ogbonna &amp; Harris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1059601113497094">Van Laer &amp; Janssens, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Typology’s Potential for Future Research</title>
<p>The typology of diversity strategies opens up several directions for future research to enrich management studies on diversity. This research will also yield a range of practical implications for different stakeholder groups. First, the typology can be a useful framework for empirical analyses of antecedents and consequences of organizational diversity strategies. Therewith we respond to the call to conduct more organizational-level analyses of diversity practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601113497094">Jonsen et al., 2011</xref>). Particularly, several of the underresearched topics that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1059601113497094">Yang and Konrad (2011)</xref> propose to analyze could be addressed in this way, such as the interplay of social and economic antecedents of diversity practices, the role of human resource managers, and the implications for legitimacy.</p>
<p>Regarding antecedents, the typology helps to explore which settings shape the choice of a diversity strategy or the change from one strategy to another. Examples include different institutional contexts, industries, market positions, or life-cycle phases, such as start-up or expansion. Regarding institutional contexts, research would benefit from including legal regulations that are prone to hinder organizations from employing ethnic minorities. In terms of organizational consequences, the framework can be applied to analyze the efficiency of a particular diversity strategy in a given context. Results would not only enrich the scientific knowledge base, for instance, regarding the relation of diversity strategies to competitive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601113497094">Ortlieb &amp; Sieben, 2008</xref>) but also imply management recommendations.</p>
<p>The typology invites the exploration of consequences for ethnic minorities, in terms of employment barriers and opportunities linked to the different organizational strategies and settings. Again, results would not only enrich diversity management studies, for instance, regarding the relation of diversity strategies to personnel structures and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601113497094">Ortlieb &amp; Sieben, 2010</xref>), but also provide practical recommendations to ethnic minority individuals.</p>
<p>The evaluation of governmental policies concerning immigrant workers is an important research area where our typology can be usefully applied. Investigations into the effectiveness of policies such as H1-B visas in the United States or Green Cards in Germany and comparative studies on the prevalence of diversity strategies in specific institutional contexts would yield significant policy recommendations.</p>
<p>Second, scholars in the field of strategic human resource management can fruitfully apply our typology to analyses based on the diversity of organizations’ competence pools, as claimed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1059601113497094">Wright and McMahan (2011)</xref>. Analogous to our classification of competences and other resources controlled by ethnic minorities, further analysis could specify characteristics with regard to other diversity dimensions. Examples include age—a pressing and hitherto underresearched management concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601113497094">Lepak &amp; Shaw, 2008</xref>)—organizational function, and gender. Beyond staffing decisions, our framework can be applied to the analysis of strategic choices concerning other human resource functions and the strategic fit of human resource practices. For instance, our approach suggests that decisions of human resource development, career planning, and job design will be based on the consideration of resource criticality. In this way, future applications of our framework could respond to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601113497094">Becker and Huselid’s (2006)</xref> call for increasing the level of differentiation in the analysis of human resource architectures—that is, the configurations of human resource practices used for different employee groups.</p>
<p>Third, more critically oriented scholars might want to apply our framework to analyses of power relations in organizations and their consequences. For instance, such analyses could help to explain pay differences between ethnic minority and majority employees. Analyses of pay gaps typically consider individual characteristics, such as human capital endowment, former work experience, occupation, or weekly working hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601113497094">Darity, Guilkey, &amp; Winfrey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601113497094">Longhi &amp; Platt, 2008</xref>). Beyond that, our framework suggests consideration of the perceived criticality of resources controlled by different sociodemographic groups. In addition, an analysis of how ethnic minorities achieve better working conditions, higher salaries, or career advancement would be promising. Again, the key argument would be that the control of critical resources enables ethnic minority employees to negotiate better terms with their organizations. Hence, the success of negotiations depends on the kind of resources controlled by ethnic minorities and the degree of the resources’ criticality.</p>
<p>In sum, these lines of potential future research demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework. It not only provides better theoretical grounding than that of previous approaches but also offers greater versatility. However, future research is needed to specify the framework in the following ways.</p>
<p>The most important task is to gain deeper understanding of how organizational decision makers’ perceptions of criticality are shaped in specific contexts. Which individual and social factors determine whether an organizational decision maker assesses a resource as highly critical if “objective” criteria suggest this assessment? Since attitudes toward ethnic minorities and historically developed patterns of inequality play an important role in this regard, future studies would benefit from an explicit contextualization through, for instance, international comparisons. This suggestion is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601113497094">Jonsen et al. (2011)</xref>, who point to the critical and underresearched role of diversity beliefs, important differences between the United States and Europe, and, consequently, the need for cultural contextualization. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601113497094">Al Ariss, Vassilopoulou, et al. (2012)</xref> show that highly skilled immigrants have different career experiences in France compared to Germany, due to the countries’ different immigration histories and corresponding policies and practices.</p>
<p>A related area in need of further specification is to account for different kinds of ethnic backgrounds for which historically developed patterns of inequality differ. We assume that such patterns of inequality influence the prevalence of certain diversity strategies. Dependent on the sociopolitical and historical contexts, organizational decision makers will perceive different ethnic groups to control different resources. As a consequence, they will choose strategies according to kind of ethnicity. Appropriate study designs include cross-country comparisons as well as comparisons of national policies and organizational strategies that address different ethnic groups. In addition, the intersection of ethnicity with other characteristics—particularly, class, gender, religion, age, and occupational function—is highly relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601113497094">Kamenou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601113497094">Syed &amp; Murray, 2009</xref>). Hence, a focus on different diversity dimensions and their intersections would be a promising approach for future research.</p>
<p>To conclude, we present in this article a novel framework of diversity strategies that theorizes the business rationales to employ hitherto underrepresented groups. Owing to its theoretical grounding in resource dependence theory, it has several advantages compared to previous approaches. The focus on critical resources to be accrued by including ethnic minorities not only helps us understand organizations’ responses to diversity but also lays out the multiple benefits of ethnic diversity for organizations as well as resulting chances and barriers for the inclusion of ethnic minorities. As such, the framework decisively advances the theoretical grounding of diversity management research. For interested actors within the diversity management field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601113497094">Tatli, 2011</xref>), the framework provides a differentiating view on the multifaceted business case for diversity. It suggests business logics that may hinder equality and diversity goals. More important, it unfolds and specifies, using the example of ethnic minorities, the manifold business arguments for realizing the social and economic benefits of diversity.</p>
