<abstract>
<p>This longitudinal content analysis study uses the Commission on Public Relations Education’s 2006 report as a benchmark to determine whether master’s education in public relations has evolved over the past decade. Findings show a lack of uniformity across the 75 programs studied. In addition, there is a lack of adherence to the Commission on Public Relations Education’s recommended content areas. The authors theorize that the variety of academic homes and titles partly explains the lack of uniformity. But also graduate public relations curricula may lack standardization because of different models.</p>

<body>
<p>While there are studies of journalism and mass communication graduate programs, little has been researched about public relations graduate education. Yet public relations graduate degree programs have proliferated in the past ten years and are found in several different schools, colleges, and departments across universities. Universities are looking for more revenue from nontraditional students,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695813481463">1</xref></sup> and speculation is that students are seeking master’s degree programs because “they can’t find jobs and stay in school or have lost jobs or found them unfulfilling and return for advanced degrees.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695813481463">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>But whether master’s degree holders will be more employable by the public relations industry is debatable. Opinions vary—from graduate school support for professional development or advancement, career change, or personal development to such cons as time, money, and delay in on-the-job training.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695813481463">3</xref></sup> The MBA still is recommended in the industry over public relations graduate education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695813481463">4</xref></sup> One qualitative study of industry leaders’ attitudes toward advance public relations education suggested they are “on the fence” about the value of graduate education when making a hiring decision, expecting professional experience regardless of degrees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695813481463">5</xref></sup> These employers perceived differences in quality of graduate programs—recommending a “better brand for graduate public relations education.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695813481463">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Differing opinions exist also about what the curriculum for a professional master’s program should contain. In 2000, Aldoory and Toth found little curriculum consistency across public relations graduate programs, speculating that these programs were housed in journalism and mass communication programs and were “probably still evolving.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695813481463">7</xref></sup> The National Commission on Graduate Study in Public Relations proposed one standard set of courses for all public relations graduate programs, citing the MBA as a comparable example of a uniform graduate program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695813481463">8</xref></sup> Others have proposed that public relations graduate education could have more than one curriculum model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695813481463">9</xref></sup> A panel of public relations professors recommended theories beneath public relations, management, economics, and business.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695813481463">10</xref></sup> This study examines public relations graduate program curricula eleven years after the Aldoory and Toth study to determine how curricula have evolved.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695813481463">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Generally, literature discussing public relations graduate curricula is found through the lens of journalism and mass communication or communication. Soloski, in a special issue of <italic>Journalism Educator</italic> on graduate education in journalism and mass communication, preferred to develop critical thinking over professional and specialized graduate studies. Also, he warned against allowing professional training to dominate graduate curriculum or curriculum structured solely for the faculty. For Soloski, “the most critical issue with MBA programs was the curriculum.” He urged journalism and mass communication educators to take a page from MBA programs that had made wholesale changes in their curricula to keep pace with the business world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695813481463">11</xref></sup> Christ and Broyles surveyed forty Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication–affiliated schools to assess doctoral education, but also described master’s tracks in three general categories—a research track, a professional track, and a general track—rather than specializations such as public relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695813481463">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, authors Baines and Kennedy continued to observe that public relations studies are part of journalism and mass communication. They stated that “boundaries between work in journalism, PR and information brokerage are porous.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695813481463">13</xref></sup> Mensing referenced journalism schools at the undergraduate and graduate levels as adding training in public relations, broadcast, and advertising, but concluded that “the central theme of journalism education has been that of a professionally oriented program focused on educating students for jobs in the media industries.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695813481463">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, studies of public relations graduate programs were reported as early as 1994. Briggs and Fleming reported that there were forty-two specializations in public relations available in 120 U.S. graduate programs in journalism and mass communication. They speculated that “interest in public relations reflects a change in employment opportunities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695813481463">15</xref></sup> Shelton found forty-nine public relations master’s program concentrations listed in the 1994 Speech Communication Graduate Directory, in an effort to help administrators make comparisons with other programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695813481463">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The only comprehensive effort to set standards for graduate public relations master’s degree programs came from a Commission on Graduate Study in Public Relations, officially sanctioned by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication in 1982. In response to the increasing numbers of master’s degree programs being offered, the commission sought to standardize master’s programs that would provide training for the management of the public relations function as well as enhance critical public relations writing, editing, and design skills. The commission proposed a thirty-credit-hour professional studies program that taught students research methods, communication theory, communication processes, public relations principles, public relations management, public relations programming and production, a public relations specialty option, minor courses, and a thesis or graduate project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695813481463">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the 2000 article, Aldoory and Toth used the 1985 commission’s proposed master’s in public relations curriculum as a benchmark to assess whether public relations graduate programs were using the commission standards. Based on a content analysis of twenty-one program websites, they found a lack of adherence to the foundation’s recommendations and a perception of a split between academic and professional goals. They concluded that until a consensus about goals for master’s public relations education could be reached, the curricula found would reflect different program goals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695813481463">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, public relations educators came together at a summer conference sponsored by the National Communication Association and recommended two public relations master’s program models—a professional model and an academic model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695813481463">19</xref></sup> Russell reported that a professional master’s of public relations curriculum should include the following content areas: public relations and organizational communication theories and management theories; understanding integrated communication; strategic planning; crisis management; managing communication and information technologies; advanced media production and delivery skills; applied research; multicultural, international, and global issues; leadership and team building; interpersonal and small group theories; legal, social, and cultural constraints on the practice of public relations; applied and professional ethics; specializations of public relations; training and consulting; and professional experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695813481463">20</xref></sup> Vasquez and Botan reported that an academic master’s degree in public relations curriculum should include the following content areas: ethics, intercultural/international issues, law and legal/policy issues, knowledge of communication/public relations theory, management theory and strategies, public relations body of knowledge, research skills, strategic planning/communication, teaching public relations, and understanding of all competencies within a public relations framework.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695813481463">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>As an outcome of this conference, the 1999 Commission on Public Relations Education report did not recommend one standardized set of requirements for the public relations master’s degree. Instead, it provided two sample curriculum models. The commission did recommend curriculum content areas: public relations theory, public relations law, public relations research methods, public relations management, public relations programming and production, communication processes, management sciences, behavioral sciences, and public relations ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695813481463">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, Hon, Fitzpatrick, and Hall presented an “ideal” curriculum for a public relations master’s program housed in a traditional college of journalism and mass communication based on an analysis of leading public relations master’s program websites and interviews with public relations professionals, educators, and graduate students. They proposed a fifteen-hour core curriculum that included public relations theories, public relations practicum, public relations research, mass communication and society, and the addition of more public relations electives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695813481463">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Quantitative research on whether models of public relations master’s programs hold traction with educators and practitioners was not available until a survey of educator and practitioner preferences of certain models was conducted for the 2006 Commission on Public Relations <italic>Professional Bond</italic> report. Findings indicated support for three different but overlapping profiles that were labeled “the academic focus,” “the academic disciplinary focus,” and the “professional focus.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695813481463">24</xref></sup> Shen and Toth also found in qualitative interviews with public relations educators and practitioners that they were open to different models of graduate public relations curricula.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695813481463">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 2006 Commission on Public Relations Education report recommended the following content areas for a master’s degree in public relations: public relations theory and concepts, public relations law, public relations ethics, global public relations, public relations applications, public relations management, public relations research, public relations programming and production, public relations publics, communication processes, management sciences, behavioral sciences, internship or practicum experience, and thesis or capstone experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695813481463">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the commission proposed three models: models A, B, and C. Model A focused on students preparing to enter a doctoral program, model B provided advanced career preparation through coursework in public relations and management disciplines, and model C provided studies for a specialization in public relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695813481463">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although public relations graduate education continues to be blurred within discussions of journalism and mass communication and is categorized in speech communication departments, recommendations and some research have developed to benchmark public relations as a graduate course of study in its own right. More literature has developed around standards for a professional public relations course of study, but other models for graduate public relations education have been noted. Although the literature does not indicate one set of standards for what should be the curriculum for a master’s degree or one model, the recommendations continue to include the following curriculum content areas: public relations theory, communication theory, research methods, public relations management, public relations law, public relations ethics, programming and production, and internship or practicum experience. In response to the calls for graduate public relations curriculum that has a “quality brand,” this study sought to learn whether or not curricula of graduate-level public relations education have become more standardized, at least reflecting the continuing recommendations made in the literature and/or if program models are now in evidence.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>Based on the review of the literature, the following research questions have been devised to further explore master’s education in public relations:</p>
<list id="list1-1077695813481463" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>RQ1</italic>: How do the curriculum elements fit the commission’s 2006 content standards?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>RQ2</italic>: How do PR master’s programs fit the three models recommended by the 2006 commission?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077695813481463" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Similar to Aldoory and Toth’s study, a content analysis was conducted, where the unit of analysis was the website of each master’s-level public relations program obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695813481463">28</xref></sup> The initial sampling frame consisted of schools listed as having a graduate program in public relations in the directories of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication and the National Communication Association. In addition, the 2011 edition of “Where Shall I Go to Study Advertising and Public Relations” was reviewed to include more schools in the sample. Issues of <italic>PR Week</italic> were also reviewed for advertisements from schools that identified themselves as public relations programs. Last, programs that self-identified as public relations programs explicitly on their websites even though they were located in departments such as Journalism &amp; Mass Communication, Communication, or Communication Studies were included in the sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695813481463">29</xref></sup> The final sample included a total of seventy-five programs, whose <italic>department, emphasis, major, sequence</italic>, or <italic>substantive area</italic> encompassed public relations graduate education.</p>
<p>For this study, we used the definition of public relations as “the management of communication between an organization and its publics.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695813481463">30</xref></sup> In making final selections of which master’s programs to include, we chose those programs that self-identified as “public relations,” “strategic communication management,” “strategic communication,” or “communication management” and/or program titles that indicated advanced graduate-level public relations studies. If program titles led to curricula that included no public relations courses, they were eliminated from the analysis.</p>
<p>The website of each program in the final sample was analyzed further for a series of categories recommended in the <italic>Professional Bond</italic> report. A limitation of this analysis is that the categories represent only what was mentioned on the website; course descriptions listed on programs’ websites may not be reflective of the entire curriculum. In addition, several websites were found to be out of date and had not been updated with the most recent information. Longitudinal data were presented using a cohort-trend sampling strategy, where different programs were sampled over time, but only those programs that met certain characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695813481463">31</xref></sup> Another limitation comes from examining the website listing of course titles and matching these titles to the <italic>Professional Bond</italic> report’s recommended “content” areas.</p>
<p>A website analysis is an appropriate method for this research because many programs now use the Internet to advertise their curricula and recruit prospective students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695813481463">32</xref></sup> Similar studies have been conducted to assess how universities and colleges use their websites to build relationships with target publics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695813481463">33</xref></sup> Poock and Lefond found that students prefer to use the Web to interact with organizations and not just read static content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695813481463">34</xref></sup> Program websites can be designed in a way to accommodate the varying Internet skill levels of these prospective students to provide resources and satisfy their information needs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695813481463">35</xref></sup> However, there are also some risks to using websites as data stability can no longer be taken for granted and as sites can disappear or change dramatically almost instantly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695813481463">36</xref></sup></p>

<p>The course most offered in the 2011 sample was Public Relations Research (64 percent). This course was fourth on the list in 2000 (23 percent). The course most offered in 2000 was Communication Processes (69 percent). Public Relations Theory and Concepts was the second most offered course in 2000 (54 percent) and the third most offered course in 2011 (50.7 percent). Public Relations Programming and Production and Public Relations Management were the two courses offered third most frequently in 2000 (50 percent). These courses were third (50.7 percent) and fourth (42.7 percent) in 2011. The Applications course, which covers public relations practice in corporate, government, and nonprofit settings, was next on the list, with 31 percent of programs offering the course in 2000 and 30.7 percent of programs in 2011. Public Relations Law was found in about a quarter of the programs (27 percent in 2000; 22.7 percent in 2011). The Global Public Relations course is now more frequently offered, increasing from 12 percent of programs to 20 percent. Courses that are not frequently offered include Public Relations Publics (8 percent and 5.3 percent), Management Sciences (19 percent and 14.7 percent), and Behavioral Sciences (15 percent and 4 percent).</p>

<title><italic>RQ2</italic>: How Do PR Master’s Programs Fit the Three Models Recommended by the 2006 Commission?</title>
<p>Based on the course offerings of each of the programs in the sample, a master’s program was designated as model A, model B, or model C. A majority of programs in both 2000 (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and 2011 (<italic>n</italic> = 42) would be considered the model B, which focuses on advancing career preparation in public relations and communication management. Six programs in 2000 and eleven programs in 2011 were categorized as model A, focusing on preparing students for a doctoral program. Five programs in 2000 and ten programs in 2011 were categorized as model C, offering an interdisciplinary approach to specialize in public relations. The remaining five programs in 2000 and ten programs in 2011 did not provide enough information about their coursework to determine which model they would fall under.</p>
<p>As listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077695813481463">Table 4</xref>, the course offerings within each model further explicate how each master’s program was designated. The majority of programs offered courses within model B, where most instances were close to or over 50 percent of the programs, for both 2000 and 2011. The second highest concentration of courses was found in model A, where course offerings were abundant, especially in terms of research methods and public relations management, for both 2000 and 2011. Last, many of the programs did not provide further information on courses listed as model C, which should explain why this model resulted in the fewest master’s programs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the intervening years since the Aldoory and Toth study of public relations graduate curriculum and two Commission on Public Relations Education reports, the data indicate little movement toward uniformity of curriculum. Results indicated that gains have been made in the requirement of a research methods course (from 23 percent to 64 percent of programs), an ethics course (4 percent to 26.7 percent of programs), and global public relations (12 percent to 20 percent of programs). However, the presence of other recommended courses was quite similar to the situation in the 2000 Aldoory and Toth study, such as public relations programming and production (from 50 percent to 50.7 percent of programs) and public relations applications (31 percent to 30.7 percent). Some recommended course categories actually showed a decline, such as communication processes (69 percent to 52 percent of programs), public relations theory and concepts (54 percent to 50.7 percent), public relations management (50 percent to 42.7 percent), management sciences (19 percent to 14.7 percent), public relations law (27 percent to 22.7 percent), and behavioral sciences (15 percent to 4 percent). While Aldoory and Toth concluded that graduate public relations education was evolving, eleven years later we are left to consider whether public relations graduate curricula are still without standardization, and it is unlikely that prospective public relations graduate students will have what the Commission on Public Relations Education reports have repeatedly recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695813481463">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>One explanation for this finding is that programs have begun to specialize in different kinds of graduate public relations education, as acknowledged in the Commission on Public Relations Education’s <italic>Professional Bond</italic> report. If programs were specializing in professional studies, a more academic track, or a more specialized graduate program, perhaps this would explain the lack of uniformity suggested by the analysis of programs by courses. Our analysis suggested partial support for this theory. At least a majority of the programs were focused on the professional studies model, with some uniformity of course content, while six programs focused on an academic course of study, which would prepare students to obtain doctoral degrees, and five programs seemed to be offering an interdisciplinary approach to specialize in public relations.</p>
<p>The lack of uniformity in graduate public relations program curricula may be explained further by returning to the lack of uniformity in the names of the programs offering graduate degrees in public relations. This variety of titles reflects the preferences of the universities in terms of where the degree should be housed, but it can also prove to be confusing for prospective students who may not fully know what kind of education they would be getting from the program. Little more than a quarter of the programs were found used the title “public relations,” with another 2 percent using the title “strategic public relations,” 1.3 percent using “public relations and issues management,” and 5.3 percent using “public relations &amp; corporate communication.”</p>
<p>The variety of names of the master’s programs is striking. The next highest percentage (14 percent) used the title “strategic communications.” Of the programs, 8 percent combined advertising and public relations in their titles. Other titles used the term <italic>communication</italic>: “communication management” (9.3 percent), “communication” (5.3 percent), “public communication” (5.4 percent), “corporate communication” (2.7 percent), “corporate and organizational communication” (1.3 percent), and “global communication” (1.3 percent). Another subcategory of titles suggests the historical influence of journalism and mass communication studies: “journalism and mass communication” (4 percent), “mass communication” (2.7 percent), and “media and public relations” (2.7 percent).</p>
<p>Another explanation for a lack of uniform graduate program curricula is that these programs are found in a wide variety of university departments. A quarter of the master’s programs were found in Departments of Communication; however, there are twenty-five other departments offering public relations graduate education, with few departments of public relations (6.7 percent) and some departments as far a field as “professional studies,” “online learning,” “business,” “executive education,” “culture and communication,” and “advanced academic.” Curriculum planners in these administrative units would be less likely to know about the Commission on Public Relations Education’s work. At the least, this variety of departments suggests a variety of academic interests rather than achieving uniform standards for graduate public relations curricula.</p>
<p>Although three Commission on Public Relations Education reports, representing most professional and academic associations, have sought to bring uniformity to graduate public relations education by continuing to recommend public relations theory, communication theory, research methods, public relations management, public relations law, public relations ethics, programming and production, and internship or practicum, little headway has been made. Prospective public relations graduate students and employers cannot expect to find these recommended topics in graduate program curricula.</p>
<p>Public relations graduate programs will remain housed in other units, such as journalism and mass communication or speech communication, and their program titles will continue to vary. But we agree with Soloski that the content of the curriculum is the most important issue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695813481463">39</xref></sup> We hope that the data will assist educators of public relations in pressing for more uniform content standards. We also call for accrediting and certification organizations to advance standards for graduate public relations education. Without more standardization across graduate programs, public relations educators and practitioners risk greater disaffection with the value of an advanced public relations degree, limiting the potential for public relations education to become a more quality brand.</p>
