<abstract>
<p>Informal cultural markets are not new. Nor are “pirate” video and software markets as different from formal markets as supposed. They are also markets governed by pricing, providing opportunities for leverage by market participants at the expense of each other. Pirate markets are a variant of a cultural market in which returns for sellers and costs to buyers factor in limited to no formal returns to content owners. Furthermore, in large parts of the world, such informal arrangements facilitate cultural, social, and market participation. This article remembers the disruptions that accompanied the VCR’s introduction to identify longstanding pathways of market formation to which the VCR and our current “digital” ensemble of DVD and downloads conform; and those features common to these and other media technologies which lend themselves to diverse production, distribution, and consumption arrangements globally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the things to be learnt from H.A. Innis, via James Carey, is the importance of attaching “changes in both social organization and culture to changes in the technology of communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412443090">Carey 1967</xref>, 9). This is the idea that “any given medium will bias social organization, for it will favour the growth of certain kinds of interests and institutions at the expense of others and will also impose on these institutions a form of organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412443090">1967</xref>, 9). While this formulation has a determinist ring, it focuses attention usefully on the interplay between the communication technology and the social, economic, institutional, and governmental arrangements. This ensemble of technology and social arrangement cocreates the spaces for action and possibility that are our cultural markets. To understand a communication technology like DVD, VCR, and internet downloading is therefore an empirical question: how cultural materials circulate, the conditions for that circulation to occur, and the uses to which people put the materials and resources at their disposal. Innis’s discussion of communication technology like many of those influenced by him (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412443090">Garnham 2000</xref>, 28–30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412443090">Carey 1989</xref>, 142–72) was concerned with the particularities of market formation as befits a political economist giving due regard to what he somewhat allusively called the “penetrative power of the price mechanism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412443090">Innis 1938</xref>).</p>
<p>I want to remember this now for several reasons. First, there is a tendency with the “transition to digital” to think of DVD and online media as so groundbreaking as to be without precedent. Recalling aspects of the first video revolution demonstrates the many continuities between it and our current digital revolution. Second, we risk viewing our current messy international arrangements from the perspective of one kind of cultural market engendering less regard for the actual arrangements possible in different social–cultural–economic–political environments globally. Third, attending to the first video revolution permits us to reflect on the continuities between formal and informal markets that are somewhat occluded by the rhetoric of a war on piracy and the associations made between terrorist financing, a rampant organized crime, and video piracy by entertainment groups, lobbies, and governments intent on increasing the market power of often multinational content owners and producers at the expense of other participants. We need, in short, to think about the continuities and interdependencies between formal and informal markets and not just their disjunctions.</p>

<title>The Characteristics of the VCR</title>
<p>So successfully has the new media of DVD and downloads supplanted the old media of the VCR that it is increasingly difficult to think of the unprecedented flexibility, manipulability, robust character, transportability, reproducibility and reusability, and radical decentralization associated with the VCR all through its period of explosive growth in the 1980s and into the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412443090">Ganley &amp; Ganley 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412443090">Boyd et al 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476412443090">Alvarado 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Today we think of it as bulky and cumbersome; as inferior in sound and image; as inflexible and awkward offering only limited scope for manipulation. We see it as difficult and less reliable to reproduce with as copies deteriorate with each generation of copying. We see it as susceptible to wear and tear (and to magnetic fields, which can wipe content) and as much bulkier to transport in comparison to the DVD and its successors like the weightless internet download. We see it, in short, as having the limitations of an analogue world falling well short of the norms and standards associated with digital technology.</p>
<p>But we have to see through these prejudices to recognize how remarkable was the VCR and what it set in train. Compared to 35-mm or even 16-mm prints, the videocassette was remarkably cheap; its projection equipment was low-cost and flexible; tapes could be recycled. Screen media could now be more readily circulated through an array of channels—private, semiprivate, public, commercial and not-for-profit. VCR tapes could be inexpensively transported through existing freight networks (including smuggling networks). Viewing could be personalized to consumer’s personal calendars and not those determined by cinema and broadcast schedulers.</p>
<p>The VCR was an instrument for personalizing, de-controlling, decentralizing TV for the viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412443090">Ganley and Ganley 1987</xref>, xi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412443090">Boyd et al 1989</xref>: 265–73). It was able to do this through the dispersal of reproduction and replay to the general population permitting them to both time-shift broadcast signals and replay recorded tapes. This defining character of the VCR permitted radically decentralized reproduction at both the individual unit level (in the home) and in more extended duplication. Later, DVD would accelerate this trend toward reproducibility as “copying equipment” became more compact, copies were made faster and more reliably, and copying medium costs reduced as the DVD disk was much cheaper than the video-cassette. Distribution with the DVD also entailed a more efficient combination of physical and virtual delivery in comparison to the physical transportation networks necessary for the VCR. In DVD markets, content was sent electronically as well as physically transported across and within national borders (something that was difficult for VCR outside recording broadcast transmissions). But we see in the forms and take-up of the VCR in the 1980s in nearly every market in the world precursors of today’s informal and formal markets and evidence of a continuous line of market development.</p>
<p>From an Innisian perspective, our current moment is less a digital break from a previous analogue world than an intensification of market and social processes begun with the growth of the VCR (which were in turn beholden to processes preceding its advent). This suggests that the transition from analogue to digital consists of the ratcheting up of processes that became widespread with the VCR. In fact, many of the features we think as particular to DVD and the internet are defining features of previous technologies like the VCR. What then are some of these common features that lend themselves to our diverse situations of production, distribution, and consumption globally?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1527476412443090">
<title>Piecemeal Development</title>
<p>One feature of the VCR, the DVD, and the internet is that each permits scope for a variety of piecemeal developments. Such developments can, at one and the same time, be organized and coordinated centrally and be disorganized and decentralized, be occurring in both geographically central and in peripheral places simultaneously, and be undertaken by a myriad of actors ranging from the smallest business to the largest multinational corporation. This makes these technologies unlike broadcast and pay-TV but like the newspaper, publishing, and the cinema. Such piecemeal development is facilitated by low barriers to entry for market participants. Market development costs can thus be shared across a large and dispersed variety of market participants from across social formations, geography, and businesses orders. The VCR permitted in ways broadcast TV and its pay-TV variants did and could not extend market participation across territories and communities no matter their size. As I put it back in 1991, the VCR
<disp-quote>
<p>had the advantage of being a low level widely available and inexpensive technology able to fit readily into existing communication and transportation networks, and business structures (electrical and other retailers, cafes, and later service stations, and department stores). It could therefore develop in a piecemeal, accretive way without large initial capital outlays, and was thus suited to decentralized small business investment, at least initially. A consequence of such piecemeal development was that VCR markets developed largely outside governmental purview. These characteristics made the VCR unlike broadcast TV, cable and DBS, all of which required large capital outlays and new technological infrastructures, including distribution structures, and hence centralized corporate and state investment to put satellites up and maintain them, to lay the cable lines, or to regulate the industry. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412443090">O’Regan 1991</xref>, 112)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If the VCR had little precedent from broadcasting arrangements it had much precedent in the market arrangements of other cultural forms. The video rental structure that emerged in many Western markets in the 1980s had precedent in the commercial and public lending libraries of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. (As Sassoon observes, commercial lending libraries emerged in a widespread fashion in the early nineteenth century in Europe allowing publishers scope to create the multiple volume novel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412443090">Sassoon 2006</xref>, 69-73].) These dispersed libraries in Australian country areas took the form of mobile commercial library services that brought books and magazines to where people were living. But the VCR was not the first example of an audiovisual cultural market formed in this piecemeal, simultaneously uncoordinated and coordinated fashion. This is how the cinema also developed.</p>
<p>When we look at the circumstances in which the growth of cinemas occurred back in the 1910s and 1920s, there were many common elements with the later VCR formations of the 1980s and DVD in the 1990s. There were the same myriad of decentralized decisions by a host of different actors to build cinemas or convert halls for showing films or simply outside projections. Just as the VCR would later decentralize viewing, the cinema through traveling picture shows, converted halls, and especially built venues, extended viewing opportunities across geographic space, bringing screening venues closer to where people lived. It also recentralized “content” as distributors moved to take advantage of the increasing number of these screen windows, creating in the process national and international markets.</p>
<p>Compared with previous cultural forms such as live theater, vaudeville, and opera, screen producers and distributors were getting much less out of individual screenings than previously but their overheads were also considerably less. But they were also getting significant economies of scale and scope from screening once the film was in the can. This decentralization of cinema exhibition when coupled with its largely “uncontrolled” expansion advantaged Hollywood and the larger film industries in the 1920s, just as it permitted exhibition “management” to emerge that needed no especial showbusiness acumen to put on a show. The era of block and blind booking had arrived.</p>
<p>VCR represented an extraordinary expansion of these decentralizing opportunities. The cinema was limited to public spaces like retail precincts and defined by transportation corridors. It required paying audiences, scheduled screenings, darkened spaces, skilled operators, and some embedding in town and cityscapes. The VCR, by contrast, had a different viability. The cost of maintaining an exhibition facility—paying for the rates and rent, services like lighting and power, and the costs of delivering content to the point of exhibition—were all substantially met by the consumer. There was now no limit to the variety of places and spaces in which screening could be found or limitations of audience size (an audience of one or two became the new benchmark of viability). Crucially, the VCR entered the home, creating “home viewing” and viewing in other communal and public places and spaces such as hotels, cafes, clubs, and schools. Here it would be defined less by retail transaction associated with the product than by other kinds of retail (food and beverage) and communal transaction.</p>
<p>Its low cost, the cheapness by which second copies could be created, its flexibility, adaptability, and its low transportation costs facilitated a wide variety of uses from the parcel-post video services providing tapes of prime time TV schedules to outback viewers in rural Australia advertised in the <italic>Queensland Country Life</italic> in the early 1980s, to the Croatian-language infotainment and variety programming supplied to fruit growers in Carnarvon in Western Australia for as much as AU$24 a unit in the late 1980s (this cost built in the assumption of its circulation among communities in this small country town); to the formalized urban video rental markets. For some communities the VCR represented more a TV service without TV broadcasting, for others another window to watch feature films.</p>
<p>The important point is that even in a “developed market” the VCR was involved in different kinds of market of varying degrees of formality and informality. And just like the cinema it happened largely without governmental authorization, enablement or action (of course there were countries, notably Iran, which briefly experimented with possession of a video as a capital offence). Once established in a visible shape governmental involvement became possible and even necessary but by then the question had become what kind of video market regulation was feasible, not whether to have a video market.</p>

<title>Types of VCR Market</title>
<p>For much of the world, the expansion of screen media in the 1980s did not come through additional broadcast TV services or pay TV but video. It was the first new TV technology in the field. It was a TV service and it was a cinema service. Surveying the literature on the VCR in the early 1990s, I identified three broadly different kinds of market.</p>
<p>First there were the VCR markets where it was an entertainment medium dedicated to the movies providing an additional window for experiencing and reexperiencing cinema and premium TV programming. Here the VCR functioned as an additional, and after initial dislocation, an integrated window with rental and sell-through markets providing a cinema like experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412443090">Austin 1990</xref>). It brought the cinema to rural and regional towns and cities that had lost their cinema hard-tops and drive-ins. It extended the film content market to audiences who had either missed the cinema screening, could not afford it, or could not fit it around busy lives. We see the legacies of this function and the lines of reasoning that attend it in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412443090">Barlow’s (2005)</xref> positioning of the DVD as an extension of the cinema permitting audiences to be with films in more extended ways (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412443090">Bennett and Brown 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412443090">Barbara Klinger (2006)</xref> explained, the VCR and later the DVD did not so much detract from but built cinema audiences. Certainly, the experience in the United States, Britain, and Australia confirms this view. Rising cinema attendances, the addition of new screens, the renovation of existing screen infrastructure, and the rise in cinema visits per head of population from the 1980s all occurred after an initial period of disruption in these markets. What we perhaps do not see so clearly here is the extent to which this market version is predicated on the existence alongside it of “mature or maturing (commercial) TV system geared to providing entertainment, high disposable income amongst its audience, and copyright protection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412443090">O’Regan 1991</xref>, 113).</p>
<p>Crucially the other two forms of cultural markets did not have these characteristics. Broadcast TV in the 1980s was in many countries in the world a television of scarcity not abundance; ethnic minorities often lacked the critical mass to sustain separate broadcasting services while their host governments were sometimes hostile to the very prospect. Copyright protections were not the norm in this or adjacent print and theatrical markets. Consequently, cultural markets emerged where video functioned as an extra, partially underground, TV service. These markets were based on “the relative absence of competitive entertainment TV services, low disposable income, barriers to trade in cultural production and the absence of effective copyright protection” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412443090">O’Regan 1991</xref>, 113). As reports from the 1980s and 1990s suggested video presaged a longer term crisis in the existing media:
<disp-quote>
<p>This led, in some countries in the 1980s, to the partial disintegration of movie markets and film industries owing to the substantial black market traffic in video that developed. The inauguration of the VCR also marked the virtual end of central political control over information flows and cultural production in many developing and Eastern bloc countries. Where government controlled TV had limited operating hours, limited channel choice, and substantial government guidance in programming selection, the provision of entertainment TV had, as a consequence, been limited as well. Here a video market emerged in which staple TV, like drama series and politically contentious information programming, made up an important component of the video titles available in the VCR market in addition to movies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412443090">O’Regan 1991</xref>, 113)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The third cultural market type was somewhere in between these first two. Here video functioned in a hybrid way. It was part alternative TV service and part de facto pay-TV service. This type of VCR market was made up of combinations of conditions from both market types.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Thus the VCR could exist in fully developed commercial TV environments, but in countries with lower disposable incomes and little copyright protection. Latin American markets tended to be of this type. The VCR market was and still is substantially illegal, offering pirated movies to relatively affluent consumers. Another variant was the VCR in states with some limited commercial broadcasting, high disposable incomes, demand for hi-tech consumer products, but with relatively undeveloped broadcasting infrastructures and substantial barriers in the trade of entertainment programming because of political or cultural censorship. Wealthy Gulf States were and still are an example here. Their Islamic commitments drove western, particularly Hollywood, entertainment programming and some informational programming from their TV screens. As a consequence an “illegal” window for such programming was provided for by the VCR market. Another hybrid was the ethnic VCR market in wealthy countries. Here commercial dynamics in broadcast TV (and also cable) were generally geared towards reaching a mass audience or profitably narrow-casting within that mass audience. As a consequence of these dynamics mainstream entertainment fare did not sufficiently account for ethnic cultural tastes and the need for programming in ethnic languages. In wealthy open western markets (USA, Australia, Canada, West Germany, Switzerland, UK) and in hybrid wealthy markets (the Gulf states, Singapore) the VCR functioned as an ideal decentralising instrument permitting ethnic minorities and “guest workers” to have their own alternative TV service at no cost to the State. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412443090">O’Regan 1991</xref>: 114)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These three types of market offered producers different kinds of opportunity. Because of their orderly, wealthy, and substantially legal nature, VCR markets in developed countries of the first type were the most significant markets for first world and developing country producers particularly if there was, as for Bollywood producers, a large diaspora in these western countries. Indeed, the VCR must be credited as being a major force in the international corporate integration of entertainment. This is a development that particularly favored Hollywood producers.</p>
<p>Markets of the second and third type present different prospects. There the substantially pirated nature of the video trade makes for negligible returns to producers despite the massive presence on rental and retail shelves of imported programming. The problem was less one of rendering more normal these markets than it was in limiting the affect and consequence of these markets for markets of the first type. Reading surveys of the DVD markets of today, much of this analysis still holds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527476412443090">
<title>Scrambled Social Landscape</title>
<p>In many parts of the world, the VCR and the DVD facilitated unprecedented cultural, social, and market participation in the audiovisual industry by dispersed and disorganized groups of actors. Ganley and Ganley writing in 1987 captured some of the realities of this situation by characterizing the VCR’s first decade as amounting to nothing less than “global political fall-out” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412443090">Ganley and Ganley 1987</xref>). The VCR took formal and informal markets alike to a new level. The DVD and online networks are building on these to intensify the nature, kind, and character of formal and informal markets alike. The result as Sundaram claims is a “scrambled social landscape of fast-moving technologies, mutating networks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412443090">Sundaram 2010</xref>, 132).</p>
<p>The VCR is not, however, far from the longstanding pathways of informal market formation evident in print media. Book publishing has a long and honored history of piracy. U.S. publishing in the nineteenth century, for instance, was a largely pirated affair, with the most popular authors among Americans—Walter Scott and Charles Dickens—receiving no recompense from American publishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412443090">Sassoon 2006</xref>, 359). These publishers behaved in the same way as do today’s video and DVD pirates. In the developing world, a series of analogous technological innovations in printing—1960s technology of cheaper offset printing methods, the 1970s development of the photocopier, and the desktop publishing revolution of the 1980s—not only greatly expanded formal publishing markets in the West but also allowed for greater variety in informal publishing markets elsewhere. The lower barriers to entry and circulation embodied in the new printing technologies ensured publishing could become dispersed and decentralized. Fertile grounds for informal activity were additionally provided by circumstances in which formal publishing markets were either not able to supply copy in a timely fashion or where political arrangements had limited the circulation of particular content, driving underground the printing of controversial material.</p>
<p>Informal cultural markets providing affordable access to valued cultural material in a timely fashion is a longstanding feature of most cultural markets. What is new today is the qualitative ratcheting up of timeliness for cultural materials, particularly feature films. Pirate and formal networks now secure the conditions for near globally synchronous release of sought after feature films and television product.</p>
<p>What we see again and again are some fundamental paradoxes of media technologies like the VCR and offset printing and their successors. These technologies have democratized access to production and distribution by decentralizing and decontrolling the means of production, reproduction, distribution, and exhibition but they have also simultaneously served centralizing and not just decentralizing ends in both formal and informal markets alike. In these media, we see dispersed local and centralized multinational corporate actors mingling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1527476412443090">
<title>Piracy and Pricing</title>
<p>Piracy is not an absence of pricing but an allocation of pricing among market participants. Pirate cultural markets are content markets where consumers not only pay to purchase or rent audiovisual content mostly on a per-unit basis but also pay for the means to exhibit that content and the cost of delivering it to their homes/screening venues. Piracy does not represent a “no payment” system. In it we can see the penetrative power of the price mechanism. It is another example of the tilting toward content market transactions at the expense of advertiser-supported or state-supported broadcasting markets.</p>
<p>We also see in pirated markets an extreme form of long-term trends toward lower payments to content makers on a per unit basis that has accompanied the significant extension in the availability and opportunity for viewing audiovisual content globally. Pirated markets are one variant of the international and national distribution systems that have emerged in both an organized and disorganized fashion to deliver audiovisual content in a timely fashion to global audiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412443090">Ravi Sundaram (2010</xref>, 121) provides a useful example of international reach when in writing about DVD piracy in Delhi he finds “Bombay films are sourced for the pirate market from Dubai and Malaysia, mixed in Pakistan, and sent on the Internet and courier to India” for manufacture. Pirate markets are like formal markets in that they are characterized by both long and short extensions through places and spaces—and they operate in a “landscape” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412443090">Sundaram (2010</xref>, 132) contends which produces “neither classic criminal subjects, nor classic criminal acts” and for which there is no clear boundary between the legal and the pirate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, pirate markets are not the only cultural markets in which returns for sellers and costs to buyers factor in limited to no returns to content owners and more returns to other market participants. Certainly piracy was enabled by both the ease with which content could be reproduced via video, DVD, and computers and the ready public availability of instruments facilitating its circulation whether through the postal and transportation systems or through telecommunications networks. But this should not obscure the ways in which in many cultural markets around the world prior to and subsequent on the advent of low-cost and domestically available video technology were cultural markets in which there were limited and in some cases no returns coming back to content producers.</p>
<p>In many television markets, for instance, distributors made TV content available at low prices particularly during its set-up period. This was and remains the case in the developing world but continues to be a feature of broadcast markets in the developed world. In the 1960s, for instance, Australian TV drama production houses were making their content available to New Zealand TV at or below cost of making a copy. We have only to remember the complaint of many intellectuals and aspirant TV producers about their national cultural markets being turned into a “dumping ground” as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412443090">Akindele et al.’s (2002)</xref> complaint that “Africa has been turned into a dumping ground where people increasingly consume an abundance of products that have little connection to their struggle for existence (for example, Literature, Movies, Music).” Sellers of content have taken a long view. They have seen the presence of their content as priming the audience and creating a demand that could lead to eventual higher prices. Such market priming remains a feature of today’s entertainment content and software markets. In much of the developing world, TV content continues to be made available at low to no cost in “official” markets in this way.</p>
<p>Many cinema markets combine formal and informal elements. Film license holders are well used to box-office under- and non-reporting and print theft. In 2010 <italic>Variety</italic> was reporting that in Russia, for instance, under-reporting by between a third and a half of box-office receipts was widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412443090">Holdsworth 2010</xref>). By the same token, in many of their regularized international markets in cinema and TV the Hollywood majors have been comfortable with arrangements advantaging foreign domestic exhibitors and TV stations more than do comparable domestic arrangements benefit U.S. exhibitors and networks. This not only kept foreign exhibitors and networks happy but turned them into a useful lobbying force for Hollywood’s presence and interests on cinema and TV schedules.</p>
<p>Embodied here is the recognition that as cultural materials travel across national borders there is an inevitable cultural discount associated with this transnational movement (for a discussion of cultural discount see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412443090">Hoskins and Mirus 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476412443090">Wildman and Siwek 1988</xref>). There is also an underlying pricing reality to this transnational circulation in that without the purchasers of imported content having a “greater profit share there would be no incentive to import, and import substitution dynamics would emerge, leading to an overall reduction in the export market” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412443090">O’Regan 1993</xref>, 61). Certainly the Hollywood majors always played harder ball in English-language territories and the larger European markets sometimes pushing so hard that as in Australia in the mid-1960s higher prices demanded by U.S. producers led to an Australian program buying strike on the part of Australian TV networks to drive down import prices and to the commissioning of more Australian drama content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412443090">Moran 1985</xref>, 30). There is a continuum between these settled relationships in television and cinema that could entail few and sometimes no returns for content owners and the arrangements that sprung up in the wake of the VCR and later DVD and online. What was new was the scale and diversity of what was now possible informally and formally.</p>
<p>What was groundbreaking about VCR markets in this context was that they overturned the time-based systems of staggered release in film and TV both within the nation and internationally. The VCR’s and now DVD’s decentralized and readily reproducible character rendered timeliness important to the performance of both formal and informal markets. The informal markets of both the VCR era and today are driven by a mix of pricing, availability, and timeliness. Piracy lived where there was a difference in the release dates for films and TV programs for which there was a demand. It therefore assisted in turning release into a global phenomenon characterized by greater simultaneity. This helped reframe the nature of the cinema window: until the VCR differentiations within cinema exhibition were achieved by time bars between screenings in different kinds of cinema and in different countries. Piracy also affected prices that could be charged. Too high prices encouraged piracy. The VCR revolution significantly extended the timely viewing of audiovisual product (including Hollywood product) globally.</p>
<p>“Piracy” was also fundamental to the spread of VCR rentals and sell-through markets. Early VCR rental shops that sprung up on a neighborhood level in the late 1970s and early 1980s needed pirated tapes. Demand had so run ahead of supply that too few feature films were made available in the early years of the VCR. But these same VCR rental proprietors over a few short years became staunch advocates of piracy controls as a way of creating effective barriers to entry to new neighborhood players. These “early adopters” pioneered the form. Because there were low to nonexistent fees paid to producers, the “most expensive” part of the system—the receiving and playing equipment was able to be “more affordable”—that is, through piracy content producers were effectively subsidizing and accelerating the extension of VCR markets through social space. The trick for the film industry was always to find some way of subsequently making these markets legal and using the emerging “micro-payments” system to advantage by capitalizing on scale economies secured through sales across national territories.</p>
<p>The VCR and DVD increased a trend evident in television before it of a shift in “rents and profits” from the content providers to the distributors and exhibitors and hardware providers in cultural markets. Particular investments in the plant and equipment were typically made by consumers but also by distributors and exhibitors. Broadcast TV required expensive TV sets and expensive transmission facilities. The consumer sets on sale in the early days were incredibly expensive compared to prices today. And that set a pattern we could see in record players and later VCR players and the like: that of consumers paying for playing and receiving. Furthermore broadcast TV was setting a precedent that the “consumer” would not only need to purchase the “playing” equipment but also the “reception” equipment. That is, the consumer was paying for the most expensive link of all: the link into the home. This pattern of price and profit shifting is familiar to us with the VCR and now DVD and internet. There is something of a significant continuity between the consumer paying for the reception and playing equipment with TV, VCR and DVD and with them paying for their computers, playing devices, and internet connections.</p>
<p>Indeed we can see the current telecommunications payments of people as a remarkable intensification of these processes such that they are now paying substantially for the “connection.” This characteristic of cultural markets is the other side of the long-term trend for the “content-provider” to get less and less proportionally of the take. This pattern is evident too in wider retail trends as pricing margins contract for mass-produced commodities like food and cars. To be able to bear lower margins, producers and distributors not only need deeper pockets but large markets to spread the risk and develop feasible returns. It is not surprising then that those who have benefited most from the VCR and DVD were entities with highly developed coordination and control functions capable of commanding a dispersed international system like the Hollywood Majors.</p>

<title>The Interaction of Formal and Informal Markets</title>
<p>Much of the anxiety over piracy comes from its spill-over effects on more formal markets. This is the concern for pirated product entering largely legal markets and undercutting prices. But this is only one side of the story. There is as much anxiety over the spill-over effects of pricing in one market having an impact on pricing in adjacent markets. This interaction of formal markets is often of as much concern as is the concern for piracy. Sometimes the real concern is not piracy at all but the integrity of the system of territorial copyright substantially undercut by VCR’s and DVD’s propensities for circulation. Hollywood’s concern for parallel imports particularly from Malaysia and Singapore in the late 1980s and early 1990s was really about the maintenance of price differentials between Singapore and Malaysia on the one hand and its valuable Australian market on the other. The worry here was not so much piracy but with how VCR was eroding the territorial copyright systems—and, most particularly, the price differentials able to be maintained between Asian Singapore and Malaysia and Anglo Australia. This was a concern that tapes and DVDs both legitimate and pirated purchased in Southeast Asia for one price would turn up in the Australian market undercutting the higher prices paid for the same item.</p>
<p>DVD and online media actors have made various attempts to engineer a way of keeping price differentials that take account of cultural discounts and capacity to pay—the attempt to zone DVD players provides a case in point. Australia’s zone was purposely not with its geographically proximate Southeast and East Asian counterparts, it was shared with Latin America. But the very porousness and leakage of the VCR, DVD, and now online technologies makes these attempted technological fixes of limited consequence. The other solution is price standardization. There has been a noticeable move toward global pricing for premium product, with the “same price” being charged across the system regardless of circumstance. Such pricing is becoming a feature of DVD and cinema markets and seems a direct corollary of global circulation in a timely fashion. But much of the world cannot pay these premium prices. This can only encourage bifurcated markets where an elite able to afford such prices pays the “international standard rate” in upmarket multiplexes while a general public consumes the same fare in pirated markets.</p>
<p>In the older system, the passage of time marked lower prices. Suburban cinema and drive-in tickets were lower priced than their inner city counterparts but the catch was you saw the movie some months later. Many countries (e.g., Turkey, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476412443090">Ogan 1988</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476412443090">1989</xref>) would see Hollywood releases a year or two after their American release. In TV, pricing also related directly to time. Access to product was guaranteed but at a cost of receiving “older” programming. With the VCR, global simultaneity became possible. But again we are not just seeing something new. Since the 1960s, the trend in broadcast and cinema markets has been for the amount of time between cinema and TV screening to contract. This trend accelerates after the twin advent of the VCR and pay-TV from the mid-1970s. So too the new wave of suburban multiplex in Western markets began eliminating traditional distinctions between inner city and suburban release from the early 1980s. Simultaneity more than anything else raises the problem for our established ways of using the passage of time to differentiate price structures globally.</p>

<title>Hybrid Arrangements of the Virtual and the Physical</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412443090">William Boddy (2008)</xref> suggests that the “format wars” over high-definition DVD are perhaps the last of the format wars to be about physical media. While there is a conceptual neatness to this logic, it is too soon to write an epitaph for physical media. Its conjunction with virtual media may be especially powerful. This is not just because much of the world is, at best, only now moving partially online. It is also because the combination of the virtual and physical presents a potent commercial and public mix whose possibilities are far from exhausted. The joining together of the virtual and the physical is fundamental to legit and pirated DVD markets alike. It is a combination calibrated not only to habits of purchase and consumption but is often the most efficient way of reaching geographically dispersed publics. We can expect a range of hybrid arrangements of the virtual and physical to continue to characterize software and hardware, content and equipment markets.</p>
<p>From the retail point of view, online and physical shop-front trading do not represent a straightforward either/or in content and equipment markets. The two are not simply competitors. They can amplify each other. Apple’s physical investment in high-profile Apple shops in high streets globally was designed to amplify its online business and vice-versa. Similarly the online sale of audiovisual content and the physical store-front purchase and rental of the same may be just as similarly tied to each other as mechanisms for the distributing of content to paying and nonpaying audiences alike.</p>
<p>We have longstanding business models in the publishing and VCR markets for such combinations. Indeed, the DVD is a place where the bringing together of new efficiencies associated with the interpenetration of online and physical media is writ large. The co-persistence of the physical and immaterial elements has, as noted above, been a feature of contemporary DVD markets and DVD manufacture. This combination has enabled near simultaneous release of materials as global circulation has become calibrated to people’s habits and use not only of media but of public spaces.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s in newspaper publishing, national newspapers (and international magazines) have been published in different cities (and countries) based on “electronic” transmission of newspaper copy and subsequent printing in diverse locations. Such distributed physical print making stitched together through electronic transmission goes back to the mid-nineteenth century when the telegraph in decisively severing the link between transportation and communication transformed the newspaper with press agency/wire service copy, making up a significant component of newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412443090">Carey 1989</xref>, 201-30). We sometimes forget that this intermixing of the physical and the electronic has characterized much of our media history over the past 150 years in a number of different media.</p>
<p>The combination of the online and the physical is taking different forms in audiovisual markets. It is integral to DVD manufacture and sale; it is becoming one basis for digital cinema exhibition. The retail options of buying a DVD and downloading a movie rely on different kinds of shopping experience and impulse buying. The growth of DVD was enabled through a shift away from rental markets to direct purchase markets as video sales moved to becoming the core business of former high street record stores, sections of book stores, apartment stores, and streetmarkets—and even strategic placement for impulse supermarket and service stations buying. This retail diffusion has been critical to direct sales becoming the most significant component of DVD sales.</p>
<p>Certainly for much of the world the capacity to efficiently deliver cultural product in a timely fashion to geographically dispersed publics relies on and is likely to continue to rely on some combination of “electronic” transfer and physical transport as with the striking of DVD copies where such combinations are fundamental to the geography of DVD printing and distribution.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Remembering the VCR and connecting it to later physical media (DVD) and online media developments provides us with a way of thinking about media transformation. My focus in this article has been to identify longstanding market processes and characteristics linking physical and online media, analogue and digital media. It has explored what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412443090">Innis (1938</xref>, 302) called the “characteristics of production, distribution, and consumption” of cultural commodities persisting across time.</p>
<p>While media transformations, particularly in screen and online media, are much discussed at policy and scholarly levels, we typically understand them in terms of the particularity of a given media transformation—usually highly visible and system-wide influencing change in media like DVD, internet downloading or the transition from analogue to digital. Consequently we pay considerable and almost exclusive attention to <italic>recent</italic> transformations with our focus on new communication technologies and platforms, to the <italic>current</italic> dramatic expansion of existing media, to the <italic>contemporary</italic> versions of the increasing blurring of the boundaries among screen media (cinema, TV, cable-satellite, internet, DVD and video games), and to the <italic>present-day</italic> versions of the increasingly globalised media sphere whose impacts that are reaching down further into the routine organization of media industries than have previous internationalization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412443090">Katz &amp; Scannell 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412443090">Debrett 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412443090">Jenkins 2006</xref>). By contrast, the perspective advanced here identifies continuities among diverse media changes overlooked when the focus is on the visible and evident. Such a perspective provides a corrective to presentist assumptions about the unprecedented character of change.</p>
<p>By remembering video and connecting it to both earlier and later developments, I have positioned contemporary media transformation as less sui generis than as part of larger regularities. They are another turn in an old story of how the global media system is being managed and not managed, arranged and rearranged. This perspective enables us to see conjunctions and continuities where we might otherwise claim discontinuities. Informal cultural markets are not new and might be best thought of as adaptations formed to meet the always contingent historical circumstances of production, distribution, and exhibition.</p>
<p>I began by suggesting that cultural markets globally exhibit diverse characteristics of production, distribution, and consumption. We sometimes think of globalization as cohering the global system by regularizing cultural markets and moderating market behavior. But the creation of shared norms, processes, and practices are just one feature of globalizing cultural markets. Another notable feature evident in both the VCR and DVD is the generation of systemic differences and disjunctions among markets suggesting disorganized “organization and control” operating at multiple levels of formality and informality. Our new technologies are not just better cohering national cultural markets into seamless international markets but are also creating greater diversity and greater irregularity. In this situation, we need to understand the varieties of both formal and informal cultural markets. It may well be the case that our cultural markets are less alike than they were once.</p>
