<p>The stated purpose of this text is addressing the challenge of encapsulating the complexity of defining Human Information Interaction (HII). HII, for readers unfamiliar with the term, focuses on the interaction element of the relationship. As an area HII spans the areas of Human Information Behaviour, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Informatics, Human Factors and Information Retrieval. The author acknowledges the complexity of representing human information processes and takes a cognitive work analysis approach to translating the body of knowledge and search into something that might translate into real impacts on systems design.</p>
<p>The book’s Preface captures the author’s enthusiasm and drive towards finding an understanding of the world using an ecological model and the cognitive work analysis method. The philosophical stance underpinning this approach draws on Marxism and feminism. These key underpinnings to the text suggest that, even though ideas exist for ways to improve systems design and human information interactions, the reality for the research is that real implementations are going to be driven by the market and by circumstances. Few would disagree with these thoughts: research and the real world have different drives. The Preface also offers a nice discussion of the relationship between methods and philosophical approaches to research that may be of use to doctoral students in contextualising this work.</p>
<p>Throughout the text there is a delicate balance in reading this work as a product of Marxist-feminist interpretation and challenging the reader: a balance which is good overall as old assumptions and non-challenging texts tend to undermine further innovations and development. Challenges apart the book is dedicated towards the same goals that everyone who has done research in this broad field might also seek: those of improving systems and of having research with impact.</p>
<p>The audience for the book is everyone who is interested in HII from any discipline. Aimed at such a wide audience, the book aims to provide an exploration and discussion of this field and to draw different avenues together in a series of structured discussion chapters. The chapters begin with basic concepts moving onto what HII is and the conceptual and theoretical constructs pertinent to the area. The themes of information-seeking behaviour, information need and the decision ladder, five search strategies, and conceptual traditions in human information behaviour are then addressed. Via these chapters the reader is invited to engage with a critique of the literature and its assumptions, weaknesses and key frameworks. The critique is very useful and in each chapter there is a sufficient amount of detail without quite fully encompassing the whole of the literature, the size of the book itself necessitating some brevity.</p>
<p>The chapters that really begin to make this book a worthwhile read are those on ‘Cognitive work analysis dimensions for analysis’ and ‘Cognitive work analysis harnessing complexity’ as these unravel and explain something of the method that might be applied to this area in the future. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612468819">Vicente (1999)</xref>, as the key text underpinning cognitive work analysis, is explained well and the various elements, such as dealing with actors not users, have strengths which are explored. The final two chapters offering a ‘Summary of an ecological approach to information behaviour’ and ‘Enhancing the impact of research in human information interaction’ are useful in highlighting some key themes and needs for researchers.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that this is a monograph and as such is focused on the shape of ideas coming from one author, the scope is still fantastic and there is enough here to link beyond the text with the provision of excellent endnotes. As a totality this book is more than the sum of its chapters: it is an interesting and in places challenging read. It does something that few texts achieve: it makes one think about things differently. This is certainly a text that I would feel comfortable recommending to higher degree students navigating their way into the field, and it is also suitable for colleagues in its many sub-disciplines who are seeking to find a way to develop research that has impact.</p>
<p>The book should raise questions and inspire critical thought about core principles and propositions and it will no doubt trouble those with different perspectives. However, to raise critical thought and questioning are in my opinion the best outcomes for a text, and for this reason the book should be on many reading lists.</p>
