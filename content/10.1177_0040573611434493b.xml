<p><italic>God’s Almost Chosen Peoples: A Religious History of the American Civil War</italic></p>
<p>George C. Rable</p>
<p>Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2010. 600 pp. $35.00</p>
<p>George C. Rable teaches Southern history at the University of Alabama and is the author of several books relating to the American Civil War, including <italic>Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!</italic>, which won the Lincoln Prize in 2003. His most recent book, <italic>God’s Almost Chosen Peoples</italic>, traces religious views starting from the 1830s through the last year of the American Civil War. Rable pieces together divergent narratives, drawing upon extensive research of sermons, denominational journals, newspaper articles, and diaries. The end result is more a collage than a portrait of an era. Themes emerge, divine providence being a prominent one. At the onset of the war, in both the Union and the Confederate states, preachers and laity alike declare signs of God’s favor. Their conviction about God’s plan gives way to uncertainty as battles are won and lost, with no immediate outcome in sight. Even when the war draws to a close, citizens of the devastated Southern states try to make sense of what they perceive to be God’s punishment, while Lincoln’s assassination provides new mystery surrounding God’s intentions for the North.</p>
<p>How does the author give credence to these musings when modern historiography of the American Civil War consistently steers clear of the religious motivations behind that cataclysm? The first step is to give them voice. And for that readers may be grateful to Rable, for he has presented several religious voices: Roman Catholic, Episcopalian, Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, and even Jewish. These are voices reporting from the battlefield, from the pulpit, from military hospitals, and from the relative comforts of home.</p>
<p>Most of these voices are unfamiliar to all but a few scholars, yet they shed important light on the complex relationship between religion and politics during that era. There is, for instance, the case of Samuel B. McPheeters, an Old School Presbyterian pastor in the border state of Missouri, who in 1862 rejected the notion that the denomination owed any allegiance to the civil authorities (320). McPheeters’ stance was viewed as disloyalty to the Union, and he was banned from preaching by General Samuel R. Curtis. Only a year before such a stance of neutrality was tolerated, but not when the war was in full swing.</p>
<p>There are familiar voices as well, but even here the focus is shifted off center. In what is arguably the best chapter in the book, titled “War’s Purpose,” Rable recounts Lincoln’s deliberations over the Emancipation Proclamation. This proclamation is often seen as the crowning achievement of Lincoln’s presidency, because it officially declared the end of legalized slavery in the South. However, what most intrigues Rable in this chapter is the variety of views church leaders held on the purpose of the war, both in the North and the South. From our perspective almost 150 years later, Lincoln’s legislative decision stands out as a moment of clarity. Religious leaders at the time, however, often had different views. One would expect Northern churches to have embraced the proclamation, but concerns over riots and social unrest sometimes dampened support.</p>
<p><italic>God’s Almost Chosen Peoples</italic> rewards the patient reader who is interested in the religious dimensions of the Civil War. By Rable’s own admission this is not a thesis-driven work. The book contains no overarching argument about the role of religion in the war; its organizing principle is chronological. Chapter headings do provide a rationale for the grouping of material in that chapter, but sometimes even this is a stretch. For instance, in a chapter titled “Jubilo,” Rable writes, “The long festering slavery question was reaching a glorious, complicated, spectacular, disappointing, and still unpredictable climax” (278). Is the chapter title then ironic? Should it be followed by a question mark? The answer may be that when we move from a bird’s-eye view of the war to a multi-perspectival ground’s-eye view, things get messy. Rable is in this work doing the same kind of thing embedded reporters did when last decade’s Iraqi war was going full throttle. He covers the war from the trenches, through the prism of religion, and it is disturbing, enlightening, and confusing all at the same time.</p>
