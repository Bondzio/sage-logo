<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To determine prevalence of exposure to bullying in an adolescent/young adult gynecology population, whether pelvic pain is an associated somatic complaint, and if health care providers are viewed as a resource. <italic>Methods</italic>. An anonymous self-reporting survey about exposure to bullying, somatic and mental health symptoms, and disclosure patterns was given to 224 consecutive gynecology patients aged 15 to 24 years in a suburban practice. <italic>Results</italic>. Prevalence of exposure as a bully, victim, witness, or combination was 80.5%. Missing school for pelvic pain was significantly greater in the bully–victim–witness and victim–witness groups. Taking medication for depression or anxiety was significantly greater in the bully–victim–witness group. No one disclosed bullying exposure to a health care provider. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Gynecologists see large numbers of patients exposed to bullying. Patients exposed in combinations of bully, victim, and witness have increased frequency of pelvic pain, depression, and anxiety. Patients do not disclose exposure to bullying to health care providers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The adverse effects of school-age bullying are evidenced by an ever-increasing amount of research data. Bullying is aggressive behavior by an individual or group with the intention to do harm; the behavior is repetitive and involves an imbalance of power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812468207">1</xref></sup> The act of bullying can take various forms, including physical, verbal, and psychological. These actions cause injury, fear, and/or emotional distress consistent with other forms of abuse. Prevalence data of bullying reveal that it begins in elementary school (21%), peaks in middle school (43%), and continues through high school (22%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812468207">2</xref></sup> Exposure to bullying can occur as a bully, victim, witness, or combination thereof. When witnesses are included, exposure to bullying has been reported at numbers up to 72%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812468207">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812468207">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fekkes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812468207">5</xref></sup> observed that bullying victims’ symptoms resemble those associated with victims of child abuse. A variety of psychosomatic complaints has been associated with victims, including headache, sleeping problems, abdominal pain, enuresis, and fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812468207">5</xref></sup> It has also been shown that bullies and bully–victims (defined as those who both bully and are bullied) are also at a significantly higher risk of suffering from somatic symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812468207">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812468207">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effects on mental health for bullies, victims, and bully-victims have been described and confirmed in numerous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812468207">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812468207">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812468207"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812468207"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812468207"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812468207">12</xref></sup> Both victims and bullies are at high risk for depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts; bully-victims are at the highest risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812468207">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812468207">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812468207">14</xref></sup> More recently, the effects on witnesses have been studied, with outcomes similar to what has been reported for victims and some research indicating even greater mental health risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812468207">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812468207">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812468207">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812468207"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812468207"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812468207">18</xref></sup> As with victims, long-term psychological impact has been shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812468207">18</xref></sup> Students with multiple roles (any combination of victim, bully, witness) are at higher risk of suicidal ideation than those with singular roles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812468207">4</xref></sup> Girls are more likely to internalize mental health problems and somatic complaints, as well as experience an increase in both types of symptoms with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812468207">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812468207">20</xref></sup> Bullies have been reported to have higher rates of delinquent behavior, drug and alcohol abuse, and a sense of not belonging to school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812468207">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812468207">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812468207">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gynecologists will see patients with both current and past exposure to bullying. All exposed individuals are at risk for sequelae including depression, loneliness, anxiety, school avoidance, low self-esteem, and posttraumatic stress disorder.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0009922812468207">*</xref> This study describes the prevalence of exposure to bullying in an adolescent/young adult gynecology population in a suburban private practice setting. Our first hypothesis was that young women seen in our gynecology office would self-report bullying at numbers previously reported in school-based studies. We hypothesized there would be a correlation between self-reported victims of bullying and pelvic pain. We also hypothesized that adolescents exposed to bullying would not view health care providers as a resource.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study was granted exemption status by the Human Investigation Committee of William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, as no personal identifiers or protected health information was collected. The study was conducted at a suburban private office from May 2010 through August 2010. Consecutive gynecology patients between 15 and 24 years old were asked to fill out a brief anonymous survey. In addition to self-provided demographic data, the survey asked 10 questions, 5 of which offered the opportunity for multiple answers. The survey was filled out in the privacy of an exam room before a health care provider was seen. The completed survey was placed in an envelope by the patient and then into a larger envelope inside a drawer. Patients who did not wish to participate were asked to draw a line through the survey and place it in the envelopes as noted above. Age-appropriate definitions and examples were provided.</p>
<p>Demographic data included age, weight, and height. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as (weight in lb/[height in inches]<sup>2</sup>) × 703. Patients were queried if they were being seen for a routine exam, pain, or other; had ever missed school for recurring or persistent pain secondary to headaches, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and/or abdominal pain; and were taking medication for depression, dysmenorrhea, birth control, migraines/headaches, sleep problems, and/or anxiety.</p>
<p>Survey questions inquired if they had ever been bullied, bullied someone, or witnessed bullying. If they answered yes to any of those questions, then they were asked when it occurred: elementary, middle school, high school, and/or college. Patients were also asked about the reason(s) for the bullying: appearance, race, ability, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, household income, unknown, or other. If the patient had been bullied or was a witness, they were asked if they had told any of the following: parent, peer, teacher, other school personnel, physician, other health care provider, or no one. Last, all were asked if they thought telling a health care provider about bullying would be helpful.</p>
<p>Groups for statistical analysis were created and identified using the following terms: <italic>bully, victim</italic>, and <italic>witness</italic>. These terms will be used consistent with previous research.</p>

<p>Not all participants answered all questions. As there were no obvious patterns among data that were missing, missing data were considered to be missing completely at random. Groups C, D, E, F, G, H, and I were mutually exclusive subsets of group A, whereas group B consisted of those with no exposure as defined above.</p>
<p>Continuous variables including demographic data such as age, height, weight, and BMI, were summarized using means ± standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum and were compared among the nonexposed group and all subgroups of A, using one-way analysis of variance based on the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages and compared using either the 2-tailed Fisher’s exact test or Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> test, wherever appropriate. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also computed wherever appropriate.</p>
<p><italic>P</italic> values less than α of .05 (probability of type I error) were considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS system for Windows version 9.2.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 224 surveys were distributed and returned. Six were excluded because they were not eligible based on age criteria and 3 chose not to fill out the survey for a nonresponse rate of 1.4%.</p>
<p>The exposed group comprised 80.5% of the total study population, the nonexposed group 19.5%. The exposure subgroups were as follows: victims 1.4%, bully–witness 2.8%, witness 44.2%, victim–witness 15.3%, bully–victim–witness 16.7%, both bully and bully–victim 0%.</p>
<p>Demographic data did not yield any differences between the groups with regard to age, weight, or BMI. Comparison of height (inches) revealed a significant difference, with group F (bully–witness) being the tallest (67.3 ± 1.9). The next tallest was group I (bully–victim–witness’ 66.0 ± 3.1), the only other group that contained bullies (<italic>P</italic> = .01). Group B (not exposed) was 64.1 ± 2.5, group C (victim) 63.0 ± 2.7, and group H (victim–witness) 64.4 ± 2.6.</p>
<p>In the exposure group, 46.5% were exposed to bullying in elementary school, 84.9% in middle school, 58.7% in high school, and 13.4% in college. A statistically significant proportion of group G (witness only) was exposed in elementary school and middle school (<italic>P</italic> = .03); and a statistically significant proportion of group I (bully–victim–witness) was exposed in college (<italic>P</italic> = .001; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812468207">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, young women in our gynecology practice self-reported bullying at percentages similar to those in school-based studies. Identification as witness only was the most common subgroup, followed by bully–victim–witness and victim–witness. Comparable frequencies have been reported with similarly defined subgroups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812468207">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this study was confined to one suburban private practice, non-Medicaid population, the prevalence and reasons given for bullying are congruent with previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812468207">8</xref></sup> In this study, where individuals could self-identify multiple roles, there were no self-reported exclusive bullies or bully–victims, and only 3 sole victims. There exists the possibility that the study population, patients in a physician’s office, is different from students in a classroom setting. However, there are no similarly designed studies for comparative purposes per PubMed database search (search terms “bullying survey,” “physician,” and “office”). These data may simply reflect the pervasiveness and complexity of the bullying culture that exists in schools.</p>
<p>The demographic data showed significant differences in height. Group F (bully–witness) was the tallest group, the second tallest was group I (bully–victim–witness). Unlike boys, girls typically engage in indirect bullying (social exclusion, verbal, psychological)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812468207">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812468207">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812468207">22</xref></sup> and have not been described as physically larger than victims. The difference in height appears to be a unique finding. Additional data are needed to delineate whether female perpetrators are often physically taller or stronger than their victims and whether this information is clinically useful.</p>
<p>Our data confirm bullying beginning in elementary school, peaking in middle school, and declining in high school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812468207">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812468207">8</xref></sup> The data also reveal bullying in college. Although the study asked when bullying exposure occurred vis-à-vis the educational setting, college-age participants (75% of the total group) were not specifically asked if they attended college. It is, therefore, noteworthy that more than 13% of study participants reported exposure in college. A significant proportion of those exposed were members of group I (bully–victim–witness), indicating a particularly high-risk population. There has been limited research aimed at determining the prevalence of bullying at institutions of higher education; however, a witness rate of 60%, bully rate of approximately 20%, and a victim rate of 21% to 25% have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812468207">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812468207">24</xref></sup> Health care providers should be aware that women attending college may exhibit symptoms of past or current exposure.</p>
<p>A PubMed database search (search terms “bullying” and “pelvic pain”) failed to reveal a study where an association between bullying and pelvic pain was explored or identified. In the current study, when patients were asked if they missed school for specific reasons, pelvic pain was significant for group H (victim–witness) and group I (bully–victim–witness). Abdominal pain was also significant for group H. As these are cross-sectional data, it is not possible to show causality for exposure to bullying and somatic health complaints. However, physicians who are caring for young women with pelvic and/or abdominal pain should consider exposure to bullying as a possible etiology or exacerbating factor. When an abuse history is being elicited as part of a focused evaluation for pain, bullying should be specified, as patients may not interpret bullying as abuse and not communicate the history.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that a significant proportion of respondents taking medication for depression and/or anxiety are members of group I (bully–victim–witness). This finding likely represents an underreporting of the true prevalence of depression and anxiety as it only identifies those patients on medication. In an evidence review for the US Preventive Services Task Force, it was reported that the majority of depressed youth do not receive any treatment. During adolescent primary care visits in which depression was reported, antidepressants were prescribed 52% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812468207">25</xref></sup> For gynecologists whose young patients are taking these medications or exhibiting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, exposure to bullying should be investigated.</p>
<p>Victims and/or witnesses in this study were most likely to tell a peer about bullying. Studies have shown that friendship can decrease victimization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812468207">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812468207">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812468207">27</xref></sup> and physician awareness of socially isolated patients may increase identification of those at risk. Twenty-five percent of victims and/or witnesses told their teachers. A school environment where teachers are perceived to be supportive has been shown to increase help-seeking behavior for bullying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812468207">28</xref></sup> Physicians should consider that their perceived attitude may influence disclosure when screening for exposure to bullying.</p>
<p>The last hypothesis was based on the authors’ experience of screening for abuse for more than 15 years. During that time frame, no patient had ever disclosed bullying, even when specifically asked about physical or emotional abuse. In this study, no participant who had been bullied or was a witness to bullying had ever told a health care provider. Only 41.7% of the entire study group and 37% of the exposed group thought a health care provider would be helpful. This mind-set exists in spite of policies addressing bullying that are promulgated by several medical organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812468207">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812468207"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812468207"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922812468207">32</xref></sup> Our data suggest that physicians, individually and collectively, must promote themselves as a resource directly to patients.</p>
<p>Self-reporting retrospective data collection is inherent in studies on this topic, although the time frame of recall may vary. This study inquired about exposure to bullying that may have occurred over a decade in the past, thus the data are subject to recall bias. There has been precedent with this duration of recall in studies exploring reactions of bystanders and victims to repetitive abuse, where young adults are questioned about childhood or adolescent experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812468207">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812468207">18</xref></sup> Additionally, traumatic stress symptoms have been reported to recede over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922812468207">33</xref></sup> Given the psychological impact of bullying, especially when it occurs at the developmentally vulnerable time of childhood and adolescence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922812468207">34</xref></sup> it seems less likely that exposure was overreported.</p>
<p>This study did not determine the percentage of young women who would disclose to a health care provider with screening. However, the prevalence of bullying dictates that all young patients should be screened for exposure, as they are for other forms of abuse. The risk of sequelae does not end when the exposure does, as longitudinal studies have shown. Among victims, studies have found higher levels of depression and poorer self-esteem at 23 years of age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812468207">1</xref></sup> as well as an association of suicidal ideation persisting across all ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922812468207">35</xref></sup> Gynecologists have the opportunity to identify victims, witnesses, and bullies and to provide support, referral, and/or encouragement to tell a parent/guardian or other trusted adult.</p>
<p>Providers need to be aware of the resources in their communities in order to refer patients in need of psychological support or evaluation. Physician identification of a young woman’s exposure to bullying affords the opportunity to decrease her risk of mental health or somatic sequelae. For many young women, a gynecologist is the only health care provider they see; it is therefore incumbent on gynecologists to inquire about exposure to bullying to all school- and college-age patients, given that it is endemic in this population. Such inquiries are particularly important as part of an evaluation for pelvic or abdominal pain, depression, and/or anxiety.</p>
