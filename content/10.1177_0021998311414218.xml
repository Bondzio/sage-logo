<abstract>
<p>The emergence of new high-performance thermoplastics to replace thermosets in fiber-reinforced polymers puts up a new challenge: their machining. In this study, carbon fiber-reinforced poly-cyclic butylene terephthalate laminates were manufactured, drilled, and inspected. Different commercial drill geometries and machining conditions were compared. Roughness, microscopy, and non-destructive tests allowed us to determine the hole quality as well as delamination. The surface tests showed better results after working at the most common cutting speed (3000 rpm) than at high speed (15,000 rpm) with a constant feed rate. This fact can be explained based on the viscoelastic properties of the matrix that becomes fragile at high cutting speeds. The Delamination factor obtained by means of Ultrasonics and X-ray Computed Tomography also confirmed that the best results are achieved with a Twist drill bit at 3000 rpm. In contrast to carbon fiber-reinforced thermosets, the detected delamination at high cutting speeds is not as remarkable as expected. These results allow us to conclude that this new composite will certainly increase production rate without delamination damage. Chip formation takes also a special role. It can be recovered to be used as reinforcement in manufacturing processes due to the recyclability of the thermoplastic matrix.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311414218" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) are becoming widely used in the manufacturing of products where a high mechanical strength must be accompanied by a low weight. Consequently, these composite materials can be found in industrial sectors such as aeronautical, automotive, railway, naval, or wind-power.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the research projects are focusing on developing low-viscosity thermoplastics in order to replace thermosets in high fiber content composites. Isothermally polymerized cyclic butylene terephthalate (pCBT) is a promising thermoplastic which can be manufactured by resin transfer molding (RTM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311414218">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311414218">2</xref></sup> The obtained laminates have improved toughness and impact resistance, and they can also be thermoformed and recycled. On the other hand, a new challenge is created: their machining.</p>
<p>Due to their anisotropy and heterogeneity, machining of CFRPs implies coping with problems that are not encountered when machining other materials. In most cases, a composite part needs to be assembled to other parts, either in a composite or in a different material (steel, aluminum alloys, wood, etc.) and mechanical joining (rods, pins, fasteners, etc.) is the solution commonly adopted. The holes required by mechanical joining are generally drilled in the semi-finished composite part. Drilling is a particularly critical operation for CFRP laminates because the large concentrated forces generated can lead to widespread damage. This damage causes esthetic problems but, more seriously, may compromise the mechanical properties of the finished part.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311414218">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311414218">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mechanics of drilling composite materials has been studied along with the quality of the hole and the effects of tool geometry, tool material, and cutting conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311414218">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311414218">9</xref></sup> The main types of structural damage generated during drilling of polymeric matrix composites are delamination, microcracks, fiber–matrix debonding, matrix cratering, and thermal damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311414218">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311414218">11</xref></sup> Delamination is probably the most common type of structural damage causing concern, which is induced during the drilling process of fiber-reinforced composite materials. Owing to the drill thrust force, the different layers of the composite are prone to delamination, the exit layers being the most vulnerable ones.</p>
<p>Different techniques and parameters can be used to assess and model the damage caused by drilling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311414218">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311414218">15</xref></sup> Sophisticated non-destructive techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311414218">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311414218">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311414218">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311414218">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311414218">18</xref></sup> can be employed in addition to low-magnification microscopy in order to identify internal defects, while destructive techniques are rarely employed. Moreover, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be used to observe the cut surface morphology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311414218">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ultrasonic C-scan is a well-known non-destructive inspection technology and it has been widely used for composite delamination measurement, especially in the aeronautical sector. However, the C-scan based delamination measurement poses up several hole-interference-related problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311414218">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311414218">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311414218">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311414218">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311414218">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, the X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) technology offers the capability to obtain a 3D image of a sample uncovering internal information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311414218">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311414218">22</xref></sup> The resolution of the reconstructed CT image depends on the overall sample size. In order to evaluate the delamination damage in a drilled hole, a X-ray CT reconstruction with a relatively high resolution is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311414218">23</xref></sup> Thus, although the X-ray CT is in essence a non-destructive technique, the preparation of specific single-hole samples is necessary. Although this decreases the applicability of the X-ray CT technique, it can be thoroughly used to provide high-resolution reference results.</p>
<p>In this article, different drill geometries and drilling parameters of carbon fiber-reinforced pCBT laminates are investigated in order to find the most accurate tool and machining conditions. Traditional tests such as optical microscopy, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), and surface roughness-metry are combined with non destructive inspection techniques such as ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray CT. The aim of this study is to detect suspected delamination as well as other structural damages that can compromise the mechanical performance of the piece into service. An ultrasonic-based strategy for fast non-destructive measurement of hole peripheral delamination is presented and validated by X-ray CT based reference data. Chip formation is also studied since it can be recovered to be used as reinforcement in the manufacturing processes of thermoplastics.</p></sec>

<p>The resins used were of CBT160 (Cyclics® Corporation) type, which polymerize into the engineered thermoplastic pCBT when catalyzed. The carbon fiber reinforcement was supplied by Hexcel as a bi-directional [0°/90°] fabric of 200 g/m in weight. The laminates were manufactured by thermoplastic resin transfer molding (TP-RTM) which was vacuum assisted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311414218">24</xref></sup> in plates of dimensions 250 × 300 mm<sup>2</sup> with thickness 3 mm, consisting of 12 plies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311414218"><title>Drilling tools and parameters</title>
<p>Drilling tests were carried out on a vertical machining center (MML-500). The tests were run at spindle speeds 3000 and 15,000 revolutions per minute and feed rate 0.05 mm/rev. Drilling was performed in dry conditions in order to avoid moisture adsorption by the thermoplastic matrix. The lack of a support beneath the specimen avoids blunt tool and chip pollution. Three different tool geometries were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311414218">Figure 1</xref>) and five holes made for each spindle speed and drill geometry.
<fig id="fig1-0021998311414218" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Studied tool geometries: (a) Reamer, (b) Twist drill, and (c) Drill-end cutter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311414218-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The Reamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311414218">Figure 1(a)</xref>) is a very common tool in aeronautics because it provides fast drilling times. The Twist drill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311414218">Figure 1(b)</xref>) is a standard drill with a point angle of 118°. The Drill-end Cutter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311414218">Figure 1(c)</xref>) is a special tool for cutting composite materials and provides a smooth finish.</p>
<p>Regarding the spindle speed used, it is very common to drill at 3000 rpm which corresponds to a cutting speed of 56 m/min. However, drilling at 15,000 rpm (282 m/min) may be considered too high and it could cause damage in the material such as delamination and thermal degradation. As no previous experience in drilling carbon fiber-reinforced pCBT laminates has been reported, different parameters are tested in order to study the new composite material behaviour for obtaining high production rate.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311414218"><title>Quality hole</title>
<p>After drilling, the final diameters obtained were measured by means of a traditional hole micrometer. Surface roughness measurements were conducted in a portable tester (Mitutoyo Surftest SJ-301). The <italic>R</italic><sub>a</sub> parameter has been obtained under a measuring speed of 0.5 mm/s along the hole thickness. The optical microscopy pictures have been acquired by means of a Olympus SZX12 Microscope with a magnification value from 7 to 100.</p>
<p>The more significant holes were cut in half to visualize the cut surface morphology by means of Scanning Electron Microscopy. The SEM equipment used in this study was a Carl Zeiss AG – EVO® 40, working under low vacuum. The semi-holes were inspected by SEM in order to verify delamination, fiber crash, or other defects, which were previously detected by means of Ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray CT.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311414218"><title>Ultrasonic C-scan inspection</title>
<p>The portable sound encoder OmniScan® MXU-M and a two-axes encoded scanner were used to perform ultrasonic measurements with a broadband-phased array probe of 64 elements (10 × 0.6 mm each) and a center frequency of 5 MHz. A gel was applied to the composite and the measurements were performed at normal incidence in pulse-echo mode.</p>
<p>In order to increase the ultrasound beams energy and decrease its angle of divergence, 16 elements were used to generate each single beam and the beam was electronically focused on the materials surface (<italic>N</italic> = 20 mm). The equivalent area of the transducer with 16 elements was 10 × 9.6 mm; the approximate spot size of the beam (<italic>d</italic>) and the half-beam spread angle (<italic>α</italic> = −6 dB) were calculated using the following experimental relationships:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021998311414218"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311414218-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

where <italic>λ</italic> is the wavelength of the ultrasound beam and <italic>D</italic> the diameter of the transducer. An approximate diameter of 10 mm was used for these calculations.</p>
<p>The material was scanned in a single axis at 0.1 mm/sample, whereas in the phased array axis, the maximum possible resolution was fixed by the OmniScan at 0.3 mm/sample. In this way, a 20 × 15 mm area was scanned, obtaining 200 × 50 A-Scans.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311414218"><title>X-ray CT inspection</title>
<p>The X-ray CT inspections were performed with a Metrotom 1500 CT machine. The voltage and intensity of the X-ray tube used were <italic>V</italic> = 115 kV and <italic>I</italic> = 133 µA, respectively, and no cooper filter was used. With these parameters, the samples were penetrated properly by the X-ray radiation in all the projections, obtaining good contrast images at an acceptable integration time of 2 s. Owing to the low density of the carbon fiber-reinforced pCBT laminates, no beam-hardening artifacts were obtained in the reconstruction. Each hole was measured in a single scan obtaining a voxel size after the reconstruction of Vx = 13.52 µm.</p></sec></sec>

As it can be observed, the best dimensional accuracy is obtained at low cutting speed whatever be the tool used. However, a clear increase in the diameters (1–4%) can be observed using Twist drill and Reamer at high speeds. This fact can be explained due to the ductile behaviour of the matrix at speed 3000 rpm that becomes fragile at 15,000 rpm.

<p>The surface roughness values (<italic>R</italic><sub>a</sub>) along the hole thickness can also be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311414218">Table 1</xref>. According to the resulting diameters obtained as given above, the best values of roughness are also found at low cutting speeds. The Reamer obtains better values than the Twist drill at low speeds. In contrast, the Reamer shows worse values of roughness than the Twist drill at high speeds. This fact can be due to the difficulty of the Reamer to remove the chip at high cutting speeds, hindering a proper tool cutting. It was expected to obtain the highest surface quality using the Drill-end Cutter but the worst roughness is observed. The special cutting geometry of the tool does not seem to be appropriate for the viscoelastic properties of the matrix.</p></sec>

<p>The hole entry after machining with different drills at 3000 rpm are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311414218">Figure 2</xref>. The Reamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311414218">Figure 2(a)</xref>) leaves thermoplastic peels, that is to say, its cutting lips are not able to cut properly the thermoplastic matrix. The Twist driller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311414218">Figure 2(b)</xref>) shows many burrs containing pCBT and broken fibers. The better visual appearance is obtained after using the Drill-end Cutter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311414218">Figure 2(c)</xref>). Working at 15,000 rpm does not give better results.

The drilled surface produced at low cutting speed has a nice smooth surface. In contrast, drilling at high speed reveals a rough surface and push-down delamination. This fact can be explained due to the ductile behaviour of the matrix at speed 3000 rpm that becomes fragile at 15,000 rpm.

<p>The hole exit drilled by the Reamer at 3000 rpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311414218">Figure 4(a)</xref>) presents accumulation of broken fiber and thermoplastic matrix. This could be because of the reamer geometry does not provide a way for the chip to clear the cutting zone. The Drill-end Cutter shows a more rough surface because its special cutting geometry is not suitable for the thermoplastic matrix. Broken fiber and push-down delamination are also observed in the hole exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311414218">Figure 4(b)</xref>).

<p>Working at 15,000 rpm gives worse results, whatever be the tool used, since the plies cannot resist the thrust of the drill bits and start to delaminate. The cutting lips of the different drills push down and extrude the composite layers rather than cut them. Push-down delamination is the most extensive phenomenon and is consequently considered to be the most dangerous in fiber-reinforced polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311414218">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311414218">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311414218">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311414218">27</xref></sup> It can be underlined that this phenomenon is only observed in the last ply of the pCBT laminates.

<p>As the size and form of the measured delaminations were not big and suitable enough to generate a clear reflection of the above-described acoustic beam (see section Ultrasonic C-scan Inspection), no acoustic reflection was detected inside the material thickness. Besides that, a clear difference in the ultrasonic back reflection intensity (BRI) profile was observed between different holes. Although delaminations do not generate a measurable acoustic reflection, they do affect the propagation of the acoustic beam, decreasing the beam intensity by absorption and scattering of the beam. This effect can clearly be noticed in the change of the BRI which can be used for delamination measurement.</p>
<p>For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414218">Figure 5(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414218">b</xref>), S-Scans of two generic obtained holes are shown, whereas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414218">Figure 5(c)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414218">d</xref>), the respective A-Scans can be observed. The A-Scans correspond to the point A which is at 3 mm from the center of the hole in both cases. It can clearly be seen that due to the peripheral damage, the BRI in the point A is lower in the one seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414218">Figure 5(c)</xref> than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311414218">Figure 5(d)</xref>.

<p>In a theoretical hole without delamination, in the boundary of the hole, approximately half of the beam would get into the material, provided the hole diameter is greater than the spot size of the beam. Thus, a threshold of 50% of the maximum BRI value was defined as a criteria for delamination detection, considering delamination every point with a BRI lower than the threshold value. In this way, the ultrasonic C-scan color images (related to the BRI amplitude) were converted into binary delamination images; white (delamination); black (no delamination).</p>
<p>The resolution of the C-scan images is limited by the phased array axis maximum resolution of 0.3 mm/sample. In order to obtain better resolution images, each hole was scanned twice, with a relative orientation of 90°. Meaning the signals, an approximate resolution of 0.1 mm/sample in both axes was obtained.</p>
<p>With the above presented strategy, a 20 × 15 mm binary delamination image (200 × 150 pixels) of a drilled hole was obtained in 7 s. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311414218">Figure 6</xref>, three binary delamination example images are presented.

<p>Based on the binary delamination images, the delamination factor for each hole can be calculated. The delamination factor (<italic>F</italic><sub>d</sub>) is widely used as an index to evaluate the extent of damage and is defined as the ratio of the maximum diameter (<italic>D</italic><sub>max</sub>) of the delamination zone to the hole diameter (<italic>D</italic><sub>Hole</sub>); it can be expressed as follows:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311414218">16</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec13-0021998311414218"><title>X-ray CT</title>
<p>In order to further analyze the delamination damage and check the ultrasonic C-scan results, X-ray CT measurements of the holes were performed. A 3D image obtained from a X-ray CT is composed of small 3D cubes called voxels (equivalent to pixels in 2D images). Each voxel has a specific value which is related to the mean X-ray attenuation of the material at that cube volume. This way, materials with different X-ray attenuation values can be visualized and localized in 3D.</p>
<p>In the 3D images obtained, it was observed that the carbon and the pCBT materials have a very similar X-ray attenuation. Thus, the gray value difference between those two material-related voxels was too small to be distinguished. However, the air voxels showed a clear different attenuation value. Thus, defining an attenuation value threshold, the sample (carbon fibers and pCBT resin) can be separated from air and visualized in 3D. Furthermore, the air–material separation enables the drilling-induced delamination detection, since a clear air gap can be visualized between delaminated layers. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311414218">Figure 7</xref>, the surface-perpendicular cross-sections are shown, where the most prominent delaminations for different drills at 3000 rpm can be appreciated. As expected, the X-ray CT results showed that the delaminations were produced in the last plies of the laminate due to the well-known push-down phenomenon. The required measurement time for each hole scan was 56 min.

<p>For a comparative analysis of both the Ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray CT results, the delamination factor <italic>F</italic><sub>d</sub> was also calculated based on the X-ray CT results.

<p>As a general trend, the X-ray CT provided smaller delamination factor values but the overall results are found to be consistent. Thus, the ultrasonic-based inspection strategy developed in this study has proven to be a reliable inspection technique for drilling-induced delamination characterization. The hole reflexion problem was avoided and the measurements were performed in an acceptable acquisition time.</p>
<p>Delamination results are consistent with that observed in the SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311414218">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311414218">4</xref>). The spindle speed of 3000 rpm generates less delamination for all the drilling tools. Concerning the different drilling tools, the Twist drill has proven to be the one in which less delamination is generated. In contrast to carbon fiber-reinforced thermosets, the detected delamination at high cutting speed is not as remarkable as expected. These results allow us to conclude that this new composite will certainly increase production rate without remarkable delamination damage.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-0021998311414218"><title>Chip formation</title>
<p>Machinability may also be assessed by the type of chips produced. There is often a correlation between the type of chip produced and surface finish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311414218">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311414218">28</xref></sup></p>

A ribbon-like continuous chip is clearly obtained at low cutting speeds. By contrast, a powder-like chip is obtained at high speeds. Observing the values of roughness in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311414218">Table 1</xref>, it is seen that continuous chips indicate a smooth surface that is produced.

<p>Carbon fiber-reinforced pCBT laminates become brittle and machines fracture with powder-like chip formation at high cutting conditions, while they have the capability to withstand large elastic and plastic strains at low cutting speeds. Besides, the continuous chip produced, in the case of machining at 3000 rpm, can be used as reinforcement in manufacturing processes of thermoplastics.</p></sec></sec>
