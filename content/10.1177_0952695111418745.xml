<abstract>
<p>This article describes the relations between academic psychology and psychical research in Britain during the inter-war period, in the context of the fluid boundaries between mainstream psychology and both psychical research and popular psychology. Specifically, the involvement with Harry Price of six senior academic psychologists: William McDougall, William Brown, J. C. Flugel, Cyril Burt, C. Alec Mace and Francis Aveling, is described. Personal, metaphysical and socio-historical factors in their collaboration are discussed. It is suggested that the main reason for their mutual attraction was their common engagement in a delicate balancing act between courting popular appeal on the one hand and the assertion of scientific expertise and authority on the other. Their interaction is typical of the boundary work performed at this transitional stage in the development of psychology as a discipline.</p>

<title>Psychology in Britain in the early 20th century</title>
<p>Although psychology as a discipline began at the turn of the century – marked by the founding of laboratories, a professional society and a journal – it was an extremely small-scale operation in a primitive state of development for several decades. By about 1920, there were growing signs of independence. A separate Psychology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was formed in 1921; the following year the British Psychological Society abandoned joint meetings with philosophical societies since ‘the divergence of interest was becoming too wide for common … meetings to be profitable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952695111418745">Edgell, 1947</xref>: 112). But in 1939 there were still only about 30 university posts in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952695111418745">Hearnshaw, 1964</xref>: 208); it did not become established as a recognized occupation until after the Second World War. Hence, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952695111418745">Aveling (1937</xref>: v), writing on the position of psychology in the 1930s, remarked: ‘Scientific psychology must still be said to be in a state of transition, and not yet fully to have found its feet.’</p>
<p>Its progress has been beset by two perennial problems. The first is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952695111418745">Bunn (2001</xref>: 3) refers to as ‘the variegated character of the new discipline’: its diversity and fragmented nature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952695111418745">Aveling (1937</xref>: 84), having reviewed six different approaches, commented: ‘Neither on its scope, its definition, nor its method are all psychologists entirely agreed.’ Likewise, Flugel, engaged in a similar project, after discussing nine different schools, observed that, although psychology ‘has made great progress’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952695111418745">Flugel, 1933</xref>: 357), it is ‘still infantile, still relatively unco-ordinated’ (ibid.: 358), admitting that it ‘may still be uncertain about its own nature’ (ibid.: 360). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0952695111418745">Richards (2001</xref>: 49) remarks, ‘Psychology’s understanding of what constituted its appropriate subject matter was itself something which had to be forged within specific historical and social contexts’. Some are of the opinion that the situation has not been ameliorated, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0952695111418745">Smith (1988</xref>: 154−5) going so far as to claim that ‘“psychology” is not a unified body of knowledge with a common core of mutually consistent concepts; indeed, it is a highly contentious philosophical question whether it could ever achieve a unified theory’.</p>
<p>The second problem is insecurity with respect to its scientific status. It is seen as continually struggling to establish its scientific credentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0952695111418745">Richards, 1987</xref>: 202): ‘a discipline anxious to defend its own rather tenuous claims to scientific authority and firm disciplinary boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0952695111418745">Thomson, 2006</xref>: 6). Both these factors – its ill-defined nature and its precarious position as a science – contributed to the importance of what has been called boundary work in the development of psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952695111418745">Derksen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0952695111418745">Thomson, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0952695111418745">
<title>Boundary work</title>
<p>The post-Kuhnian view is that science is distinguished from non-science not by criteria of falsification and repeatability but by dynamic and complex social manoeuvres. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952695111418745">Kohler (1982</xref>: 1) observed, ‘Disciplines are political institutions that demarcate areas of academic territory, allocate privileges and responsibilities of expertise, and structure claims on resources’. Boundary work is an attempt to create a public image for science by contrasting it favourably with non-scientific activities, in order to justify claims to authority and resources. Such activity may be used to achieve expansion, monopolization, or protection of autonomy over professional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952695111418745">Gieryn, 1983</xref>). In the present context, two boundaries are of particular interest: that between professional and popular psychology, and that between academic psychology and psychical research.</p>
<p>The proximity of professional to popular or lay psychology is particularly close. Many scholars have drawn attention to psychology’s cultural embeddedness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0952695111418745">Thomson (2006)</xref> even questions the division between professional and amateur up to the Second World War. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0952695111418745">Richards (1987</xref>: 211) has pointed to the ambiguity of the term ‘psychology’ to refer to both the discipline and its subject matter; and Derksen reveals the resulting tension in demarcating professional psychology from common sense when the latter forms its subject matter. Paradoxically, demarcation necessitates popularization, in order to ‘reap the rewards of funds, clients, students, and trust’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952695111418745">Derksen, 1997</xref>: 436). As psychology shifted away from philosophy towards the natural sciences, great emphasis was placed on detached observation, accurate measurement and recording. Boundary work often involved the creation of material and social spaces such as laboratories, which defined scientific work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952695111418745">Bordogna, 2008</xref>: 27). Technical equipment and specialized training became the hallmarks of scientific activity.</p>

<title>Academic psychology and psychical research</title>
<p>For the first part of the 20th century, there were also fluid boundaries between academic psychology and psychical research. The terms ‘psychological’ and ‘psychical’ were used interchangeably up to 1920 to mean mental as opposed to physical, ‘psychological’ sometimes being used to refer to what later became known as the paranormal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952695111418745">Coon, 1992</xref>). In 1906 the British Psychological Society changed its name from the ‘Psychological Society’ to ‘prevent confusion’ with an ‘unacademic group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952695111418745">Edgell, 1947</xref>: 116). It is likely that this group was the London Psycho-Therapeutic Society, also founded in 1901, and that members of the professional society wished to dissociate themselves from any taint of mysticism belonging to this eccentric fringe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952695111418745">Bunn, 2001</xref>: 18).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952695111418745">Coon (1992)</xref> has described three strategies that American experimental psychologists used to create and maintain boundaries between psychology and psychical research (regarded as pseudo-scientific), at the turn of the 20th century. These were demonstrating the fraudulence of, and/or providing naturalistic explanations for, claimed psychical phenomena (strategies pursued by Hugo Münsterberg) or investigating how people could possibly believe in such phenomena, through the psychology of deception and belief (developed by Joseph Jastrow). Coon argues that they used these ‘modes of combat’ to legitimate scientific psychology and to create a new role for themselves as guardians of the scientific worldview. They were thus able to satisfy the public’s interest in spiritualism and psychic phenomena, but at the same time assert their authority as experts.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0952695111418745">Wolffram (2009)</xref> has explored the multiple boundary disputes that surrounded the emergence of psychical research and parapsychology in Imperial and inter-war Germany. She sees psychical research as a border science between psychology and spiritualism: psychologists distanced themselves from psychical research and psychical researchers distanced themselves from spiritualism. Although the initial development of psychical research in Germany during the late 19th century was an attempt to expand the frontiers of psychology to counter the prevailing materialistic Weltenschauung, it trespassed on the territory and epistemic authority of other disciplines, leading to counter-attacks, thus helping both their practitioners and their opponents to highlight, negotiate and remedy methodological and epistemological problems within contemporary science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952695111418745">Lachapelle (2005)</xref>, in discussing psychical research in France in the 1920s, takes a slightly different view. She suggests that psychical research is destined to remain at the margins. Since much of its audience and frequently its financial support come from those outside the scientific world, who may hold spiritualist beliefs, it is impossible for it to achieve acceptance by mainstream science.</p>
<p>Indeed, psychical researchers have been ambivalent in their attitude towards mainstream science. Some have seen psychical research as part of mainstream science. Frederic Myers, one of the prime movers of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), wrote: ‘So far from aiming at any paradoxical reversion of established scientific conclusions, we conceive ourselves to be working (however imperfectly) in the main track of discovery, and assailing a problem which, though strange and hard, does yet stand next in order among the new adventures on which Science must needs set forth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0952695111418745">Gurney, Myers and Podmore, 1886</xref>: xxxvi). On the other hand, for others what came to be known as parapsychology was defined as being in opposition to science: ‘Parapsychology means the scientific study of the “paranormal”, that is, of phenomena which in one or more respects conflict with accepted scientific opinion as to what is physically possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952695111418745">Beloff, 1974</xref>: 1). For these researchers psychical research was an attempt to study phenomena not so far explained by mainstream science and motivated by the perceived limitations of the latter. On this view, seeking recognition by mainstream science is misguided.</p>
<p>The attitude of mainstream psychologists towards psychical research has generally been hostile. A notable exception is the active involvement of a number of senior academic psychologists with Harry Price’s National Laboratory of Psychical Research and the University of London Council for Psychical Investigation in the inter-war years in Britain. After sketching the early period, this article will describe Price’s attempts to cultivate academic psychologists, and the role of several of these in psychical research in the inter-war period. Finally, the question is addressed of why academic psychologists cooperated with someone of dubious integrity and lacking scientific credentials.</p>

<sec id="section4-0952695111418745">
<title>The early days of the Society for Psychical Research</title>
<p>The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) was founded in 1882 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952695111418745">Gauld, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952695111418745">Haynes, 1982</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0952695111418745">Oppenheim, 1985</xref> for detailed accounts), in an era of spiritualism, to study ‘phenomena which are <italic>prima facie</italic> inexplicable on any generally recognised hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0952695111418745">Sidgwick, 1882</xref>–3: 3). The aim of the society was ‘to approach these various problems without prejudice or prepossession of any kind, and in the same spirit of exact and unimpassioned inquiry which has enabled Science to solve so many problems’ (ibid.: 4).</p>
<p>In this early period, there were close links between psychical research and mainstream psychology. Many psychologists were members of the SPR. The following were presidents of the society: William James (1894–5), William McDougall (1920–1), T. W. Mitchell (1922), R. H. Thouless (1942–4), Gardner Murphy (1949–50).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0952695111418745">1</xref>
</sup> C. S. Myers and G. F. Stout were associate members. R. A. Fisher, who assisted with the statistical analysis of a number of the experiments, was an honorary member. Théodore Flournoy, Sigmund Freud, Pierre Janet, Carl Jung, G. Stanley Hall and Morton Prince were corresponding members.</p>
<p>Frederic W. H. Myers, a founder member and chief researcher of the SPR, was joint secretary of the Second International Congress of Experimental Psychology, held in London in 1892, half of which was devoted to hypnotism and related topics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0952695111418745">2</xref>
</sup> Speakers included Henry Sidgwick and Frederic Myers on hallucinations, and Eleanor Sidgwick on experiments in thought transference.</p>
<p>There were also close relations between psychical research and psychoanalysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952695111418745">Keeley (2002)</xref> has cogently argued that Freud had a lifelong interest in psychical research, and that it played a crucial role in the development of psychoanalytic theory, providing Freud both with many of his ideas and with the stimulus for their development. The SPR was the route by which Freud’s work became known in England. Frederic Myers gave an account of the 1893 paper on hysteria by Breuer and Freud at a general meeting of the society three months after it appeared. Freud was invited to contribute a paper to a special ‘medical’ issue of the <italic>Proceedings</italic>, which he wrote in English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952695111418745">Freud, 1912</xref>). Among psychologists who became interested in psychoanalysis in this way were James Strachey, Freud’s translator, who was present when this paper was read. It is possible that William McDougall and J. C. Flugel also first came across psychoanalysis through membership of the society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952695111418745">Hinshelwood, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0952695111418745">
<title>The inter-war period</title>
<p>Although psychical research was born in the spiritualist era towards the end of the 19th century, there was considerable activity in this area in the inter-war period. An examination of the relevant databases for occurrences of ‘psychical research’ in both <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>The Times</italic>, shows they peaked during the 1920s and 1930s (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0952695111418745">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0952695111418745">2</xref>

), contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952695111418745">Inglis’s (1984</xref>: 314) claim that <italic>Nature</italic> rarely permitted itself to consider the topic.</p>

</fig>
<p>The First World War led to an increased interest in telepathy and the possibility of survival after death, as a result of the massive number of bereavements. It is perhaps not without significance that many of those interested in psychical research, notably Oliver Lodge, Arthur Conan Doyle and Samuel Soal, had lost relatives in the trenches, though it may be oversimplified to suggest that a hope of contacting the deceased was their sole motive. Lodge became interested in psychical research long before his son’s death and Soal remained sceptical about survival.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0952695111418745">3</xref>
</sup> Membership of the SPR reached a peak in 1920, but by 1930 it had dropped to almost half this figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952695111418745">Inglis, 1984</xref>). The society was in disarray, split by factions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952695111418745">Mauskopf and McVaugh, 1980</xref>: 211). There were disputes about both metaphysical and methodological issues. The so-called left wing contained spiritualists or others dedicated to seeking evidence for survival after death, while members of the more conservative right wing were intent merely on demonstrating the inadequacy of what they regarded as materialistic and mechanistic dogmas. The ‘High-and-Dry’ faction of the SPR strove to maintain rigorous scientific standards, whereas the Not-High-and-Dry school questioned the appropriateness of such methods for the study of psychical phenomena, arguing that the craving for scientific respectability had distracted attention from spontaneous phenomena. Many considered the experimental approach counter-productive in this area, and that introducing the necessary controls militates against the production of supernormal phenomena. The study of ‘physical’ mediums<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0952695111418745">4</xref>
</sup> demonstrated the impossibility of full control and the consequent difficulty of conclusively ruling out fraud – often compounded by financial interests on the part of the mediums. The division of opinion over subject matter, methods of investigation and theoretical explanations, as in the case of academic psychology, resulted in incoherence and vulnerability to boundary disputes.</p>
<p>A number of rival institutions stepped into the breach. The British College of Psychic Science was founded in 1920.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0952695111418745">5</xref>
</sup> Its members felt that the SPR was failing in its duty, and wanted to encourage the study of mediums. It had three departments of work: instruction, demonstrations and research. Although eclectic in spirit, it favoured ‘a human and practical approach rather than a cold and often negative scientific attitude’;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0952695111418745">6</xref>
</sup> and most of the reports in its journal, <italic>Psychic Science</italic>, relied on personal experiences and anecdotal evidence. The International Institute for Psychical Research was established in 1934,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0952695111418745">7</xref>
</sup> also spiritualist in inspiration while claiming to be scientific. Although it was initially supported by reputable scientists, including the biologist Julian Huxley, they resigned after a few months when its survivalist leanings became clear, and the institute merged with the British College of Psychic Science. In between these, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research was set up in 1926 by Harry Price.</p>
<p>Harry Price (1881−1948) was a businessman and amateur psychical researcher. A salesman for 40 years for paper merchants, he was a man with many skills: conjuror (and member of the Inner Magic Circle), photographer, engineer, numismatist, writer, journalist and bibliophile. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952695111418745">Morris (2006</xref>: 213), in a recent biography, describes him as ‘a supreme bluffer, a hedonistic con man, a terrific raconteur, a great conjuror, a gifted writer and a wonderful eccentric’. Defensive about his working-class origins, Price sought academic recognition. His lifelong passion was psychical research to which he devoted an enormous amount of energy and finances but his approach and values were those of a businessman rather than a scientist. He craved fame and publicity, and was prepared to sacrifice truth and integrity in pursuit of them if necessary. Although he was a lifelong member of the Society for Psychical Research, which he joined in 1920, the two were at daggers drawn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0952695111418745">
<title>The National Laboratory of Psychical Research</title>
<p>The National Laboratory of Psychical Research was founded ‘to investigate in a dispassionate manner and by purely scientific means, every phase of psychic or alleged psychic phenomena’ and ‘to provide facilities for experimentation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695111418745">Price, 1931</xref>: endpapers). It was formally opened ‘in a flurry of media attention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952695111418745">Randall, 2000</xref>: 163). A. A. Campbell Swinton, the television pioneer and an FRS, suggested that Price had named it thus so that people would think it was on a par with the National Physical Laboratory!<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0952695111418745">8</xref>
</sup> Honorary membership entitled people to use the laboratory and participate in seances; lectures were also organized. Within a very short time the membership of the laboratory topped the 800 mark, rivalling that of the SPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952695111418745">Randall, 2000</xref>). Several of the world’s leading parapsychologists, including the German Albert Schrenck-Notzing and the Frenchmen Eugène Osty and René Sudre, were on its council. The psychologists William Brown, William McDougall and J. C. Flugel were members of a ‘London group available for participating in experimental work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695111418745">Price, 1931</xref>: endpapers) and Flugel was on its board. Between 1926 and 1932 the laboratory carried out series of sittings with (mostly physical) mediums, including the Austrian Rudi Schneider and the Scotswoman Helen Duncan. Physical mediums had the dual advantage of providing objectively observable ‘hard’ data to satisfy scientists and suitable fodder for newspaper publicity to satisfy the general populace. Reports were published in research bulletins, a journal, books and newspaper articles. Articles were also submitted to the <italic>Revue Métapsychique</italic> and <italic>Zeitschrift für Parapsychologie</italic>.</p>
<p>Price aimed to appeal both to scientists and to the lay public: ‘It has always been the policy of the Laboratory to invite both the Press and official science to our tests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952695111418745">Price, 1930</xref>: 19). In fact, initially ‘experimental’ seances to which scientists were invited alternated with ‘demonstrations’ for ‘interested others’. Reporters from several national newspapers and a representative from the British Broadcasting Corporation attended some of the seances; and articles were submitted to other newspapers.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695111418745">Price (1931</xref>: 3) maintained that ‘modern scientific psychical research necessitates a great technical knowledge in many branches of science and the use of instruments and apparatus which must astound the layman’. This is borne out by the description of his ‘properly equipped séance room’: ‘A number of photographic cameras, Dictaphones, time clock etc. are at hand for recording purposes. … A special teak note-taker’s table, on pentagraph rubber wheels, supports Dictaphone, rheostats, luminous watch for timing, etc. Thermographs, barographs, and other instruments are installed for recording the meteorological conditions’ (ibid.: 15). In addition, ‘ultra-violet and infra-red installations are available and X-ray apparatus is at hand, if necessary’ (ibid.: 14). The laboratory owned 14 cameras; the Dictaphone was used on one occasion to record the voice of a ‘trance personality’; and the infra-red apparatus could be used to detect apports (objects moving supernaturally) – a bell rang if the beam was interrupted.</p>
<p>A number of precautions were aimed at preventing cheating. The medium was searched internally and externally. Helen Duncan’s ‘rectum was examined for some distance up the alimentary canal and a very thorough vaginal examination given’ by Mollie Goldney who had ‘trained and worked for many months in a midwifery hospital’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695111418745">Price, 1931</xref>: 30). McDougall and Brown, both qualified doctors, performed ‘medical examinations’, examining her throat, mouth and teeth. Duncan was then sewn into a special one-piece garment,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0952695111418745">9</xref>
</sup> to which luminous strips were attached, as they were to various objects in the seance room. In the case of Rudi Schneider, a method of electrical control was used. The medium and sitters wore gloves and socks containing metallic strips. They placed their feet on metal plates and grasped the hands of their neighbours. If the circuit (a diagram of which was reproduced in the report) was broken, a light came on. In addition, the medium’s hands and feet were also held by two ‘controllers’. Seances took place in the evening and lasted for three or four hours, usually with a short break at some point. Notes were taken by Price’s secretary, using either the Dictaphone or shorthand, and a protocol plus comments were typed up within a few days of the sitting ‘when details of the incident were fresh in our memories’ (ibid.: 3). At a later stage the note-taker was even separated from the sitters by a gauze net, after criticisms that she might have been an accomplice.</p>
<p>The principal reason given for studying Schneider was Price’s determination ‘that official science should have an opportunity of witnessing for itself phenomena of unimpeachable genuineness under control conditions which had never previously been imposed upon any medium in this country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952695111418745">Price, 1930</xref>: viii). His efforts were indeed hailed as truly scientific by newspapers all over the world. It was also felt ‘highly desirable that the Press and the public should be informed as to what psychical research really meant under modern scientific methods of investigation’ (ibid.: vii).</p>
<p>Two series of sittings, totalling 25 seances, were held with Schneider in 1929–30. William Brown was present at three of them. He took part in searching the medium, acted as one of the controllers, and took some physiological measures. A third series of 27 seances took place in 1932, at four of which Brown was present. At the 26th seance, he witnessed ‘magnificent phenomena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695111418745">Price, 1931</xref>: 189): moving curtains, ringing bells, cold breezes, table knocks, a flower taken out of his hand, and a basket moving on his knee. Price (ibid.: 174) commented: ‘Dr. Brown was the one to whom Olga’s [Schneider’s “trance personality”] best phenomena were directed and, like the rest of us, was much impressed.’ Brown was so impressed that he wrote to <italic>The Times</italic>. In a long letter giving a detailed account of his experiences at the seance, he referred to ‘some unseen agency’ and ‘some mysterious power’, concluding that ‘undoubtedly the phenomena are worthy of the closest scientific investigation’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0952695111418745">10</xref>
</sup> The following week there was a partial recant. Anita Gregory provides evidence that Brown was ridiculed by colleagues at Oxford.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0952695111418745">11</xref>
</sup> In his second letter Brown said that although he had originally been convinced that the phenomena were ‘supernormal’, ‘intellectual conviction can only come, if at all, after much more stringent scientific investigation carried out in a university laboratory, or in the séance room of the S.P.R., with trained scientists and psychical researchers as sitters’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0952695111418745">12</xref>
</sup> This infuriated Price, who felt that his work was being denigrated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0952695111418745">13</xref>
</sup> The phenomena were initially heralded as genuine by Price, though he later revealed that photographs taken at the 25th seance showed Rudi to have broken control.</p>
<p>A series of five seances with Helen Duncan was held in 1931.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0952695111418745">14</xref>
</sup> McDougall and Flugel each attended two, Brown three. Duncan’s act was to enter a cabinet (a curtained-off recess in the seance room), go into trance, get taken over by a ‘control’ (or ‘trance personality’), and produce ectoplasm − taken as materializations of the dead by bereaved sitters. After the first ‘informal’ seance, Price wrote to McDougall (who had been unable to attend):<disp-quote>
<p>We had a brilliant evening last night; the medium underwent a rectal and vaginal examination with Dr. William Brown and Mrs Goldney and was sewn up into a one-piece garment. In thirty seconds after going into trance the teleplasm streamed from her and I secured five magnificent photographs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0952695111418745">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>It rapidly became clear, however, that what Duncan was doing was swallowing and regurgitating cheesecloth when in the cabinet, unseen by sitters in the red light. Photographs showed the warp and weft, selvedge and rents in the material. On being threatened with an X-ray machine after the fourth seance, Duncan staged a hysterical fit. She ‘made a lunge at Dr. William Brown who fortunately avoided the blow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952695111418745">Price, 1931</xref>: 61), and dashed into the street where she was able to pass the cloth to her husband (who subsequently refused to be searched). Price’s report concluded that all the manifestations were ‘produced by normal – though exceedingly unusual – means’ (ibid.: 83). The story was published in the <italic>Morning Post</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0952695111418745">16</xref>
</sup> Both McDougall and Brown also wrote reports, published as appendices to Price’s <italic>Regurgitation and the Duncan Mediumship</italic> (1931). McDougall pronounced Duncan’s ‘whole performance fraudulent’ (ibid.: 111). Brown concurred: ‘Nothing that I saw would have led me to attribute to her any supernormal or “psychic” power whatever’ (ibid.: 112) As early as 1899, McDougall had warned about ‘“sittings” conducted in the dark by professional mediums who work for pay’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0952695111418745">17</xref>
</sup> He was also a sceptical member of the <italic>Scientific American</italic> committee appointed to examine the Bostonian medium Margery, after which he wrote: ‘I have taken part in a considerable number of investigations of alleged supernormal phenomena; but hitherto have failed to find convincing evidence in any case, but have found rather much evidence of fraud and trickery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952695111418745">McDougall, 1926</xref>: 23).</p>

<title>The University of London</title>
<p>Price attempted to develop collaborative links with a number of institutions. He first approached the London Spiritualist Alliance and the Institut Métapsychique International in 1929.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0952695111418745">18</xref>
</sup> The institut had been founded in Paris in 1919 with similar aims to the SPR; its director was Eugène Osty and its president Charles Richet (for further details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952695111418745">Lachapelle, 2005</xref>). The following year Price approached the British College of Psychic Science and the SPR. None came to fruition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0952695111418745">19</xref>
</sup> When these approaches failed, he made a formal offer to the University of London in 1933 to found a Department of Psychical Research. The offer included his laboratory and library (an extensive collection of books including many rarities on psychical research) and a guaranteed income of £500 per annum. The proposal was considered by the Academic Council, the Board of the Faculty of Science, and the Boards of Study in Advanced Medical Studies, Physiology, Psychology, Philosophy, Physics and Theology. Advanced Medical Studies and Philosophy were in favour. Physics thought it should be considered by Psychology. Theology gave general approval, stating that its members would communicate certain conditions to the Board of Studies in Psychology. Physiology objected, noting in passing that ‘certain members of the Board of Studies in Psychology had voted against the proposals’, on the grounds that ‘psychical research holds an unenviable reputation because of its association with misrepresentation and fraud’: ‘acceptance of the offer on any terms whatever by the University might easily lead to publicity and propaganda of a type which would not bring credit to the University’ and ‘researches so contaminated with trickery are not suitable for investigation in a university laboratory and should only be dealt with by specially selected men of science’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0952695111418745">20</xref>
</sup> Notwithstanding, with all the reports in mind, the Academic Council concurred with the judgement of the Board of the Faculty of Science, subsequently ratified by the Senate, that ‘Psychical Research is a subject which can properly be included among the subjects of study of the University’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0952695111418745">21</xref>
</sup> However, in the final analysis, the Senate deemed that space<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0952695111418745">22</xref>
</sup> and financial limitations prevented its implementation in practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952695111418745">Mauskopf and McVaugh (1980</xref>: 212) suggest that Price’s plans constituted a threat to the university’s resources and reputation.</p>

<sec id="section8-0952695111418745">
<title>The University of London Council for Psychical Investigation</title>
<p>Nevertheless, the following year Price managed to organize a so-called University of London Council for Psychical Investigation (ULCPI) of 10 academics, including four psychologists: Francis A. P. Aveling, Professor of Psychology at King’s College; Cyril Burt, Professor of Psychology at University College; J. C. Flugel, Assistant Professor of Psychology, University College; and C. Alec Mace, Lecturer in Philosophy and Psychology, Bedford College London. The council undertook to supervise the work of the laboratory and to direct students in psychical research for higher degrees.</p>
<p>For a while Price succeeded in engaging both mainstream scientists and the general public, by cultivating academics and courting journalists, such as the editors of <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>The Listener</italic> and the <italic>Daily Mail</italic>. During this time he transferred his assets to the university. His library, having been rejected by the SPR, was handed over in November 1936.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0952695111418745">23</xref>
</sup> In July 1937, he was the guest of the university at a dinner at the Athenaeum;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0952695111418745">24</xref>
</sup> but the following year the council was disbanded. Price’s behaviour upset several of his council members on account of his disregard for scientific integrity, his seeking of press publicity and his failure to consult them before going ahead on such matters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0952695111418745">25</xref>
</sup> In the end his headstrong pursuit of publicity, if necessary at the expense of honesty, lost him academic support. So ultimately the attempt to link psychical research with universities failed; the SPR was left to carry on research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952695111418745">Mauskopf and McVaugh, 1980</xref>: 215).</p>
<p>By contrast, in the United States, William McDougall, who had emigrated there in 1920, successfully shifted his focus from societies to universities with enormous implications for the field. It is intriguing to speculate on what might have happened if he had stayed in England.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0952695111418745">
<title>The psychologists</title>
<p>Six academic psychologists became associated with Harry Price’s work on psychical research. As we have seen, William McDougall, William Brown and J. C. Flugel attended seances at his laboratory. Flugel, Cyril Burt, Alec Mace and Francis Aveling were members of his University of London Council. All except Aveling were members of the SPR. How did they become interested and what exactly was their involvement in psychical research?</p>
<p>William McDougall (1871–1938)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0952695111418745">26</xref>
</sup> first became interested in psychical research by reading about William James’s work with the medium Leonora Piper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952695111418745">Garrett, 1967</xref>). He was a frequent visitor to the College of Psychic Science in London and lectured and demonstrated on hypnotism while at Oxford. He carried out experiments on telepathy with Cyril Burt and J. C. Flugel shortly after his arrival in Oxford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952695111418745">Evans, 1967</xref>: 25). He was on the council of the SPR for over 20 years and president of both that (1920−1) and the American Society for Psychical Research, also playing a leading role in the founding of the Boston Society for Psychical Research. On moving to Duke, he developed work on parapsychology, encouraging J. B. Rhine (having been instrumental in his appointment), and was coeditor of the <italic>Journal of Parapsychology</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952695111418745">Asprem (2010</xref>: 125) justifiably suggests he should be considered ‘the father of the <italic>professionalization</italic> of modern parapsychology’. He was in the habit of spending the summers in England, which enabled him, on occasion, to attend seances at Harry Price’s laboratory. Towards the end of his life, he confessed that had it not been necessary to earn a living, he might have chosen to devote all his time and energy to the field of psychical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952695111418745">McDougall, 1930</xref>: 220). Freud made a similar confession.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0952695111418745">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>William Brown (1881–1952)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0952695111418745">28</xref>
</sup> first became interested in psychical research by reading Frederic Myers’s <italic>Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death</italic> as an undergraduate, which caused him to switch from science to classics (‘Greats’), with psychology as a special subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952695111418745">Brown, 1932</xref>−3: 74). He was a council member of the SPR, delivering a lecture to them on ‘Psychology and Psychical Research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952695111418745">Brown, 1932</xref>−3), which provides a useful summary of his views. In it he explains how he was particularly impressed by personal experiences of incognito sittings with the medium Mrs Leonard, by shell-shock victims 15 per cent of whom he estimated had mediumistic powers of telepathy and clairvoyance under light self-hypnosis, and by sittings with Rudi Schneider. He was a member of the Consultative Committee of the International Institute for Psychical Research when it was founded in 1934<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0952695111418745">29</xref>
</sup> and served as a member of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s inquiry into psychical research and spiritualism in 1937 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952695111418745">Price, 1942</xref>: 301).</p>
<p>Brown became associated with Harry Price, attending seances at the laboratory on 10 occasions. He took an active part in sittings with both Rudi Schneider and Helen Duncan, as described above; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952695111418745">Price (1942)</xref> acknowledges his help. He was also present at the Kuda Bux firewalk in 1935.</p>
<p>J. C. (‘Jack’) Flugel (1884−1955),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0952695111418745">30</xref>
</sup> as a young Oxford undergraduate, had shown an ‘inquiringly original mind’ and a ‘penchant for unconventionality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952695111418745">Jones, 1956</xref>: 193). Here he studied hypnotism, conducted seances, joined the SPR, and became one of the small group of William McDougall’s students, along with Cyril Burt, William Brown and others.</p>
<p>Flugel became well acquainted with Harry Price. Their correspondence amounts to over 50 letters;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0952695111418745">31</xref>
</sup> and on at least one occasion the hospitable Jack and his wife Ingeborg invited Price to dinner. As secretary to the University of London’s Board of Studies in Psychology, Flugel played a key role in steering Price’s offer through the university’s labyrinth of boards and subcommittees. He was a member of the executive committee of the ULCPI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0952695111418745">32</xref>
</sup> He was involved in the investigations of Pasquale Erto, Willi Schneider, Helen Duncan, Frederick Marion, telepathy experiments and a poltergeist in Wimbledon. He and his wife were present at Ahmed Hussein’s firewalk at Alexandra Palace televised by the BBC in 1937, as well as numerous dinners arranged by Harry Price or held in his honour, at one of which he spoke. He and his wife also visited Borley Rectory, ‘the most haunted house in England’, with Price and later read his book <italic>The End of Borley Rectory</italic> (1946).</p>
<p>Cyril Burt (1883−1971)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0952695111418745">33</xref>
</sup> possessed several qualities relevant to the pursuit of psychical research: interests in personal experience, consciousness and the application of mathematics to psychology. Although he did not become a member of the SPR until 1959 (perhaps for reasons of professional caution), Burt had had an interest in psychical research since his time as a student of McDougall’s at Oxford. Burt and Flugel read Myers’s <italic>Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death</italic> ‘chapter by chapter’. ‘We were fascinated, but at first decidedly sceptical. … Nevertheless, both Flugel and I were sufficiently impressed to embark on a few private trials of our own’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952695111418745">Burt, 1968</xref>: 3). He confesses to having ‘dabbled in the matter quite a lot’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0952695111418745">34</xref>
</sup> as a junior lecturer at Liverpool.</p>
<p>Burt also became associated with Price, though he was limited in what he could do by his other commitments. He was a member of the ULCPI and provided facilities in his laboratory for Soal to carry out card-guessing experiments. He describes himself as ‘an observer and occasional assistant during the experiments carried out by Dr Soal while he was a research student in my laboratory at University College’ (1968: 4). Both Price and Soal acknowledge his help, which included getting hold of subjects. He also had his wife ‘carrying out a few experiments [with him] on card guessing’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0952695111418745">35</xref>
</sup> He was present at sittings with Marion, and he and his wife were present at the dinner arranged by Price for René Sudre<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0952695111418745">36</xref>
</sup> and the Ahmed Hussein firewalk, and read <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0952695111418745">Price’s (1933)</xref> <italic>Leaves from a Psychist’s Case-Book</italic> and (1946) <italic>The End of Borley Rectory</italic>. In his role as head of the psychology department at University College, he was the (cautious) recipient of equipment on the winding-up of the ULCPI.</p>
<p>C. Alec Mace (1894–1971)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0952695111418745">37</xref>
</sup> was a member of the ULCPI. Both Samuel Soal and K. M. Goldney conducted experiments on ESP in his laboratory for a number of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952695111418745">Goldney, 1973</xref>). He served as an observer in some of the experiments and made methodological suggestions to Soal. In 1935 Mace paid a visit to a Mr Loweman in Ipswich, suspected of a secondary personality, sending this report to Price:<disp-quote>
<p>I spent some two hours with Loweman yesterday for the greater part of which time I listened to a discourse from Flammarion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0952695111418745">38</xref>
</sup> … Loweman goes into a trance, sweats profusely, then a rather dramatic change of appearance takes place and ‘the Professor’ announces the presence with a characteristic professorial cough. I invited him to discourse on psychical research – which he did, quite intelligently but without great originality. He deliberated at length on the method of the fraudulent medium – and expressed his opinion that the most interesting phenomena were the apparitions &amp; thought transferences that occur at the moment of death … I certainly think it would be worth while having him up to London for a week.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0952695111418745">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The following year he gave the F. W. H. Myers Memorial Lecture on ‘Supernormal Faculty and the Structure of the Mind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952695111418745">Mace, 1937</xref>), in which he hypothesized that the collective unconscious leaves engrams in some interpersonal stuff, a ‘psychic ether’ or better a more non-committal ‘Tertium Quid’, which might on occasion influence the experience and behaviour of others and thus provide an explanation for telepathy.</p>
<p>Francis Aveling (1875–1941)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0952695111418745">40</xref>
</sup> employed hypnosis with patients at the Medico-Psychological Clinic, where he was head of the Psycho-Therapeutic Department from 1913 to 1920. He was a reluctant member of Price’s ULCPI, agreeing to serve provided he could play devil’s advocate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0952695111418745">41</xref>
</sup> After repeated failure to attend the council’s meetings, he finally resigned in October 1936. He supervised John Hettinger’s PhD (awarded 1939) on ‘The Ultra-perceptive Capacity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952695111418745">Hettinger, 1940</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0952695111418745">
<title>Reasons for the psychologists’ involvement with Harry Price</title>
<p>Price was a controversial figure, frequently subject to charges of fraud and deception. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952695111418745">Dingwall <italic>et al.</italic>’s (1956)</xref> report on Borley Rectory accused him of creating some of the phenomena himself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0952695111418745">42</xref>
</sup> The case for his defence was mounted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952695111418745">Hastings (1969)</xref>, who concluded that the allegations made against Price were ‘very grossly exaggerated’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952695111418745">Gregory (1977)</xref>, after a careful examination of the evidence, concluded that the supposed incriminating photograph purporting to show Rudi Schneider cheating, was a ‘cleverly contrived fake’; Price’s lack of scruple and duplicitous behaviour were motivated by the desire to embarrass Charles Hope who had arranged sittings with Schneider independently of Price. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0952695111418745">Hall (1978)</xref> has documented numerous cases in which Price manipulated evidence, perpetrated fraud, or distorted the truth if it suited him.</p>
<p>It is true that some of Price’s exploits were daft, such as the attempt to turn a goat into a man on the Brocken in the Harz Mountains in Germany, a black magic experiment in connection with the Goethe centenary, attended by the BBC’s outside broadcast unit; and the investigation of Gef, the supposed talking mongoose at Cashen Gap on the Isle of Man. On the other hand, he was genuinely passionate about psychical research − to which he devoted a very considerable amount of time, energy and money − and critical. After all, most of his investigations turned out to be exposés.</p>
<p>So why did reputable scientists and the University of London become involved with Price? How did the enigmatic and controversial ‘father of modern ghost hunting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952695111418745">Morris, 2006</xref>: 213) manage to inveigle a number of senior academic psychologists into collaborating with him? Personal, philosophical and socio-historical factors are discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0952695111418745">
<title>Personality factors</title>
<p>The personalities of certain of the characters involved may go some way towards explaining the turn of events. Harry Price was charismatic and gave the appearance of honesty and plausibility. Charles Sutton of the <italic>Daily Mail</italic> said of him, ‘Harry was one of the most plausible rascals I ever had the pleasure of meeting’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0952695111418745">43</xref>
</sup> Frequently a kind and generous friend, he enjoyed wining and dining his guests. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952695111418745">Morris (2006</xref>: 212) observes, ‘He was an extremely likeable and clubbable man, so few bothered to look beyond his affability’. Perhaps the psychologists were gullible; Morris (ibid.: 171) describes them as ‘less circumspect’.</p>
<p>Some of the psychologists were affable too and keen to help. Their correspondence with Price was almost always cordial, expressing mutual interest in the phenomena under investigation. Flugel is described as ‘a most lovable person. He invariably radiated cheerfulness and friendliness, and his modesty, patience and tolerance made his friendship easy to win and easy to keep. … Few men could have been so universally liked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952695111418745">Jones, 1956</xref>: 194). He was well known as a mediator, and his excellent interpersonal skills meant that he was often sought as a confidant and adviser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952695111418745">Russell, 1956</xref>: 329) and frequently asked to perform the role of chair in potentially conflict-ridden situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0952695111418745">Sutherland, 1956</xref>: 1). Concerning the discussion of Price’s offer to the University of London, by the Board of Studies in Psychology, Flugel assures him: ‘I hope very much that they will be able to give a positive recommendation to the University. … Naturally I shall use any personal influence I have in this direction.’<sup>

<title>McDougall’s influence</title>
<p>One psychologist in particular was largely responsible: William McDougall. It is significant that William Brown, J. C. Flugel and Cyril Burt were all students of his at Oxford. As Burt wrote to Robert Thouless: ‘Even as students he started us taking an interest in such problems.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0952695111418745">45</xref>
</sup> In his paper on the implications of parapsychology for general psychology, originally delivered to a meeting of the Institute for Parapsychology in Durham, NC, he confesses that the subject ‘is one that has always intrigued me since I first served as guinea pig in some of McDougall’s early experiments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952695111418745">Burt, 1967</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>Indeed Knight Dunlap reached a similar conclusion concerning McDougall’s influence in regard to supporters of J. B. Rhine:<disp-quote>
<p>We can understand the attitudes of the two or three middle-aged psychologists who have rushed into print with acclaims for Rhine, and confession of long-standing beliefs which they now feel it safe to proclaim. These men have in other regards been open to suspicion, and considered on the fringe of psychological respectability. Furthermore, I believe, they have all been, in the past and at impressionable ages, apprentices of McDougall, and came under the spell of his attractive personality.<sup>

<title>Metaphysical position of the psychologists</title>
<p>The psychologists may be considered broad-minded or ‘flakey’ according to one’s theoretical position. But perhaps there are deeper philosophical reasons beyond mere flakiness or gullibility. McDougall and Brown were in the vitalist tradition. In this regard, it is interesting to note that there has been a strong connection between psychical research and neo-vitalism, exemplified by Henri Bergson and Hans Driesch (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952695111418745">Asprem, 2010</xref>: 137). McDougall and Burt held explicitly dualist metaphysical theories about the relations between mental and physical. Brown and Burt put their faith in quantum theory. McDougall, Burt and Mace put forward ideas about possible mechanisms for supernormal phenomena.</p>
<p>McDougall’s psychology was based on the hormic principle: ‘I had become more and more convinced that the mechanistic biology was unsound … that in all living things there is some factor which does not work in accordance with mechanistic principles and which has its own peculiar nature and organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952695111418745">McDougall, 1930</xref>: 209). He regarded the principal importance of the results achieved by psychical research ‘as having established the occurrence of phenomena which cannot be reconciled with the mechanistic scheme of things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952695111418745">McDougall, 1918</xref>: 350). He was persuaded of this by the evidence for telepathy which he considered to be ‘of such a nature as to compel the assent of any competent person who studies it impartially’ (ibid.: 349) and the mind’s power to influence the body as demonstrated in healing and hypnosis.</p>
<p>McDougall states that the reason for ‘dabbling in psychical research’ was his ‘desire to know the truth’ (1930: 219). He felt that orthodox science’s assumptions of mechanism and materialism were dogmas, that it had denied the existence of parapsychological phenomena without adequate justification, and that empirical investigation was necessary to determine the truth or falsity of such claims.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952695111418745">Pastore (1944)</xref> has argued that McDougall’s rejection of materialism was part of a package of attitudes motivated by a conservative desire to preserve the status quo – the existing moral order in general and his position in a hierarchical society in particular – which were threatened by destabilization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0952695111418745">47</xref>
</sup> For McDougall, the replacement of the ‘two pillars of dogmatism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952695111418745">McDougall, 1921</xref>: 108), orthodox religion and scientific materialism, was a <italic>moral</italic> imperative. The decay of religion and the spread of materialism demanded a new basis for morality.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952695111418745">Asprem (2010)</xref> has drawn links among what he calls the ‘nice arrangement of heterodoxies’ that McDougall espoused: psychical research, neo-vitalism, Lamarckism and eugenics. Vitalism and dualism provided a philosophical basis for a non-mechanistic, anti-materialist view of life and mind, while psychical research and Lamarckism offered the promise of empirical support.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0952695111418745">48</xref>
</sup> Each, McDougall believed, would help counter the threats of biological and moral degeneration and the decline of civilization, feared by so many intellectuals of his generation.</p>
<p>Burt expressed his dualist views on a number of occasions, e.g. ‘normal psychology reveals within itself an inescapable dualism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952695111418745">Burt, 1961a</xref>: 86); ‘there must be a ghost in the machine’;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0952695111418745">49</xref>
</sup> ‘I believe that many, if not all, the processes of consciousness which are at present regarded as normal, will, in many of their aspects, turn out to be quite as independent of the physiological processes of the brain as those which at present are classed as paranormal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952695111418745">Burt, 1961b</xref>: 30). He considered mechanism outmoded, invoking quantum theory: ‘it would seem there is nothing whatever in <italic>contemporary</italic> physics which would preclude the apparent anomalies presented by psi phenomena’ (ibid.: 29). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952695111418745">Brown (1929</xref>: 17) likewise drew attention to the significance of Bohr’s discovery that electrons could move from one orbit to another, without apparently traversing the intermediate space, though he considered reliance on quantum theory to support parapsychological phenomena was premature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952695111418745">Brown, 1932</xref>−3: 75).</p>
<p>Burt’s suggestion was to posit some kind of field theory. He argued that substituting a field theory for causal theories in the psychical sphere would be a way of ‘escaping many of the dilemmas which causal theories inevitably raise, and at the same time bringing both normal and paranormal psychology more into line with the cosmological theories of modern physics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952695111418745">Burt, 1959a</xref>: 86). It would accommodate action at a distance.<disp-quote>
<p>Not only telepathy (if it exists) but also every form of cognition is essentially a mode of action at a distance. Now in physics a common reason for postulating a ‘field’ is to furnish a convenient model for interpreting action at a distance. And in my view this is one of the many advantages of adopting a similar model in interpreting the phenomena of consciousness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952695111418745">Burt, 1961b</xref>: 167, note 1)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0952695111418745">50</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>His further explanation has a peculiarly current ring:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… the essence of a field-theory consisted in supposing that the electric charge of a body lies not within the body, but in a spatial continuum around it. In much the same way we might suppose that the consciousness of a given individual, so far as it has location, resides in the environment around him rather than inside his head. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952695111418745">Burt, 1959a</xref>: 86; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952695111418745">Burt, 1959b</xref> for more detailed discussion)</p>
</disp-quote>Thus, ‘we can regard the mind as a kind of “field” existing in the neighbourhood of an individual brain, much as the physicist conceives of an electromagnetic field existing in the neighbourhood of a set of electric currents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952695111418745">Burt, 1961b</xref>: 167). His final suggestion is that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… the transmitter’s brain might include a mechanism which, like the laser, could produce amplification by stimulated emission of the relevant radiation. The radiation could then perhaps be concentrated and directed in almost linear fashion towards the recipient … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952695111418745">Burt, 1966</xref>: 373)</p>
</disp-quote>Some of his conjectures may have been rather speculative but he was at least wrestling with the question of possible mechanisms.</p>

<sec id="section14-0952695111418745">
<title>Fluidity of boundaries</title>
<p>As previously discussed, psychology was in a state of transition in the inter-war period, with fluid boundaries between academic psychology and both psychical research and popular psychology. Burt considered the phenomena of psychical research to fall within the remit of psychology: ‘all the various manifestations which have formed the subject of “psychical research” – are essentially psychological phenomena’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952695111418745">Burt, 1961a</xref>: 29); ‘psychical processes and psychical phenomena [form] … the very crux of psychology as a separate branch of science’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952695111418745">Burt, 1967</xref>: 16). The relation between supernormal phenomena and abnormal psychology was particularly close. As Price himself remarked at the ULCPI dinner held in his honour: ‘departments of abnormal psychology or psychical research – they mean much the same thing’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0952695111418745">51</xref></sup> Theories of levels of consciousness, including Frederic Myers’s own, were regarded as part of abnormal psychology. The trance states entered (or supposedly entered) by mediums were considered altered states of consciousness, abnormal phenomena worthy of scientific investigation. William Brown’s interest in such phenomena was largely motivated by his concern with the nature of personality or the ‘self’. Writing of Mrs Leonard’s ‘control’ Feda, he says: ‘A possible psychological theory is that Feda is a secondary personality of Mrs. Leonard, part of her subconscious self – working as a dramatization of her subconscious self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952695111418745">Brown, 1929</xref>: 217).</p>
<p>Possibly the most significant reason for the cooperation between the psychologists and Harry Price was their mutual position poised between scientific and popular psychology. As noted above, Price was explicitly committed to engaging – even educating (as he saw it) – both scientists and the general population. He was continually involved in a balancing act to appeal to both constituencies. His laboratory, equipment and elaborate method of control designed to eliminate fraud were hallmarks of science. To the psychologists he appeared as an impartial investigator. On the other hand, his publications in the popular press were aimed at gaining the support (financial and otherwise) of the general public, including spiritualists.</p>
<p>The psychologists too were concerned to demonstrate the relevance of their work to everyday life while asserting their authority and expertise. They cultivated mass audiences and sought practical applications for their research. They were all enthusiastic about what the new psychology could offer, and wrote books aimed at educating the public in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0952695111418745">Thomson, 2006</xref>: 74). McDougall and Burt were regular broadcasters. Brown and Flugel wrote frequent letters to <italic>The Times</italic>. Brown, Burt and Flugel were all consulted by government officials at various times.</p>
<p>McDougall and Burt became particularly well known and were highly influential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0952695111418745">Thomson (2006</xref>: 55) describes McDougall as crossing the divide from the academic arena to the semi-popular realm of teaching and training, to the popular sphere of practical and even spiritual psychology. He wrote books of practical advice, and published in popular series. A series of talks on ‘Love and Hate: a Study of the Energies of Men and Nations’, broadcast in 1931, was subsequently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952695111418745">McDougall, 1931</xref>).</p>
<p>Burt too came to be regarded as an expert by the public, contributing to lectures and debates, as well as writing and broadcasting. His popularity was established by books such as <italic>The</italic>
<italic>Young Delinquent</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952695111418745">Burt, 1925</xref>), which ran to many editions. He was regarded as having a natural and easy microphone manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952695111418745">Hearnshaw, 1979</xref>: 189), broadcasting series on ‘The Study of the Mind’ and ‘The Mind of the Child’ in the 1930s. He collaborated on a project on aesthetics sponsored by the BBC, in which the judgements of 6,000 members of the public (readers of <italic>The Listener</italic>) were compared with those of six art experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952695111418745">Bulley, 1933</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0952695111418745">Thomson (2001)</xref> singles out Burt as an example of a psychologist who engaged in the balancing act of courting public appeal at the same time as asserting disciplinary authority, citing this example: ‘to follow the workings of the growing mind, to guide its development and correct its faults … we imagine … nothing but common sense is needed. <italic>No view could be more mistaken</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952695111418745">Burt, 1945</xref>: 8; cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0952695111418745">Thomson, 2001</xref>: 127; original emphases). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952695111418745">Aveling (1937</xref>: 115) emphasizes that his reader ‘unless he is himself a psychologist … will need the service of an expert’ to administer vocational guidance tests or to analyse and interpret work curves. Guy Brown, a physicist member of Price’s ULCPI, taking exception to the mention of Price’s secretary in a research report, protests: ‘[W]e cannot allow people to say that we leave a difficult physical measurement to an untrained person’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0952695111418745">52</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In sum, Price offered the psychologists access to subjects who apparently exhibited paranormal phenomena. He was able and willing to engage in the publicity necessary to secure them and to provide the funds necessary to maintain their services. The psychologists were thus able to acquire data under the controlled conditions of his laboratory relevant to their theories of the mind. Furthermore, for most of them, such data held the additional promise of supporting metaphysical positions to which they were wedded. Both Price and the psychologists in their different ways courted public appeal while asserting scientific expertise and authority. A study of their interactions is thus of historical significance in revealing the interplay between the professional and the popular at this transitional period in the development of psychology as a discipline.</p>

<p>McDougall was a dominating force in British psychology for the first part of the 20th century. Trained in medicine and science, he held posts at University College London and Oxford University (the Wilde Readership in Mental Philosophy) before emigrating to the United States in 1920, working first at Harvard, before moving to Duke University in 1927, where he remained until his death. He gave as two of the reasons for his emigration that income tax was taking a third of his income and that he was ‘savage against the English climate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952695111418745">McDougall, 1930</xref>: 212).</p>
