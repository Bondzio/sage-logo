<abstract>
<p>This article draws on a range of sociological literature including studies of sport, subculture, interspecies relationships and animal advocacy to understand the social processes that have contributed to the horse being defined as an athlete in equestrian sports. Using a combination of qualitative interviews and archival analysis, we identify trends in the equine industry that have provided the foundation for the emergence of a new type of equine athlete – the sport pony – in the context of late modern societies. We conclude by arguing that the popularity of the sport pony is a reflection of a general trend within the equine industry placing value on athleticism and esthetics.</p>

<p>The use of horses has changed dramatically over the last hundred years. Once central to economic and social life, horses currently occupy a more specialized role in late modern societies. Whereas once central to agriculture, industry and transportation, the new social realm for horses is limited primarily to sport, leisure and recreation pursuits. Correspondingly, as horses move into different social realms, there emerges a need for new types of horses. The growth of equestrian sports like those featured in the Olympic Games (show jumping, eventing, and dressage) has led to the trend toward breeding horse types with specific physical capacities, scope and disposition. The willingness and ability to jump a series of fences is now more central to what it means to be a horse than the capacity to pull heavy cargo or a large carriage. As a result, newer sport horse breeds are thriving as more people become involved in competitive and recreational equestrian sports while breeds established in the 19th century to power the industrial revolution are threatened and in decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211416726">Greene, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Beginning in Europe and moving to North America, a specific kind of sport horse breed – the sport pony – gained prominence as youth involvement in equestrian sports increased. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211416726">2009</xref> the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) recognized the growing participation of youth with a movement referred to as the ‘year of youth’ which sought to connect and give voice to young equestrians worldwide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.horsesport.org/youth">www.horsesport.org/youth</ext-link>). In this article we explore the social processes that have led to the re-classification of horses as athletes in equestrian sport. Using qualitative interviews with breeders, and archival data we describe the efforts among breeders in North America to ‘hybridize’ current established breeds in order to advance a new type of horse, the sport pony (a pony being defined as a type of horse measuring less than 1.48 meters at the withers). The sport pony breed initially began in the United Kingdom in the 1950s when larger Thoroughbred or Arabian horses were crossed with smaller Welsh or Dartmouth ponies to create what was initially called the riding pony. Soon after, German breeders also started to breed larger athletic ponies referred to as the Deutsches Reitpony. In the late 1960s, the ‘saddle pony’ breed was started for similar purposes in France. By the 1980s a similar breed had been started in Eastern European countries, called the Slovak sport pony. Our aim is to understand the development of the sport pony as a hybrid breed type, a material and cultural artifact that is suited to the physical and social demands of equestrian sports at this historical moment.</p>
<p>In the sociology of sport and interspecies relations, the study of horses and equestrianism has figured quite prominently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1012690211416726">McConville, 2008</xref>). This research has concentrated primarily on the evolution of sport forms that bring together human and horses as in, for instance, studies of rodeo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211416726">LeCompte, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1012690211416726">Stoeltje, 1989</xref>), the Olympics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211416726">Hedenborg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211416726">Huggins, 2000</xref>), hunt clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211416726">Marvin, 2007</xref>), racing clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211416726">Hedenborg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690211416726">O’Hara, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1012690211416726">Vamplew, 1976</xref>) and agricultural exhibitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211416726">Heaman, 1999</xref>). It is in this work that ethical status of using horses in sport is taken up. It is often argued that using horses in violent cultural spectacles is increasingly being recognized as a form of animal abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211416726">Atkinson and Young, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211416726">Dunning, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211416726">Holt, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the literature on horses in sport, our research builds most directly on studies that explore the subcultures of equestrian sports and interspecies sport in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211416726">Baldwin and Norris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211416726">Gillespie et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211416726">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211416726">Schaffner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690211416726">Sheard, 1999</xref>). This research emphasizes the relationship between horse and rider more so than the ethics of violence or gambling. The significance of relationships built between human and nonhuman in the context of sport is a recurring theme in this work. Several studies, for instance, examine the popularity of equestrian sports among girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211416726">Eichberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211416726">Hedenborg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211416726">Nikku, 2005</xref>). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1012690211416726">Pfister (1993)</xref>, they argue that, unlike many masculine dominated sports, equestrian sport is empowering and appealing along gender lines because girls and women are in control and in the majority. Along similar though not specifically gender lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211416726">Wipper (2000)</xref> traces the precarious social dimensions of partnership building between horse and rider that occurs while preparing, often over the course of several years, for competition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211416726">Game (2001)</xref> extends this idea by suggesting that equestrian sport is mutually constitutive for the human and nonhuman participant.</p>
<p>Game’s argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211416726">2001</xref>) that horse and rider is mutually constituted, that this relationship is created and sustained through the practice of riding, training and competing, is a topic that has not received sufficient attention in studies of interspecies sport. Furthermore, it is primarily the rider as athlete rather than the horse as athlete that has been the focus of attention. An understanding of the horse as an actor and partner, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211416726">Wipper (2000)</xref> has noted, is not well developed. We address this gap by concentrating our analysis on the meanings generated about the sport pony as a new category of horse: an athlete and partner in equestrian sport.</p>
<p>In exploring the sport pony-as-athlete we draw on two theoretical resources. First is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211416726">Latimer and Birke (2009)</xref>, who situate the meanings generated around the identity of a specific type of horse, in this case the sport pony, as the culmination of specific breeding practices and uses in sport over time that are themselves shaped by broader social structures. This ‘figure of the horse’ according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211416726">Latimer and Birke (2009</xref>: 8):
<disp-quote>
<p>is complex and polysemic: a hybrid but highly socially differentiated cultural artifact. The body of the horse is represented in terms of its ‘breed’, which is performed as having inherent qualities, but qualities that have been developed partly through methods of breeding and partly through how horses have been used or nurtured. The horse is performed as an effect – of the partial connection between nature, culture and technology.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While a specific horse breed may appear to be rooted in the ‘natural’ – a combination of genetics and ancestry – its qualities and attributes are tied to a history of place and function. They are the product of ‘breeding technologies, hard work and ‘‘education”’ among those who are dedicated to preserving and promoting the breed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211416726">Latimer and Birke, 2009</xref>: 9). Unlike the conventional understanding of breed, which is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211416726">Edwards (1980</xref>: 8) as ‘a group of horses that have been selectively bred over a sufficient period of time to ensure the consistent production of stock that has in common clearly defined characteristics of height, colour, conformation and action’, horse types are also the product of the needs and interests of citizens and the social and political circumstances in which they live and work.</p>
<p>The social context for horse breeding has shifted since the 19th and early 20th century when horses were used as engines of industrial advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211416726">Greene, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211416726">McShane and Tarr, 2007</xref>). Horses in late modern societies must meet the cultural and economic demands of an expanding equestrian sport industry. Breeds like the Irish Draught horse are being crossed with smaller more athletic breeds like the Thoroughbred or Arabian to create what is redefined as a more generic ‘sport horse’. The transformation of ‘draught’ horses into ‘sport’ horses – a trend that is evident in most countries in Europe and North America – is an effort to ensure the continuation of the breed by responding to the social transformations in the use of horses in late modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211416726">Latimer and Birke, 2009</xref>). The achieved status of a horse in its capacity to perform on the stage of equestrian events has taken primacy over its regional genetic lineage or pedigree. There is a greater propensity toward the creation of ‘hybrid’ breeds that combine the characteristics of a variety of different existing breeds to create a new category of horse that is better suited to equestrian sports.</p>
<p>Latimer and Birke point to the structural factors leading to a shift in the categorization of horse breeds. This work, however, is not sufficient in understanding the qualities or dispositions inherent or embodied in the new category of horse that is socially produced. To address this issue in our analysis, we build on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211416726">Bourdieu’s (1978)</xref> concept of this habitus only with references to the horse-as-athlete. In ‘Sport and Social Class’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211416726">Bourdieu (1978</xref>: 820) sets the foundation in which to understand equestrian sport as ‘area of production, endowed with its own logic and its own history, in which ‘‘sports products’’ are generated’. Horses occupy a curious position in this area of production in that they are both a product of sport as well as a social agent participating in events along with other social agents (human and nonhuman). As a social agent, the horse as athlete in order to perform successfully requires, like other agents participating in events, a specific ‘habitus’ – a set of internalized and embodied dispositions that structures one’s own sense of self (perception, taste, character) and directs and organizes social action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211416726">Booth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211416726">Bourdieu, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211416726">Kay and Laberge, 2002</xref>). In our analysis we examine the contours of an ‘equine habitus’ which enables horses to ‘fit into’ and excel in equestrian sports. The structure of this equine habitus is organized around two axes: the first is the physical capital of the horse which is embodied both as capacity (what it can do) and as aesthetics (how it looks); the second is social capital, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211416726">Haraway (2008)</xref> refers to as encounter value, which is embodied in the character, personality and demeanor of the horse.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This article is based on a broader study examining changes in the Canadian equestrian industry with specific attention to transformations in the use and status of ponies. This research examines transformations in the use of ponies in sport in relation to modernization and industrialization. We use a range of methods including document analysis, interviews and media analysis. Each method was used concurrently and informed the analysis as it emerged. Over the course of collecting data we identified emergent themes and incorporated them into the development of an ongoing dynamic analysis of the social and historical signification of the sport pony breed in equestrian sports. Twenty-five interviews were conducted with sport pony breeders, trainers, coaches, owners, and riders throughout Canada. The interviews were conducted over a period of eight months. Each interview subject identified themselves as one or more of these classifications. Interviews were semi-structured and ranged in length from 15 minutes to two hours. Respondents were asked questions regarding their involvement in equestrian sports and their use of sport ponies including what they knew about the history of sport ponies, and the purpose of sport ponies in their work and or competitive lives.</p>
<p>The research methods also included the use of archival data. Sources included market industry studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690211416726">Equine Canada, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211416726">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211416726">2003b</xref>), horse sport organization web pages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211416726">North American Sport Pony Registry, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690211416726">Sport Pony Canada, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690211416726">Sport Pony Magazine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690211416726">Sport Pony Studbook Society, 2010</xref>), webblogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211416726">Marsh Haven Farm, 2010</xref>), YouTube clips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211416726">Hilltop Farm, 2010</xref>), personal webpages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211416726">Morton’s Stables, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690211416726">Wishfoal Farms, 2010</xref>), and government web pages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211416726">Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690211416726">Department of Justice Canada, 2010</xref>). The Canadian sport pony website and the North American sport pony website were used to gather information regarding current competition dates, sport pony news, and the history of sport ponies. Government web pages included resources from agriculture Canada, and information specific to the Canadian animal pedigree act. Personal web pages that were used included but were not restricted to the web pages of pony breeders from Canada, the United States and Germany. Online video clips of sport ponies competing and being trained to ride and drive were used to gain a better understanding of how the sport pony performs across disciplines.</p>
<p>In some cases, the sources of data drawn upon in this study were in their accounts interested in promoting and advancing the idea of a sport pony breed. A number of the horse breeders in particular had a vested economic interest in the idea that there ought to be a sport pony. This view was not share by all breeders, however. Many that we spoke with articulate a balanced point of view on this new breed as a contested idea that had advantages and disadvantages for their work and for the horse industry more broadly. Similarly, the archival sources of information also varied in terms of articulating a more explicitly promotional tone, as in the case of breeders’ websites or sport pony organization websites, versus a more balanced consideration of the issue, as was the case with government documents market industry studies. As such, data sources were not taken at face value as trusted sources of information but critically evaluating in relation to their position on the issue of advancing the sport pony as a breed in equestrian sport.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1012690211416726">
<title>The emergence of sport ponies as a hybrid breed</title>
<p>The sport pony as a breed developed in response to social transformations within late modernity in the context of equestrian sport. Like horses, ponies were historically used for transportation and as a source of physical power on farms or in mines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211416726">Chamberlin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211416726">McShane and Tarr, 2007</xref>). With the invention of the combustion engine and motor vehicles the purpose of ponies gradually shifted towards leisure and sport. As a precursor to the sport pony, riding ponies were an initial attempt by breeders to cross ‘working ponies’ with more athletic breeds. The British Riding Pony, for instance, began in the 1930s replacing the traditional stocky, rouged, hardy, mountain pony with a finer, more athletic, and aesthetically pleasing mount. While still small in comparison with horses (under 1.48 meters), riding ponies were bred to be athletic enough to jump fences, gallop cross country, pull carts, and perform dressage movements, while being safe enough to be suitable for a youth or young child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211416726">National Pony Society, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the 1960s breeders in Germany established the first recognized sport pony called the Deutsches Reitpony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1012690211416726">Through Connection Ltd, 2010</xref>). Although similar to the British Riding Pony, the Reitpony is distinctive as a sport pony – as opposed to its predecessor the riding pony – on two key fronts. First, fundamental to the goals of Reitpony breeders was to create a pony with the build and stature of a small horse. The athletic capacity and stature of the Reitpony was greater than that of riding ponies; they were larger, between 1.37 meters and 1.48 meters and had a much longer stride and a smooth and rhythmic gait. Second, the Deutsches Reitpony had an established registry that was modeled after European warmblood and sport horse registries. The registry inspected and graded each pony based on standardized measures of their performance ability, confirmation, and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1012690211416726">Through Connection Ltd, 2010</xref>). A key objective of the registry was to bring ponies into competitive equestrian sports on the same level as horses.</p>
<p>Since the development of the Reitpony, similar breeds – referred to as either sport ponies or competition ponies – have been developed in countries in Europe, the Commonwealth and North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211416726">Hungarian Horse Association, 2010</xref>). The Reitpony, for instance, served as a model for the American sport pony. Established in 1997, the North American Sport Pony Registry began as a division of the American Warmblood Registry (AWR). As the number of sport ponies throughout North America grew, the founders of the registry saw a need to grade, document, and promote the ponies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211416726">North American Sport Pony Registry, 2010</xref>). In 2003, the organization Sport Pony Canada was founded to bring together those who were breeding sport or competitive ponies. This initiative has sought to bring together breeders with similar interests and advance the interests of sport ponies in equestrian sport in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690211416726">Sport Pony Canada, 2010</xref>). The standardization of the sport pony type has lead to a rise in sport pony competitions and Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI)-level pony competitions in Canada and the United States.</p>

<sec id="section3-1012690211416726">
<title>Sport ponies as equine athletes</title>
<p>The pony as an equine athlete gained recognition and momentum as breeders became aware that it is possible to cross-breed ponies and horses in such a way that they have the capacity to compete in equestrian sports at all levels. This new breeding approach required a different understanding of ‘the pony’: the idea that a pony’s usefulness could be extended from being workers, companions, teachers, or babysitters to that of an athlete capable of participating in the highest level of equestrian competition. Sport pony breeders work to advance this understanding of what a pony can become in equestrian sports. This idea of a sport pony and its expression in terms of an equine habitus, advances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211416726">Latimer and Birke’s (2009)</xref> analysis of horse breeds by demonstrating they can be understood in relation to the embodiment of two related forms of capital. The first is physical capital, reflecting a shift in breeding away from pedigree toward performance. The second is cultural capital, which is expressed in relation to the embodiment of a specific kind of character, demeanor and disposition. The sport ponies cultural capital is a product of the relationships it is capable of establishing.</p>
<sec id="section4-1012690211416726">
<title>Physical capital: Performance over pedigree</title>
<p>The trend toward breeding ponies for sport in Canada and the United States is recent, emerging with the popularity of European ponies bred specifically for riding. Breeders in Canada and the United States are increasingly seeing the need and market for athletic, small-horse type ponies, rather than the traditional pony breeds. In North America, the historical development of sport ponies as a breed type is in the process of being established. The physical capital embodied in sport ponies is a product of breeding techniques and reflects the ‘taste’ of key figures participating in the field of equestrian sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211416726">White and Wilson, 1999</xref>). As one breeder explained, ‘the Welsh pony industry has really fallen off and the hunter [sport] pony industry has really increased, and the standards and type of ponies has definitely improved’. Other respondents noted that people are realizing ponies can be bred to be smaller, talented horses. People involved in equestrian sports acknowledged that it is not necessary to have a breed-registered pony like a Welsh or a Dartmoor to be successful. And, that it may in fact be preferable to a use a pony that has been specifically bred to excel in equestrian events.</p>
<p>This breeding for performance over pedigree is a trend also seen in dogs, a practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211416726">Haraway (2003)</xref> refers to as purpose-bred puppy breeding. Along this line, respondents noted that horses bred for a specific purpose challenged traditional breeding practices that are based on bloodlines. One key element of this purpose-bred orientation was the importance of physical capacity. Many breeders identified athletic ability as the defining characteristic of the sport pony breed type. According to one breeder, ‘sport ponies have to be athletic, they have to be flowing in their movement; they can’t be small and plump like a Thelwell pony’. The Thelwell pony that the respondent refers to is a cartoon caricature by Norman Thelwell, which dates back to the 1950s. A Thelwell pony has come to represent the typical traditionally bred ‘pedigree’ pony: short, stocky, stubborn, and mischievous. One respondent in our study commenting on the difference between traditional ponies and sport ponies noted that:
<disp-quote>
<p>many ponies now don’t seem to be Thelwell ponies anymore with the big round bellies and the short little legs, they seem to be elegant, well put together, nice moving, so they are not just good at their job, they are pretty too.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The American Sport Pony Registry and the Canadian Sport Pony Association are organizations made up of breeders who seek to promote the legitimacy of purpose breeding in North America. Respondents in the study identified the two organizations as having the potential to positively impact the standards of sport ponies. A respondent said that:

<p>you can reason with what their goals are, a pony with attractive aesthetically pleasing type of pony with overall balanced and harmonious confirmation, athletic, good temperament. . . . An advantage of performance registries is it gives you an assurance that these horses meet a certain standard and a certain type.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A recurrent theme throughout our interviews was the role played by breed registries in defining and advancing the physical capital parameters of what constitutes an ideal typical sport pony. Registries serve this purpose by establishing and evaluating performance guidelines through inspections and numeric grading scales. Sport ponies are evaluated and scored when accredited members of a sport pony association inspects them.</p>
<p>Not all breeders agree with the need for registers, arguing that they did not think inspection was worthwhile as it could cost as much as one thousand dollars. In addition to cost, others felt that the term ‘sport pony’ was a fad and chose not to register their ponies with the sport pony association. If a pony is not inspected, then its value is drawn unofficially from either performance in competition or by the breeders’ application of the sport pony label without a formal inspection. Using the sport pony label without inspection is controversial as some argue that it undermines the legitimacy of officially registered and inspected sport ponies. Breeders noted that regardless of whether they had registered their ponies with an association they would be inclined to refer to their ponies as sport ponies if they felt this label would be a valuable marketing strategy. Furthermore, one breeder argued that performance trumps whatever label a horse is given: ‘selling to trainers and coaches and show barns, they don’t care if it’s a Clyde or a Shetland if it can do the job’. Another said, ‘I don’t think people really care if your pony is registered, especially in the pony world, as long as it can do the job they want for their child.’</p>
<p>Despite such reservations, the majority of breeders saw breed registries, and the move toward the sport pony breed broadly, as improving the quality of ponies being bred for sport in Canada. Shifting the meaning of the pony away from the traditional image popularized by Thelwell to that of an athlete improved the prospects of ponies in general becoming obsolete in equestrian sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211416726">Hendricks and Dent, 2007</xref>). The sport pony helps ponies as a group survive in a climate dominated by larger horses. Many respondents saw the shift from pedigree to performance as a new emergent ideology in equestrian sport. One breeder explains: ‘I think it’s a phenomenon that’s catching on where people are realizing that ponies can do it all – they can do eventing and dressage.’</p>

<title>Cultural capital: Encounter value</title>
<p>Demonstrated athletic capacity of a pony in sport, ideally confirmed through a breeding registry, is what we have referred to as physical capital and in part gives the sport pony its value within equestrian sport, a field of cultural production. This physical capital can be converted into monetary capital when the pony is bought or sold and used in competition. The exchange value of a sport pony is not limited to physical capital alone. Physical capital is only one component of an equine habitus. Sport ponies need to be athletic; however, their appeal lies as much in their disposition and stature, what we refer to as cultural capital. What gives the sport pony an additional type of value, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211416726">Haraway’s (2008)</xref> uses the term, is the relationship they develop with a rider (and other participants in the field of equestrian sport). If physical capacity is what a rider is looking for alone then a horse will suffice. What the sport pony offers is physical capacity combined with a smaller (and less intimidating) stature and easy-going temperament. In this regard, when breeders are creating a hybrid pony for sport they are looking not only to determine physical capacity but also temperament and stature. This disposition is a key component of what constitutes an equine habitus and what it means for a pony to be an athlete. And while it is prominent among sport pony breeders, it is arguable that this trend is extending to breeding for equestrian sport in general. Breeders are recognizing that many riders wish to have a companionable relationship with their horse or pony and that this may even be more important than the physical ability of the animal, though capacity is an important component of what contributes to the value of a horse as a commodity.</p>
<p>In term of cultural capital the sport pony has a value that is acquired through the relationship established with a rider and trainer. The capacity to interact with people over time contributes to the establishment of a sport pony’s social nature and disposition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211416726">Haraway (2008)</xref> refers to this as an animal’s encounter value. Many parents within the equine industry would pay significantly more money for a pony they could trust to take care of their child. Sport ponies tap into a niche market within the equine industry by breeding athletic ponies with good temperaments for children and small adults. Respondents said that breeding horses for equestrian sport is getting more competitive and as a result the sport pony market is seen to be a lucrative alternative. They identified sectors within the pony market that had grown in popularity in recent years. One respondent pointed out that, ‘in the last three years the pony driving market has opened up’.</p>
<p>Buying and selling horses and ponies is a process of value negotiation; the seller must attempt to accurately identify the type of buyer their horse or pony would best suit. The target market for those selling sport ponies included two distinct types of riders: smaller adults and youth. Youth would be considered the traditional market for someone who was selling a pony, however breeders and sellers suggest the type of youth consumer has changed over the years. One respondent said, ‘I think it is more to do with the microwave era; everyone wants something really fast, and not a lot of people are willing to work for it.’ This trend of selling a sport pony that was ready and willing to perform was a consistent theme throughout the interviews. Another breeder suggested that the individuals she had sold ponies to had a particular mentality that she felt was consistent with most of the pony buyers today:
<disp-quote>
<p>If I’ve got a fifteen year old kid that I’m paying for lessons for, then I’m going to make damn well sure that’s she’s going to win a ribbon. That is easier than having to explain to her that she has to develop the skills in order to earn that ribbon.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The sport pony is marketable to both youth and smaller adults because it has the two main selling points that these groups look for: athleticism and dependability. When interviewing the parents of children who ride ponies, their main concern was whether their child was going to be safe on the pony. This concern is representative of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211416726">Haraway’s (2008)</xref> encounter-value: when the child or adult makes a successful bond with the animal, the value of that animal substantially increases. In the case of sport ponies, interviews with sport pony breeders suggested a ‘dual’ encounter-value was developed that Haraway would not have observed in her study of dogs. The dual encounter-value is the value the pony gains from the connection it makes with a child, and also the secondary connection it makes with the parent or guardian of that child. Both the child and the guardian of the child must learn to trust the pony and when that trust is developed the pony develops a form of value that exceeds its exchange value. Other concerns, marginal to the concern of trust, are whether the child grow out of the pony too quickly, competes successfully on the pony, and if pony is easy to maintain.</p>
<p>For small adults the rationale for using a sport pony rather than a horse is different. The use of ponies by adults, many of whom are women, is a tangible indication of shift in the pony market. One breeder identified, ‘it used to be that you mostly sold ponies to kids and grandparents, there is [now] a big market with adult amateur riders for ponies’. One trainer identified that in Europe it is becoming ‘more acceptable for tiny adults to ride these ponies’ suggesting that the growing acceptance in North America is a result of changes that have already begun in Europe. The notion of why this shift has emerged was considered and one breeder commented, ‘I think that people have now realized that ponies are basically miniature, talented horses.’ This demand among smaller adults points to the growing ascendency and legitimacy of sport ponies as equine athletes in equestrian sport. Sport ponies tap into a niche market within the equine industry by breeding athletic ponies with good temperaments for children and small adults. The identification of a niche market and the diversification of inventory were suggested as mechanisms for success in the horse breeding industry.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The presence of horses in work, sport and leisure continues to influence the structure of modern societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211416726">Greene, 2008</xref>). In work, horses were a necessity for many communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211416726">Greene, 2008</xref>). In the 19th century cities were built around horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211416726">McShane and Tarr, 2007</xref>). The presence of horses in cities, however, became increasingly problematic: they were expensive to feed and keep, prone to disease, and their waste not easily disposed of in a city setting. With modernization, horses moved out of the city into the field of sport, recreation and leisure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211416726">Latimer and Birke (2009)</xref> outline the classification and breeding of horses shifted to account for this historical trend in the movement of horses in public life. In recent years the emergence of the sport pony is evidence that breeding practices have transformed the socially constructed ‘figure of the horse’ to suit the needs and taste of those involved in equestrian sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211416726">Game, 2001</xref>). For youth and small adults, for instance, the athletic ability, small stature and desirable temperament of the sport pony encourage the horse–rider connection and establishment of a partnership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211416726">Wipper (2000)</xref> identifies that the horse–human relationship can take on many forms, ranging from egalitarian to authoritarian, but is best achieved when shared decisions between horse and rider are based on mutual negotiations. The sport pony is bred specifically to encourage this relationship and hence contribute to its encounter value as an equine athlete. In embodying a specific type of equine habitus, the sport pony participates in the field of equestrian sport in dual capacity: the pony is a product of breeding practices intended to emphasize specific physical and social dispositions; at the same time, the pony is also an agent who is contributing to his or her own fate by performing (successfully or unsuccessfully) in competitions and initiating (or jeopardizing) social relationships with those involved in equestrian sport. By describing the formation of an equine habitus, and by showing how animals actively participate in sport as athletes, we hope to push the direction of interspecies research on sport toward conceptualizing non-humans participants as social agents.</p>
