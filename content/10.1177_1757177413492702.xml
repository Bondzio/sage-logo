<p>Published in 2010, <italic>Inside the Outbreaks</italic> by Mark Pendergrast had passed me by until Amazon presented an <italic>If you liked this…</italic> recommendation. I am so glad they did. This is perhaps the best book on outbreaks I have ever read. The book presents the efforts, achievements and occasionally failures of the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from the inception of the service in 1951 until 2009. This is not a <italic>‘How to manage an outbreak’</italic> text. It does not detail every blind alley the investigators ventured into before finding the cause of an outbreak, nor does it present the formulaic process of outbreak investigations. It is, however, a history not just of the outbreaks investigated – successfully or otherwise – but also of the social and ethical context of the day. Some of the descriptions of the social context provide a shocking reminder of just how far we have journeyed as a society. As an example of the social history, Pendergrast writes about one medic’s response to Julie Garner, a nurse and EIS officer, appearing at a conference in 1970. Of Julie, who is still one of my heroines for her original work on transmission-based precautions, a doctor commented ‘that it was a waste of time training nurses to do disease surveillance, since the only surveillance they would be conducting within 5 years would be on their children’s behaviour in the supermarket.’</p>
<p>For those of us who think there are too many ethical hoops that need to be jumped through before being able to undertake research these days, in the sad and sorry tales of experiments on prisoners and even in the eradication of smallpox, the book provides the rationale for each and every hoop.</p>
<p>But most intriguing of all is the insight into the novel, emerging and re-emerging pathogens that continue to find new ways to make people ill. EIS officers respond to outbreaks with a tool kit. They look for changes that caused the outbreak (even if that is just the entry of a new pathogen to a naïve community) and look for what changes will stop the outbreak. In presenting the outbreaks chronologically, infection preventionists will find themselves shouting at early outbreaks – ‘It’s Legionnaires’ disease.’ It <italic>is</italic> Legionnaires’ disease – but you can’t blame the EIS officers for not knowing that – no one had yet found or named the Legionnella organism.</p>
<p>The period covered by the book begins only a handful of years after I was born and provides the reader with a myriad opportunities to think about the sheer enormity of microbial challenges, on how much we have learned and on how much people have suffered, all in a lifetime.</p>
<p>The writing style makes the book exceptionally easy to read. For those of you who love quotes I offer you just a couple. Of Alex Langmuir (the founder of the EIS) it was said, ‘Alex was often wrong but never in doubt.’ In another section, an anthropologist explains to the EIS that ‘… culture drives behaviour and that reality is always complex, subjective and changing.’ In a pithy comment illustrating the limitations of quantitative research, the anthropologist states simply: ‘You can quantify what happened but, [without qualitative research] not explain why.’</p>
<p>This book about the EIS of the CDC is a <italic>tour de force</italic>. The author provides a kind of time-lapse window into the investigations of emerging, re-emerging and novel microbial pathogens that have caused outbreaks throughout the globe over half a century. This is essential reading for all infection prevention and control teams and anyone with a love of social, ethical or microbiological history.</p>
