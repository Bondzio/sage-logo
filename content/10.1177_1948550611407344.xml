<abstract>
<p>The present research examines the relation between measures of childhood temperament at 54 months and adolescent risk taking and externalizing problems. Three temperament factors were calculated from maternal reports: negative affectivity, surgency, and effortful control. At Age 15, data was gathered on risk taking and externalizing problems using self- and maternal reports. Analyses indicated that effortful control predicted self-reported risk taking. Different dimensions of temperament were related to externalizing behaviors, depending on the identity of the reporter. Maternal reports of externalizing problems were predicted by all three dimensions, whereas self-reports of externalizing problems were predicted only by surgency. Additional analyses demonstrated that the prospective associations between childhood effortful control and adolescent risk taking and externalizing behaviors were partially mediated by adolescent measures of self-regulation: impulse control and future planning. Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of early emerging personality differences for understanding problem behaviors during the teen years.</p>

<p>Dimensions of temperament refer to early-emerging individual differences—the childhood precursors of adult personality. Temperament is typically thought to capture relatively enduring tendencies in emotional, motor, and attentional reactivity that are rooted in psychobiological systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611407344">Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611407344">Clark &amp; Watson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407344">De Pauw &amp; Mervielde, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611407344">Rothbart &amp; Bates, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611407344">Wachs &amp; Bates, 2001</xref>). Although there is debate about the precise connection between childhood temperament and adult personality, there is emerging recognition that they are strongly overlapping constructs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611407344">Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611407344">Clark &amp; Watson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611407344">Donnellan &amp; Robins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611407344">Tackett, 2006</xref>). Similar to studies of adult personality traits, numerous studies have documented associations between temperament and outcomes from the domains of social (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611407344">Eisenberg, Fabes, Guthrie, &amp; Reiser, 2000</xref>), emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611407344">Kochanska, Philibert, &amp; Barry, 2009</xref>), and cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611407344">Blair &amp; Razza, 2007</xref>). Likewise, temperamental dimensions are related to psychopathology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407344">De Pauw &amp; Mervielde, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611407344">Nigg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611407344">Tackett, 2006</xref>). Thus, dimensions of temperament are linked to consequential life outcomes.</p>
<p>The present research extends the literature on the power of personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611407344">Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, &amp; Goldberg, 2007</xref>) by evaluating connections between temperamental characteristics measured during early childhood and adolescent risk taking and externalizing behavior problems. Before describing the current study, we briefly review previous literature concerning the structure of temperament and relations between dimensions of temperament and externalizing problems.</p>
<p>Rothbart and her colleagues have proposed one of the most widely used models of temperament structure which identifies three major dimensions: negative affectivity, surgency, and effortful control (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611407344">Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, &amp; Fisher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611407344">Rothbart &amp; Bates, 2006</xref>). Negative affectivity refers to the tendency to experience emotional distress in novel, intense, and uncertain situations. Fear, anger, sadness, and discomfort are specific emotions associated with this dimension. It is a consistent predictor of externalizing problems and antisocial behavior, especially in adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611407344">Cale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611407344">Krueger, Caspi, &amp; Moffitt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611407344">Miller &amp; Lynam, 2001</xref>). However, the strength of the association may depend on how negative affectivity is assessed, with more consistent effects found in studies in which hostility was a strong component and less consistent effects when attributes like anxiety and depression were emphasized (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611407344">Cale, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Surgency captures a lack of shyness, coupled with high levels of energy. It serves as a protective factor against the development of depression, as it is related to the ability to experience positive emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611407344">Clark &amp; Watson, 2008</xref>). Children high in surgency may tend to be hyperactive and even aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611407344">Berdan, Keane, &amp; Calkins, 2008</xref>). However, the overall association between this dimension and externalizing problems tends to be the weakest of the three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611407344">Cale, 2006</xref>). One exception might be found for those elements of surgency most strongly related to sensation seeking, which is associated with heightened risk taking (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611407344">Zuckerman, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Effortful control captures self-regulatory processes, such as the ability to plan ahead, activate a novel response, and inhibit a dominant response. It also plays an important role in the top-down regulation of emotions and reactive approach/withdrawal behavioral tendencies in risk and/or reward situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611407344">Blair, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611407344">Blair &amp; Diamond, 2008</xref>).Of the three dimensions, effortful control has the most straightforward conceptual and empirical connections to externalizing problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407344">De Pauw &amp; Mervielde, 2010</xref>), Henry and colleagues found that a temperamental lack of control at Age 3 (akin to low levels of effortful control) predicted conviction of violent offenses at Age 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611407344">Henry, Caspi, Moffitt, &amp; Silva, 1996</xref>). Likewise, constraint and conscientiousness, two dimensions of adult personality with strong conceptual overlap with effortful control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611407344">Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407344">De Pauw &amp; Mervielde, 2010</xref>), are also consistent predictors of antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611407344">Cale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611407344">Miller &amp; Lynam, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary goal of this report was to examine associations between early temperament and adolescent risk taking and externalizing behaviors. However, beyond documenting associations across developmental periods (i.e., from early childhood to adolescence), an additional goal was to test a theoretically informed process model linking preschool temperament (particularly effortful control) with adolescent self-regulatory abilities that figure in prominent models of the psychological attributes linked with adolescent problem behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611407344">Steinberg, 2008</xref>). Therefore, we evaluated connections between effortful control and two measures from the adolescent self-regulation literature: impulse control and future planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611407344">Steinberg et al., 2009</xref>). Impulse control refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate and/or ill-considered behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611407344">Nigg, 2000</xref>) and is required when particular urges are activated in a given setting. For example, high levels of impulse control prevent the dieting individual from consuming the tempting but nonetheless calorie-laden dessert. In contrast, future planning reflects the ability to envision long-term consequences and to persist in working toward future goals.</p>
<p>Both impulse control and future planning are hypothesized to act as a top-down “brake” over rash thoughts and actions that typically increase in salience and attractiveness during puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611407344">Steinberg, 2008</xref>). Connections between preschool effortful control and these two variables would demonstrate developmental coherence between early individual differences and aspects of self-regulation in adolescence. Currently, there is evidence linking contemporaneous self-regulation to risk taking and externalizing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611407344">Ellis, Rothbart, &amp; Posner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611407344">Martel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611407344">Raffaelli &amp; Crockett, 2003</xref>). However, research on the longer term connections between childhood temperament and adolescent self-control is far less extensive.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that adolescent impulse control and future planning would both serve as (a) contemporaneous predictors of risk taking and externalizing behavior and (b) would partially mediate the relation between effortful control and later risk taking and externalizing behaviors. That is, we expected that adolescent measures of self-regulation may help to explain some of the association between childhood temperament and adolescent problem behavior. Support for our second hypothesis would suggest that childhood effortful control may contribute to adolescent self-regulatory abilities and therefore add an important developmental dimension to current theorizing about adolescent risk taking.</p>
<p>An additional goal of the present study was to test for evidence of interactions between dimensions of temperament when statistically predicting future externalizing problems. Indeed, researchers have proposed that effortful control may moderate links between dimensions of temperament with strong affective components (e.g., negative affectivity) and outcomes (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407344">De Pauw &amp; Mervielde, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611407344">Valiente, Lemery-Chalfant, &amp; Swanson, 2010</xref>). That is, effortful control may serve as a top-down regulator of basic affective tendencies involved in approach and avoidance motivation (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611407344">Valiente et al., 2010</xref>). For example, high levels of effortful control might be able to temper the deleterious consequences of negative affectivity. Unfortunately, large sample sizes are required to reliably detect interactions in correlational research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611407344">McClelland &amp; Judd, 1993</xref>). Accordingly, consistent empirical support for these interactions is not widespread in existing studies, which are often based on modest sample sizes.</p>
<p>The data used for the present analyses come from a large prospective study of children and their parents collected from multiple regions of the United States. Measures of Rothbart’s three-factor model were derived from maternal ratings and used to predict adolescent self-reports of risk taking, impulse control, and future planning to provide a multi-informant and longitudinal perspective on the connections between preschool temperament and adolescent development. In addition, we examined maternal and self-report of externalizing problems. Previous research has found the concordance between reports from parents and youth to be far from perfect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611407344">Achenbach, McConaughy, &amp; Howell, 1987</xref>) and it may also be that different aspects of problems are salient or observable to parents or youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611407344">Karver, 2006</xref>). This raises the possibility that different temperament dimensions may be differentially predictive, depending on the identity of the informant.</p>
<p>This research offers several advantages over previous studies. Foremost, the present study uses data from an initial sample of over 1,000 children and their caregivers. The use of a large sample size will increase statistical power, in particular our ability to detect previously hypothesized interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407344">De Pauw &amp; Mervielde, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611407344">Valiente et al., 2010</xref>) between dimensions of temperament. Second, previous studies with large sample sizes and long time frames (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611407344">Henry et al., 1996</xref>) did not use a measure of preschool temperament that was explicitly tied to a contemporary structural model of temperament. Thus, the findings of the present study will be easier to incorporate into the contemporary literature. Third, the current sample possesses socioeconomic variability. This is important, as socioeconomic variables, such as parental education level and financial difficulties, have been linked to self-regulatory problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611407344">Li-Grining, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611407344">Mezzacappa, 2004</xref>). Moreover, the use of socioeconomic status (SES) also provides us with a comparison standard for evaluating effect sizes associated with measures of temperament (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611407344">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were drawn from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (for information about recruitment and participant retention, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611407344">NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2003</xref>). There were data from 1,061 children for the temperament variables at 54 months. Approximately 50% of the children (<italic>N</italic> = 529) were girls. Caucasian and non-Hispanic children represented 79% of the sample, with Black and Hispanic children forming 12% and 6% of the sample, respectively. Of these 1,061 children, only 990 had data at Age 15. Children without adolescent data did not differ significantly from those with data on any of the eight temperament subscales nor on income-to-needs ratio. However, the groups differed on maternal education (<italic>M</italic> = 13.99 years vs. 14.49), <italic>t</italic>(1059) = 2.31, <italic>p</italic> = .02.</p>

<title>Children’s behavior questionnaire (CBQ)</title>
<p>The CBQ measures temperament in children between the ages of 3 and 8. The original instrument contains 196 items that measure 15 subscales of temperament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611407344">Rothbart et al., 2001</xref>). Items were presented on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = Extremely Untrue to 7 = Extremely True) and were directed at children’s typical responding to a number of common situations from the previous 6 months. In the present sample, mothers completed a shortened version consisting of 76 items measuring 8 subscales: Approach/Anticipation (10 items, α = .70), Activity Level (10 items, α = .70), Shyness (8 items, α = .85), Fear (10 items, α = .64), Anger/Frustration (10 items, α = .76), Sadness (10 items, α = .60), Inhibitory Control (10 items, α = .75), and Attentional Focusing (8 items, α = .74). The internal consistencies reported here are similar to other studies using shorter forms of the CBQ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611407344">Putnam &amp; Rothbart, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Youths completed this measure of the ability to control impulses and regulate behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611407344">Weinberger &amp; Schwartz, 1990</xref>). Each item is responded to on a 5-point scale (1 = False to 5 = True), indicating the extent to which the respondent agreed with a statement regarding their behavior (e.g., “I stop and think things through before I act”). Impulse control was calculated as the mean of all items and scored so that higher values reflected a greater ability to control impulses (α = .82). This measure has previously been shown to predict risk-taking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611407344">Farrell &amp; Sullivan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611407344">Weinberger &amp; Schwartz, 1990</xref>).</p>

<p>The Future Outlook Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611407344">Cauffman &amp; Woolard, 1999</xref>) is an 8-item measure designed to assess the ability to persist in a goal, plan ahead, and consider the consequences of one’s actions. Items were statements (e.g., “I can see my life 10 years from now.”) for which the youth had to select a response on a 4-point scale (1 = <italic>Never</italic> to 4 = <italic>Always</italic>). Future Planning was calculated as the mean of all items and scored so that higher values reflect a greater ability to plan for the future and consider long-term goals (α = .72). This measure has been shown to predict persistent antisocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611407344">Mulvey et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Risky behaviors questionnaire</title>
<p>Participants were asked to complete items related to risky behaviors that they engaged in (e.g., fighting, cutting school, smoking) on a 3-point scale (0 = <italic>Not at all</italic>, 1 = <italic>Once or twice</italic>, and 2 = <italic>More than twice</italic>). Risk Taking (α = .91) was the square root of the mean response of 36 items and scored so that higher values reflected more risky behaviors.

<p>Mothers completed the CBCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611407344">Achenbach, 1991</xref>): a 129-item measure reflecting a broad range of behavior and emotional problems related to the youth. For each item, the mother was asked to rate how well an item describes the youth currently or within the last 6 months. Ratings were made on a 3-point scale (0 = <italic>Not True</italic>, 1 = <italic>Somewhat or Sometimes True</italic>, and 2 = <italic>Very True or Often True</italic>). We examined Externalizing Problems scores (33 items, α = 0.91), which reflected acts of delinquency, such as truancy, substance use, vandalism, stealing, and swearing, as well as acts of aggression, such as the destruction of property, mood changes, disobedience at home and school, temper tantrums, and screaming.</p>

<title>Youth self-report (YSR)</title>
<p>The YSR is a 119-item self-report measure that assesses a range of behavioral and emotional problems in adolescence designed to parallel the CBCL. We examined Externalizing Problems scores (30 items; α = .86), which were similar to those measured by the CBCL.</p>
<p>Raw scores from the CBCL and YSR were positively skewed, with many participants and parents reporting no problems. Thus, a square root transformation was applied to each measure.</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>To control for the effect of SES, income-to-needs ratios were calculated at both 54 months and 15 years. This ratio consisted of the income of the family divided by the poverty level at the time. Larger values reflect higher levels of financial resources. The two variables were strongly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .57) and were standardized and averaged for a single index of SES from childhood to adolescence.</p>
<p>Gender was also included as a covariate in many of the analyses. We used a dummy variable indicating the participant’s gender (1 = female and 0 = male).</p>

<sec id="section14-1948550611407344">
<title>Plan of Data Analysis</title>
<p>We utilized a multistep procedure to analyze these data. We first used exploratory factor analytic techniques to evaluate whether the CBQ yielded three higher order factors. Previous research with the CBQ used oblimin rotation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611407344">Rothbart et al., 2001</xref>), so we specified this rotation and used the default γ value of 0. We then interpreted the pattern loadings and correlations between latent temperament factors in the context of the existing childhood temperament literature (see online Appendix A available at http://spp.sagepub.com/supplemental). Previous studies of the CBQ point to the potential for multiple cross-loadings for individual scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611407344">Rothbart et al., 2001</xref>). This indicates that this inventory would not do well when subjected to strictly confirmatory factor analytic applications (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611407344">Marsh, Ludtke, Muthen, Asparouhov, &amp; Morin, 2010</xref>). After evaluating the structure of the CBQ, we constructed scales for use with standard regression-based analyses. We elected to use this procedure given that interaction terms with continuous variables are easily handled in this analytic framework and readily understood by social/personality psychologists. Although standard regression-based analyses use listwise deletion methods, we reestimated models in Mplus using Full Information Maximum Likelihood Estimation and the results were substantively identical to those reported here. Correlations and standardized regression coefficients were interpreted using rules of thumb associated with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611407344">Cohen (1988)</xref>: An effect size around |.10| was considered small, an effect around |.30| was considered medium, and an effect around |.50| was considered large.</p>

<title>Higher Order Dimensions of Temperament at 54 months</title>
<p>The eight temperament scales were used in an exploratory factor analysis to determine whether we could extract the three temperament dimensions discussed in the existing literature. Three eigenvalues were greater than 1.0 (Eight eigenvalues: 2.727, 1.637, 1.061, 0.716, 0.621, 0.473, 0.394, 0.371) and we examined two-, three-, and four-factor solutions. The three-factor solution offered the closest approximation to the canonical Rothbart and Bates model. Factor I (Negative Affectivity) reflected higher levels of Fear, Sadness, and Anger/Frustration. Factor II (Surgency) captured higher Activity Levels and Approach/Anticipation, along with lower levels of Shyness. Factor III (Effortful Control) reflected higher levels of Attentional Control and Inhibitory Control, along with lower Activity Level. The latent factor correlations were as follows: <italic>r</italic> = .239 for Negative Affectivity and Surgency; <italic>r</italic> = –.138 for Negative Affectivity and Effortful Control; <italic>r</italic> = –.402 for Surgency and Effortful Control. Based on these results, we calculated a Negative Affectivity composite (the average of the Fear, Sadness, and Anger/Frustration scales), a Surgency composite (the average of the Shyness (reversed), Activity Level, and Approach/Anticipation scales), and an Effortful Control composite (the average of the Attentional Focus and Inhibitory Control scales) for use in subsequent analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1948550611407344">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Relations Between Dimensions of Child Temperament and Adolescent Outcomes</title>
<p>We used the three temperament composites at 54 months to predict adolescent outcomes at Age 15. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550611407344">Table 2</xref> reports zero-order correlations and regression coefficients in models that also controlled for gender and SES. As anticipated, Effortful Control was the most consistent statistical predictor of adolescent outcomes. It was the only 54 month temperament variable that was independently related to the two adolescent variables of self-regulation and the self-reported risk taking. Interestingly, Effortful Control predicted maternal reports of Externalizing Problems but not self-reports (although the zero-order correlation was significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Surgency related to both mother and self-reports of Externalizing Problems; whereas Negative Affectivity predicted only maternal reports of externalizing problems in the regression analyses. SES had a negative association with all problem outcomes and a positive association with impulse control. In general, the effect sizes for Effortful Control and SES were comparable.</p>

<title>Testing Interactions</title>
<p>We tested higher order interactions between the dimensions of temperament. We created all three two-way interactions (Negative Affectivity by Surgency; Negative Affectivity by Effortful Control, and Surgency by Effortful Control), as well as a three-way term. Temperament variables were mean-centered before interactions were calculated. We used a hierarchical regression strategy in which the variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550611407344">Table 2</xref> were entered in Step 1, the three two-way terms were entered in Step 2, and the three-way term was entered in Step 3. For all dependent variables, the three-way term never produced a statistically significant change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and thus will not be discussed (see online Appendix B).</p>
<p>There was only one instance in which the two-way interactions produced a statistically significant change in <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05): Future Planning. A plot of the interaction specifying the levels of the other variables at the sample mean indicated that Effortful Control was positively related to Future Planning at low levels of Negative Affectivity (the anticipated association) but seemingly unrelated to Future Planning at very high levels of Negative Affectivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611407344">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, our efforts to find evidence of consistent temperament by temperament interactions were largely unsuccessful.</p>

<title>Testing Meditational Models Predicting Adolescent Risk and Externalizing Behaviors</title>
<p>We conducted two additional analyses to determine whether Impulse Control and Future Planning partially mediated associations between Effortful Control and the adolescent behavioral outcomes. We did not pursue analyses for youth reports of externalizing behaviors, given that the effect for Effortful Control was not statistically significant. Likewise, Effortful Control was the only independent temperamental predictor of Impulse Control and Future Planning which precludes the possibility that these variables could “explain” the statistical associations evident for Negative Affectivity and Surgency.</p>
<p>In these meditational analyses, self-reports of Risk Taking and maternal reports of Externalizing Problems were regressed on gender, SES, the three temperament variables, Impulse Control, and Future Planning. Those results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611407344">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1948550611407344">3</xref>. We tested the statistical significance of the total indirect effects using bias corrected bootstrapping methods (5000 resamples) as implemented in the macro developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611407344">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>. The 95% CI for the indirect effects involving Effortful Control did not include zero for both dependent variables. It is interesting that there was no evidence for an independent effect of Future Planning for statistically predicting maternal reports of Externalizing Problems. Likewise, the statistical effect for Impulse Control appeared larger than Future Planning effect for predicting Risk Taking. This suggests that Impulse Control is a more potent independent predictor than Future Planning with respect to the adolescent problem behaviors we examined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the findings of previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611407344">Caspi &amp; Silva, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611407344">Henry et al., 1996</xref>), we hypothesized that dimensions of preschool temperament, especially effortful control, would predict adolescent problem behaviors. We tested our hypotheses using data from a large prospective study that included abbreviated measures of child temperament at 54 months. We were able to recover the three-factor model of Rothbart and colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611407344">Rothbart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611407344">Rothbart &amp; Bates, 2006</xref>) and use composites to predict adolescent variables. As expected, Effortful Control was the most consistent correlate of adolescent problem behaviors. Moreover, the effect sizes were comparable to effects associated with SES. In addition, we found that Surgency predicted self-reported and maternal reports of Externalizing Problems, whereas Negative Affectivity predicted adolescent reports of Externalizing Problems.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting findings was a distinction between the correlates of adolescent-and-mother reported externalizing problems. The correlation between these two perspectives was only moderate (i.e., <italic>r</italic> around .30) which is consistent with meta-analytic findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611407344">Achenbach and colleagues (1987)</xref>, who reported an average correlation between the CBCL and YSR scores of <italic>r</italic> = .28. Thus, it seems unlikely that the findings in this report are attributable to unusually low associations between maternal and self-reports. Our findings are therefore perhaps best viewed in light of previous studies indicating that congruence between reporters is impacted by the visibility or salience of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611407344">Karver, 2006</xref>). In the current study, youth’s report of externalizing behaviors were independently predicted by early individual differences that reflect appetitive aspects of temperament (i.e., surgency), whereas maternal reports of these behaviors were also predicted by a “top-down” aspect (i.e., Effortful Control), as well as unique aspects of Negative Affectivity. It may be that the youth’s self-reporting on aggressive and delinquent behavior is influenced by tendencies toward sensation seeking and approach behaviors. On the other hand, mothers may be reporting through a different lens, one that reflects broader influences of temperament.</p>
<p>We should also point out that the obtained differences for Externalizing Problems are not simply explained away by shared method concerns. To be sure, adolescent reports of Risk Taking were also predicted by maternal reports of temperament at 54 months, particularly the measure of Effortful Control.</p>
<p>In addition to providing evidence that childhood temperament is related to adolescent problem behavior, the present results provide a temperamentally informed perspective on adolescent risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611407344">Martel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611407344">Steinberg, 2008</xref>). Most notably, Effortful Control was a predictor of two variables associated with contemporary models of adolescent self-regulation—Future Planning and Impulse Control. This pattern is broadly consistent with the perspective that temperament differences are elaborated into subsequent individual differences in adolescence and adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611407344">Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2006</xref>). Again, these effects are cross-method effects (i.e., mothers reported on temperament, whereas adolescents provided reports of impulse control and future planning) and this further bolsters our confidence in the conclusion that early emerging individual differences impact developmental outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611407344">Caspi &amp; Shiner, 2006</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that adolescent self-regulatory abilities are linked to dimensions of temperament that are evident well before adolescence.</p>
<p>In evaluating these findings, it is necessary to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying dataset. On the one hand, the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development is a large, prospective study from multiple sites across the United States. However, the scope and size of the dataset also presents some inevitable trade-offs in the form of measurement. Mothers completed an abbreviated version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBQ). The original CBQ version contains more items and scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611407344">Rothbart et al., 2001</xref>) than the measure used here. This may have affected the nature of the temperament dimensions. For example, the composite measures of the Big Three temperament dimensions in the present study might be slightly “narrower” than the canonical constructs. Thus, we place more faith in our positive findings rather than in the null results.</p>
<p>This restricted content may have attenuated predictor-criterion associations. This concern might be particularly relevant for negative affectivity, a dimension of temperament which is often associated with externalizing problems in adults (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611407344">Cale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611407344">Krueger et al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that the effects of irritability and hostility were “washed out” by the aggregation into a composite variable (see e.g., the correlations for Anger/Frustration in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550611407344">Table 1</xref>). Thus, there might be benefits to focusing on specific aspects of Negative Affectivity in future studies.</p>
<p>Measurement issues also lead us to urge caution with respect to the null results for analyses involving interactions between dimensions of temperament. Although temperament-by-temperament interactions are often discussed in the developmental literature (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611407344">De Pauw &amp; Mervielde, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611407344">Valiente et al., 2010</xref>), we did not find robust evidence for these theoretically interesting effects in the present work. As we noted, large sample sizes are often required to detect these interactions. Future studies may need to use even larger samples to study this issue in conjunction with assessment that have very low levels of measurement error given how reliability affects the power to detect interactions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611407344">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Last, we acknowledge that some may quibble with the effect sizes we obtained. However, we believe that the time span and cross-method effects (in addition to the challenge inherent in assessing temperament) speak in favor of the idea that early-emerging individual differences are important. Indeed, many of the effect sizes for temperament compared quite favorably to SES. All in all, the present research suggests to us that there is connection between childhood temperament and consequential adolescent outcomes measured over 10 years in the future. These findings therefore underscore the power of even early-emerging personality differences for understanding adolescent problem behaviors.</p>
