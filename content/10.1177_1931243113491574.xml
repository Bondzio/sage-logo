<abstract>
<p>A major topic of analysis in sport has been the gender gap and hegemonic masculinity that have historically been present in the media. Following Cunningham’s rationale of analyzing sports that are as gender equal as possible, this current study examines the coverage of the Australian Open on ESPN’s website. The findings reveal that although ESPN emphasized the men’s game quantitatively, it did not give it more prominence proportionally. On one hand, despite having journalists on-site to cover the women’s tournament and despite not being limited by airtime, ESPN.com frames the men’s game as more important than the women’s game in the amount of coverage dedicated to each gender. On the other hand, there is no gender difference in terms of production value, which is in striking opposition to the previous literature about gender media coverage in sport.</p>

<p>A major topic of analysis in sport has been the gender gap and hegemonic masculinity that have historically been present in the media: Despite the rise of female participation in athletics, research shows that media companies generally frame women’s sports as much less important than men’s sports, reinforcing the notion that sport is a masculine world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1931243113491574">Hardin, Lynn, &amp; Walsdorf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113491574">Kian &amp; Clavio, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Some scholars come to this conclusion by finding a difference between the amount of women’s sports coverage and men’s sports coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243113491574">Boutilier &amp; SanGiovanni, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243113491574">Cramer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1931243113491574">Eastman &amp; Billings, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243113491574">Messner &amp; Cooky, 2010</xref>). Others have pointed out that the difference manifests itself in the placement of articles and stories, and in the production value, for example, presence and size of an accompanying illustration in print (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243113491574">Adams &amp; Tuggle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243113491574">Hilliard, 1984</xref>). Although at different points in history individual sports have been culturally more socially acceptable for women than team sports have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243113491574">Adams &amp; Tuggle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1931243113491574">Lichtenstein, 1998</xref>), studies conducted on tennis coverage in traditional media have found a similar gender gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1931243113491574">Crossman, Vincent, &amp; Speed, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243113491574">Hilliard, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1931243113491574">Vincent, Pedersen, Whisenant, &amp; Massey, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The pressure of market forces limits the range of coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113491574">Cunningham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243113491574">Messner &amp; Cooky, 2010</xref>), which means that the media are limited in the amount of space (print) or time (broadcast) they have to cover events. This limited time or space must be dedicated to issues that have the widest public interest. In the sporting industry, these events generally do not include women’s athletics. But the web represents a new platform to distribute news and cover events. The endless capacities and low costs of the medium theoretically enable media outlets to include content on their websites that they do not include in their traditional forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113491574">Cunningham, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113491574">Cunningham (2003</xref>) analyzed university-sponsored men’s and women’s tennis websites and found no gender difference in the amount of information. He argued that to examine the “true” gender gap in the sports world, research should “designate sport equity and public awareness” and thus look at sports that are comparable in these terms. Indeed, in basketball for instance, gender differences in coverage could be attributed to the financial gap between men’s and women’s basketball. Tennis, he argues, is much more equitable genderwise both financially and in popularity—a position that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113491574">Kian and Clavio (2011</xref>) also defend. When examining tennis coverage, a remaining gender gap, if any, could thus “be attributed to social rather than economic matters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113491574">Cunningham, 2003</xref>, p. 44).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian, Mondello, and Vincent (2009</xref>) looked at the coverage of March Madness online, and stated that even though both ESPN and CBS upheld hegemonic masculinity online, ESPN offered “more and better coverage of the women’s tournament” than CBS did (p. 492). Kian et al. thus dubbed ESPN “the women’s sports network.” However, this study included a significant limitation (acknowledged by the authors): ESPN had the TV rights to the women’s March Madness tournament, while CBS had those to the men’s tournament. ESPN thus had clear economic interests in its extensive coverage of the women’s tournament.</p>
<p>The current study is a follow-up to the research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian et al. (2009</xref>), while following Cunningham’s (2003) rationale of analyzing sports that are as gender equal as possible in aspects other than in the media world. For this preliminary study, the author examined the coverage of the Australian Open on ESPN’s website. Tennis is one of the few professional sports in which there is equality in earnings for men and women at least 4 times a year (during the four Grand Slam tournaments, which include the Australian Open). Furthermore, ESPN holds the rights to both the male and the female tournaments. Also, there is no “airtime” limit (on the internet), and both genders usually receive a similar amount of media coverage during Grand Slam tournaments, partly because these tournaments are “simultaneously-held men’s and women’s events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113491574">Kian &amp; Clavio, 2011</xref>, p. 59). In other words, media outlets do not have to spend extra money to cover the women’s tournament because both men and women play at the same location. The purpose of this study is to determine whether, in such conditions, ESPN gives an equal amount of coverage and exposure to women’s tennis as it does to the men’s game. In short, is ESPN really the “women’s sports network”? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian, Mondello, &amp; Vincent, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Women as the “Other”</title>
<p>For years, women were prevented from participating in physical activity altogether because sport was believed to damage their reproductive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1931243113491574">Cahn, 1994</xref>). Tennis was one of the few socially acceptable sports for women, but the game was not very athletic because women could play only while wearing what was considered feminine clothing—skirts and blouses over corsets and petticoats—making it difficult to move, thus to achieve a good level of play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1931243113491574">Lichtenstein, 1998</xref>). But the 1960s brought great social change through, and one of the outcomes of this time period was the enactment of Title IX in 1972, which has given thousands of female students a chance to play on the athletic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1931243113491574">Blumenthal, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the world of sport is still an “important organizing institution for [the] embodiment of masculinity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1931243113491574">Messner, 2007</xref>, p. 104), and women’s entry represents a “fundamental challenge to male power and privilege” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243113491574">Kane &amp; Greendorfer, 1994</xref>, p. 33). Women are expected to practice sports that require characteristics stereotypical of femininity, such as finesse and grace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1931243113491574">Banet-Weiser, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243113491574">Bryson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1931243113491574">Nelson, 1991</xref>), suggesting that sport reinforces traditional gender ideals and privileges men to the detriment of women.</p>
<p>An oft-cited example is the Super Bowl, the most watched sports program on television. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1931243113491574">Real (1975</xref>) describes it as one of America’s “mythic” activities, “a collective reenactment of symbolic archetypes that express the shared emotions and ideas” of American culture (p. 36). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1931243113491574">Langman (2003</xref>) calls it “a key trope of American identity” (p. 69). What can we take away from this annual event? The focus is a battle between two groups of virile men, while women are left on the sidelines to entertain the crowd during breaks. The Super Bowl represents a patriarchal system of gender roles indicative of American culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1931243113491574">Creedon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243113491574">Kane &amp; Greendorfer, 1994</xref>), and these traditional gender stereotypes in sports have been perpetuated through the years by mass media, which keep framing sport as “a celebration of manhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1931243113491574">Duncan, 2006</xref>, p. 1).</p>

<title>Traditional Media Reinforce Masculine Hegemony in Sports</title>
<p><italic>Framing</italic> is a term used to illustrate the fact that communicators shape the telling of news through a selection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1931243113491574">Entman, 1993</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1931243113491574">Scheufele and Tewksbury (2007</xref>) argued, “Framing, for (journalists), is a necessary tool to reduce the complexity of an issue, given the constraints of their respective media related to news holes and airtime” (p. 12). In other words, communicators rely on commonly accepted schema to produce content in order to make that content accessible and easy to understand for their audience. When it comes to sports, these schema include traditional gender stereotypes that place men as big and powerful—for example, competitiveness, strength—(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1931243113491574">Connell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1931243113491574">Messner, 2007</xref>) and women as feeble and soft—for example, weakness, grace—(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243113491574">Bryson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243113491574">Kane &amp; Greendorfer, 1994</xref>). These stereotypes present men as superior to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1931243113491574">Bryson, 1987</xref>). This inequitable or stereotyped coverage of female athletes and women’s sports, many researchers argue, sends a message to the public that women’s sport is insignificant and trivial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1931243113491574">Coakley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113491574">Cunningham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1931243113491574">Kane &amp; Greendorfer, 1994</xref>), which, in turn, influences women’s decision to participate in sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1931243113491574">Coakley, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has shown that both the amount and the type of athletics media coverage strengthen masculine hegemony in sports. Scholars have consistently found that the amount of women’s sports coverage is “at best sporadic and at worst non existent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1931243113491574">Cramer, 1994</xref>, p. 173). A series of studies conducted since 1989 criticize the lack of women’s sports exposure, and deplore the tone of the coverage women’s sports do get, which is rarely serious and respectful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1931243113491574">Duncan, Messner &amp; Wilson, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243113491574">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1931243113491574">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1931243113491574">Duncan, Messner, Wilson, Williams &amp; Jensen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243113491574">Messner &amp; Cooky, 2010</xref>). Men’s sports have also been found to be more prominent than women’s sports: Both headlines and pictures tend to be about men’s athletics. In the same vein, mixed-gender articles generally discuss men before women and center on men for a longer time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1931243113491574">Bishop, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243113491574">Hilliard, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The production value of women’s sports has also been criticized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1931243113491574">Adams &amp; Tuggle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1931243113491574">Baker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243113491574">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>), and so has the portrayal of female athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1931243113491574">Baroffio-Bota &amp; Banet-Weiser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243113491574">Bernstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1931243113491574">Duncan &amp; Messner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1931243113491574">Duncan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243113491574">Hilliard, 1984</xref>). In a nutshell, previous research supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1931243113491574">Kane and Snyder’s (1989)</xref> argument that media construct female athleticism as a “bastardized, perhaps event counterfeit version of the ‘real’ (men’s) sports” (p. 92). Yet, all of these studies were conducted in traditional media. The little research conducted online has generated more diverse results.</p>

<title>Gender, Sports, and Online Media</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113491574">Kian and Clavio (2011</xref>) suggested that the internet may challenge the hegemonic masculinity in sports coverage. However, the little research that has been published shows that even online, there is a gender gap, albeit smaller than in traditional media. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1931243113491574">Sagas, Cunningham, Wigley, and Ashley (2000</xref>) focused on 52 different universities’ baseball (men) and softball (women) websites and found that baseball websites were “routinely updated in a more timely manner” than were softball sites for scores and statistics (p. 201). On the other hand, Cunningham’s (2003) quantitative content analysis of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men’s and women’s tennis websites revealed that women received as much coverage as men do, and even that women’s tennis press releases were, on average, significantly longer than those for men’s tennis.</p>
<p>Focusing on college basketball, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian et al. (2009</xref>) found an inequity between men and women but their data, collected on the CBS Sports and ESPN websites, revealed that women benefited from 27.7% of basketball coverage overall and 37.6% on the ESPN website. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1931243113491574">Cooper and Cooper (2009)</xref> analyzed 30 NCAA Division I homepages and found that 40% of online coverage was devoted to women’s athletics. A gap clearly remains, but it is a great improvement from the 1.6% devoted to women in televised sports news in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243113491574">Messner &amp; Cooky, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113491574">Kian and Clavio (2011</xref>) looked at framing differences in the coverage of the 2007 U.S. Open between three mainstream newspapers (<italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>, <italic>New York Times</italic>, and <italic>USA Today</italic>) and three internet sites (<italic>ESPN</italic>, <italic>Fox Sports, </italic>and <italic>Sports Illustrated</italic>). They concluded that sport news websites were more likely to challenge masculine hegemony than newspapers were. Though research about online coverage of sports is still in its infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113491574">Kian &amp; Clavio, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1931243113491574">Real, 2006</xref>), what has been published indicates that the gender gap in sports coverage remains online, but it is narrower than in traditional media, in both quantity and quality.</p>
<p>With the growing importance of the internet as a news source, further research about the gender issue in online sports coverage is much needed. The idea that the internet may be the first medium to allow for the challenge of masculine hegemony in sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1931243113491574">Kian &amp; Clavio, 2011</xref>) needs to be pursued. This study takes a first step at doing so by examining how much tennis coverage on the ESPN website is dedicated to the women’s game during the 2012 Australian Open. The coding protocol was designed to establish which gender benefited from the most prominent coverage on ESPN’s tennis webpage. In other words, the researcher sought to determine whether ESPN emphasized the coverage of one gender over the other. As such, the study answers the following questions:

<title>Method</title>
<p>A content analysis of ESPN tennis pages collected during the Australian Open was used for this study. As mentioned previously, ESPN has been dubbed as “the women’s sports network” because of its extensive online coverage of the “March Madness” women’s tournament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the ESPN network holds the television rights to both the men’s and the women’s Australian Open tournaments, which means that, contrarily to March Madness, it has economic motivations to cover both competitions. Examining the tennis main page rather than the homepage means that every other sport is eliminated from the study. This enables the researcher to draw conclusions about how gender affects coverage of a sport, when the “Big Four” (National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, and National Hockey League) are not part of the equation.</p>
<sec id="section6-1931243113491574">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>The population of the study consists of all various appearances of the ESPN tennis page during the length of the 2012 Australian Open. It is difficult to nail down the “population” because internet pages change constantly. Because tennis tournament organizers set up schedule of play on a day-to-day basis in consultation with television networks, and because we cannot know how long a match will last, it is not possible to plan data collection during specific games.</p>
<p>As a result, random sampling was used. The day was divided into three time blocks based on the format of the tournament: the <italic>day session</italic> ran from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., the <italic>night session </italic>ran from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. and the <italic>pregame and postgame phase</italic> was from 2 a.m. to 11 a.m. (the times indicated here are local time in Melbourne, Australia). Both the ESPN tennis page and homepage were saved at three random times a day, once for each time block, for a total of 42 times. These times were generated using the website random.org, which provided times in chronological order. The author then used the random function in Excel to assign each of these times a random number, and then sorted the times. Times were then converted to Eastern Standard Time for data collection. Each saved page contains about 50 stories for a total of about 2,100 stories.</p>

<sec id="section7-1931243113491574">
<title>Coding Procedure</title>
<p>The unit of analysis is the story as it appears on the ESPN tennis page. It is defined as a noncommercial written piece or link present on the tennis page (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1931243113491574">Appendix</xref>)—that is, scrolling is acceptable but clicking is not necessary, unless the coder needs to check some information. Some page elements were not coded because they did not constitute stories (e.g., the banners on top of the page; general links, such as “more videos”; the embedded Twitter list; and the schedule section). Coders were allowed to click on links to check whether they brought them to a story to be included (video, audio, photos, etc.), or a more general webpage that was to be excluded.</p>
<p>All variables were coded based on the story’s title, as well as its potential picture and blurb, defined as a sentence or small paragraph summarizing the story (including when it is the first few words of the story followed by an ellipsis). Gender was coded as <italic>male </italic>when the story was about the men’s tournament, <italic>female</italic> when it was about the women’s tournament and <italic>both</italic> if the story was about the sport of tennis in general or if athletes of both sexes were part of the story. Coders clicked on the story’s link if they needed to check how to classify the story but they did not read full articles. For stories about both genders denoted by two or more elements (title, blurb, and picture), coders also identified the gender of each existing element. Indeed, a story with a title and blurb mentioning both the men’s and the women’s tournaments may be illustrated only by either male or female athletes instead of both.</p>
<p>Prominence of coverage pertains to how much emphasis news media give a particular story. It was measured with a series of variables: whether the story appeared on ESPN’s homepage (which enhances the prominence of the story), whether it was part of the leading block of the five most prominent topics on both the tennis page and the homepage, whether it was the first topic of that leading block (which is the most prominent topic on the page), how many pictures illustrated the story and their size, whether there was a video and/or a blurb, and the placement of the story on both the tennis page (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1931243113491574">Appendix</xref>) and the homepage (divided in three tiers with the first tier being what is visible when the page loads on a 13 in. computer, the second tier being the next sections that cover the same screen size, and the third, the last categories). All of these variables were measured nominally, except for the number of pictures and their size.</p>

<title>Reliability and Data Analysis</title>
<p>After having gone through the coding sheet and a few examples with the main researcher, five random pages were selected using Standard Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The coder was given sampling units (pages) rather than coding units (stories) to verify that both researcher and coder understand the term <italic>story</italic> the same way. They identified the stories to code in two of these pages separately and compared their findings. Once the definition of <italic>story</italic> was agreed upon, the coder coded all stories on the five pages (<italic>N</italic> = 246) to check intercoder reliability on each remaining variable using Krippendorf’s α. The minimum value was calculated at α = .86 for the presence or absence of video. All other variables had a Krippendorf’s α of .92 or above.</p>
<p>Data analysis for this preliminary study was conducted using SPSS 19.0 for Mac. It is mainly descriptive, consisting of percentages, crosstabs, means, as well as some chi-square analyses, <italic>z</italic> tests for proportions, and <italic>t</italic>-tests to detect gender differences.</p>

<sec id="section9-1931243113491574">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>All stories appearing on the sampled tennis pages (<italic>N</italic> = 2,155) were coded, no matter how many times they appeared throughout the duration of this study. Only 16.71% were part of the leading block, about half of which were also part of the main topic. Almost a third of all stories were illustrated by at least one picture and about 15% had an illustrating video. Furthermore, 13.83% of stories had a blurb and about 1 of the 10 stories also appeared on the homepage. When appearing on the homepage (<italic>N</italic> = 209), stories were often part of the leading block (78%) but only 21 stories (10%) were part of the main topic. About a fifth had at least one illustrating picture featured on the homepage, while a quarter included a video and 22.01% had a blurb.
<list list-type="simple">

<p>
<italic>Research Question 1:</italic> How much coverage did ESPN dedicate to the women’s tournament, compared to the men’s, during the 2012 Australian Open?</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Among the 2,155 stories, 1,558 (72%) were about men’s tennis and only 443 (20%) were about women’s tennis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1931243113491574">Figure 1</xref>). The remaining 7% were stories that either included both genders or were about the sport of tennis in general (e.g., <italic>Top 100 memories of 2011</italic>). This gender difference is significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 2,001) = 621.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, many stories stayed on the tennis page for days, or even throughout the duration of the study, and although the results section is made up of two tabs, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tab, which reflects men’s tennis results, is always the active one by default. As a result, the researcher ran the same analysis on the three categories that changed regularly and are made up of ESPN-generated content: <italic>Top Stories</italic>, <italic>Headlines</italic>, and <italic>Photo Wire</italic>. Only 55% of these stories (<italic>N</italic> = 911) were about men’s tennis and 36% were about women’s tennis. Though the gender gap is considerably narrower, this difference is still significant, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 833) = 416.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Looking at each category of placement individually, men’s tennis got more coverage in every one of them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1931243113491574">Figure 2</xref>). It even got 100% of the coverage in four categories: <italic>ATP exterior links</italic>; <italic>King of the Slams</italic>, which consists of stories about Roger Federer, the player who has won the most Grand Slam tournaments; <italic>Columnists</italic>, who didn’t write a lot of new materials during the Australian Open; and <italic>Latest Results</italic>, which displays the men’s tab by default. Using <italic>z </italic>tests for proportions, the gender difference was significant in each category, except <italic>Tennis.com</italic>, which is not ESPN-generated content, and <italic>Vote</italic>, a poll to interact with users.</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, the number of pictures per gender (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1931243113491574">Figure 3</xref>) also shows that ESPN’s tennis page is a male-dominated domain. However, that ESPN frames men’s tennis as more important than women’s tennis quantitatively does not mean that it is given more prominence proportionally.

<p>To answer this question, we looked at the production value of each story, as it appeared on the tennis page. <italic>Z </italic>tests for proportions revealed that more women’s tennis stories were part of the leading block, <italic>z</italic> = −5.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and part of the main topic, <italic>z</italic> = −2.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1931243113491574">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, almost a quarter of women’s tennis stories included a video but less than 15% of men’s stories did, <italic>z</italic> = −4.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In the same vein, female stories were twice as likely to appear on the homepage in addition to the tennis page, <italic>z</italic> = −4.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. There was, however, no gender difference for the average number of pictures per story, and in the proportions of stories that had a blurb and those that had at least one picture.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a two-tailed independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test was conducted to evaluate whether the average size of pictures differed between illustrating visuals of male stories and those of female stories.

<p>Finally, there was no gender difference in the treatment of stories about both genders. Of the 154 stories, more than half did not have a picture. Among those that did, a little less than 23% were of male athletes and 18% were of female athletes, <italic>z</italic> = .65, <italic>p</italic> = <italic>ns</italic>. Most photos (56%) were headshots of bloggers (coded as neither male nor female). Similarly, titles and blurbs of stories coded as “both genders” included either both or neither gender, but did not mention men’s tennis to the detriment of women’s tennis or the contrary.</p>
<p>Accordingly, men’s tennis was not more prominent than women’s tennis proportionally. It was even less prominent than women’s tennis when all stories are included in the analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to expand previous research, notably that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1931243113491574">Cunningham (2003</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian et al. (2009</xref>), by examining the online coverage of the Australian Open on the ESPN website. It is important to recognize limitations of the current study before interpreting its results. First, only one sport was analyzed, so these results cannot be generalized to others. Second, more websites need to be examined as well. Additionally, one may argue that the level of play in each tournament may be a confound to the study (the higher the level of play, the more likely it is to draw an audience regardless of gender). However, both singles Australian Open tournaments were crucial. On one hand, the top four men’s players in the world once again reached the semifinals for epic matches. On the other hand, the women’s final determined who the new Number 1 player in the world was going to be.</p>
<p>Furthermore, future research would benefit from more in-depth analyses of the articles and videos published. As stated earlier, some studies have found that media coverage often relies on traditional gender stereotypes and frames women as weaker than men are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1931243113491574">Duncan et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1931243113491574">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1931243113491574">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243113491574">Messner &amp; Cooky, 2010</xref>). Whether the stories coded and analyzed in this study contain such stereotypical language remains to be seen.</p>
<p>However, this study has shown several things. First, there was significantly more coverage of men’s tennis compared to women’s tennis, which indicates that despite having journalists on-site to cover the women’s tournament (because both tournaments are played at the same location) and despite not being limited by airtime, ESPN.com still frames the men’s game as more important than the women’s game. This confirms the masculine hegemony that has been present in sports media for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1931243113491574">Bernstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1931243113491574">Boutilier &amp; SanGiovanni, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1931243113491574">Eastman &amp; Billings, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243113491574">Messner &amp; Cooky, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, men’s tennis was not found to be more prominent than women’s tennis, which is in striking opposition to the bulk of the literature about gender media coverage in sport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243113491574">Hilliard, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1931243113491574">Messner &amp; Cooky, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1931243113491574">Hilliard (1984</xref>), for instance, had found that titles and pictures of magazines articles that include sports coverage of both sexes usually talked about men first and emphasized their events more than the women’s. The current study, conducted online rather than in print and designed to study the gender difference from a new perspective (i.e., striving for as much gender equality as possible in the real world in order to hone in on social matters), indicates that ESPN does not give any more prominence to the men’s game. This reinforces the idea that the internet may be used to counter gender bias in sports coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, despite the gender equality reached in tennis (in earnings for instance, or location) and although ESPN does not emphasize one tournament over the other in terms of production value, the network did frame the men’s game as more important than the women’s game quantitatively. This allows for two conclusions regarding hegemonic masculinity in sport. First, it was both reinforced and challenged, and thus remains “contested terrain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1931243113491574">Kian et al., 2009</xref>, p. 492). Second, it is not solely due to financial and economic reasons.</p>
<p>Obviously, these financial and economic reasons cannot be overlooked either, but the findings of this study are consistent with Cunningham’s (2003) rationale that it is important to designate “sport equity and public awareness when conducting [gender] examinations” of sports coverage. The amount of coverage of a sport should not necessarily mirror its popularity, but one cannot compare apples to oranges, which is why future research should take into account the public appeal and financial capabilities of each sport as variables or at least refrain from looking at the gender gap between two sports that have completely different levels of popularity (such as professional men’s and women’s basketball).</p>
