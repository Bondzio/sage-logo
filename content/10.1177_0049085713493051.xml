<p><italic>Rights of Adolescent Girls in India: A Critical Look at Laws and Policies</italic> by Saumya Uma is a timely publication about the most neglected segment of our society, namely adolescent girls. Perceived as burden by their parents, neglected by policy-makers, subordinated by a patriarchal system, crushed before they bloom due to omnipresent misogyny; adolescent girls in India have to tread a tight rope.</p>
<p>The author rightly avers that in India experiences of adolescence for girls are greatly different from that for boys. For boys, adolescence is marked by greater autonomy in decision making about their careers, financial independence, enhanced status and expanded participation in family, community and public life. While for girls it is always differential treatment as compared to their male counterparts. Amartya Sen has highlighted seven types of inequalities that women and girls have to face throughout their life cycle—from womb to tomb.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 defines the analytical perspective informed by ‘theory of social exclusion’ of the book that discusses six crucial issues pertaining to adolescent girls’ rights: health, education, right to and rights in work, age of marriage and agency in marriage, violence against girls and juvenile justice.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, while providing situational analysis on the subject, the author highlights major indicators for Status of Girls in India. She focuses on the most mind-boggling problems faced by adolescent girls such as decision-making in the day-to-day life, self- dependence and career. Dictatorial atmosphere in the family, educational institutions and in the community life, make adolescents feel left out of the decision-making processes affecting their lives. Both, in private and in the public spheres, we need to give more space for development to the adolescent girls.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, on Law and Policy Framework, the author shows the apathy of government towards adolescent girls. Even in the Youth Reports churned out by the Ministry of Youth Affairs hardly any serious consideration is given to rights of girls as citizens. Most of the schemes and programmes for girls are guided by a stereotypical understanding of girls’ roles as future wives and home-makers. The author has meticulously described existing provisions for girls in the law and has critically examined the minimum legal age as defined by the national legislations in India.</p>
<p>Adolescent girls’ struggle for formal and vocational education is discussed in Chapter 4 titled ‘Education as a Tool for Empowerment’. The most challenging issue is the dropping out of adolescent girls from school due to their inability to pass in mathematics, science and English. There is an urgent need for bridge courses, remedial education, distance- and IT-enabled courses and vocational training to be made available to girls from marginalised sections. Industrial Training Institutes run by the Government of India have a strong gender-bias and give training to girls only for beautician, secretarial practice, stenography, Computer Operator and Programming Assistant (COPA) and tailoring, while boys get training for hundreds of courses.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 on Girls at Work focuses on both paid and unpaid work of adolescent girls. In the intra-household distribution of labour, girls shoulder the major burden of economic, procreative and family responsibilities. Sexual abuse at the work-place is a hidden burden that a girl worker endures. The child labour policies, however, do not spell out anything specific to girl child workers. There is no implementation of prohibition of girls working in hazardous occupations as per the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986.</p>
<p>Transnational corporations and multinational corporations have long realised that the best way to reduce the wage bill and to enhance profits is to move parts of the production process to the informal/unorganised sector of poorer countries like India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, etc. The cheap labour of Asian adolescent girls and young women is regarded as the most lucrative way to enhance profits. Globalisation is riding on the back of millions of poor girls and women and child workers in the margins of the economy.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 provides the health profile of adolescent girls. The chapter examines factors that contribute to a healthy life. Health challenges concerning a girl child cover mortality, morbidity, nutritional status and reproductive health and linked to these are environmental degradations, violence and occupational hazards, all of which have implications for her health status. It is intricately related to the socio-economic status of the households to which she belongs. Due to the competing demands on their time and energy as well as their socialisation, girls tend to neglect their health. The lesser access to food coupled with neglect invariably leads to a poor nutritional status and a state of ill health for most of the girls. Changing determinants in the survival struggles of girls have created an alarming situation that prevents India to meet the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 on Age of Marriage and Agency in Marriage is historiographically illuminating. Many girls already in poor health, are married between the ages of 14 and 16. They bear children while still young and malnourished themselves. An upswing of female deaths in the age group 15–19 years indicates the high mortality rate of teenage mothers. Nearly 45 per cent of Indian girls are married off before they attain majority. Child marriages and teenage pregnancy with and outside marriage are the major problems faced by girls in the developing world.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 on violence against girls in their private and public lives shows that adolescent girls account for more than their share of abortion related complications and deaths. Unwed pregnant girls when faced with unintended pregnancy, take desperate measure resulting into health risks of unsafe abortions. Domestic violence in parental and matrimonial home, battering, physical tears, death due to bleeding, rape, sexual harassment at home, workplace and public places, eve teasing, kidnapping and abduction, prostitution, sexual assault, molestation, rape, child sexual abuse, nuisance calls cause psychological disturbances among girls and women and throw a major health burden on girls. The trauma of sexual violence sparks off tension and anxiety at a dangerous level.</p>
<p>Engaging with the juvenile justice system, Chapter 9 brings out operation of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 that covers functioning of five types of institutions dealing with adolescents: observation homes, children’s homes, special homes, shelter homes and after care organizations. Bureaucratic lethargy, political vested interests, sexual exploitation of girls, embezzlement of funds earmarked for food, education, vocational training, and lack of transparency have eroded credibility of the Act. NGOs and social work institutions are the only conscience keepers.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 on state responsibility locates the framework of state responsibility under international human rights law. The National Commission for Children has a special mandate for girls. The very first sentence in the chapter aptly projects needs and aspirations of adolescent girls, ‘Adolescent girls are not merely “claimants” or “beneficiaries” of pre-defined rights; they play an important role in defining the contents of rights’.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 on ‘Claiming Ownership of the Future: Some Adolescent Girls’ Visions’ brings out voices of girls through survey research based on a representative sample of 112 adolescent girls from underprivileged communities in Mumbai conducted by Vacha. The main highlights of the study speak volumes about agency of adolescent girls who are convinced about the importance of education for empowerment; perceive child/early marriages as a major impediment to their growth; aspire to be economically independent in their future life; are extremely concerned about personal safety and security; deplore honour crimes and assert the right of girls to choose their life partners; are conscious of societal discrimination and injustice against girls, and wish to see it eradicated; do not give adequate importance to aspects of health, food and nutrition; feel positive about government schemes, but also emphasise the need for increased focus on education and personal safety of girls; reiterate the need for proper implementation of laws; cherish spending time with friends, going out, playing and studying; wish to focus on personality development and improving life skills, such as acquiring self-confidence and skills in independent decision-making; and believe that self-assertion of rights is a key to their empowerment.</p>

<title>Let the Girls Bloom</title>
<p>Adolescent girls are surpassing earlier milestones in the area of education, vocation, sports and cultural activities by displaying tremendous grit and hard work. They are setting new benchmarks in their success stories in spite of socioeconomic and cultural hurdles. Now the state and civil society need to remove the institutional and cultural constraints so that the adolescent girls can realise their dreams. Providing good and healthy role models for adolescent girls is very important.</p>
<p>This book is a valuable contribution in terms of its analytical rigour, right based perspective and crucial strategic thinking for empowerment of adolescent girls. This book is a must-read for educationists, thinking youth, policy-makers and practitioners dealing with problems and challenges of girls and youth in general.</p>
