<p>In their article “Scheduling science on television”, based on the project “European TV science programming”, Markus Lehmkuhl and his colleagues supply us with valuable data about the conditions and the status quo of specialised science programming in European television. Their approach leads away from a science-centred perspective which “repeat[s] over and over problems science faces with journalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662512454952">Lehmkuhl et al., 2012</xref>: 3); instead it focuses on a media-centred perspective which explains the status quo of science programmes as output of organisational decisions. “From this perspective, a television science programme for example can be neither a reflection nor a distortion of what is going on ‘out there’ but is, rather, a reflection of the practices of workers guided by established editorial concepts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512454952">Lehmkuhl et al., 2012</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>The present study offers very useful and thought-provoking findings. They help us to understand why certain science programmes, though they may be normatively preferable, have no chance of survival on the market. Thus, the media environment and the motives and expectations of the audiences appear to be significantly independent variables and anyone interested in the communication of science and public understanding of science has to adapt to these general conditions. So far, so good – from a pragmatic point of view.</p>
<p>But from a theoretical point of view I could also invert the causality. That means I could also consider the media environment regarding science (for example the scheduling of science programmes) as a <italic>dependent</italic> variable and I could even consider the expectations of the audiences as a <italic>dependent</italic> variable. From such a perspective, of course these factors still serve as constraints for science programming. But the question – based on the research of Markus Lehmkuhl and colleagues – is now how the current status quo of science programmes and audience expectations could be explained by other factors. Given the same media environment, the topic “science”, including the social sciences and humanities, without doubt is treated very differently compared to politics or economics. That means: It cannot be the media environment alone. Regulations, scheduling, commercial vs. public television, market segmentation are important categories to describe the success and the dispersion of science programmes, but they cannot entirely explain <italic>why</italic> science in television has developed as described today, and <italic>why</italic> certain formats as for example edutainment are quite successful and others, such as information programmes, far less so. Why, for example, don’t we have a regular news magazine called “Science and Society” which covers the manifold interdependencies of science and other societal areas in Germany today, for example? We <italic>do</italic> have such magazines for political and for economics topics and “even” for culture “of course”, but why not for science? This observation seems strange considering that modern society is characterised as thoroughly academicised and standardised due to scientific rationality.</p>
<p>For me, the crucial concept which allows us to shed some light on the status quo of science in television which <italic>adds</italic> to the factor “media environment” is the concept “public”. I would like to address three issues:</p>
<list id="list1-0963662512454952" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the concept of the public as expressed by science programmes themselves</p></list-item>

<title>The concept of the public as expressed by science programmes themselves</title>
<p>Not so long ago I was teaching a class about science on German television. The students’ task was to present a certain format and to analyse especially the role and the concept of the public in these programmes. The result was obvious and at least for me, quite shattering: The typical spectator of a science programme is conceived of as the typical visitor to Disneyland; he is intellectually unambitious, wants to be surprised and flabbergasted and accepts his role as pupil and the hierarchical superiority of the scientist. Science, on the other hand, is presented as a neutral producer of complex and superior knowledge, generated by unbiased persons who are enthusiastic about their work and profession and delighted by their wanderings through the realm of scientific truth.</p>
<p>I do not want to say that this cannot be true – at least sometimes. But it is obviously a distortion if not a caricature of how science and scientists work today and what their motivations are. It may be a necessary motivating self-perception for scientists. But this also allocates a certain social position for the so-called lay public.</p>
<p>My first thesis is that this <italic>social positioning of the public</italic> can help to explain the characteristics of science programming on television. In the end, this specific <italic>idea of the public</italic> leads to a certain media environment for science programmes and will be conserved by these media structures. If you want to break up these structures, you have to break up this conception of the public.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0963662512454952">
<title>The relation between the public and the scientific system</title>
<p>One reason for the social positioning of the public described before lies in science itself. Science is maybe the only important social area without its own public. In the nineteenth century we still had the amateur taking part in scientific discourses. With the professionalisation of science, these amateurs were excluded from the discipline. Since then, the primary public of scientists consists of scientists. As long as its function remains to produce cognitively proven knowledge, science is not dependent on the participation of a broader non-scientific public. This is totally different in the political and economic systems, where every decision can generate very direct and immediate feedback. In these social areas, the broad public is a participating public, which has to be respected by the decision makers.</p>
<p>I would like to point to the fact that non-participation – or to put it differently: the <bold>exclusion</bold> – of the public removes the most crucial criteria for attention to and interest in science, which are practical experience and an experienced relevance to everyday life. The blank position of a <italic>participating public</italic> was filled with a concept which is close to home for scientists and also comfortable: the concept of a <italic>public which has to be educated</italic>.</p>
<p>Again, the change of existing structures in science programmes must start with the change of the underlying condition, namely the non-participation of the public. In my view, participation would mean already engaging in the all-embracing consequences of science for social life. The majority of science programmes are definitely not designed to address this challenge. What is missing are programmes that put science in the societal context and discuss the positive and negative outcomes of science as performed by social actors who are guided by interests – acceptable and non-acceptable interests. That is what news media do (or should do) with politics and economics. Such a science coverage would probably show that science is highly relevant for people and that they should take notice of it. Of course it would be far away from programmes such as the German programme “World of Wonders”, which has an audience of 4.6 million.</p>
<p>My second thesis is that science is a social system not being grounded on the participation of a broader public. Consequently, science was free to generate its own idea of the public as an object of education and enlightenment. As we have seen, the vast majority of the media has adopted this idea of the public. In my first thesis I have argued that one has to break up the social positioning of the public in the science programmes in order to attract more people. Now it becomes clear that this is strongly correlated to a rearrangement of the relationship between science and the public.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0963662512454952">
<title>The expectations of “the” public as expressed in interviews</title>
<p>My last point refers to the motives and expectations which are expressed by the members of the focus groups described in the project report (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512454952">Lehmkuhl et al., 2010</xref>). In a nutshell, “[t]he dominant motivation for engagement […] is that science provides new insights into what is completely unknown.” That motivation is, as the authors write, “strongly connected with affective motives, e.g. feeling fascinated, inspired, surprised” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512454952">Lehmkuhl et al., 2010</xref>: 69). It is notable that the respondents do not expect information from television. “Instead, respondents expect popularisation and edutainment programmes from TV” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512454952">Lehmkuhl et al., 2010</xref>: 69).</p>
<p>The fact that respondents do not expect information “explains”, according to the authors, “why TV lacks information programmes on science and why many respondents did not recognise a news report on a scientific finding as something that is broadcast by science programmes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512454952">Lehmkuhl et al., 2010</xref>: 69). Apart from the restriction of information to “scientific findings”, this seems to be a chicken-or-egg question: Do the expectations of the public explain the status quo of the science programmes or do the science programmes explain the expectations of the public? I prefer the egg, which means: The expectations of the public are influenced by the science programmes that are offered to them. The uttered motives and expectations of the recipients correspond to their social positioning in the programmes and they also correspond to the concept of a public which is favoured by science. In communication science this would be called a cultivation effect.</p>
<p>My third thesis is that the recipients have been socialised to behave like a public that has to be educated by science. Probably they have been socialised not only by science on television but these programmes at least amplify this attitude.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662512454952">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude I would like to summarise my considerations about the concept of the “public” of television science programmes and in science. I started out with the idea that the media environment and audience expectations should be considered as dependent variables. Then I discussed the concept of the public as a crucial factor to explain the status quo of science programmes. You could say that it is a normative discussion about which type of public one would prefer. If we follow the idea of a democratic society, the concept of a participating public seems more appealing. Seen from the perspective of science, an inspired and enthusiastic public is something very nice and highly preferable. But it is another question if social systems should rely on enthusiasm and fascination which can easily turn into apathy and hostility. A participating and critical public which has an appropriate overview of the interdependencies of science and society will generate more adequate and reasonable expectations towards science and scientists. This is not the worst foundation for a robust trust relationship.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the majority of the existing science programmes will continue to contribute to a partly distorted image of science. In the end, these programmes could even alienate people from science. Therefore, I would like to add another recommendation to those already raised in the project report of the AVSA research group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662512454952">Lehmkuhl et al., 2010</xref>: 110–112): It’s necessary to rethink the concept of the public, on the part of the media, on the part of the science system and on the part of the public itself. And, last but not least, on the part of the research about science communication. I believe that Markus Lehmkuhl and colleagues have made a very promising move.</p>
