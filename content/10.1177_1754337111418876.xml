<abstract>
<p>The selection and performance of different arrows in a wind can be a significant differentiator between competitors in outdoor archery competitions. Lateral displacement due to wind (wind drift) has two components: the first due to the arrow aligning itself with the resultant airflow, and the second due to the lateral component of the arrow’s aerodynamic drag. In this paper those components are calculated and compared with the measured wind drift in a large wind tunnel and with the standard deviation of the group size of different arrows shot outdoors in a wind. The wind drift of arrows can be compared by considering their diameter and mass. This is used to select the optimum arrow for outdoor target archery, together with optimization of the various arrow components to minimize the wind drift of a particular arrow.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Archery competitions are usually conducted out of doors and are hence subject to the prevailing weather conditions. Unless it becomes dangerous to do so, competition continues through wind and rain. Competitions are generally only stopped for lightning, very severe wind such as when the infrastructure might be disturbed or arrows blown off their supports on the bow, flooding, or high temperatures where health might be endangered. Consequently, dealing with the weather, and particularly with wind, is a very important skill for an archer.</p>
<p>Wind gusts are very challenging for an archer. A sudden change in wind strength while the archer is aiming and executing a shot can result in substantial archer movement and a major deterioration in accuracy. In those circumstances the archer generally tries to shoot between gusts and to shoot each arrow relatively quickly. However, with a restricted time allowed for each set of shots (each ‘end’) there are times when the archer has no choice but to shoot regardless of the gusts.</p>
<p>Wind drift (lateral movement of the arrow in a relatively steady wind) is also quite challenging, and especially so at longer distances. Even in a light wind an arrow may be pushed away from the centre of the target by a substantial amount. At a distance of 70 m it would not be unusual for an arrow shot using a compound bow to drift by more than 100 mm to the side, and the inner scoring ring on the target (the ‘10 ring’) has a radius of just 61 mm with each subsequent ring increasing in radius by that same amount. The drift for an arrow shot using a recurve bow can be expected to be significantly greater in view of the lower arrow energy. In addition, the wind drift frequently varies along the length of the archery ground and the wind strength felt by an archer on the shooting line might be quite different to that experienced by the arrow on its way to the target.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the International Archery Federation (FITA) World Records for a male archer using a compound bow at 70 m are a score of 358 from a possible score of 360 for 36 arrows and 713 from a possible score of 720 for 72 arrows, with a possible score of ten points for each arrow. For a male archer using a recurve bow the corresponding records are 349 and 691. In less than perfect, but not severe, conditions a male archer using a compound bow would generally need to score around 350 or 700 in order to be in the top group of competitors at a major world-level competition, while for a male archer using a recurve bow the corresponding scores would be around 335 and 670. That is, the archer has few points to spare, even when there is significant wind drift and an inability to deal with that wind drift successfully will inevitably mean that the archer is not amongst the top group of competitors.</p>
<p>In addition to trying to pick the optimum time to shoot, an archer usually attempts to deal with wind drift by using knowledge from previous shots and an assessment of the likely wind strength during the current shot. The archer then either aims off the centre of the target or tips the top bow limb a little into the wind (‘cants’ the bow) to allow for the expected drift. The amount the archer allows for drift is subjective, subject to error, and does not readily cater for wind strength changes during the time taken in making the shot.</p>
<p>Consequently, any reduction in the magnitude of the drift for a given wind strength, and hence the allowances that need to be made, through appropriate technology selection can be expected to reduce the inevitable errors and is a very real advantage indeed (so long as it does not compromise other aspects of shooting an arrow accurately).</p>
<p>While wind drift is of significant importance to an archer, it is little covered in the literature. Ascham [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337111418876">1</xref>], writing in 1545, noted the importance of equipment selection when shooting in wind ‘Weak bows and light shafts cannot stand in a rough wind’, ‘… in winter and rough weather, …, so likewise weak archers using small and hollow shafts, with bows of little pith must be content to give place for a time’, and ‘The greatest enemy of shooting is the wind’. Hardy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111418876">2</xref>] noted that at the battle of Towton Heath in 1461 the Lancastrians were shooting into a strong head wind and snow storm, all their arrows fell short and were promptly shot back again by the Yorkists using the tail wind to advantage and with excellent results (at least for them).</p>
<p>Aside from those very early references to shooting in a wind there would appear to be no papers covering the topic despite its importance. Modern texts covering archery technique do occasionally mention shooting in a wind but appear not to cover optimal equipment selection at all. Manufacturers’ arrow selection guides do note the advantages of small diameter arrows. Easton Technical Products’ arrow selection guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111418876">3</xref>] notes the advantage of tapered and barrelled arrow shafts (but does not quantify it).</p>
<p>External ballistics (the behaviour after the projectile has left a bow or gun), including wind drift, has been extensively studied and covered in the literature for artillery and small arms. However, the velocities are invariably substantially greater than those of arrows, the distances are usually much greater, and the projectiles are of quite a different nature.</p>
<p>This paper provides a means of calculating the likely wind drift for a given arrow and launch conditions from the bow and of verifying the comparative wind drift of different arrows.</p>
<p>The component parts and typical sizes of an arrow are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337111418876">Fig. 1</xref>. The nock is used to attach the arrow to the bow’s string and is usually made from polycarbonate plastic. The fletching is usually made from thin flexible plastic. The point is usually made from either stainless steel or tungsten and is usually of the same diameter as the arrow shaft or slightly larger and then tapered to the shaft diameter where they join. Most arrow shafts for outdoor competition are constructed from carbon fibre composite material.</p>

<title>2 Arrow Behaviour in a Wind</title>
<p>The lateral displacement of the arrow in a wind has two component parts. One of those is due to the arrow aligning itself with the vector sum of its forward velocity and any wind, as shown in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111418876">4</xref>]. The drag force on the arrow is aligned with that resultant velocity and consequently adds a second lateral component to the arrow’s displacement. The second of these component parts is usually the larger.</p>
<sec id="section3-1754337111418876">
<title>2.1 Lateral displacement due to the arrow’s launch conditions</title>
<p>As it leaves the bow an arrow is likely to have a non-zero angle of attack and longitudinal angular velocity to the vector sum of its forward velocity and any wind. As shown in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111418876">4</xref>], lift and drag forces on the arrow (and especially lift from the fletching) act to align its longitudinal axis with that resultant air flow. The angle of attack of the arrow to the airflow as it travels down range can be expected to be a damped sinusoid with the phase and amplitude depending on the initial angle of attack and rotational velocity. The period and damping depend strongly on the fletching area, and for a typical arrow shot from a compound bow the period is likely to be of the order of 20 m and is readily visible to an experienced observer standing behind the archer and looking along the line of flight (although it does happen quite quickly). In the horizontal plane the yaw is referred to by archers as ‘fishtailing’, and in the vertical plane the pitch is known as ‘porpoising’.</p>
<p>As the arrow rotates longitudinally to align itself with the resultant airflow it gains a lateral velocity and displacement, <italic>S</italic><sub>launch</sub> as shown in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111418876">4</xref>]. The lateral velocity and displacement are determined by the combination of the initial angle of attack and angular velocity. The lateral displacement increases approximately linearly with distance. Adding a wind component changes the effective initial angle of attack and hence the resulting displacement down-range. This component of wind drift can be evaluated using the model in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111418876">4</xref>] with the initial angle of attack set in relation to the resultant wind direction.</p>
<p>Using that model with varying wind strength shows that while the fletch area changes the period and time constant of the longitudinal oscillation, it has little impact on this component of the lateral displacement of the arrow as the wind velocity is changed. The average displacement varies approximately linearly with wind velocity and is approximately inversely proportional to the arrow’s mass. While the lateral displacement increases approximately linearly with the initial angular velocity, the angular velocity has little impact on the additional displacement in a wind.</p>
<p>The displacement increases linearly with the initial angle of attack. While there is asymmetry in the displacement as the wind changes direction by 180° that asymmetry is small. For a given arrow, the lateral displacement decreases as the initial arrow energy increases, although the dependency is weak.</p>
<p>At typical competition distances of 70 m, this component of lateral arrow displacement can be expected to be of the order of 15 per cent of the displacement due to the lateral component of the arrow’s drag. Consequently, small errors in the initial angle of attack used in calculating the displacement in a wind have only a minor influence on the calculated total lateral displacement. At very short distances, such as 10 m, however, the two components can be expected to be of similar magnitude since the rotation component increases approximately linearly with distance, as shown in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111418876">4</xref>], while the drag component increases approximately quadratically with distance, and those small errors may need to be considered; the total displacement is nevertheless very small at those short distances and would usually be less than typical archer aiming errors.</p>

<sec id="section4-1754337111418876">
<title>2.2 Lateral displacement due to the arrow’s drag</title>
<p>In addition to a lateral displacement due to the arrow’s launch conditions, the arrow moves laterally due to drag from the resultant air velocity. Assuming the arrow is aligned, on average, with the vector sum of its forward motion and the wind, the drag force will be aligned, on average, with that resultant. The drag can then be split into two components, one in the direction of the target and the other perpendicular to it. Note that, from Hoerner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337111418876">5</xref>], the drag for small angles of attack can be expected to be approximately that for a zero angle of attack. The lateral acceleration and displacement, <italic>S</italic><sub>drag</sub>, due to the drag can then be calculated using the method proposed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111418876">6</xref>]. Since the arrow velocity and hence the drag changes as the arrow moves down-range and to allow for the different path lengths taken by the arrow for different target distances it is necessary to calculate the resulting wind drift by iteration in both the vertical and horizontal planes.</p>
<p>Consider wind at an angle of <italic>ψ</italic> to a direct line from the archer to the target as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337111418876">Fig. 2</xref>. If the arrow velocity is <italic>V</italic><sub>arrow</sub> and the wind velocity is <italic>V</italic><sub>wind</sub>, the air velocity seen by the arrow, <bold><italic>V</italic></bold><sub>total</sub>, is</p>

<title>3 Calculated Wind Drift for a Typical Arrow</title>
<p>The wind drift was calculated for an Easton Technical Products ‘Protour’ arrow, size 470, with three ‘X vanes’, an Easton Technical Products ‘G pin nock’ (used to fasten the arrow to the string) and a full mass stainless steel point, shot from an Archery Research ‘AR34’ single cam compound bow, as modelled in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111418876">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111418876">6</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111418876">7</xref>]. That arrow type and configuration is typical of those used by competitors using compound bows at major international competitions at the time of writing. The arrow parameters used in the calculations are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1754337111418876">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Measurement of average wind speed at major tournaments and the related subjective comments from top archers (and including the author), together with the scores they obtained, suggests that at 3 m/s the archers are definitely seeing a score degradation, and especially so when the wind is gusty. This was tested, subjectively, at the Australian National Championships in 2008, at the Australian Open Championships in 2008, 2009, and 2010, at several FITA World Cup events in 2009 and 2010 and at the FITA World Championships in 2009.</p>
<p>For example, at the Australian National Championships in 2008 there was very little wind at the first distance of 90 m and the scores obtained by the top male archers using compound bows were just short of the then world record. Later in the day wind gusts exceeded 3 m/s and the scores obtained by those same archers were significantly lower than would have been expected given the scores at the first distance.</p>
<p>The calculated drift for wind velocities, <italic>V</italic><sub>wind</sub>, of 1 and 3 m/s at an angle, <italic>ψ</italic>, of 90° is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337111418876">Fig. 3</xref>. The drift varies approximately as the distance squared and is linear with wind velocity. At the maximum competition distance of 90 m the wind drift is 62 per cent greater than the drift in a similar wind at 70 m, pointing to the substantial increase in difficulty as the distance increases. At a distance of 70 m <italic>S</italic><sub>launch</sub> contributes 16 per cent of the total wind drift and <italic>S</italic><sub>drag</sub> 84 per cent.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the absolute drift distances shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337111418876">Fig. 3</xref>, it can be readily appreciated that in gusty conditions of up to 3 m/s a variation in drift distance from arrow to arrow of 0.2 m at a target distance of 90 m could well be expected for an archer using a compound bow. On the usual target face used at that distance that variation in drift distance could readily exceed two scoring rings and it would be unusual for even a top level archer to not suffer a significant score degradation. At a wind speed of &lt;1 m/s the wind drift could probably be safely ignored except at the longest distances.</p>
<p>If the wind direction is instead changed to a direct head or tail wind, but with the same velocity of 3 m/s, the height at which the arrow hits the target changes by ±0.024 m at a target distance of 70 m. That is, the lateral movement is substantially more serious – a side wind is more challenging for the archer than a head or tail wind.</p>

<title>4 Measuring Wind Drift</title>
<p>Ideally, it would be useful to measure wind drift over a long distance, such as 70 m, at a known uniform wind strength. However, that seems not to be practical outdoors, and most wind tunnels have only a limited wind width.</p>
<p>The wind drifts of five different arrows were measured over a distance of 10.3 m, shooting across the large wind tunnel at Monash University using a shooting machine, with two wind velocities: 4.41 and 8.49 m/s, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337111418876">Fig. 4</xref>. The airflow was from right to left and it was measured at the height of travel of the arrow (1 m). The shooting machine was located outside the wind tunnel. The Archery Research AR34 single cam compound bow was used, but with its draw force adjusted to its minimum value in order to minimize the arrow velocity and hence maximize the lateral movement in the wind.</p>

</fig>
<p>Prior to the tests in the wind the repeatability of the equipment was tested by shooting 12 arrows in succession at a distance of 12 m, using the one-sight setting and aiming point (defined by thin horizontal and vertical lines to enable precise aiming). The bow was re-aimed for every shot as the shooting machine moved due to the bow’s recoil (and hence better simulates a person than a very rigid machine). Each of the 12 arrows hit the same hole in the target, with a maximum error of 1 mm. Note that considerable effort was devoted to learning how to use and adjust the shooting machine to achieve this level of accuracy – it would not be expected from casual use.</p>
<p>The arrows were all manufactured by Easton Technical Products, are frequently used with compound bows, and were selected to provide a wide range of expected lateral deflections. They were:</p>

<p>Further details of the arrow construction, comprehensive data, and images are available from the Easton Technical Products target archery arrow catalogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111418876">3</xref>]. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1754337111418876">Table 2</xref> provides the arrow parameters and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1754337111418876">Table 3</xref> shows the calculated and measured wind drift. The arrow hit the target at an angle to its line of travel due to the wind. As the wind velocity increased then the tear in the target face became elongated rather than round and this limits the accuracy of the measurements at the higher wind velocities. At the lower wind velocity the lateral deflection was measured to an accuracy of approximately ±1 mm. At the higher wind velocity the holes were elongated and hence the accuracy was estimated to be ±3 mm.</p>

<p>At the lower wind velocity there was a good match between calculated and measured wind drifts. At the higher wind velocity the match was less close but within the estimated bounds. In each case the magnitude of the drift increased in order of the arrow types as predicted. However, note that in view of the wind drift, and the errors, increasing approximately as the square of the distance to the target this good match at 10.3 m needs to be taken in perspective when considering longer distances.</p>
<p>Testing outdoors has a number of significant limitations including variable wind strength and direction from shot to shot and with distance down the shooting range, difficulty in defining the zero-wind arrow position on the target (which differs for different arrows), differences in the grouping ability of different arrows with zero wind, and the challenges of obtaining a day with wind of a suitable strength and consistency from the desired direction. Consequently, measuring the absolute wind drift at long distances does not seem viable. Nevertheless, taking advantage of the variable wind strength and direction, the lateral standard deviation of the arrow position in the target can be used as an indication of the arrow’s relative performance in wind to that of others.</p>
<p>Protour and LightSpeed arrows were shot alternately at 70 m using a shooting machine with an identical sight setting and aiming point, using a Hoyt Maxxis 35 compound bow. Each arrow type was shot 36 times. The wind gusted up to &gt;10 m/s from an average angle of 135°, where 0° is a head wind The initial arrow velocity for the Protour arrows was 87.3 m/s and for the LightSpeed arrows it was 89.8 m/s. The measured lateral position of the arrows on the target is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337111418876">Fig. 5</xref>. The measured standard deviation for the Protour arrows was 44.6 mm and for the LightSpeed arrows it was 58.6 mm, with the ratio of the standard deviations being 1.41. The predicted ratio of the wind drift displacements for the two arrows, using the discussed method was 1.45. The average group sizes were equivalent to a score at 70 m for the Protour arrows of 697 and for the LightSpeed arrows of 672 for 36 shots, which is a major difference. That difference in score equates to approximately 40 ranking places given the scores obtained in the FITA World Cup events held during 2010, and in which most of the world’s top archers competed, and strongly points to the advantage to be obtained from appropriate arrow selection.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754337111418876-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Prior to testing in the wind, the grouping ability of each of the arrow types was tested at a distance of 35 m without a wind, and for each the measured standard deviation was &lt;10 mm. At 70 m the standard deviation of the aiming error with the shooting machine was estimated to be &lt;10 mm. The results of the test at 35 m for the Protour arrows is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111418876">Fig. 6</xref>. The small inner ring on that target face, within which the group was contained, has a diameter of 20 mm. Each arrow of the set of 12 arrows was shot three times. Testing at 70 m in the absence of a wind has shown that with the shooting machine it has been easily possible to obtain a perfect score on the normal target face used at that distance.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754337111418876-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Given the above limitations of testing wind drift outdoors, it was nevertheless obvious that the wind drift for the LightSpeed arrows was significantly greater than that for the Protour arrows, as expected, and the ratio of the standard deviations of the arrow groups was approximately as expected from calculation. This was also obvious during the down-range arrow velocity measurements undertaken in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111418876">6</xref>] where at the longer distances were markedly more challenging to avoid having the ‘high-drift’ arrows hit the measuring apparatus from time to time than was the case with the ‘low-drift’ arrows.</p>
<p>Since wind drift depends strongly on the arrow’s aerodynamic drag, measuring the drag can be used as an indirect test of the wind drift calculations. In reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111418876">6</xref>] the arrow’s drag was modelled and used to predict the arrow’s down-range velocity, which was subsequently measured for those two arrows. The measured down-range velocities were a good match with the calculated values.</p>

<title>5 Minimizing Wind Drift</title>
<p>The main difference between different arrow types is their diameter and mass. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111418876">Figure 7</xref> shows a number of arrows manufactured by Easton Technical Products that might be used for target or field archery. In each case the size of the arrow has been selected as the closest to a ‘spine’ (or stiffness) of 400 as defined by Easton Technical Products in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111418876">3</xref>]. By that definition (which uses Imperial units) the spine is defined as the deflection in thousandths of an inch resulting from a mass of 1.94 pounds placed centrally on the arrow supported at two points 28 inches apart.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754337111418876-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In each case the arrow length was 0.715 m, the heaviest recommended point was used, together with identical fletching and nocks. The Protour, X10, and ACE arrows do not have a constant diameter along the arrow shaft, and their average diameters have been used, assuming blank shafts were only cut from the front in order to obtain the desired arrow length.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111418876">Figure 7</xref> includes calculated contours of equal drift at a distance of 70 m, assuming arrow shafts of constant diameter, as shot from the Archery Research AR34 single cam compound bow used in references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111418876">4</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111418876">6</xref>], and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111418876">7</xref>]. The wind velocity was 3 m/s at 90° to the line from the bow to the target. The left-most contour is a drift of 175 mm, and for each successive contour the drift increases by 25 mm. The arrow velocity of the Protour 420 with this bow was 78.2 m/s.</p>
<p>If a higher energy compound bow is used the wind drift will be reduced. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337111418876">Fig. 8</xref> for the Hoyt Maxxis 35 hybrid cam compound bow. The equal drift contours are of similar shape but shifted to the right, with the left-most contour now being a drift of 150 mm. The arrow velocity of the Protour 420 with this bow was 86.5 m/s.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1754337111418876-fig8.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Assuming that each arrow type groups comparably in the absence of wind, it is obvious that, from those arrows, the archer should select either the X10 or the Protour for target archery when it is likely to be windy. Selecting the other arrows for target archery would be a significant disadvantage. There is also an obvious advantage in using the higher energy bow, so long as the archer is able to use it with equal proficiency (which should be the case).</p>
<p>As previously noted, those charts assume arrow shafts of constant diameter. However, the Protour is tapered to the front and the X10 to both ends (barrelled) and the average diameters have been used. Hence, the charts for those arrow types are only indicative. Allowing for the varying diameters along the shaft in the drag calculation rather than simply using the average shows that the wind drift of the X10 when used with the Maxxis 35 compound bow with a side wind of 3 m/s is 151 mm and for the Protour it is 154 mm, giving a small advantage to the X10, primarily due to the reduced area of the rear of the arrow shaft as a result of the barrelling.</p>
<p>Given a particular arrow type and size, it is also important to minimize drag, and hence drift, by appropriate arrow component selection. Park [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111418876">6</xref>] shows that for the Protour 470 arrow the fletching contributes approximately 13 per cent of the arrow’s drag, with that split approximately equally between the viscous drag from the fletch surface and the pressure drag from the projected frontal area of the fletching. Consequently, it is useful to select a thin fletch and, for a given fletch area, fletching with a low profile.</p>
<p>Park [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111418876">6</xref>] also shows that the nock contributes approximately 11 per cent to the drag for that arrow. However, that could rise, in some instances, to around 16 per cent where a large diameter over-nock is used, suggesting that they are best avoided in order to minimize wind drift (although they may offer enhanced protection to the rear of the arrow shaft from other arrows).</p>
<p>If there is flow separation where the arrow point joins the shaft and the flow is then turbulent for the full length of the shaft rather than laminar for the first portion, the drag increases by approximately 5 per cent. Consequently, the point profile should be selected to avoid steep slopes from its maximum diameter to the shaft diameter. The maximum point mass recommended for the arrow type and size should be selected.</p>
<p>The arrow shaft length should be no longer than is consistent with safe use. That is, there should not be excessive arrow shaft overhanging the bow’s launcher. It is, however, not uncommon to see an archer using an excess arrow length of 50 mm or more, which, for a typical arrow length of 700 mm would lead to an approximately 7 per cent increase in the wind drift distance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1754337111418876" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>6 Conclusions</title>
<p>The calculated wind drift for a number of quite different arrows was satisfactorily in accord with that measured, both in the wind tunnel and in comparative testing outdoors.</p>
<p>While it is challenging to obtain a good day for testing outdoors, the relative standard deviation of an arrow’s group size in a gusty wind was a useful means of comparing the performance in wind of different arrows, although a shooting machine was essential.</p>
<p>As expected, small diameter high mass arrows perform best in a wind, and can provide a substantial, and compelling, competitive advantage over other arrows. Care needs to be taken to optimize the selection of arrow components (nock and fletching in particular, but also the point shape) if the optimum performance is to be obtained. An inappropriate arrow component selection could readily degrade wind drift by &gt;10 per cent, which in a typical wind of 3 m/s could easily translate into a difference of more than three arrow diameters at the usual competition distance of 70 m.</p>
<p>Higher energy bows provide a competitive advantage in a wind, so long as they can be used with equal proficiency as lower energy bows.</p>
<p>At a wind speed of &lt;1 m/s wind drift can probably be ignored except at the longest distances, so long as the arrow type and configuration has been chosen wisely. At 3 m/s it should not be ignored, even at moderate competition distances.</p>
