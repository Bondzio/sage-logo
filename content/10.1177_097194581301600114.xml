<p>It is always difficult to do justice to an edited volume in a brief review. If one is <italic>writing</italic> about three books, two of which are collections of rigorously researched pieces by some of the most renowned historians of early modern India, the task at hand becomes doubly challenging. Yet, there are many reasons why clubbing the three together still makes sense especially in the context of the stasis that marked modern historiography of ‘Mughal period’ of Indian history for four decades up till about the 1990s. Beyond the obvious fact that each of the volumes is concerned with the period roughly between late fifteenth and early nineteenth centuries, they also share: (<italic>a</italic>) a welcome move away from the exclusive Perso-centric historiography; (<italic>b</italic>) a focus on the literary sources as testimonies to cultures of politics, power, religion as well as aesthetics, communication and performative arts in an interconnected manner; (<italic>c</italic>) an engagement with the literary forms and hermeneutics of ‘sources’ and not an exclusive preoccupation with mindlessly mining information therefrom; and most importantly (<italic>d</italic>) the premise, first articulated by Sheldon Pollock more than a decade ago, that we cannot know how colonialism epistemologically transformed South Asia if we do not know what existed ‘just before British colonial power changed the rules of the knowledge game’ (Pollock’s Introduction to <italic>FKEMA</italic>, p. 4). In fact, Pollock’s shadow looms large, quite understandably, in the contributions to both the edited volumes as well as in Busch’s monograph. Let me start then, with the volume edited by him.</p>
<p>The compilation is divided into four sections: Communication, Knowledge and Power; Literary Consciousness, Practices and Institutions in North India; Inside the World of Indo-Persian Thought; and Early Modernities of Tibetan Knowledge. In the brief 13-page introduction, Pollock situates the theme and the contributions to the volume, not so much in the context of Mughal historiography, as from the perspective of what this engagement with ‘early modernities’ could mean for the post colonial attempt to theorise the rupture brought about by colonial intervention. He admits that such a line of inquiry is perforce teleological but only to the extent that there ‘is no way to forget the end of the story’. He is quick to warn against any a priori definition of modernity, Euro-centric or otherwise, as that could predetermine what one discovers as ‘early modernity’. Rather, the idea is to ‘understand how variegated the world was at the moment’. Thus, the early modern moment is simply ‘a threshold where potentially different futures may have been arrested or retained’ (p. 3). This appears politically laudable and historically logical. The extent of methodological novelty necessary for such an enterprise, however, raises questions of a different order. Contributors to the volume address these questions in their own ways.</p>
<p>In the very first piece on ‘the languages of science in early modern India’, Pollock himself explores how, until at least the sixteenth century, ‘Sanskrit persisted as the exclusive medium of communication outside the Persianate cultural sphere for many areas of science, systematic thought and scholarship more generally’ (p. 19). An elaborately theorised language ideology, first formulated as early as seventh century, backed Sanskrit’s claim to monopoly of truth. Even as late as seventeenth century, it was only Brajbhasha that broke this division of language labour in the limited context of ‘literary sciences’, a sphere in which Kannada, Tamil and Telugu had long been exceptions. With the tremendous variety of Sanskrit and vernacular texts cited by the author, it is difficult not to agree with the argument. Yet, how does one define science? Equally, did the language ideology offered by Sanskrit scholars from seventh to seventeenth centuries claim a monopoly only over <italic>laukika</italic> truth? For, that remains an unexamined premise in the author’s otherwise useful formulations. These questions point only to a limitation of how far questions like these may be pursued.</p>
<p>In a related vein, Sumit Guha studies lexical awareness and language use in the Marathi-speaking world during the period 1300–1800. After tracing the journey of Marathi (and the attendant politics of it) during this period, Guha focuses on three outstanding lexical compositions of seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: <italic>Rajavyavaharkosa</italic> (a thesaurus for state usage), <italic>Tanjavari Kosa</italic> and <italic>Bhasaprakasa</italic>. Though the long time period covered by the essay makes it more of a survey of literature, the author does succeed in tracing certain patterns of language use among those whose mother tongue was Marathi. Particularly interesting is to know how Shivaji commissioned a lexical work to ‘replace the unnecessary Yavana terms of state’ with Sanskrit and how the project, in the same breath, also tried to purge ‘state language’ of even some of the <italic>tadbhav</italic> words. Yet, there is evidence to suggest that the same person in different contexts used different mixes of Marathi, Persian, Sanskrit and Tamil words. The next piece of the first section, by the renowned trio of Rao, Shulman and Subrahmanyam, departs from the survey mode and intimately examines Krishnadevaraya’s famous <italic>niti</italic> text in Telugu, <italic>Amukta-malyada</italic>. The authors meticulously locate the text in its historical, geo-political and literary contexts before laying bare its intricate framing, with multiple stories within stories. The <italic>rajaniti</italic> section of the text comes in for special focus. Evidently, the royal author showed marked preference for ‘yogic and renunciatory themes’ even as he gave (to himself!) somewhat detailed pragmatic advice on statecraft. As the authors point out, this is not really a paradox so much as an attempt to ‘separate rulership as a social function…from the personal salvation of the ruler’ (p. 89). The way this piece simultaneously studies the literary form and aesthetics of the source-text, on the one hand, and its historical ‘content’, on the other, with mutually enriching results can be a great exemplar for young researchers struggling to break away from positivist reading of sources. No less useful is a ‘fresh translation of the Raja-niti Section of <italic>Amukta-malyada</italic>’ that is appended at the end and I cannot resist quoting at least a couple of verses:</p>
<p>Just show devotion to the learned</p>
<p>and if they resent their poverty—don’t be concerned. (p. 97)</p>
<p>The following advice by Krishnadevaraya has evidently found many takers in the present:</p>
<p>Give out gardens, yards, and mines</p>
<p>to those whom you wish to favour. (p. 98)</p>
<p>A crucial area of knowledge production in early modern South Asia on which there is very little work yet is the vernacularisation of manuscript production. The process seems to have started at least in the Hindi belt around the middle of the second millennium. Imre Bangha takes up the issue and focuses on Tulsidas who differed ‘from the previous [vernacular] poets because…he committed to <italic>writing</italic> many of his works at the moment of their birth’ (p. 141). Through a case study of <italic>Kavitavali</italic>, Bangha is able to show how, in the process of transmission, texts could grow (or shrink) as they were received, appropriated and reconstituted by an interventionist class of scribes in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Though largely descriptive, the piece does throw up questions for historians of premodern South Asia about a host of understudied problems like the implications of putting vernacular texts to writing, the changing notions of authorship, the dangers of treating a published work as the ‘authentic’ composition of an author and so on. Another area that has remained largely unexplored in South Asia is the institutional setting for production, re-production and dissemination of knowledge, especially in the vernacular context. The short piece by Mallison on the ‘Bhuj Brajbhasha Pathashala’ (1749–1948) puts together a useful range of information about the ‘school’ founded by Lakhpati Simha (<italic>r</italic>. 1741–61), such as, the background of its teachers and students, its finances, its changing ideological orientation, its curriculum and systems of evaluation. As Mallison says, ‘a critical study of the…pathshala is indeed still awaited’. By painstakingly sifting through available accounts, Mallison has made the project easier and more attractive for probable researchers in the area.</p>
<p>Essays in the third section (Indo-Persian thought) have to expectedly wade through a greater mass of historiography even though each one studies a theme that is relatively novel. The section is certainly denser than the rest of the book in terms of argumentative complexity and contextualisations. In recent times, historians have shown an increasing awareness of the scribal cultures of early modern India. The bio-historical account of Nek Rai by Alam and Subrahmanyam takes the project several steps further by providing a fascinating study of the making of a seventeenth-century Munshi, the archetypal scribe-accountant of the early modern times. The authors succeed in illuminating several interesting aspects of ‘the Persianised Hindu scribal groups that came increasingly to serve the Mughals in the seventeenth century’ (p. 205). The role of this class was critical for not just the smooth conduct of administrative and discursive business of the Mughal state but also in the process of transition to colonial rule in the eighteenth century. Indeed in spite of the centrality of Persian language (or probably because of it, since that language truly claimed a cosmopolitan inheritance), the scribal class actually wielded a variety of skills and nurtured a diverse set of cultural heritages while playing that role.</p>
<p>A more direct but equally fascinating engagement with the ‘composite’ religiosities of early modern times is witnessed in the late Aditya Behl’s close and critical study of the famous mid seventeenth-century Persian ‘Book of Religions’ (<italic>Dabistan-i Mazahib</italic>) by a Zoroastrian author, Mubad Shah. ‘How is one to make sense of Mubad Shah’s attempt to write about every religion that he encountered or could know from books?’ (p. 222). This is the central question the essay deals with. Behl’s is a textual study of highly nuanced order that seeks to lay bare the structural elements and framing strategies of <italic>Dabistan</italic> in a manner that illuminates the historical moorings of the book. The point that he makes with persuasive lucidity is that one must not take (like most historians do) Mubad Shah’s claims to objective presentation of truth about different religions of his time ‘at its face value’. A study of his techniques of classification, the narrative structures of his description and the universalising language of comparative religions, in fact, demonstrate that he did not depart from the orthodoxy of his (Azar Kaivani) sect.</p>
<p>Sunil Sharma’s exploration of ‘urban ethnography in Indo-Persian poetic and historical texts’ is remarkable for its breathtakingly encyclopaedic canvas that draws from a large corpus of Persian literature beginning with Amir Khusraw in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and coming up to Ghalib and Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan in the nineteenth century. The study weaves together an interesting mass of information on the abiding literary tropes and conventions of the surveyed literature but this reviewer failed to see a systematic exposition of patterns of change in the process. One may also point out the suspect leap from Amir Khusraw to <italic>Baburnama</italic> leaving the intervening period of 200 years completely unremarked. Equally problematic is the concluding assertion that ‘the numerous Iranian poets settled in India in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were genuinely responding to the novelty of their situation and locale, while Indian writers have an effusive patriotic zeal that informs their writing’ (p. 252). Would the Indian–foreign binary hold in sixteenth, seventeenth or even eighteenth centuries? Would not a Gujarati poet visiting Agra be ‘genuinely responding to the novelty of the locale’? Abul Fazl’s description of the habits of Bengali folks surely appears to be informed by the sense of an alien’s amazement. One must add, however, that the comment excerpted above comes almost as a lazy aside and does not take away much from the richly researched piece. The section concludes with Tarbighi’s essay on Persianate Modernity that seeks to highlight certain texts made ‘homeless’ by the ahistoricising binds of orientalist–nationalist history. Though the first few pages analysing historiography is somewhat laboured, the author successfully makes a case for revisiting texts that transcend boundaries of nations with their own separate historiographies.</p>
<p>This reviewer lacks even the elementary familiarity with ‘early modernities of Tibetan knowledge’, the subject of the third section, to comment on any of the three essays in there. Suffice it to say that the first two focus on the developments in the field primarily of medicine in Tibet while the third one deals with geographical and cosmological knowledge production.</p>
<p>The other compilation, edited by O’Hanlon and Washbrook, marks continuity with a very recent trend of exploring religion as a socio-political–institutional–ideational and textual process. It is not simply the relationship between religion and state but rather the political context of religious ideas, communities and performative practices that the various contributors to the book examine. The earlier historiography studied religion and religious movements either as a completely independent phenomenon or merely as an instrument for legitimising state power. Indeed, it is a mark of the state of modern historiography of the ‘well traversed’ Mughal period that a theme sounding as simple as ‘religious cultures’ appear to be, and <italic>is</italic> actually, a novel enterprise today.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, south India remains almost untouched in this volume with the possible exception of the study of Advaita Vedanta by Minkowski. Deccan and Bengal are ably served by Novetzke and Tony Stewart respectively, but a majority of pieces focus on the Ganga–Yamuna <italic>doab</italic> and north India more generally. The editors nicely set up the themes in a brief introduction but not before they needlessly burden it with contentious and unsubstantiated remarks such as this: ‘The region’s contemporary societies remain predominantly ones of “faith”…’. The contributors to the volume, O’Hanlon included, thankfully steer clear of such stereotypes. The first piece by Alam examines Abd al-Rahman Chishti’s <italic>Mir’at al-Asrar</italic>, a biographical dictionary of Sufis written in seventeenth century. In a characteristically gentle prose, the author successfully unsettles the entrenched orthodoxy about the ‘inactive’ Chishtis during the Mughal era. As the author shows, Abd al-Rahman sought to redefine the Islamic past and Muslim religious traditions. Rahman’s insistence that a Sufi should not restrict himself to the narrow confines of any particular jurisprudential school (<italic>mazhab</italic>) was at variance with the views of the powerful Naqshabandis and the Qadiris. Thus, the diverse vitality of Islamic discourse during middle ages is further reinforced here in the context of the seventeenth century. Alam has forcefully championed this position over the last seven–eight years revitalising medieval Islamic studies with a new vigour. The fact that the text examined here is still unpublished adds to the value of the work.</p>
<p>In the next essay, Hawley focuses on the <italic>chatursampradaya</italic>, or the fourfold taxonomic mechanism to describe the <italic>bhakti</italic> ‘movement’. Hawley’s is a densely erudite exploration of how and when this system of classification might have come about and what might be the reasons for, and significance of, its persistence. This is an extremely detailed work involving close textual and historical explication of an entire variety of material that will be of immense research interest to those who specialise in the field. For others, it might be difficult to wade through since the author does not attempt to distil generalised insights about medieval religious cultures or even <italic>bhakti</italic> movement out of it. In a related vein, Horstmann considers two sets of <italic>bhakti</italic> sectarian theologians (Pushtimargiyas and Gaudiyas) in early eighteenth-century Rajasthan during the reign of Raja Jai Sing. It examines ‘their response to each other and to the king’s religious project of good governance under Vaisnava auspices’ (p. 77). The assertion that all the Vaishnava sects under the given political context competed with each other to pose as champions of orthodoxy within a ‘Hindu’ cosmology appears to hold true in the limited context of soliciting court patronage. Yet the study posits somewhat simple and direct correspondence between Jai Singh’s active interest in legitimising his own principles of governance with the help of the Vaisnava sects and what the Vaisnav leaders wrote and preached. This might be misleading. A more complicated picture might emerge if one considers the fact that some of the <italic>bhakti</italic> sects, for example, continued to be socially and politically radical, a fact that the essay does not take adequate note of. In part, this might be on account of the fact that Horstmann is trying to figure out only the linkages between ‘theology and statecraft’, as suggested by the title of the essay.</p>
<p>Christopher Minkowski’s work turns the focus on ‘Advaita Vedanta in early modern history’, systematically laying down an incredible mass of information on the theme. It stitches together inputs on literary trends, currents of thought, networks of circulation, geographical expanse, social–institutional moorings and even an ‘excursus’ on four prominent Advaitin authors. A considerable part of this information is understandably drawn from secondary sources, especially Dasgupta, Potter, Thangaswami and Mahadevan. Though the article is meant more as a survey paper, it does provide tentative leads that could be picked up to write a much-needed social history of the diverse strands of Advaita philosophy during this period.</p>
<p>The next two essays, by Novetzke and O’Hanlon, respectively, depart from the erudite mode without sacrificing the rigour of meticulous research in as much as they capture the liveliness of the times they write about and set their explorations within a larger and contemporary political context. Novetzke studies ‘the Brahminical construction of anti-Brahminism’ in pre-colonial Maharashtra. It is unique among all the works surveyed in this review essay in as much as it takes full cognisance of the strong ‘oral-performative aspects of what we call <italic>bhakti</italic> literature’. Situating his analysis within three different moments of historical memory, that of thirteenth century, sixteenth century and late eighteenth century, he reflects on anti-Brahminical critiques of caste attributed to Brahmin figures. Such critiques, identified as a ‘Brahmin double’ were predicated upon the separation of the good Brahmin from the bad one. More crucially, argues the author, it provided ‘one important way to separate Brahminism and Brahmins discursively in public culture’ (p. 149). Novetzke’s reading is textually nuanced, sociologically well contextualised and politically trenchant. A fastidious historian, always looking for change, may complain that there is no conscious attempt to trace shifting patterns between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries, thus making his study historically flat. Yet, is not plotting continuities of literary tropes and tactics and explicating their abiding presence as much of a historical enterprise as mapping change?</p>
<p>Rosalind O’Hanlon’s essay on the Brahman ‘ecumene’ of Mughal India also attempts to understand the dynamics of the process whereby the Brahman intellectuals of early modern times claimed and ‘maintained their social authority and ritual entitlements’. Her study, however, is focused on the scholar households of Banaras. As the latter emerged (reinforced its position?) as an intellectual centre for the Brahman scholars with the significant new opportunities created by the expansive framework of the Mughal empire, O’Hanlon turns her gaze on patterns of migration and articulations of legal–philosophical positions by the Sanskrit scholars of the city. She tries to understand the paradox/challenge for the Brahmans to maintain a sense of unity and community among themselves in the face of stiff real-time rivalry within for material patronage and sectarian followers. The political tumult of 1670s and the consequent decline in the position of Banaras (and Mughal authority), however, eroded the position of scholar-intellectuals as they (a large chunk of them from the Maharashtra region) predictably gravitated towards the Maratha domains. By the eighteenth century ‘it was the Pune court that now inherited the task of mediating conflicts between Maharashtra’s Brahman communities and of pressing and persuading all of them to adhere to common norms of conduct…’ (p. 201).</p>
<p>In the only work focused on Bengal, Tony Stewart examines the configuration of ‘devotional space’ by paying close (and somewhat erudite) attention to what he calls the ‘architectonics of the <italic>mandala</italic>’ in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, especially in the contentious context of reclaiming and remapping the legacy of Chaitanya. Due to the ambitious and somewhat novel methodology of this work, a critical evaluation is not possible within the space permitted in this review. However, this reviewer found the mesocosmic representation, as envisaged by the author, of the Vaishnava order in the architecture of <italic>mandala</italic> to be a little too schematic and simple. Also problematic are the casual usages of phrases like the ‘last major Hindu dynasty’ or ‘Hindu rule’ (p. 247) without explaining what is meant by such sweeping terms. It is precisely such stereotypes taken to their extreme that Heidi Pauwels challenges in her piece on ‘the tale of two temples’. She undertakes a long overdue study of the imperial–ideological context of the building (by Vir Singh Bundela) and destruction (by Aurangzeb) of the Kesavaraya (‘Krisnajanmabhumi’) temple in the sixteenth century along with the parallel story of the Caturbhujadeva temple at Orchha. This is a very well-researched, politically calibrated and historically nuanced work presented with the lucidity (and charm) of a finely crafted linear narrative.</p>
<p>Allison Busch’s monograph on vernacular ‘Poetry of Kings’ explores the Brajbhasha literary traditions of north India—primarily <italic>riti</italic> literature—between late sixteenth and early nineteenth centuries. As the author rightly remarks, ‘the spiritual supremacy of the earlier bhakti literature and the moral degeneracy of its later <italic>riti</italic> counterpart’ have remained ‘unchallenged literary-historical presuppositions’ for far too long. The stated purpose of the book is to understand how and why the <italic>riti</italic> ‘poetry and scholarship were at once popular and prestigious in their own day’ and to see these ‘from the point of view of the people who created it’ (p. 15). It must immediately be added that the book actually accomplishes much more than simply to restore the lost scholarly dignity to <italic>riti</italic> literature. Indeed, it rehabilitates <italic>riti</italic> literature as worthy historical material to engage with. The author herself mines this relatively ignored corpus with exemplary results. Hers is a valiant attempt to turn the focus back on <italic>riti</italic> literary oeuvre along with its courtly milieu, patronage networks, political contexts, literary implications and most importantly intellectual cultures that sustained it.</p>
<p>The book is divided into six chapters plus a longish introduction and a brief conclusion. The introduction sets up the theme in the backdrop of the Hindi scholars’ problematic treatment of Brajbhasha <italic>riti</italic> works as well as the Mughal historians’ complete disregard for the literature. It also historicises this hiatus by underlining what anachronisms informed this neglect. The first chapter understandably focuses on Kesavadas and his immediate successors, while the second chapter illuminates the aesthetic world of <italic>riti</italic> poetry. The subsequent chapters give analytical accounts of its intellectual space, its Mughal courtly context, the wider subcontinental growth and finally its transformation during colonial times. However, this is not a simple description of what <italic>riti</italic> literature was and why it is important for historians to study it (though it is also that). Rather, Busch herself undertakes a nuanced study of this literature and ably demonstrates how a careful reading of this literature can complicate the picture of vernacular literary traditions, on the one hand, and several important aspects of Mughal politics (most prominently the Mughal–Rajput relations), on the other. The outstanding strength of the book, however, lies in the close attention that it pays to the nuances of language. Thus, the author is able to notice and reflect upon the tactical usages of literary tropes, the political significance of specific lexical choices, the specific trajectories of particular genres and the novelties that marked the <italic>riti</italic> literature at different points of time. Her historical sensibility combined with an amazing mastery over the rhythms of Brajbhasha produces a gripping narrative.</p>
<p>While the larger arguments of the book are finely constructed and well taken, certain (dispensable) presuppositions may attract critical attention. One such assumption is that ‘The Indian tradition produced no more potent symbol of political authority than <italic>Ramrajya</italic>, making the adoption of this imagery into one’s aesthetic program an obvious choice for kings, and their court poets’ (p. 43). It is not clear as to how a historian well versed with the complexities of Indian traditions in plural could refer to <italic>the</italic> Indian tradition. Even if the author meant the Sanskrit or vernacular traditions, it is not clear as to how one could judge the relative potency of political symbols! In a similarly sweeping statement while discussing Keshavdas’s reference to Muslim rulers and nobles in terms of Hindu icons, Busch observes that ‘Keshavdas… could construct images of Jahangir in this poetically rich, classicizing fashion because Mughal rule had become fully routinized and was entirely comprehensible to the poet within the traditional Sanskritic episteme of Hindu dharma and kingship’ (p. 60). One only has to look at the Sanskrit texts like the Palam Baoli inscription of thirteenth century, among many others, to remind oneself that the Muslim presence and their representation in terms of Hindu icons had become routinised in the subcontinent long before the Keshavdas actually adopted the ‘classicizing fashion’. It is equally problematic to believe that the traffic of influence between Sanskrit and vernacular was always ‘one way’. Sumit Guha’s essay in the <italic>Forms of Knowledge</italic> (pp. 58, 62), for example, provides an interesting counter point in the context of Marathi in late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, casual remarks such as these do not bear heavily upon the larger argumentation of the book, which remains solid and substantiated. In fact, each of the three volumes is a welcome addition for a new generation of researchers who might find the conventional emphasis of earlier historiography on economic history, dynastic–political narrative and legitimisation route for connecting politics and religion to be inadequate and constricting. In their attention to forms of knowledge as well as to religious and literary cultures of early modern India, the contributors considered above have opened up new avenues for writing a social history of intellectual pursuits in exciting ways. Still, there are two caveats to this general note of appreciation that may profitably be slipped in here. First, none of these works show much interest in remarking upon, let alone analysing out, the gendered terrain of the interconnected traditions of literary, religious or intellectual cultures. The character of this omission might appear to be benign historically speaking if one was to look at one’s ‘sources’ merely in terms of what they convey rather than what they take for granted or simply elide. But the rich possibilities of a gender-sensitive methodology are too well known to be recounted here. Second, it is probably a comment on the state of early modern studies in India today that all the authors considered here are institutionally affiliated to an institution either in Europe or in USA with the exception of David Shulman of Hebrew University at Jerusalem! This is not to make a nationalist complaint but to appreciate the contribution of west European and North American institutions to a better understanding of South Asian history as also to wonder why the subcontinental institutions are not producing as many useful studies as one might expect.</p>
