<abstract>
<p>Facial stereotypes are cognitive representations of the facial characteristics of members of social groups. In this study, we examined the extent to which facial stereotypes for occupational groups were based on physiognomic cues to stereotypical social characteristics. In Experiment 1, participants rated the occupational stereotypicality of naturalistic face images. These ratings were then regressed onto independent ratings of the faces on 16 separate traits. These traits, particularly those relevant to the occupational stereotype, explained the majority of variance in occupational stereotypicality ratings. In Experiments 2 and 3, we used trait ratings to reconstruct stereotypical occupation faces from a separate set of images, using face averaging techniques. These reconstructed facial stereotypes were validated by separate groups of participants as conforming to the occupational stereotype. These results indicate that facial cues and group stereotypes are integrated through shared semantic content in the cognitive representations of groups.</p>

<body>
<p>If asked to think about a typical doctor, many people would likely conjure up an image of a middle-aged, healthy individual, perhaps male with graying hair. A typical nurse, in contrast, might be represented as a young, attractive female; while a criminal is likely to be imagined as a sinister, pale and unshaven male. In essence, these cognitive representations of the facial characteristics of group members are stereotypes.</p>
<p>Although social psychology has traditionally studied stereotypes in their linguistic form, in recent years there has been increasing interest in the visual aspects of stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550612469820">Macrae, Quinn, Mason, &amp; Quadflieg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550612469820">Zebrowitz, 2006</xref>). Here, we extend this approach by taking advantage of developments in image manipulation software that open up opportunities to study facial stereotypes in detail, enabling researchers to “externalize” these pictures in the head so that the facial characteristics associated with a range of judgments can be visualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550612469820">Tiddeman, Burt, &amp; Perrett, 2001</xref>). </p>
<p>In the current study, we employed face averaging techniques to identify and visualize the facial stereotypes associated with selected occupational groups. By averaging sets of faces rated as looking like particular occupations, we aimed to reveal the facial cues that are consistently associated with each occupation. We then developed models of the facial cues contributing to each stereotype and reconstructed the facial stereotypes using these facial cue models with a separate set of face images. That we were successful in reconstructing recognizable facial stereotypes from these cues suggests that facial stereotypes are based to a large extent on physiognomic cues that associate independently with stereotype-relevant traits. These findings indicate that cognitive representations of groups and associated facial stereotypes are linked through common semantic associations.</p>

<title>Previous Research on Facial Stereotypes</title>
<p>Facial stereotypes are cognitive representations of the facial characteristics of members of social groups. Studies have demonstrated the existence of facial stereotypes for ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550612469820">Blair, Judd, Sadler, &amp; Jenkins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8a-1948550612469820">Dotsch, Wigboldus, Langner, &amp; van Knippenberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19a-1948550612469820">Livingstone &amp; Brewer, 2002</xref>), different types of criminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550612469820">Dumas &amp; Teste, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550612469820">Goldstein, Chance, &amp; Gilbert, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550612469820">Shoemaker, South, &amp; Lowe, 1973</xref>), political groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21a-1948550612469820">Olivola, Sussman, Tsetsos, Kang, &amp; Todorov, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550612469820">Samochowiec, Wanke, &amp; Fiedler, 2010</xref>), and various occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612469820">Hills, Lewis, &amp; Honey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15a-1948550612469820">Klatzky, Martin, &amp; Kane, 1982</xref>). Facial stereotypes can have important consequences. For instance, faces that look more stereotypical of their occupation group are better remembered than nonstereotypical faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612469820">Hills et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15a-1948550612469820">Klatzky et al., 1982</xref>), political candidates are more likely to be elected if they appear stereotypical of their political group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21a-1948550612469820">Olivola et al., 2012</xref>), faces that match criminal stereotypes are more likely to be judged guilty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550612469820">Shoemaker et al., 1973</xref>), and more stereotypically African American faces are more likely to be judged as criminal and given harsher sentences than less stereotypical faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550612469820">Blair et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550612469820">Blair, Judd, &amp; Chapleau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10a-1948550612469820">Eberhardt, Goff, Purie, &amp; Davies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612469820">Kleider, Cavrak, &amp; Knuycky, 2012</xref>). Given these potentially significant consequences, it is important to understand how facial stereotypes are formed. </p>
<p>A number of physiognomic cues that enable categorization of faces into age, sex, and race categories are reasonably well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550612469820">Bruce &amp; Young, 2012</xref>), and these cues tend to correlate reliably with category membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550612469820">Burt &amp; Perrett, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550612469820">Burton, Bruce, &amp; Dench, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550612469820">Langlois &amp; Roggman, 1990</xref>). However, facial stereotypes also exist for more abstract social groupings, such as occupations, for which reliable facial cues might seem less probable. Nevertheless, research shows there is a degree of consensus in matching faces with a variety of such groups. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550612469820">Shoemaker, South, and Lowe (1973</xref>) asked participants to choose which of the 12 photographs looked most and least likely to have committed one of four types of crime. They found that certain faces were associated with certain crimes more than others, indicating shared facial stereotypes for different kinds of criminals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612469820">Hills, Lewis, and Honey (2008</xref>) showed 250 computer-generated faces to participants and asked them which of the eight occupations each looked most like. More than half of their participants chose the same occupation for three quarters of the faces, demonstrating shared facial stereotypes for occupational groups. There even appear to be facial stereotypes for first names. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550612469820">Lea, Thomas, Lamkin, and Bell (2007</xref>) had participants construct a face, using computer software, to go with one of 15 male first names. A second group of judges sorted the resulting faces into “good” and “bad” exemplars of each name, from which name prototypes (averages) were generated. A third group, tasked with pairing face prototypes with names, showed a beyond-chance tendency to associate the faces with the names for which they had been created.</p>
<p>Given that facial cues to indicate membership of occupational groups, criminal types, or first names are likely at best to have limited validity, the question remains how and why these judgments are made with a degree of consensus. One possibility, which we advance here, is that perceivers’ facial representations of groups are influenced by their stereotypes about those groups, such that faces will be perceived to be stereotypical to the extent they contain cues to stereotypical traits. To the extent that group stereotypes are shared, facial representations of those groups will also be shared. </p>

<title>Semantic Associations With Groups and Faces</title>
<p>Stereotypes are understood to be sets of semantic associations with groups. For example, elderly people are often associated with being forgetful and kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550612469820">Cuddy, Norton, &amp; Fiske, 2005</xref>), women with being caring and emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612469820">Eagly &amp; Steffen, 1984</xref>), and African Americans with being athletic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550612469820">Devine &amp; Elliot, 1995</xref>). Even subtle cues to category membership can activate traits associated with the category automatically and without conscious awareness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612469820">Kawakami, Dovidio, Moll, Hermsen, &amp; Russin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550612469820">Lewicki, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612469820">Nosek, Banaji, &amp; Greenwald, 2002</xref>). </p>
<p>Like groups, faces also carry a wide range of semantic associations. Beyond the more objective judgments of sex, age, and race, perceivers also judge faces on intelligence, confidence, trustworthiness, approachability, and many other traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550612469820">Sutherland, Oldmeadow, Santos, et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550612469820">Zebrowitz, Fellous, Mignault, &amp; Andreoletti, 2003</xref>). These judgments are widely shared and often made rapidly and from relatively short presentations, suggesting a degree of automaticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550612469820">Willis &amp; Todorov, 2006</xref>). </p>
<p>Since both groups and faces invoke strong and often automatic semantic associations, it is possible that groups and faces become linked with the cognitive representations of groups through these shared associations. A small number of studies provide evidence of such connections between groups and faces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550612469820">Shepherd, Ellis, McMurran, and Davies (1978</xref>) had participants reconstruct a face from memory using interchangeable templates of separate facial features (Photofit). In separate conditions, the same face was believed to be that of either a “murderer” or a “hero.” The reconstructed face in the hero condition was subsequently rated by independent judges as being more attractive and intelligent than the reconstructed murderer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7a-1948550612469820">Davies and Oldman (1999</xref>) showed similar effects for liked and disliked celebrity faces reconstructed using a computer program. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8a-1948550612469820">Dotsch, Wigboldus, Langner, and van Knippenberg (2008</xref>) demonstrated that the facial composites of Moroccans generated by highly prejudiced Dutch participants were significantly more criminal and untrustworthy looking than those generated by low-prejudiced participants. These studies demonstrate that perceivers’ facial representations of groups are influenced at least by their attitudes toward the group (positive or negative). In the current study, we go further to demonstrate that facial stereotypes can also be connected to group stereotypes through shared semantic content.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>In the current study, we explored the intersection of facial cues and semantic stereotypes in the formation and recognition of facial stereotypes for occupational groups. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that facial stereotypes would be based on facial cues to stereotypical social characteristics. In Experiment 1, we collected ratings of a large number of faces on four occupations and regressed these onto previously gathered trait ratings to generate models representing the contributions of trait judgments to facial stereotypes. In Experiment 2, we used these models to reconstruct facial stereotypes from a separate set of face images and validated these reconstructed facial stereotypes with a new sample of raters. Experiment 3 controlled cues to highly salient social categories of sex and age and found that facial composites continued to be perceived as stereotypical of their intended occupations, demonstrating that the mappings underlying these occupational stereotypes are not simply loosely derived from one or two linguistic descriptors. Instead, they entail subtle evaluations of facial appearance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1948550612469820">
<title>Experiment 1</title>
<p>The aim of Experiment 1 was to examine the contribution of perceived social characteristics to occupational stereotypicality. Faces rated previously on 16 traits were rated by separate judges for how much they looked like one of four occupations: investment bankers, nurses, teachers, and drug dealers. These occupations were chosen because pilot testing indicated they occupied different quadrants of the stereotype content model, which differentiates groups on key dimensions of competence and warmth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550612469820">Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick, 2006</xref>). Average occupational stereotypicality ratings were then regressed onto ratings of perceived social characteristics to explore how much variance in occupational stereotypicality could be accounted for by perceived social characteristics.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1948550612469820">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-two undergraduate students from the University of York participated in exchange for payment or course credit. Age ranged from 18 to 33 (M = 22, SD = 4). Fourteen participants identified themselves as British. The remainder included a range of Asian and European nationalities. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1948550612469820">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The experiment utilized a database consisting of photographs of 500 male and 500 female adult Caucasian faces taken from the Internet. The photographs were cropped around the head and shoulder and standardized to 150 pixels in height. In other respects, the images were free to vary in any way, including wide ranges of age, expression, pose, health, facial hair, hairstyle, glasses, piercings, lighting, background, and camera angle. The images were deliberately chosen to be as highly variable as those we encounter in our daily lives, allowing them to capture the wide variety of cues that might potentially influence judgments of social characteristics or group membership.</p>
<p>In previous research, these images have been rated by groups of judges on 16 separate characteristics, so that each face in the database is associated with a mean score (averaged across judges) for each trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612469820">Santos &amp; Young, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612469820">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550612469820">2011</xref>). The rated characteristics were trustworthiness, confidence, aggressiveness, dominance, masculinity, age, approachability, attractiveness, intelligence, babyfacedness, pleasantness, degree of smiling, healthiness, skin tone, arousal, and gaze direction. These traits were selected to reflect a range of physical and social characteristics people perceive in faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550612469820">Bruce &amp; Young, 2012</xref>). Each face was rated on each characteristic by between 6 and 12 raters, and reliabilities (Cronbach’s α) for all traits were above .70.</p>
<p>For the current study, the 1,000 faces were randomly split into two sets of 500 images, each containing 250 male and 250 female faces. Independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests confirmed the two sets did not differ significantly on any trait, with mean differences less than 0.17. One of these sets was used to collect ratings of occupational stereotypicality (Experiment 1), while the other was used to construct facial stereotypes from trait scores (Experiments 2 and 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550612469820">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>One set of 250 male and 250 female faces was rated in terms of how stereotypical each faced looked for four occupations: investment bankers, nurses, teachers, and drug dealers. These occupations were selected from a pilot test in which participants (<italic>n</italic> = 5) rated 15 occupations on traits related to competence and warmth. These four occupations were the best representatives of the four quadrants of the competence by warmth space. Participants were randomly allocated to rate the faces on two occupation groups, but due to technical difficulties two participants rated faces for only one occupation. Participants were instructed to “rate the faces in terms of how much they look like a stereotypical [occupation].” Ratings were made on 7-point scales (1 = not at all stereotypical; 7 = very stereotypical). In total, the faces were rated on each occupation by 15 participants. Interrater reliability was acceptable for all occupations (Cronbach’s αs &gt;.80).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550612469820">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Regression analyses assessed the extent to which occupation judgments (averaged across raters) could be explained by the rated characteristics. Scores (obtained from separate raters) for the 16 traits were regressed onto the four occupation scores in separate regressions. Stepwise regression was used in order to determine the most important predictors of each occupational group.</p>
<p>The 16 traits explained 48.4% of the variance in investment banker ratings, 71.8% in drug dealer ratings, 80.9% in nurses, and 51.7% in teachers. All models were significant (Fs &gt; 52, ps &lt; .001). β coefficients for each trait and occupation are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550612469820">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550612469820">Table 1</xref>, ratings of occupational stereotypicality were strongly related to perceived characteristics. The best predictors of looking like an investment banker were intelligence, dominance, health (perhaps reflecting their presumed wealth) and age; faces rated as stereotypical drug dealers were young, untrustworthy, masculine and unhealthy; the best predictors of stereotypical nurses were femininity, trustworthiness, youth and confidence; and stereotypical teachers were intelligent, dominant, feminine and unattractive.</p>
<p>These predictors were largely consistent with results from a separate group of 43 participants asked to rate each (linguistic) trait for how stereotypical it was of each occupation. The stereotypical traits for each occupation, ordered from most to least, were as follows: Investment bankers—intelligent, confident, dominant, masculine, and aggressive; drug dealers—untrustworthy, aggressive, unhealthy, masculine, dominant, confident, unattractive, unapproachable, and young; nurses—trustworthy, approachable, healthy, feminine, confident, passive, vibrant, intelligent, and attractive; and teachers—intelligent, trustworthy, approachable, confident, healthy, dominant, vibrant, feminine, and old. Across the four occupations, the rank order of these linguistic stereotypes correlated with the regression weights of the traits predicting facial stereotypes (r = −.30, p &lt; .05). Therefore, the traits that contributed to occupational stereotypicality judgments of faces were in line with cultural stereotypes of these occupations.</p>

<sec id="section10-1948550612469820">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Having demonstrated that independently rated traits can account for a substantial proportion of the variance in stereotypical occupational appearance, we sought to put the effectiveness of the traits summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550612469820">Table 1</xref> to a further test. This was achieved by attempting to reconstruct occupational facial stereotypes by using computer image manipulation techniques to combine stereotypical facial cues into facial averages. To do this, we used the second set of 500 face photographs (Set 2), which had not been rated for occupational stereotypicality but which had been previously rated on the 16 characteristics.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section12-1948550612469820">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-six participants (19 female, aged 19 to 60, M = 29.87, SD = 8.71) recruited through the researchers’ social networks judged the occupational stereotypicality of facial averages. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1948550612469820">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>Face averages for each of the four occupations were computed from 20 faces, which were selected on the basis of the sum of the weighted ratings on stereotypical traits. For each occupation, scores on the significant predictors were multiplied by each predictor’s β value in the regression model. For example, for investment bankers the raw intelligence score of each face was multiplied by .533, dominance by .356, health by .270, age by .188, and so on for all significant traits shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1948550612469820">Table 1</xref>. The resulting scores were then summed and the 20 highest scoring faces were selected for averaging. For comparison, we computed facial averages from the 20 faces in Set 1 that were rated highest on stereotypicality for each occupation. </p>
<p>Thus, two face averages were created per occupation. One was the “derived” face, which was an average of the 20 faces from Experiment 1 rated as looking most like the occupation being modeled. The other was an “assembled” face built from the 20 faces in Set 2 that scored highest on the sum of weighted stereotypical facial characteristics. Importantly, because of the use of separate sets of stimuli, none of the faces used to create the derived faces were used in the assembled faces. These derived and assembled face images are therefore completely independent except for the extent to which they are based on a common set of cues. Averaging was done using Psychomorph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550612469820">Tiddeman et al., 2001</xref>), which uses 179 fiducial points to align the two-dimentional (2D) shapes of all constituent images to the same average and then tessellates each reshaped image and blends the pigmentation. </p>
<p>To determine the effectiveness of these computer-created facial stereotype images, participants were asked to choose which of the four faces (within the derived and assembled sets) looked most like each occupation. To avoid carryover effects, half of the participants (n = 18) rated the derived faces and the other half (n = 18) rated the assembled faces. In an online survey, participants were shown all four faces displayed in a 2 × 2 grid and asked to select the one that looked most like a given occupation. The task was completed for all four occupations. The position of each face in the grid was randomized across participants and trials, and the participants were instructed that they could choose the same face more than once if they wished. </p>

In all cases except one, the predicted face was chosen more frequently than any of the other faces. The exception was the assembled teacher face, which was chosen as looking most like a nurse slightly more frequently than the assembled nurse face (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1948550612469820">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The results of Experiment 2 confirm and extend Experiment 1 by showing that facial stereotypes can be reasonably well reproduced by combining facial cues to stereotype-relevant social characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1948550612469820">
<title>Experiment 3</title>
<p>In Experiment 2, the occupation stereotype images were generated without constraining them in any way beyond the characteristics linked with each occupation. In consequence, the images vary in sex and age, and it is possible that stereotypical likeness judgments might be based solely on these salient cues. For example, a participant may reason that a nurse is likely to be a young woman and a drug dealer a young man.</p>
<p>To explore the impact of age and sex stereotypes, we conducted hierarchical regressions using the data from Experiment 1, regressing occupational likeness ratings onto masculinity and age in Step 1 and all other traits in Step 2. For each occupation, Step 2 produced a significant increase in explained variance (ranging from 4.3% to 36.2%), suggesting that cues other than those for sex and age do contribute to facial stereotypes. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether these contributions could be detected in facial composites. Therefore, we constructed facial stereotypes for the four occupations within sex and age categories and had these composites rated for occupational stereotypicality by a new set of judges.</p>
<sec id="section16-1948550612469820">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Forty-three participants (36 female) aged 18 to 55 years (M = 21.56, SD = 7.69) from the University of York completed an online survey, which was advertised on a website for psychology experiments and e-mailed to a list of registered participants. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1948550612469820">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>The 500 faces used in Experiment 2 were divided into four subsets: younger males, younger females, older males, and older females. To construct age- and sex-matched facial stereotypes of each occupation, the weighted scores for the significant predictors excluding masculinity and age were summed, and the 20 highest scoring faces within each social category were averaged. This yielded 16 face composites, one for each occupation within each social category.</p>
<p>An online survey was constructed in which participants were presented with each of these 16 face composites in random order and asked to rate each one in terms of how stereotypical it looked of one of the four occupations (1 = not at all stereotypical, 7 = very stereotypical). All participants completed this task for all four occupations, presented in separate randomized blocks.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1948550612469820">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>If facial cues other than those for sex and age contribute reliably to occupational facial stereotypes then (a) there should be a significant main effect of face for each occupation and (b) the face constructed from stereotype-relevant cues should be rated significantly more like the intended occupation than other faces within the same social category. Likeness ratings were analyzed separately for each occupation using 2 (Sex) × 2 (Age) × 4 (Face) within-subject analysis of variances (ANOVAs), followed by simple main effect pairwise comparisons. For each occupation, there was a significant main effect of face (all Fs &gt; 8.08, ps &lt; .001), confirming that across the four social categories the four faces did not resemble the occupation equally well. Pairwise comparisons between the stereotypical face and the three other faces within each social category confirmed that the stereotypical face was rated significantly more like the occupation than the other face on 30 of the 48 comparisons (ps &lt; .05). On a further 13 comparisons, the stereotypical face was rated higher than the other face, though not significantly so (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1948550612469820">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1948550612469820-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In addition to these predicted effects of face type, there also were numerous effects involving sex and age, which were consistent with the sex and age typing of these occupations. The effect of sex was significant for bankers, drug dealers, and nurses (Fs &gt; 64.48, ps &lt; .001), and the effect of age was significant for drug dealers, nurses, and teachers (Fs &gt; 19.25, ps &lt; .001). There also were significant interactions of face type with sex (for bankers, drug dealers, and nurses) and with age (for drug dealers and teachers), which indicated that, in general, the effects of face type were stronger within stereotypical social categories. For example, face type had a stronger effect on banker and drug dealer stereotypicality within male faces than female faces, while the effect of face type on nurse stereotypicality was stronger for female faces. These results show while sex and age may be strong cues to occupational likeness, other more subtle cues can also contribute meaningfully to facial stereotypes particularly within stereotypical sex and age categories.</p>

<sec id="section19-1948550612469820">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The three experiments reported here provide evidence that some facial stereotypes are based on facial cues to stereotypical social traits. In these experiments, faces were judged as being stereotypical to the extent they contained cues to stereotypical social traits. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrate that facial cues to social traits can be manipulated to produce facial stereotypes for occupational groups, providing a potentially powerful tool for research at the intersection of face perception and social cognition.</p>
<p>It is worth noting at the outset that we found clear evidence for the existence of facial stereotypes of occupational groups, supporting previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612469820">Hills et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15a-1948550612469820">Klatzky et al., 1982</xref>). In Experiment 1, the level of agreement regarding how much each face matched a given occupation was high (αs &gt; .80) across the 15 raters of each occupation. In Experiment 2, when the 20 faces rated as looking most like each occupation were averaged, the composite faces were distinctive, appearing to fit our intuitive facial stereotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550612469820">Figure 1</xref>). They were also chosen by independent judges as looking most like their intended occupation from among the four composite faces. Together, this constitutes strong evidence for the existence of shared mental representations of the facial characteristics of group members.</p>
<p>Two findings from this study support the view that facial stereotypes are based on cues to stereotypical social characteristics. First, a high proportion of variance (between 48% and 81%) in the rated stereotypicality of the 500 faces was explained by those faces’ rated social characteristics, particularly those characteristics central to the cultural stereotype. This was despite the fact that the two sets of ratings were provided by different raters, eliminating shared method variance. Clearly there is considerable overlap between the facial cues for judgments of occupational stereotypicality and those for judgments of social characteristics. Second, we were able to construct stereotypical occupation faces by averaging faces with cues to known stereotypical traits. In Experiment 2, despite drawing on a different set of base faces, the assembled face averages looked remarkably similar to the derived averages and were for the most part chosen as looking most like their intended occupation. Experiment 2 revealed the strong sex and age typing of these occupations, which came through in relatively clear sex and age cues in the facial stereotypes. However, Experiment 3 showed that occupational facial stereotypes involve more than just sex and age cues, since we were able to construct facial stereotypes within sex and age categories using cues to stereotypical social characteristics independent of sex and age. Overall, this provides strong support for the view that these facial stereotypes are based on cues to stereotypical social characteristics and not just those for sex and age.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not claim that facial cues to stereotypical social characteristics are the only basis for facial stereotypes. We deliberately focused on occupational groups, which have strong semantic associations and relatively weak facial correlates at best. Facial stereotypes of other kinds of groups, such as ethnic groups, could well be based on actual physiognomic correlates. Indeed, the process is likely to work in both directions, with reliable physiognomic cues to group membership taking on semantic meanings consistent with group stereotypes. This causal ordering is evidenced in a series of studies by Blair and colleagues, showing that Afrocentric facial features activate African American stereotypes even in faces that are explicitly not African American (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550612469820">Blair et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550612469820">Blair, Judd, &amp; Chapleau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550612469820">Blair, Judd, &amp; Fallman, 2004</xref>). That research, together with the current study, points to close bidirectional relationships between facial cues and social stereotypes in face evaluation.</p>
<p>Although our face averaging technique produced valid facial stereotypes for each of the four occupations, it was more successful for some occupations than others in terms of creating distinctive faces that were clearly more stereotypical of their occupation than others. Overall, drug dealer stereotypes were most distinctive, while there was some overlap between teachers and nurses and between teachers and bankers. Though speculative, we suggest facial stereotypes will be most distinctive for groups that are also distinctive in terms of semantic or linguistic stereotypes: in both facial and linguistic stereotypes drug dealers were the only group stereotyped as untrustworthy, aggressive, and unhealthy. The degree to which there is strong sex and age typing of a group will also affect the distinctiveness of facial stereotypes: in general males did not look like nurses and females did not look like investment bankers or drug dealers. However, sex and age cues will not differentiate between groups with the same sex and age typing. Similarly, it is probable that facial stereotypes will be most distinctive across key dimensions of stereotype content, so that facial stereotypes will best differentiate groups falling in different quadrants of the competence by warmth space (e.g., between bankers and drug dealers more than between bankers and doctors). Hypotheses such as these will need to be examined in further research to test the boundaries of this trait approach to facial stereotypes.</p>
<p>Beyond demonstrating a connection between facial and group stereotypes, the current study demonstrates the utility of face averaging methods for the growing area of research on social influences on face perception. We have demonstrated that it is possible to capture meaningful facial representations of social groups by averaging sets of face photographs, and moreover that it is possible to reconstruct these representations from known combinations of facial cues. The current research also underscores the importance of using highly varied face images for research on facial stereotypes in order to capture the wide range of cues that may contribute to stereotyped perceptions (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612469820">Jenkins, White, VanMontfort, &amp; Burton, 2011</xref>). Our impressions of others are likely influenced as much by facial accessories (glasses, jewelry, facial hair, makeup) and transient cues (expressions, gaze) as they are by more stable structural cues, and these are clearly relevant to social and facial stereotypes. To ignore such cues in experimental research would be to miss a significant component of our cognitive representations of faces and how they are associated with our representations of groups. </p>
