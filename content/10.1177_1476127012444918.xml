<abstract>
<p>This article explores in depth the mechanisms through which formal contracts and relational governance complement each other, focusing on the role played by formal contracts in transitional economies characterized by weak legal enforcement and a culture oriented around informal ties. The findings, drawn from case studies conducted at five firms across China, suggest that formal contracts are used even when they are not legally enforceable because by defining the rights and obligations in an exchange, contracts reinforce reciprocity in long-term exchange relationships. Although this role of contracts has not previously been clarified in the literature, it is particularly important in China because its cultural traditions prioritize reciprocity. The findings have implications for developing a theory of inter-firm relationship governance and optimal contracting, particularly in transitional economies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Weak legal enforcement is a major cause for contract failure, particularly in transitional economies. Furthermore, these economies exhibit a long-standing tradition of using personal ties to conduct business. For these reasons, there is a widespread perception that formal contracts are ineffective or irrelevant in such economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012444918">Banerjee and Duflo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012444918">Blunt and Jones, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012444918">Gupta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012444918">Walder, 1986</xref>). However, the use of formal contracts is still evident in transitional economies like China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012444918">Luo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012444918">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>), which raises key research questions: ‘If risks are managed in these networks informally on the basis of accepted social practice rather than by reliance on formal laws of contracts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012444918">Boisot and Child, 1996</xref>: 622), can personal ties (i.e., <italic>guanxi</italic>) replace formal institutions to assure business success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012444918">Ambramson and Ai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012444918">Child and Möllering, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012444918">Davies et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012444918">Li, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012444918">Peng and Heath, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012444918">Peng and Luo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012444918">Xin and Pearce, 1996</xref>), and why does the use of formal contracts remain ubiquitous?</p>
<p>The effect of using formal contracts for governing inter-firm transactions has been debated in various research streams. Within transaction costs theory (TCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012444918">Joskow, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012444918">Macher and Richman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012444918">Masten, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012444918">Williamson, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012444918">1991</xref>), how a contract influences the exchange and ongoing relationship between parties when they repeatedly interact is a complex issue. Contracts can both substitute for and complement relationships in markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012444918">Adler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476127012444918">Argyres and Mayer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012444918">Curchod, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012444918">Dyer and Singh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012444918">Ghoshal and Moran, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012444918">Granovetter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012444918">Gulati, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476127012444918">Mesquita and Brush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012444918">Uzzi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012444918">Weber and Mayer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012444918">Woolthuis et al., 2005</xref>). Contracts may also appear similar, formally, but their meaning may evolve over transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012444918">Argyres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444918">Ryall and Sampson, 2009</xref>). And, to the extent that formal contracts delineate the obligations of each party (or provoke mistrust when they are too protective), they serve as a complex strategic choice affecting firm performance. It follows that the evolution of the contract’s meaning through repeated exchanges, even if the contract is not often enforced explicitly, should influence strategic choices. Yet very little work has been undertaken to examine this evolving relationship, which remains one of the ‘unresolved issues’ in inter-firm research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012444918">Weber and Mayer, 2011</xref>). My objective is to explore this evolutionary process of contract structure, meaning, and impact in a transitional economy.</p>
<p>I conduct a case study analysis in a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) in the textile industry and four of the firms with which it does business. Although despairing of contractual enforcement, I find that Chinese managers attach increasing significance to formal contracts in repeated inter-firm interactions. Contract signing is an event in which debt and the credit are balanced in an inter-firm relationship, not deal-by-deal, but over time. Formal contracts define the rights and obligations of each partner. They serve to remind both parties ‘who owes what to whom’ when one or another partner cannot fulfill its contractual obligations due to unanticipated contingencies. Although this role of contracts has not been identified previously, it is particularly important in China given its cultural traditions related to reciprocity.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>The governance of inter-firm collaboration is an important topic in strategic organization research. Formal contracts and relational governance are two broad categories of control mechanisms in inter-firm exchange settings. A formal contract refers to a written document representing promises and obligations to perform a particular action in the future; its enforcement is guaranteed by a third party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012444918">Macneil, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012444918">Williamson, 1985</xref>). Formal contracting addresses the moral hazard problems via explicit terms. As exchange hazards arise, managers should respond by crafting complex contractual safeguards to define remedies for foreseeable contingencies or specify processes for resolving unforeseeable outcomes. However, it is impossible to foresee all future relevant contingencies at the time the contract is signed and managers align the governance features of inter-organizational relationships to match known exchange hazards, particularly those associated with specialized asset investments, difficult performance measurement, or uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012444918">Argyres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012444918">Beckman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012444918">Ghosh and George, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012444918">Poppo and Zenger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012444918">Reuer and Arino, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476127012444918">Rindfleisch and Heide, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012444918">Williamson, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, the contracting parties are often uncertain of the enforceability of the real intent of the contract by a court or third party because verifiability of contractual provisions, a requirement for <italic>ex post</italic> enforceability, makes formal contracting costly if not impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012444918">Grossman and Hart, 1986</xref>). When such contracts are too costly to craft and enforce, managers may choose not to enforce them or engage in incomplete contracting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012444918">Lyons and Mehta, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Relational governance refers to the enforcement of obligations, promises, and expectations through trust and informal ties. Business partners frequently resort to informal, social interactions to maintain bilateral relations, to carry out contract implementation, and to respond to unforeseen contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012444918">Granovetter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012444918">Macaulay, 1963</xref>). Relational governance cannot be enforced by a third party and must therefore be self-enforcing. The idea is that repeated interactions make it costly for either party to breach the contract (i.e., loss of future trade value). However, the self-enforcing range of such implicit agreements is limited by the level of mutual trust.</p>
<p>The fact that there are two means to foster cooperation naturally leads to a trade-off between formal and relational governance, depending on their relative efficiency. A crucial question is the nature of the relationship between the two mechanisms in explaining exchange performance. Previous literature has usually studied the emergence of informal contracting when formal contracting may yield suboptimal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012444918">Baker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012444918">Klein, 1996</xref>). This logic suggests that relational norms, such as trust, can <italic>substitute</italic> for complex, explicit contracts or vertical integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012444918">Adler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012444918">Dyer and Singh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012444918">Granovetter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012444918">Gulati, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012444918">Larson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012444918">Uzzi, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>More recent discussions direct attention to the <italic>complementarity</italic> of formal contracts and relational governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476127012444918">Argyres and Mayer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476127012444918">Mesquita and Brush, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012444918">Woolthuis et al., 2005</xref>). The main arguments are: (1) well-specified contracts promote more cooperative, long-term, trusting exchange relationships by narrowing the limit and severity of exchange hazards and increasing the penalties for opportunistic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012444918">Poppo and Zenger, 2002</xref>); (2) formal contracts have a ‘coordination’ function because they may have positive psychological impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012444918">Weber and Mayer, 2011</xref>) and relationships require clearly communicated goals and procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012444918">Mayer and Argyres, 2004</xref>); and (3) a more extensive relationship history leads to greater efforts at contingency planning in the contracting process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012444918">Argyres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012444918">Kalnins and Mayer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444918">Ryall and Sampson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012444918">Vanneste and Puranam, 2010</xref>). Taken together, these arguments suggest that building long-term ties may mandate explicit agreements that facilitate cooperative efforts and processes through which firms learn how to work together, which improves their ability to write more effective contracts.</p>
<p>A growing body of theoretical and empirical work has argued that the substitutability hypothesis does not generally hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444918">Ryall and Sampson, 2009</xref>). Previous empirical literature focuses on the complementarity of formal and relational contractual dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012444918">Lazzarini et al., 2004</xref>) or the link between past interactions, trust, and the way contracting parties draft contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012444918">Corts and Singh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012444918">Gulati and Nickerson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012444918">Ryall and Sampson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012444918">Vanneste and Puranam, 2010</xref>). Although many firms choose to waive their rights to courtroom dispute resolution in practice, it is taken for granted that formal contracts have ultimate coercive power. However, this complementary relationship – that is, in repeated deals parties learn to draft more detailed contracts with more explicit penalties or incentives that help to preserve long-term relationships by delineating the obligations each party is expected to fulfill, so then long-term relationships will further improve parties’ capacity of crafting more efficient contracts and so forth – is not be plausible without the precondition that formal contracts have effective coercive power ensured by an efficient legal enforcement system. Furthermore, since both its fundamental mission is to avoid costly misunderstandings and dissuade <italic>ex ante</italic> opportunistic behaviors leading to contractual violation, this complementary relationship offers no strategic guidance for dealing with the situation in which inter-firm relationships are <italic>de facto</italic> affected by contractual noncompliance. Indeed, the learning-by-doing rationale appears to encourage re-contracting and reconstructing inter-firm relationships in case of contractual noncompliance caused by unforeseen events, which could prove very costly.</p>
<p>In TCE, contractual unenforceability or violation is seen to result from partners’ voluntary strategic choice in response to high transaction costs, especially in complex exchanges involving important specific assets. In practice, however, it is more common for contractual noncompliance to result from non-strategic causes (i.e., unforeseen events). Facing this problem, TCE proposes incomplete contracts or vertical integration as a solution. Incomplete contracts require some costly preconditions (e.g., partners’ reputation) that can severely limit their application in practice and generate considerable costs associated with ongoing negotiations. Vertical integration is a non-market solution that effectively ends market-based inter-firm contractual relationships.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the dynamic interaction of formal contracts and relational governance, it remains an understudied topic in inter-firm research. Given the fundamental nature of these issues and the need to unpack them in current theory, I use an exploratory, qualitative approach in this study, in particular, a multi-case design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012444918">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). Although case studies afford limited generalizability, they are a preferred research strategy for examining complex social phenomena such as the dynamics of inter-firm relationships because they provide rich findings for theorizing, allow development of a holistic understanding of unfolding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012444918">Yin, 2003</xref>), and aid in discovery of dynamic processes involving multiple causal chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476127012444918">Pettigrew, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>I examine the contracting of three suppliers, one central producer, and one end-use buyer in the textiles manufacturing industry over the last several years. This design allows me to study contract forms and use over time within one set of embedded relationships. It also offers some variance, given more than one supplier contract is used, and thus to determine whether specific relationships of suppliers and buyers and/or their contracts make a difference. Furthermore, by including one end-buyer, I have access to outcome data (i.e., the performance effects of these contracts).</p>
<p>The kinds of contracts studied are simple sales and purchase or service contracts that involve very basic goods and service exchanges. A common feature of the exchanging goods and services involved is low technological content, suggesting that the types of transactions studied in the current work do not involve a high level of transaction-specific investments. In such a type of transactional setting, theory makes strong predictions that exchange parties do not need specific contracting strategies (i.e., incomplete contracts, strategic unenforcement) to better adapt to their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012444918">Williamson, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012444918">1985</xref>), and this helps thus to limit the number of possible explanations when legal enforcement is lacking. Although this choice has negative implications for the generalizability of this study, it reflects the current global situation in which the Chinese economy is located, that is the transition to ‘a market capitalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012444918">Boisot and Child, 1996</xref>). In addition, focusing on a state-owned enterprise’s (SOE) long-term relationships with other four firms, this study helps to develop a dyadic perspective on inter-firm relationships by giving equal attention to the viewpoints and actions of both buyer and supplier firms.</p>
<sec id="section4-1476127012444918">
<title>Setting and sample</title>
<p>In China, it is difficult to obtain access to firms, especially to find managers willing to openly speak of contract issues, considered to be business secrets. Furthermore, Chinese managers have difficulties in distinguishing bureaucratic controls from purely academic studies. Finding an appropriate sample is a common difficulty faced by researchers when they study Chinese firms. Because of this difficulty, I was not able to follow random sampling procedures to select my sample firms. Instead, I employed my personal connections to a close relative to introduce me to those who have knowledge of inter-firm contracts. Compared to other sources, such as government sponsorship or the involvement of official research institutions, this is the most effective channel to collect detailed, confidential and sensitive information on business transactions, and informants are more likely to provide honest information while facing sensitive issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012444918">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476127012444918">Table 1</xref> provides a descriptive summary of the sample firms. The sample firms are located in central China (Zhengzhou, Wuhan), eastern China (Wuxi, Qingdao), and western China’s less developed regions (Chongqing). They represent a variety of industries, ranging from machinery to the dyeing industry. Almost every type of ownership status in China was represented: state-owned, private, collective-hybrid, and joint-venture. I selected firms that varied in location, activity, and ownership to minimize the risk of taking what can be observed in a very local context as overly general.</p>

<p>Since its foundation in 1957, Yuxin has been one of the most important industrial enterprises in Zhengzhou, itself one of the most important textile industry centers in China. At the peak of its development, Yuxin had more than 10,000 employees. Like many other stated-owned enterprises in China, Yuxin underwent a complete reconstruction and lost a great part of its production capacity. At the moment when this study was conducted, Yuxin was a firm with about 4200 employees and an annual sales income of US$16 million. Yuxin’s product, mainly cotton fabric, is sold around China and abroad. As a manufacturer situated in the midstream of the textile industry chain, Yuxin has a large quantity of business partners, located in Zhengzhou, other Chinese regions, and outside the country. This facilitated my fieldwork considerably. Thanks to the help of the aforementioned relative, four of Yuxin’s business partners – including suppliers, clients, and other service providers – accepted my visit and offered full cooperation for my research. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012444918">Figure 1</xref> depicts the inter-firm relationships of the sample. Changxing and Jinhui are specialized manufacturers of the spare parts of shuttle looms and spinning machines respectively. As one of Yuxin’s biggest clients, Tianrong dyes and texturizers griege goods into fabric. Wanbao is a Sino-French joint venture. Wanbao sold 60 shuttleless looms of the latest generation for Yuxin’s new production site in 2002 and signed a maintenance service contract for 10 years. The unit of analysis is primarily the buyer–supplier relationship. Yuxin has maintained a partnership for at least 10 years with each of these four firms.</p>

<p>Although the scale of Yuxin is large (especially the advantages of staff size), the firm does not have any absolute advantages in the local area, and even the comparative advantages are not obvious as Yuxin is in an industry and market in perfect competition (there are five other textile companies with similar scales, and over 100 small and medium-sized textile companies in Zhengzhou alone). Yuxin’s suppliers also provide similar products to over 30 companies, Yuxin is simply one of them. Therefore, its suppliers do not excessively rely on Yuxin.</p>
<p>For Yuxin and other enterprises in my sample, a large percentage of their contracts (61%) are with partners that the firms have dealt with before, indicating that contractual relationships tend to be associated with prior acquaintance from recurrent social or business relations. I examined a total of 87 contracts for purchase and sales of relevant goods and services between Yuxin and its four partners. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012444918">Table 2</xref> reports selected attributes of the contracts. Most contracts in my sample were carried out during past seven years (90% of the contracts began after 2000), thus the attributes of these contracts and firms reflect recent changes in China’s transitional economy. The average duration of the contracts is about 12.5 months, but duration varies greatly across contracts, ranging from within one month (close to a spot-market transaction) to a long-term relationship of more than five years. The transaction in each contract is, on average, about 8.4% of the total sales (or purchase, or service) of the same type of products (or services) in the firm. On average, there are five contractual partners for the same product (or service) by a focal firm.</p>

<p>Ideally I would investigate the variation of contract design in my sample to better assess learning-by-doing mechanisms that may be at work; unfortunately, the policy of standardized contracts means that the structure of the contracts is quite similar over time and across parties. In fact, government regulations require that firms use formal contracts in their business dealings. In many industries, government agencies (e.g., the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China National Textile and Apparel Council [formerly the Ministry of Textile Industry]) even design standard contractual forms for the whole industry. Among the 87 contracts examined in this study, only nine are not completely standardized and ready-to-fill-in contracts.</p>
<p>Although the structure of the contracts is recycled over time for the same or similar deals, I still captured a certain contract evolution in all repeated deal activity for my sample firms and broke this information down into three levels: (1) using the standard format contract formulated by the competent authorities of the relevant industries, my sample firms only adjust the key variables, such as price, quantity, terms, and time of delivery in each deal; (2) much rarer (only under special circumstances), the contracting parties may include supplementary agreements (clauses); and (3) based on common problems encountered in practice, the competent authorities of relevant industries update the contract format periodically (every three to five years).</p>

<title>Data collection and analysis</title>
<p>To collect data, I conducted 45 in-depth, open-ended interviews in June and July 2007 within the five sampled firms. Nine interviews were eliminated for poor quality. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012444918">Table 3</xref> summarizes the main information about the remaining 36 interviews. My respondents include legal consultants and managers at various hierarchical levels, such as CEO, directors of relevant services, sales agents. All of my informants work directly with contract deals. The average age of the interviewees was 47.7 years, and their mean tenure with their companies was 11.2 years; 90% of the interviewees were men. The interviews varied in length, ranging from 45 to 200 minutes. In order to have a discussion-friendly atmosphere in which my interlocutors could speak frankly, the interview venues were chosen carefully. Four of them were carried out in the respondents’ individual offices and the rest were conducted in my hotel room. The interviews were recorded and then transcribed literally. A summary report was created for each firm. The interview language is Chinese and all transcribed material was subjected to a back-translation procedure. The quotations which follow are all comments made by the respondents.</p>

<p>I analyzed my interview data using a content coding and grounded theory building method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012444918">Yin, 2003</xref>). I began with three pilot interviews to formulate and reformulate my questions and protocols. Next, I conducted the open-ended, moderately directive interviews. The discussions were guided by several themes on formal contracts such as contractual negotiations, contract draft, contract execution, contractual enforcement, and problem-solving. The questions are listed in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1476127012444918">Appendix 1</xref>. If an informant spoke only in an abstract manner about a question, I stressed accuracy in reporting and used nondirective items to probe sensitive issues such as ‘I would like to learn more about that,’ ‘I am interested in details like that,’ or ‘Could you give me an example to explain that?’ Progressively, all my informants were systematically asked to deliver their detailed personal experiences to support and justify their points of view. This type of narrative interview has the advantage of revealing more information than the traditional question-and-answer strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012444918">Yin, 2003</xref>). While retelling an event, the narrator observes a number of chronological and structural elements, which can be seen as the principles of arranging and classifying statements and accounts. This allows the analyst to later build on these themes. Furthermore, this narrative approach, because it carefully reiterates the data with the respondent, helps build trust and understanding between the interviewer and interviewee, something quite important in the Chinese context.</p>
<p>In the second stage of analysis, I integrated and classified the findings from the first phase described above to address how informants’ contract-related views emerge from and influence events throughout their exchange activity. Sometimes I discovered an obvious incoherence or even contradiction in my informants’ comments. This constituted a major challenge but also served as an analytical guide for this research. Discovering a united logic behind these contradictory comments is the key task for the success of this study. Meanwhile, when describing and conceptualizing related key concepts such as contract, opportunism, problem-solving, bargaining, trust, and <italic>guanxi</italic>, my informants invoked another important concept – reciprocity. As I document below, reciprocity is an indispensable element to understand complementary relationships between formal contracts and relational governance. In this step of the analysis, I used standard cross-case analysis techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012444918">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>) to look for patterns and revisited the data often, using charts and tables to facilitate comparisons between different views.</p>
<p>The third stage of analysis was aimed at shedding light on an inherent link among the different concepts involved, allowing to develop a theoretical explanation of the interplay between formal contracts and relational governance. In phase three, I formed an organized interpretation of the data to understand how the presence or absence of contracts influenced the unfolding of the inter-firm relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012444918">Shah and Corley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012444918">Yin, 2003</xref>). A working framework was developed based on extant theory. I then sought to read the data in light of my working framework, and vice versa. As I progressed, I refashioned my working framework by retaining and revising expectations from the literature, removing some and adding others. In this stage, I also did a formal analysis of the data, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476127012444918">Table 4</xref>, which indicates the frequency and weighting of data across cases and how well my framework was rooted in the data source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012444918">Miles and Huberman, 1984</xref>). This analysis, however, like all data reduction methods, cannot display the full richness of the data.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>My findings are organized around three sets of topics: contract use and enforcement, reciprocity as enforcement, and benchmarking across contracts. Within each set of topic areas, I discuss the nuances of contract evolution, especially the formal and relational governance side of the contract.</p>
<sec id="section7-1476127012444918">
<title>Contract use</title>
<p>The traditional view arguing that there is a lack of contractual consciousness among Chinese business people was immediately contradicted by the data that I collected. Interviewees made several comments that made it clear that they were aware of contracts and contracts were something they thought about. ‘A contract is a reference for a deal,’ said a senior manager; ‘if I buy something without a contract, I have to accept the products even if they don’t meet my needs, because I don’t have any reference to defend my rights. A contract is a written reference.’ Terms such as ‘reference,’ ‘right,’ and ‘restraint’ appeared so systematically that it was difficult to believe that my interlocutors did not treat formal contracts seriously. This contrasts sharply with some studies arguing that the Chinese business community has no contract spirit.</p>
<p>An examination of selected core provisions in the sample contracts showed that formal, written contracts cover a high percentage (more than 90%, and reaching 99% for price) of each provision (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012444918">Figure 2</xref>). This is in accordance with the conclusion of some Chinese economics historians and the observation of some organization theorists. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012444918">Zelin et al. (2004</xref>: 2) were quite explicit in arguing that contract is ‘a central part of Chinese lifeways.’</p>

<sec id="section8-1476127012444918">
<title>Contract enforcement</title>
<p>While contracts were used extensively, there was little evidence that interviewees thought they would be enforced. ‘If you rely on justice, you get nothing. Judicial institutions do nothing but shirk their responsibilities for two or three years. You can do nothing,’ a manager said. A sales agent said: ‘If someone doesn’t want to pay you at all, it is useless to speak of contracts.’ Zhou and his colleagues reported similar remarks from a manager in a state-owned firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012444918">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). In China, contracts may sometimes be enforced, but enforcement may occur in a biased way. Courts may be biased in favor of certain categories of firms such as SOEs, or may just be corrupt (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012444918">Mui, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of legal contract enforcement actions in the sample was 11. This means only 13% of the total contracts were fully executed (no disputes on any provision). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012444918">Table 5</xref> provides more detailed information about contract enforcement in the sample. Apart from the very low contract enforcement rates in general, it is not difficult to notice the fact that contract non-compliance occurs in all categories of provisions. If, the quality-related provisions, difficult to be quantified and verified, are most likely to provoke disputes, the rates of contractual clauses concerning price and volume could be expected to be high. However, this is not the case, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012444918">Table 5</xref>. In fact, there were still a certain number of disputes on price and volume. Why would contract parties have differences on something that is expected to be clear, certain?</p>

<p>All interviewees emphasized the need to ‘understand things relatively.’ For some, the importance of the role of contracts in reality should be understood with moderation. ‘For me, a contract is a weak restraint, a symbolic one for the two contract parties,’ a manager said; ‘I’d say that contracts are little more than a formal restraint. In practice, they are far from being as strict as we think they should be,’ another said. The tone of still others changed completely when speaking in the abstract. ‘As I mentioned earlier, there are no regulations in China, so we can by no means treat formal contracts seriously.’ The words of certain interlocutors were more radical: ‘In China, a contract doesn’t have any authority,’ a manager related forcefully.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1476127012444918">
<title>Reciprocal method of dispute resolution</title>
<p>How, then, are disputes resolved if contracts are used but not enforced? Dispute resolution is often informal and involves a variety of principles. ‘Although we have very clear clauses, contracts are not respected in practice. We should not be so meticulous. If some important principles are not violated, it is not so bad.’ In fact, what concerns my interlocutors is not the confrontation destined to get justice at all, but <italic>real resolutions that go beyond a contract itself.</italic> Concerning inter-firm cooperation: ‘it’s like our life, there are ups and downs. This is not a concern for me because through discussion all goes well,’ said a salesman at Changxing, appearing very optimistic. The point is the strength in the relationship. He related this to me in his delicate handling of a complaint from Yuxin, described below:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Make a gesture to strengthen the relationship</italic></p>
<p>Once, a client [Yuxin] complained about the poor quality of our products [shuttles]. We have a long history of cooperation. How to deal with this problem? I have 100% confidence in the quality of our products. First of all, we should find out what had happened and clarify the responsibility. If it’s mine, I’ll take back all the goods and exchange them. Our sales contract was very clear on this. If it is not mine, things will be different. It was their responsibility in the end. In fact, it was due to the failure of the maintenance service that the parts were quickly put out of service. According to our contract, all damage would be paid by the buyer. But we decided to change all the parts in question. Why? Because I’m focusing on our long-term relationship. If I had revealed the truth, the ‘real culprits’ would have received serious sanctions. You cannot imagine, more than 50 looms were damaged. In this case, they would have expressed strong discontent to <italic>me</italic>, whereas I work with them and not (directly) with their bosses. If I act according to our contract by putting them in a very embarrassing situation, it will be difficult for me to face them in the future. Our relationship will be broken. Instead, if I accept willingly the responsibility that is not mine, those who were really responsible will have a very strong sense of recognition, because they owe me something. This context is very favorable for strengthening our relationship. Thus, communication will become easier. We will improve considerably our mutual understanding. This emotional attachment means more orders and more loyalty. Our destinies are linked more closely.’</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this case, the contractual deviation is not any non-execution of what the contract requires, but involves, rather, <italic>doing what the contract does NOT require</italic>. The action of this salesman runs great risks: not only did he suffer direct and immediate financial losses (caused by the product recall) for his firm, but also his commitment not to reveal the truth might seriously sully the reputation of his firm and its products. Certainly he expected a return, but nothing could guarantee that he would actually get it. Of course one can assume that there were <italic>tacit agreements</italic>, but they cannot be invoked in a court in case of non-enforcement. In fact, the rationales for this manager’s conduct could be paraphrased as ‘we were in a long-term relationship and the event was only one episode in it.’ The conduct taken helped to link more closely the futures of the parties concerned and created in one who perceived another as conciliatory the feeling that he owed something to his partner. This conduct met the expectation of the partner, who might have broken the bilateral business relationship if it had not been adopted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, hiding information raises ethical considerations. One might wonder whether some form of ‘corrupt’ arrangement has happened here. Is it possible that this manager received some benefit (monetary or otherwise) from Yuxin? When replying to my doubt in this regard, expressed very delicately, this salesman seemed very calm. ‘I know what you want to know. Did I get money or some benefit as return? My answer is No, whether you believe or not.’ He explained:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You [i.e. author]’re too naive if you think that the chiefs were not aware of the whole thing. For my part, my boss had already understood the problem and approved my plan even before I left. When I was in Zhengzhou, I often called my boss. Who would have dared do that without his approval? After all, it was a loss of more than 20,000 RMB yuan. In Yuxin, it was the same situation. More than 50 looms broken! What did that mean? A huge loss that is difficult to imagine. They could not bear that alone. So they needed me to share part of the responsibility and loss. If my shuttles had had problems, they would have requested compensation for their damage. Why didn’t they do that? The chiefs of Yuxin knew that there weren’t any problems with our – as I said Yuxin is an old client – but opened one eye, closed another.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This version of things was confirmed by some informants from Yuxin. The comment of a Yuxin senior executive about this event was quite positive: ‘they made a gesture and we appreciate it. We are all focusing on the long-term relationship. We like partners like them.’ Yuxin and Changxing’s method of dispute settlement is not contractual, but respects a principle of reciprocity. As an expatriate manager from Hong Kong commented, by reciprocating two parties can solve any dispute:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the case of a dispute we must be sincere and honest; we must act with good faith. [In this case] the other party does the same: if you yield me a <italic>chi</italic>, I will refund you one <italic>zhang</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1476127012444918">1</xref></sup> One should not count, compare the profit and loss at each moment, each time. Things often go in the opposite direction as desired: if you’re willing to lose, you finally lose nothing, but if you only seek to win, you earn nothing. If the relationship develops with such a spirit, there is nothing difficult; we can solve all problems . . .</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Certainly, if agents act in such a way, anything can be discussed as if they had never signed a contract. But how to ensure that ‘good faith’ or ‘good will’ will be understood as such by another party still poses a problem. Presented with this question, all my respondents, thinking that it reveals mainly an issue of partners’ ‘personal quality’ and anchoring their hope on ‘good luck,’ failed to give a clear answer. To assess the mechanisms that may be at play, it is necessary to examine more dispute settlements.</p>

<title>Almost broken relationships</title>
<p>Sometimes understandings are not simple episodes that can be easily ignored. These require more in-depth resolution. A Yuxin sales manger told me that Yuxin came very close to ending its partnership with Tianrong because of ‘a serious misunderstanding.’</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>A serious misunderstanding</italic></p>
<p>In December 2005, we [Yuxin] received a purchase order of 400,000 pieces of denim from Tianrong. All major provisions [price, quality, deadline, etc.] were fixed over the telephone. Tianrong told us that this order was an ‘urgent one’ and very important for its survival. They asked us to ensure the delivery and quality. Tianrong is an old client, so we immediately started the production without thinking too much [about contractual issues]. As usually, Tianrong would pay no later than one week after the last delivery and arrange shipment. This is almost a tacit agreement. At that time, Tianrong had some difficulties and solicited aid with regard to shipment. Considering our long history of cooperation, we agreed to ship the articles by our own means. After the first two deliveries, we asked Tianrong to ship the rest of goods by itself. However, Tianrong would not take over the shipment and again made a request regarding shipment. We gave a positive response and meanwhile asked them to pay for the articles already delivered because of cash flow needs. Tianrong refused our request and threatened to cancel the order, blaming us for ‘exploiting its helpless situation’ and ‘not understanding the give-and-take needed in business.’ Of course we thought that Tianrong’s reaction was unacceptable and its accusations were completely unfounded. Thus, we decided to suspend the rest of deliveries. Fortunately, after difficult talks, both sides finally reached a compromise: Tianrong paid for the articles already delivered and the shipment fees for the rest of the deliveries; Tianrong accepted to pay for the rest of articles no later than one week after the delivery; we continued to arrange shipment and didn’t charge Tianrong the shipment fees for the first two deliveries. Finally, at our request both parties also decided to sign a formal contract to formalize all these provisions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All those who had participated in this dispute settlement attributed this crisis to ‘a deep misunderstanding.’ However, why could this ‘misunderstanding’ emerge between two partners with ‘a long history of cooperation’ and strong mutual trust? In response to this question, this sales manager gave his explanation:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[This is due to the fact that] many things are not clear. Despite all our efforts to think of others, despite the fact that we’ve done so many good things, we were still accused of ‘exploiting its helpless situation’ and ‘not understanding the give-and-take needed in business.’ Where is the justice? Our request was not a ransom. They thought that they were an old client, so it was our obligation to do what they had requested. In their eyes, it was by no means a favor. The key issue is that some important things were not explicit so that our legitimate request for payment was considered as something blameworthy. This experience tells me that we cannot boldly presume that others are fully aware of what we think they should be. Everything must be written down in black and white.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is not difficult to notice this sales manager’s regret about not fixing all important provisions in a formal contract. For him this dispute was completely avoidable. On the other side, does Tianrong share this opinion? As one of the witnesses to the event, Tianrong’s purchasing director also expressed his complaints while talking about this crisis:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In this story, no one is completely innocent. What we could not understand or accept is why they asked us to pay just after we had made the request for shipment. They could have done that earlier or later. But why at that moment? In fact, we used to pay after the totality of goods was delivered. Furthermore this order was very important, almost a matter of life and death. It was a critical moment. A real friend would never do that. Of course, this has afterwards proved to be a misunderstanding. But at that time things were happening like this in our mind. Moreover, this was a big order and we gave them a very good price.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What should merit particular attention in this director’s remarks is that although thinking that the request for payment was made by Yuxin at ‘the wrong time,’ Tianrong had no exact idea about what constitutes ‘a good time.’ At this point, the purchasing director failed to deliver a more precise explanation other than ‘earlier or later.’ Unlike the sales manager of Yuxin, who attributed the dispute to the absence of formalized provisions, Tianrong’s purchasing director pointed out that the fundamental cause of this misunderstanding was ‘lack of tacit convention.’ However, he agreed that a clear contract is the most efficient solution before ‘tacit convention’ can be formed.</p>
<p>The testimony of both sides indicates that even between exchanging parties who are acquainted with each other, non-contractualized provisions could still cause costly misunderstandings. Thus, to a great extent a well-drafted contract can avoid such disputes. Some informants reported that similar episodes had also arisen several times after that one, but thanks to clearly formalized provisions all problems have been dealt with appropriately in the end. For example, Tianrong itself proposed to advance payment to get an earlier delivery in exchange.</p>
<p>Another facet of the problem is the great importance attached by my respondents to the principle of reciprocity. What directly caused Yuxin to suspend the delivery of goods was not Tianrong’s refusal of payment or threat to cancel the order. In fact, the real reason was that Tianrong blamed Yuxin for not acting reciprocally. To some extent, this can be considered as denying the trustworthiness of Yuxin. On the other hand, although Yuxin was completely blameless, it still made some concessions (not charging Tianrong part of the shipping fees). By dong so, Yuxin emitted a strong signal that it strictly fulfills the principle of reciprocity and thus is a trustworthy firm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1476127012444918">
<title>The contract as a benchmark</title>
<p>What then is the use of a contract or of the relationship between two parties if serious violations can still go unchecked? In the above case, the two sides were both ready to make concessions. However, under no circumstances should such a gesture be regarded by the other party as a kind of weakness. For a compromise not to be seen as weakness, it is not enough to be generous. On the contrary, both exchange parties should always be in an equal exchange. Thus, the compromise should not go unreciprocated. That is why beginning by clarifying the liability was absolutely necessary in the first story, even if this had no effective impact on the strategy of the Changxing manager. For the same reason, Yuxin asked Tianrong to pay after having offered to the latter help with shipping. To quote Yuxin’s manager, the payment request was not a ‘ransom.’ The reason why Yuxin made such a request was just because denim was not its primary product and to produce such a big quantity of the material Yuxin had made a great effort in many aspects, generating huge cash flow needs. After a period of three months, Yuxin hoped to receive some payment to meet its needs.</p>
<p>In the first story, forced not to formally reveal what actually happened so as to avoid putting the real culprits in an ‘embarrassing situation,’ Changxing’s manager could only rely on the conscience of his counterparts to reach his goal. In the second example, Yuxin was in a similar situation when it accepted to help Tianrong. These actions would not be possible without an almost blind belief in the fact that others respect the rules of the game: reciprocity and a full awareness of the social costs caused by not fulfilling this principle.</p>
<p>If, for Yuxin’s part, the awareness of reciprocating as the principle of action poses no problem, it nonetheless does make it more difficult for the company to recognize its moral, rather than monetary debt. What finally pushed Yuxin to perceive and appreciate the message of kindness that this manager intentionally tried to send? Having one’s rightful responsibility usurped by another and then having him bear the consequences will elicit in the victim a strong feeling of guilt. It was precisely this guilt felt by his partners (the real culprits) that the Changxing manager anticipated by making such a gesture. This shares some common characteristics with the notion of ‘overwhelming benefactions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012444918">Blau, 1964</xref>). One can claim a position of superiority by bestowing excessive benefactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012444918">Blau, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012444918">Homans, 1961</xref>). Certainly, it is not completely impossible that this manager may covet the power to extract benefits in the form of tribute from his partner. But establishing such a position of superiority is far from being easy. So the purpose of the gesture by the Changxing manager is to invite further transactions in expanding exchange relations of mutual trust.</p>
<p>However, to attain this goal two conditions had to be met: (1) the responsibility of each had to be clarified; and (2) the responsible party had to be fully aware of the consequences he would normally bear. These conditions would have been difficult to fulfill if the contract had not been accurate. In fact, in the sales contract a clause clearly stated that the buyer was responsible for <italic>any abnormal deterioration of product quality and all damage caused by misuse or improper use, negligence, incorrect storage condition or poor maintenance.</italic> If the contract had been ambiguous or unclear, this agent would have been in a difficult situation. Certainly, this does not mean he was necessarily compelled to assume full or partial responsibility and bear all the cost. But his gesture of goodwill would have probably lost much of its value because it would have risked being seen as no more than what he should have done.</p>
<p>A detailed and thorough contract, while not offering ironclad proof of honest intent, does provide a <italic>benchmark against which one can evaluate one’s actions and those of others.</italic> Without such a contract, it would be difficult for reciprocity to work in a positive manner, as the second case illustrated. In the dispute between Tianrong and Yuxin the flashpoint was Tianrong’s refusal of Yuxin’s request for payment. In the eyes of Yuxin, Tianrong should on no condition refuse its request because it was only a small return for what had been done: exceptionally quick mobilization in response to the urgency of the order; significant help in shipment, and so forth. For Tianrong, however, the payment request was totally unjustified. First of all, it was a big order and the price was very good, suggesting implicitly that Yuxin should be grateful to Tianrong. Second, in previous deals Tianrong always paid after the total goods were delivered, implying that here there was no need for there to be any change in the terms of payment. Lastly, Tianrong stressed the importance of the deal. This amounts to the message: as an old partner, Yuxin should be exceptionally accommodating and helpful, thus arranging shipment was an ordinary supportive gesture and should under no condition be considered a bargaining chip.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1476127012444918">
<title>Contract evolution</title>
<p>As the exchange between parties increased and more history became embedded in the contracting relationships, the contracts themselves evolved, reflecting some of that change. Using the coding protocol discussed above in the Methods section I identifed some of the changes in the Textile Machinery Parts/Accessory Purchasing Contract used by Yuxin.</p>
<p>Although most of these changes were effected by industrial authorities, it is possible to notice that the principle of reciprocity has been strengthened in these changes. First, this was realized through revised clauses encouraging inter-organizational contact and interaction. For example, as far as the terms of quality requirements and technical standards are concerned, the old version preferred a codified form without being concerned whether prescribed technical parameters (in fact, the manufacturing technical standards comply with industrial ones) adapt well to the reality in local contexts. The new version adopted the term of design, recognizing largely the legal validity of individual firms’ standards. It also encouraged contracting parties to use sample models as the reference of standards. Therefore, not relying on lifeless figures to evaluate the quality of products exclusively, the contract parties would intensify their contact to be better understood. Thus, these changes help to create more opportunities to reciprocate by promoting the interactions between contract parties.</p>
<p>Second, contractual completeness has been increased. In this regard, the terms of receiving and acceptance are highly illustrative. In the old version, little was said about transportation and delivery locations. Therefore, once contracting parties signed the contract without clear consensus on these issues and had to tackle them as they emerged by the end of the transaction, disputes would be inevitable because of the lack of unambiguous reference. Things have been said much more clearly and concretely in the new version: each party has different rights and obligations as the delivery locations change. Stipulations on different circumstances not only increase the contract’s operationality but more importantly guide contract parties to carry out more discussions on these issues and conclude a final agreement. Thus, clear references, used by both parties to judge one’s own and the other’s behaviors, help to decrease potential disputes even though such clauses are not executed.</p>
<p>Apart from major issues, some important provisions were also perfected or added to adapt to new situations. For example, with more and more disputes concerning a product’s intellectual property, new clauses were added to make things much clearer: ‘The ownership / Patent right / copyright and other Intellectual property belong to party A’; ‘Both parties should not confide the commercial information to a third Party in oral / hand writing / notifying and lending.’</p>
<p>To a limited extent, contract parties added supplementary clauses based on their various prior interactions. For example, in order to avoid disputes about shipping issues Yuxin has urged a clearer and more concrete clause: ‘Transportation arrangement is the responsibility of party A/B, and the supplier of transportation to the designated place: party A location, transport costs by party A/B.’ Similar efforts also can be seen in the terms of Price and payment: ‘Advanced payment . . . % within one week after contract signing, the balance within 30 days after sample confirmation against invoice.’ Like others, these changes in the relevant provisions illustrate how the formal contract evolved with the governance/reciprocal relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1476127012444918">
<title>Overall increasing contract formalization</title>
<p>It seems plausible to make a prediction that the more contracts are accurate and detailed, the better exchange parties are aware of ‘who owes how much to whom’ and therefore fewer business relationships will be marked by a climate of conflict. This prediction can be directly borne out by some of the remarks of my informants. For example, many admitted that some ‘simple disputes [e.g., concerning payment, methods of delivery]’ decreased considerably as contracts became ‘more detailed.’ More importantly, most of my interlocutors expressed the wish for contracts to become ‘more and more clear and complete with less and less ambiguity.’</p>
<p>This should logically have implications for formal contracting: a firm’s contracts are more detailed when it engages in repeated deals whether with the same or different partners. However, by examining sample contracts <italic>I found little empirical evidence supporting this idea in practice.</italic> For example, Yuxin and Changxing have used the same sales/purchasing contract (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1476127012444918">Appendix 2</xref>) since 2003 without including what they have learned from different contractual disputes (including also those that have occurred between them and other partners). In fact, the contractual completeness has not increased on a steady basis due to prior deals, but only periodically at the initiative of competent authorities.</p>
<p>The incoherence between this theoretical assumption and formal contracting practice can be explained in two ways: (1) an overall incompatible view on the relationship between contract and trust; and (2) the policy of standardization of contractual forms.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1476127012444918">Table 6</xref> summarizes my interviewees’ beliefs concerning the contract/trust relationship. Most of my respondents consider that there exists a link between contract content and trust and that this link is strong. A manager said: ‘If we have mutual trust, we don’t need to write down anything concrete. Otherwise, contracts must be carefully drafted and many details will be discussed.’ Inevitably, using detailed explicit contracts evokes a universe of mistrust. A manager explained:</p>

<disp-quote>
<p>Anyway, [concerning the drafting of contracts] the model is the same for everyone: some contract models are sent to me to be signed, and they are designed, I would say, for a transaction between two thieves: one can feel a strong distrust behind every word.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This echoes sharply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012444918">Macaulay (1963</xref>: 64), who argues that the use of contracts and contract law may be counterproductive. However, other considerations came into play when this manager continued:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is not a problem of trust; it has nothing to do with that. It is merely a problem of formality. Everyone does this [i.e., sign standard contracts]. We are not a family workshop, but a modern company. So we should sign contracts [in business]. That’s all. Anyway, I don’t cheat. In fact, I never try to cheat. So I don’t care about signing a contract.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Similar remarks can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012444918">Zhou et al. (2003</xref>: 91). The comments of this manager and other respondents (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1476127012444918">Table 6</xref>) reflect the norms and expectations developed in the Chinese institutional environment. That’s why the existence of such a link between contract content and trust does not seem to inspire any observable practices. Another manager related: ‘In general, when it is the same type of deal, we always use the same standardized and ready-to-fill-in contracts, regardless of the client.’ A sales agent said: ‘Standardized and detailed contracts we use for everyone. We don’t accept other contract forms.’ Of course, ‘if there are special things, we add exceptional clauses.’ However, continued a senior manager, ‘this is extremely rare; I have not had a lot in my career.’ This is because, as a legal consultant explained, ‘in practice, the official version is fairly complete.’ The same policy of standardization of contractual forms has been reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012444918">Zhou et al. (2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although some of my respondents think that the degree of mutual trust has no implications for contractual design, it is not difficult to notice among them a general hesitancy in using contract design to regulate repeated exchange relationships. Thus, Chinese managers are not motivated to craft customized contracts, allowing them to take into account prior experiences in formal contracting. On the other hand, the standardization policy of contract drafting limits considerably the level of discretion managers do enjoy in drafting contracts.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to explore the role played by formal contracts in repeated relationships under conditions of weak legal enforcement. In contrast to the prevailing assumption that formal contracts are ineffective or irrelevant in repeated interactions in transitional economies characterized by weak legal enforcement and a long-standing tradition of using personal ties to conduct business, my analysis revealed a more complex pattern. Formal contracts are widely used by the Chinese firms in their repeated exchanges. Moreover, Chinese managers do attach great importance to formal contracts despite their ineffectiveness as external enforcement devices. This study has also explored the underlying causes for this puzzle and argues that formal contracts serve as important benchmarks for reciprocity, which is a fundamental relational governance mechanism in the Chinese context.</p>
<p>In the discussion that follows, I examine the implications of the current work relative to the present state of understanding on this topic for developing a broader theory of interplay between formal contracts and relational governance. I also discuss some limitations and offer a set of concluding statements for future research and practice on contracting in this context.</p>
<sec id="section15-1476127012444918">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>According to conventional wisdom both in economics and management literature, formal contracts, as a coordination device, help assure compliance to acceptable boundaries of behavior, particularly in complex transactions exhibiting more moral hazard problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012444918">Mayer and Argyles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012444918">Williamson, 1991</xref>). Yet, examining the details of my results raises some issues that are not neatly explained by this rationale. Let me elaborate.</p>
<p>I find that Chinese managers do not believe in the legal effectiveness of formal contracts, despite significant improvements in the judicial system in recent years. This has implications for the way Chinese managers perceive formal contracts: they generally despair of having all contractual provisions executed, thus their expectations, changing frequently, are not expressed through contractual terms. In this regard, the alignment of expectations does not offer appropriate explanation for the use of formal contracts in China. Meanwhile, I find that Chinese managers’ expectations do not correspond to a strict compliance with the contractual clauses linking them. This indicates that the primordial goal of the governance of inter-firm collaboration is not to avoid as far as possible contractual noncompliance or violation. From this point of view, the underlying logic of the use of formal contracts in China departs from the incentive alignment rationale. Therefore, the investigation of the role played by formal contracts should take into account the specificity of local institutions and its impact on how economic agents perceive contracts. Care must be taken in making broad generalizations about complementarity or substitutability from studies conducted exclusively in strong legal enforcement contexts.</p>
<p>My finding that Chinese managers consider reciprocating as the primordial principle to fulfill in business exchange raises the issue of how the frame of contracts helps develop the idea of reciprocity and trust. In prior literature on the interplay of formal contracts and relational governance, few contributions have considered the way various collective norms can be established on the basis of mutual self-fulfilling expectations about the behaviors of others. In the current work, I seek to reconstruct some social dimensions of a contract and demonstrate evidence of the existence of <italic>guanxi</italic>, which is more complicated than trust, specific to Chinese people. Most prior empirical and theoretical work on <italic>guanxi</italic> (or more broadly on network) couches it as a self-enforcing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476127012444918">Fan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012444918">Peng and Luo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012444918">Tung and Worm, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012444918">Xin and Pearce, 1996</xref>). However, this study suggests that <italic>guanxi</italic> should not be reduced to special personal connections nourished by material interest, of which the building, developing, and declining of processes have largely remained opaque in prior research. The results of this study allow us to catch a glimpse of the analytical framework of the <italic>guanxi</italic> system in business exchanges. The <italic>guanxi</italic> system is substantially the social debt relationship between the contracting parties that is partially or temporarily unbalanced, but is generally or in the long-term balanced. The partial or temporary imbalance is the necessary condition, because the reciprocity mechanism can be launched only in this way; while the general or long-term balance is the objective of developing the <italic>guanxi</italic>, and is also the final basis for judging whether a business partner is a reciprocal one or not. In fact, there appears to be an association of formalizing contracts with strengthening <italic>guanxi</italic> for those involved in the contract, plus the willingness of parties to forgo some enforcement as a sign of <italic>guanxi</italic>.</p>
<p>Based on careful observations and analysis of dispute-resolution processes among my sample firms, this study sheds light on why firms may not accurately assess whether their partners are reciprocal, even after observing behavior such as information sharing or compromising. In fact, communication may hold different meanings for different parties: one side may view information sharing or compromising as showing goodwill, while the other views these activities as repaying social debts generated in prior interactions. Repeated cooperation supposes bilateral trust continually strengthened; while trust is based on the quality of reciprocity. Only by showing the reciprocal quality, can an individual be trusted by Chinese people and trust increases with the level of reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012444918">Yang, 1957</xref>). This can also be applied to inter-organizational relationships.</p>
<p>The occurrence of unbalanced debt and the switch between the debt payment and indebtedness once again all need a standard to measure whether the behaviors of contracting parties are below, in line with, or above the rights and obligations stipulated in a contract; otherwise, both parties will determine the nature of their behaviors completely based on their subjective opinions. In this sense, I suggest that customized contracts help to narrow the domain around which parties view contract deviation as non-reciprocal. A direct implication of this rationale is that contractual completeness may increase the outcome of repeated relationships by making positive reciprocity occur more easily and thereby improving mutual trust in the <italic>guanxi</italic> system. As the contracts in the sample evolved the serious disputes similar to that described in ‘A serious misunderstanding’ decrease. However, customized contracts do not guarantee contract enforcement and contractual completeness may not improve the intent of contractual compliance. The present theoretical debate over the relationship between formal and relational governance should embody this singular effect, namely the benchmark mechanism.</p>
<p>To the extent that both could help delineate contracting parties’ expectations, the benchmark mechanism may appear similar to the learning-by-doing rationale. Yet, some fundamental differences between these two mechanisms should be highlighted. First, the learning-by-doing rationale focuses more on <italic>ex post</italic>: its essential purpose is to adjust the cooperative relationship, while, in the benchmark mechanism, a contract is not for the purpose of execution: it neither results in effective protection, nor helps the two parties understand the actual expectations of each other. Accordingly, the effectiveness of a contract is measured by its capacity of underlying positive reciprocity. Contractual enforceability is not taken into account as a determinant for an ‘effective contract’; while the learning-by-doing rationale focuses more on <italic>ex ante</italic>: it aims at promoting both parties to reach a common understanding on a certain deal, and thus effective contracts refer to those that can better align the expectations of contract parties so that the disputes caused by non-compliance can be avoided as far as possible. In other words, the core criterion for the effectiveness of a contract is its enforceability. Second, in the benchmark mechanism, both parties have a full understanding that the expectations expressed through the contract will not be implemented strictly; but according to the learning-by-doing rationale, the expectations confirmed by the contract are the end outcome of the bargaining of both parties, and they will be executed strictly. Finally, in the benchmark mechanism, even if the contract is not implemented, the contract still impacts the relationship development between the two parties (except when the relationship is terminated); while the learning-by-doing rationale predicts that once the contract is breached, the contract loses influence on the relationship between the two parties (or the contract is replaced by the new one, or it leads to the termination of the relationship). All these differences should lead to more theoretical subtleties that require further research.</p>
<p>The benchmark mechanism may contradict the argument on contractual incompleteness developed by TCE. It is necessary to shed light on this issue. According to the TCE theory, incomplete contracts allow for greater flexibility during the contract execution, which helps contracting parties adapt to the changing situations. The flexibility is substantially the flexibility of re-contracting. This mechanism has implications, especially for complicated and uncertain transactions: noncompliant behaviors are more commonly the strategic choices made jointly by two parties. According to the benchmark mechanism, complete contracts could also create more flexibility. However, this flexibility refers to the flexibility of the behaviors during the contract execution: a more complete contract allows more behaviors to be easily measured in order to specify the respective involvement of social debt by the contracting parties. From this perspective, the action space of the contracting parties will increase as the contract becomes more detailed (more importantly, parties do not need to worry that their kindness may not be acknowledged).</p>
<p>Inevitably, the benchmark mechanism may push parties to violate contracts more easily when unpredictable events occur. This suggests that care must be taken in making broad generalities about complementarity or substitutability from empirical results under the traditional wisdom that relational governance is always constructive for contract execution. However, noncompliance creates the opportunity to launch reciprocity by creating an unbalanced debt situation. When both parties have equivalent bargaining power, the aggrieved one would accept noncompliance that solely benefited the breaching party in consideration of the bilateral long-term cooperative relationship (namely, either for forming the creditor’s rights or for repaying the debt). Of course, noncompliance itself does not facilitate the cooperative relationship, because it depends on whether it can effectively launch the positive reciprocating movement.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Naturally, there are important limitations to my work and some of them offer great potential for further research. First, because most of the sample contracts examined are standardized and ready-to-fill-in, contract terms received little attention from the analysis, thereby there was no sufficient empirical evidence supporting the benchmark mechanism. This could be an important weakness that should be overcome in future research. Furthermore, although simple and certain transactions correspond to the current features of the Chinese economy, they seriously limit the applicability of my argument about the interplay of contractual design and relationship performance. In fact, my proposition would hold if complete and detailed formal contracts could be stipulated from the beginning – which is likely to be the case only for very basic or simple contracts. For more complex and uncertain transactions, on the contrary, the possibility of writing formal contracts that are complete and detailed might be the final outcome of repeated interactions between the parties involved in those transactions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1476127012444918">2</xref></sup> For a variety of reasons, sample selection might also be an issue here, in the sense that I focus on a state-owned enterprise and its repeated buyer–supplier relationships. Although some of this selectivity works in my favor, I acknowledge that the degree to which the findings are generalizable to a broader sample may be impacted by some element of sample selection that has not yet considered.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a preliminary exploration that provides both descriptive facts and more structural analysis, I believe this study complements existing theory and suggests some promising directions for its extension. Hopefully, my analysis will lead to a better understanding of how firms can more effectively coordinate, and, ultimately, of the role of contracts in economic exchange. Future research is needed to test the theoretical propositions in more similar institutional and cultural contexts, improve the research methods, identify relevant analytical variables, and overcome the various weaknesses of this study.</p>
