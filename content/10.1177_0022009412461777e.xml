<p>Among the rogues’ gallery of twentieth-century despotisms, Mussolini’s Italy has long been deemed a relatively benign case, a form of totalitarianism ‘lite’. For Hannah Arendt, fascism was ‘just an ordinary nationalist dictatorship’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009412461777e">1</xref></sup> it was much less successful than Nazism and Bolshevism in dominating state institutions, penetrating the psyches of its citizens, or carrying out a revolutionary transformation of society. These failures have variously been ascribed to the weakness of the Italian state, the dominant influence of the Catholic Church, or even the indomitability of the national character. Similarly, the repressive aspects of fascism tend to be overlooked, since there is no obvious Italian analog to Auschwitz or the Great Purges. The absence of a massive atrocity has been used by some to exculpate the Duce, or at least to compare him favorably with Hitler and Stalin; witness Silvio Berlusconi’s infamous claim that ‘Mussolini never killed anyone … he sent people on holiday in exile.’</p>
<p>In this important new book, Michael Ebner places the story of fascist repression under greater scrutiny. The ‘extraordinary’ violence of the twentieth century has perhaps inured many readers to the less dramatic, but no less real, experience of ‘ordinary’ violence under a dictatorship. As Ebner skillfully shows, terror – both psychological and physical – pervaded Mussolini’s Italy. Arbitrary arrest and torture, public beatings and humiliations, intimidation and corruption were ubiquitous and inescapable realities of life across the peninsula. While these coercive measures may have produced a low body count, they nonetheless ruined many lives: careers were destroyed, families torn apart and individuals driven to illness and suicide. Whereas the Nazis and Soviets tended to mete out punishment on a collective level, the fascists deployed a ‘personalized, carefully calibrated deployment of state violence’ (13). Initially, this was directed against communists, socialists and other anti-fascists. Ebner gives particular attention to the practice of <italic>confino</italic>, whereby subversives were exiled to desolate islands and remote villages in southern Italy (most famously described in Carlo Levi’s <italic>Christ Stopped at Eboli</italic>). Far from the ‘holiday’ described by Berlusconi, life in <italic>confino</italic> was harsh; for example, the colony on the island of Ventotene lacked electricity and running water and had only one toilet for 130 inmates. Beatings, interrogations and other abuses were commonplace. As Ebner shows, such mechanisms of repression existed in a legal ‘gray zone’: the fascist regime created a broad, ambiguously defined set of punitive measures which were then applied spontaneously and abusively at the local level, often to settle private rivalries and disputes.</p>
<p>Terror was not just a means of eliminating political opposition. It was part of the very DNA of Fascist ideology, from the ‘punitive missions’ of the early <italic>squadristi</italic> to brutal ‘pacification’ campaigns in northern and eastern Africa to Mussolini’s disastrous misadventures during the Second World War. Violence was conceived as ‘a highly flexible tool of coercive political pedagogy, through which the regime communicated its priorities and expectations to the Italian people’ (172). It was used not only to intimidate, but to encourage regular Italians to enact fascist virtues of discipline and hierarchy themselves, by reporting on a ‘grumbler’, denouncing a woman of ill repute, or simply accusing someone of wearing a red tie. In many instances, personal and social ‘crimes’ were transposed into the political arena; suspected abortionists and homosexuals, for example, were prosecuted as threats to the demographic health of the nation. Unsurprisingly, the most common victims of persecution tended to be the most vulnerable members of Italian society – women, the poor and unemployed, and the mentally ill. <italic>Ordinary Violence</italic> is most compelling when it delves into the fabric of everyday life, into the stories of individuals and communities negotiating political imperatives and personal relationships.</p>
<p>If I have any criticism of this book, it is that it is too brief to explore this tremendously important topic in greater depth. This is particularly true of its source base, which has at its core a sample of 549 personal files of political detainees. While Ebner uses this data to great effect, it emanates more from the exigencies of the coercive state than from the subjective experiences of individuals. The accounts from police records could have been more fully complemented with memoirs, diaries and the like in order to convey more fully the lived realities and personal perceptions of ordinary violence.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its brevity, <italic>Ordinary Violence</italic> is one of the most important books on Mussolini’s Italy to have been published in recent years. It provides valuable insight not only into the story of fascist repression but into the very nature of the ideology itself. For all its pretenses to intellectual pedigree – whether the modernist fantasy of the ‘New Man’ or the revival of ancient Roman imperialism – fascism was also in large measure bullying masquerading as politics. Similarly, Ebner’s work contributes to ongoing debates over the nature of popular support for the regime and the so-called ‘Years of Consensus’ by suggesting that coercion was at least as important as the courting of consent. Finally, it offers a salutary reminder that war and genocide are not the only crimes of brutal regimes. They also inflict upon their populations the daily experience of surveillance, intimidation and humiliation, whether in Mussolini’s Italy, Pinochet’s Chile or Mubarak’s Egypt. Such a corrosion of civil society should not be minimized or overlooked.</p>
