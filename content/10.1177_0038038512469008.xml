<p>The editors of the journal are pleased to receive requests to review any book recently published in the field of sociology or likely to be of interest and relevance to the readership of <italic>Sociology</italic>. The journal offices receive a lively stream of unsolicited review copies and promotional notices from a range of publishers throughout the year, but to catalogue these in the journal as ‘books received’ is not always the best spur to requests to review, nor are such lists representative of the range of sociological publications currently available. We prefer that potential reviewers contact us directly with requests to review any recently published book that has caught their attention. If we like the idea and want to see the book reviewed, we will contact the publishers direct and secure a review copy for you. (We may still, occasionally, publish abridged lists of books we are particularly keen to have reviewed.)</p>
<p>Please note that when requesting a book for review it always helps if you are able to set out briefly why it is that you think a review of the book would be appropriate for the journal, and why it is that you might make a useful reviewer. Please also remember that as well as single book reviews the journal also publishes regular review essays. The latter are more substantial reviews of three or more books taken together and provide an overview and evaluation of a topic or theme of (often emergent) sociological interest; they are a real service to the readership and we particularly welcome requests to take on a review essay.</p>
<p>Please send all requests to review to the editors at: <email>sociology@cardiff.ac.uk</email></p>
