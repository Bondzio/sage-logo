<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the creative, educational, and musical growth that comes from manipulating pieces of a music game. The importance of child-centered play is discussed, with a focus on children using icons to change the melodic and word order of a song. They then “read” the icons to sing their new creation. The music manipulatives are the creation of Barbara Andress.</p>

<p>One of the most influential leaders in the early childhood music education movement of the late 20th century was Barbara Andress. Barbara’s passion for children and their music development motivated hundreds of music teachers and childcare givers to make preschool music education an important priority. A follower of Piaget, Vgotsky, and Bruner, she was a proponent of providing music centers where children could be observed at music play. She encouraged music educators to use these observations to learn about the natural music behaviors of children in order to inform how and what to teach. She developed literally hundreds of music toys, or what she called music manipulatives, to encourage young children’s music production, and demonstrated how simple it was for music educators and nonmusic educators alike to stimulate children’s music production through play. Her manipulatives were often made from things found in the environment, so parents and child care providers could make the music toys themselves.</p>
<p>One popular Andress creation is the game to “Are You Sleeping” (see the appendix found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gmt.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://gmt.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). Andress took advantage of what might be called a “twin form” song by making “twin” illustrations for each line of the song and inviting a child and parent or child and child to take turns singing as they put the pictures in appropriate places on the mat. Like many child-centered instructional materials that Andress created, this one is simple enough that copies can be made for children to take home and teach to their parents. Andress suggested that the pictures be glued inside lids of soft drink or coffee cups so the children would have something firm to hold. They could also be produced on cardstock and laminated. This simple manipulative game encourages</p>

<p>The richness of this play provides ample value to justify its use with young children. But recently, a class of 4-year-olds showed their ability to read and improvise with these pictures. Extra copies of each picture were added to the play space and the teacher asked the children what they would sing if they saw the following (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1048371311434081">Example 1</xref>):</p>
<fig id="fig1-1048371311434081" position="float">
<label>Example 1.</label>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1048371311434081-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>One child “read” the icons while singing, including the extra “ding, ding, dong” at the end. The teacher added two more “ding, ding, dong” symbols and another child “read” the symbols and sang the song with the indicated changes. The teacher then added an extra picture at the beginning. Again, the children knew what to do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1048371311434081">Example 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-1048371311434081" position="float">
<label>Example 2.</label>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1048371311434081-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The teacher left the children to continue the play on their own. Especially interesting was how long the children continued manipulating the symbols and the song. Sam has created his own score and is reading while singing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1048371311434081">Example 3</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig3-1048371311434081" position="float">
<label>Example 3.</label>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1048371311434081-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>At one point, a child began to rearrange the order of the pictures such as (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1048371311434081">Example 4</xref>):</p>
<fig id="fig4-1048371311434081" position="float">
<label>Example 4.</label>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1048371311434081-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Surprisingly, the children were able to sing the rearrangement of the song with the correct melody!</p>
<p>Jeanne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371311434081">Bamberger (1995)</xref> observed that young children’s invented notations tend to represent blocks or chunks of sound, which she describes as figural. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371311434081">Davidson and Scripp (1988)</xref> came to the same conclusions. (For a summary of research on children’s invented notation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311434081">Gruhn, 2011</xref>.) If children’s invented notations tell us that children perceive sounds in groups, then it may be that reading pictures that represent groups of sound is a logical place for them to begin to understand the reading process. The drawings in this article are what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371311434081">Bruner (1960)</xref> called icons of the words and what Boardman called topical icons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311434081">Bergethon, Boardman, &amp; Montgomery, 1997</xref>, p. 385). According to Bruner, interpreting icons is an important step toward reading arbitrary symbols.</p>
<p>Other songs that lend themselves to this kind of song “reading” and “improvising” include Scotland’s Burning, My Aunt Came Back, and Cherries So Ripe and So Round. Without Barbara’s lovely illustrations, you may have to resort to clip art, or invite children to create their own illustrations of each phrase. Parents and childcare providers have both expressed delight with these kinds of games. Music educators are encouraged to observe and gather information about which age children seem most interested and creative in this kind of play. Most of all, enjoy!</p>
