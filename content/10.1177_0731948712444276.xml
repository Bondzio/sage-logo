<abstract>
<p>The present study investigated whether (a) growth patterns related to cognitive processing (working memory, updating, inhibition) differed in subgroups of children with reading disabilities (RD) and (b) growth in working memory (executive processing) predicted growth in other cognitive areas, such as reading and math. Seventy-three children (ages 7–17) categorized as poor decoders, poor comprehenders, or average readers were administered a battery of achievement and cognitive measures for three consecutive years. Hierarchical linear modeling showed that growth in executive processing (inhibition) in children with RD constrained growth in reading and math. The results support the notion that development in the executive system underlies performance on reading and math measures.</p>

<p>The strong link between working memory (WM) and children’s achievements in math and reading had been widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948712444276">Ashbaker &amp; Swanson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712444276">de Jonge &amp; de Jong, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948712444276">Siegel, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948712444276">Ashbaker and Swanson (1996)</xref>, for example, reported moderate correlations of .49 and .40 between two verbal WM tasks and the third edition of the <italic>Wide Range Achievement Test</italic> (WRAT-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948712444276">Wilkinson, 1993</xref>) reading. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948712444276">Bayliss, Jarrold, Baddeley, Gunn, and Leigh (2005)</xref> found strong correlations of .65 between reading and verbal WM span and .67, between math and WM. Although it is well confirmed in the literature that children obtaining higher scores on WM tasks tend to have higher reading and math scores, the relation between the executive components of WM and literacy acquisition still continues to be researched and explored.</p>
<p><italic>WM</italic> has been defined as a processing resource that enables us to simultaneously hold, process, and store information. Researchers differentiate it from short-term memory (STM), which is involved only in very short and passive storage of information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948712444276">Baddeley’s (1986)</xref> model of WM is one of the most influential when applied to developmental research. According to this model, WM consists of the central executive component, responsible for a wide range of different executive activities (EA), and two subordinate systems: phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad. The subordinate systems can hold information for a brief period of time, unless constantly rehearsed. Phonological loop holds verbally coded information (words), whereas visuospatial sketchpad holds images and visually and spatially coded inputs (pictures). It is believed that individuals with reading and language disabilities have impairments in their phonological loop component of the WM system, their central executive component, or possibly in both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948712444276">Nation, Adams, Bowyer-Crane, &amp; Snowling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948712444276">Seigneuric, Ehrlich, Oakhill, &amp; Yuill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948712444276">Siegel &amp; Ryan, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Two important questions continue to remain unclear and conflicting in the field of WM and reading disabilities (RD). The first one concerns whether growth in activities related to the executive processing components of WM or WM span in general are related to growth in reading. Tasks that assess WM span assume to tap executive processing together with short-term storage (phonological loop and sketchpad). Thus, it is not clear whether central executive, domain-specific short-term storage, or the combination of both account for inefficient growth in reading and reading-related measures. However, executive processing (processes understood to be involved and attributed to central executive component of WM system) is assumed to be domain general. That is, deficits in such processes as switching, inhibition, and updating are believed to be reflected across different domains, like writing, reading, and math. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948712444276">Siegel and Ryan (1989)</xref>, for instance, compared developmental change in WM performance, as measured by WM span (WM growth) in normally achieving and subtypes of learning-disabled (LD) children as a function of age (7- to 13-year-old students). Although the data were cross-sectional, students with RD showed significantly lower scores on the two administered WM tasks (listening span and counting tasks) across all age groups. The authors concluded that reading disability represented a generalized deficit in WM and that the growth in WM for language played a key role in the development of reading and arithmetic skills in school-age students. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948712444276">Swanson (2003)</xref> found significant differences between good and poor readers across four age groups on WM span measures. These differences persisted and also increased with age. In addition, the magnitude of the correlations between achievement measures and WM was related to a general rather than a specialized WM system. The latest synthesis of research comparing children with and without RD on measures of WM revealed an overall effect size of –0.89 (<italic>SE</italic> = .08) in favor of children without RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948712444276">Jerman &amp; Swanson, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the WM deficits persisted when age, IQ, reading level, and domain specificity (verbal vs. visuospatial) were controlled for.</p>
<p>Given the fact that children with reading problems have WM deficits and these deficits continue to persist with age, the second important question that logically follows the first is whether deficits in the executive system of WM constrain children’s ability to learn and progress in the areas of reading and math. If there is a direct relationship between the development of WM and literacy acquisition, one would expect WM deficits to directly and negatively affect children’s reading and math scores. However, it may be the case that the deficits in WM have no direct consequences and inefficient WM development simply parallels inefficient reading/math acquisition. This is a very important theoretical question. Only a few studies, to the authors’ knowledge, have looked at individual differences in children with RD as a function of age-related WM growth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948712444276">Gathercole, Alloway, Willis, &amp; Adams, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712444276">Swanson &amp; Jerman, 2007</xref>). These studies tested whether growth in WM relates to growth in other cognitive domains and their results offer us some thoughts for further investigations.</p>
<p>For example, Gathercole, Tiffany, Briscoe, Thorn, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712444276">The ALSPAC Team (2005)</xref> examined whether deficits in the phonological loop of WM in children at age 4 would constrain students’ future learning achievements in the areas of vocabulary, language, and mathematics. Contrary to their expectations, impairments in STM system at age 5 did not predict children’s attainments at age 8: Students in the experimental group performed at appropriate levels for their age on measures related to vocabulary, language, number skills, and math. However, a significant relationship emerged between performance on WM tasks and achievement measures. In particular, an important finding was that WM at age 4 was correlated significantly with later achievements in academic domains.</p>
<p>Another important study was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712444276">Swanson and Jerman (2007)</xref> and tested whether WM underlies reading growth in subgroups of children with reading disabilities. Subgroups of children with RD only, with RD and math deficits, and low verbal IQ readers were compared with skilled readers on a battery of WM and STM measures for three consecutive years. The results revealed that WM performance and WM growth rates could not be differentiated among RD subgroups, although not only were their span scores lower, but their WM growth rates were also slower compared with that of skilled readers. The major finding, however, that emerged from that study was that deficient growth in WM accounted for the slower rate of growth in reading comprehension and reading fluency.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, little is still known about how individual differences in the growth of the executive processes of WM in children with RD affect progression of their skills in other academic domains. Accordingly, the primary focus of the present study is to extend the search on WM and reading and to examine how growth in WM and executive processes relates to literacy acquisition in children with reading disabilities. Specifically, the central goal of the study is to answer the following two questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0731948712444276" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Does growth in the executive components of WM or WM span differ as a function of reading ability?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do deficits in the executive components of WM (or WM span) constrain growth on measures related to reading and math for students with RD?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Children with reading disabilities represent a heterogeneous group, and reading problems could arise as a result of problems in either decoding and/or comprehension. Thus, two reading disability subgroups were included to test the research hypotheses. The first subgroup included students with deficient decoding skills. The second subgroup comprised students with adequate decoding skills but poor reading comprehension ability.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0731948712444276">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample comprised of students attending a private school in Southern California. The school serves children with different kinds of special needs. All students whose parents gave permissions participated in the study (67% of all students). The data reported here are based on the sample, which consisted of 73 students (24 girls and 49 boys). The data from some students were not used in the analyses because they did not fit the study criteria for participation (see below). The mean age of the sample was 12.20 years and ranged in age from 7.8 to 17.0 years. The ethnic representation of the sample was 57 Anglo-American, 6 African American, 5 Hispanic, and 5 children of mixed heritage. Children’s families were middle-upper to upper class socioeconomic status (SES). Of the participants’ parents, 73% of the fathers and 70% of the mothers had completed a bachelor’s degree: 53% of the fathers and 10% of the mothers had graduate degrees.</p>
<sec id="section3-0731948712444276">
<title>Subgroup profiles</title>
<p>Students were divided into three subgroups: poor decoders (PD), poor comprehenders (PC), and a control group (C). Classification of the groups was based on standard scores from the Word-Reading subtest of the WRAT-III and the Passage Comprehension subtest of the <italic>Woodcock Reading Mastery Test–Revised</italic> (WRMT-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948712444276">Woodcock, 1998</xref>). Students who scored below the 25th percentile on WRAT-III (reading) composed the poor-decoding (PD) group; those scoring above the 25th percentile on WRAT-III and below the 25th percentile on passage comprehension were classified as PC. The majority of students in poor-decoding group also had low scores on reading comprehension. Average readers were students whose scores on WRAT-III reading and WRMT Passage Comprehension were above the 40th percentile. It was our assumption that average readers in the C did not have any cognitive deficits to hinder their reading acquisition, and, thus, their performance and growth rate would serve as a gauge, to which the scores of students with reading problems could be compared.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the scores of some students were excluded from the analyses. Students were excluded if their scores were below 80 on the <italic>Raven Colored Progressive Matrices</italic> (RCPM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948712444276">Raven, 1976</xref>) and the WRAT-III Arithmetic subtest. The exclusion was necessary to eliminate students with a possible comorbid (reading and math) disability or mild mental retardation. We used the cutoff score of 80 rather than 90, because the performance of some students on these measures varied from Year 1 to Year 2 to Year 3 ranging between 80 and 90 (e.g., a student might have had a score of 80 on the RCPM in Year 1 but a score of 95 in Year 2). Thus, we included these students to increase our sample size. Eleven students were excluded from the total sample (5 students had scores on the RCPM below 80 and 6 students had scores below 80 on the WRAT-III math). Children in each subgroup were matched on SES, ethnicity, gender, and chronological age. These results are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731948712444276">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Graduate students collected the data at approximately the same time each year. Each child was tested on various cognitive and academic measures for three consecutive years. There was some attrition in the sample, which is addressed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0731948712444276">
<title>Tasks and Materials</title>
<p>All students received a battery of group and individually administered tasks. The tasks descriptions are provided below. Along with published and standardized tasks, experimental measures were also administered.</p>
<sec id="section6-0731948712444276">
<title>Classification Tasks</title>
<p>Reading decoding skill was assessed by the Reading subtest of the WRAT-III. Each child was provided with a list of words that increased in difficulty and was asked to pronounce each word. The test stopped after five consecutive incorrect pronunciations. The dependent measure was the number of words read correctly (range = 0–42). The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on this task were .83, .85, and .87, respectively.</p>
<p>Reading comprehension ability was measured by the Passage Comprehension subtest of the WRMT-R. Students silently read short sentences/passages with a missing word. Within 15 s after reading the passage, the student was asked to verbally provide a word that would fit best the meaning of the sentence/passage. Passages increased in difficulty. The dependent measure was the number of correctly provided words (range = 0–68). The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on this task were .69, .76, and .60, respectively.</p>
<p>Arithmetic skills were assessed using the Arithmetic subtest of the WRAT-III, administered in small groups. The students were provided with a sheet of paper with math problems and were allowed 15 min to solve them. The dependent measure was the number of problems correctly solved (range = 0–40). The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on this task were .51, .60, and .63, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0731948712444276">
<title>Fluid Intelligence and Arithmetic</title>
<p>Fluid intelligence was assessed by the RCPM and administered in small groups. Children were given a small booklet containing 36 (standard version has 60) different patterns. Each pattern was displayed on a separate page and had a missing piece to it. For each pattern, six/eight possible solutions (pattern pieces) were also provided. Children were asked to circle the piece that best fit the displayed pattern. The dependent measure was the number of problems solved correctly (range = 0–60). The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on this task were .87, .87, and .87, respectively.</p>
<p>The Arithmetic subtest of the third edition of the <italic>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children</italic> (WISC-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948712444276">Wechsler, 1991</xref>) was administered to assess math word problem skills. Each word problem was presented orally and was solved without paper or pencil use. The dependent measure was the number of problems solved correctly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0731948712444276">
<title>WM Span/Executive Processing</title>
<p>Three tasks were conducted to assess these areas. The tasks were sentence span, updating, and inhibition.</p>
<sec id="section9-0731948712444276">
<title>Sentence (listening) span</title>
<p>The children’s adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948712444276">Swanson, 1992</xref>) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948712444276">Daneman and Carpenter’s (1980)</xref> sentence span task was administered. As a common measure of WM (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948712444276">Daneman &amp; Carpenter, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948712444276">Just &amp; Carpenter, 1992</xref>), this task required the presentation of groups of sentences, read aloud, for which children simultaneously tried to understand the passage and remember the last word of each sentence. The number of sentences in the group gradually increased. After each group, the participant answered a question about a sentence and then recalled the last word of the sentence. <italic>Working-memory capacity</italic> was defined as the largest group of ending words recalled. The dependent measure was the highest set recalled correctly (range = 0–5) in which the process question was answered correctly. The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on this task were .76, .76, and .77, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0731948712444276">
<title>Updating</title>
<p>The experimental updating task was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948712444276">Morris and Jones (1990)</xref>. A series of one-digit numbers that varied in set lengths of 3, 5, 7, and 9 was presented. No digit appeared twice in the same set. Participants were asked to recall only last three numbers from the list in order. Each digit in the list was presented at 1-s intervals. The dependent measure was the total number of sets correctly repeated (range = 0–16). The task was assumed to measure ability to actively manipulate the addition of new information and the replacement of no-longer-relevant information. The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on this task were .87, .88, and .87, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0731948712444276">
<title>Inhibition: Random letter and number generation</title>
<p>The task measures inhibition because participants were required to actively monitor responses and suppress responses that would lead to well-learned sequences, such as 1–2–3–4 or a–b–c–d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948712444276">Baddeley, 1996</xref>). Each student was asked to write as quickly as possible numbers (or letters) first in sequential order (baseline) and then in a random nonsystematic order. For the numbers section, students were first asked to write numbers in order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) as quickly as possible in a 30-s period. They were then asked to write numbers as quickly as possible “out of order” within a 30-s period. Scoring included an index for randomness, information redundancy, and percentage of paired responses to assess the tendency of participants to suppress response repetitions. The measure of inhibition was calculated as the number of correctly unordered numbers or letters. The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on Random Letter generation were .71, .71, and .73, respectively. The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on the Random Number generation task were .69, .70, and .72, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section12-0731948712444276">
<title>Reading/Phonological Processing Measures</title>
<p>Two tasks were associated with assessing reading and phonological processing abilities. The tasks were reading and real word and pseudoword reading.</p>
<sec id="section13-0731948712444276">
<title>Reading</title>
<p>The Reading subtest from WRMT-III was administered to assess students’ ability to read words. This subtest assesses the ability to name 15 letters and pronounce a list of 42 words.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0731948712444276">
<title>Real word and pseudoword reading tasks</title>
<p>Two subtests were administered from the <italic>Test of Word Reading Efficiency</italic> (TOWRE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948712444276">Wagner &amp; Torgesen, 1999</xref>). The two subtests required oral reading of a list of 120 real words or pseudowords of increasing difficulty. Real word reading efficiency was assessed by the Sight Word Efficiency subtest. Students were given 45 s to read aloud as many words as possible from a list of common words. Pseudoword reading ability was assessed by the Nonword Efficiency subtest. Students were given 45 s to read aloud as many words as possible from a list of nonwords. The nonwords followed regular spelling patterns, requiring students to quickly decipher pronunciations based on their existing knowledge of grammar. The dependent measures for both subtests were the number of words read correctly. The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on the Sight Word task were .81, .83, and .82, respectively. The sample Cronbach’s alpha coefficients on scores for Waves 1, 2, and 3 on Nonword Efficiency were .84, .83, and .83, respectively.</p>

<title>Growth Analysis</title>
<p>To analyze growth, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712444276">Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712444276">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>) was employed using a PROC MIXED program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948712444276">SAS Institute, 2003</xref>). The goal of this analysis was to examine whether (a) rate of change in WM span (or executive processing) was significantly different among the RD subgroups and (b) rate of change in WM span (or executive processing) could predict growth in other cognitive areas (reading and math). Although our clinical sample was limited in size, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948712444276">Snijders and Bosker (1999)</xref>, it was within acceptable range (having more than 30 observations per level) to meet HLM assumptions and requirements. Gender differences in growth models were considered and were found to be nonsignificant. Accordingly, the data for the growth analysis were collapsed across boys and girls. The analysis was performed on the <italic>z</italic> scores derived from the scores of students who had complete data points across time. The <italic>z</italic> scores were based on Wave 1 performance; consequently, Waves 2 and 3 used Wave 1 performance in calculating <italic>z</italic> scores.</p>
<p>Although nonlinear trends in growth can be modeled, the present small sample size and only three data points did not allow for thorough nonlinear growth examination. Quadratic models were tested, but only linear models are reported. Linear models provided better fit, provided more stable and precise estimation to the data analysis, and were more parsimonious when compared with quadratic models.</p>
<p>The method of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation was used to estimate the parameters in the growth models. When compared with other types of estimation, ML estimates had several advantages, such as being asymptotically unbiased or consistent, being normally distributed, and provided smaller standard errors (for more comprehensive information, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712444276">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>). Estimation of the variances and relationships among the regression coefficients was set to the TYPE = fa0 (2) option as this type of estimation provided more stable parameter estimations (the variance components estimates were calculated based on the two-factor structure [intercept, slope] model).</p>
<p>All growth models comprised two levels: (a) a Level 1 submodel that estimated an individuals’ change over time (within-subject change) and (b) a Level 2 submodel estimated changes across individuals (between-subject change). The Level 1 submodel was formulated as follows:</p>

<p>In this model, TIME<sub>ij</sub> = Age<sub>ij</sub> – Mean age (Age<sub>ij</sub> was individual <italic>i</italic>’s age on occasion <italic>j</italic> and Mean Age was the mean age of the total sample across 3 waves); π<sub>0<italic>i</italic></sub> was individual <italic>i</italic>’s initial status at the mean age (<italic>i</italic> runs from 1 to 73—the number of participants in the present study); π<sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub> was individual <italic>i</italic>’s true rate of change/growth during the period under study; and ϵ<sub>ij</sub> portion of individual <italic>i</italic>’s outcome that was unpredicted on occasion <italic>j</italic> (<italic>j</italic> runs from 1 to 3—the number of testing occasions/waves). TIME was a Level 1 predictor. The data in this study were centered on the mean age of the total sample = 146.41 months because of the wide age range of the study participants (7 – 17). Thus, centering the data on the mean age of the total sample at Wave 2 was expected to facilitate the examination and interpretation of the intercept.</p>
<p>The primary Level 2 predictor in the model was GROUP classification. The Level 2 submodel in a growth-analysis model expressed the between-group differences in change trajectories and contained six parameters or fixed effects. The fixed effects captured systematic interindividual differences in growth based on the Level 2 predictor (group). The Level 2 slope parameters answered the question as to what extent the differences in growth trajectories over age were associated with group assignment. The Level 2 model also consisted of two parts, one that represented true initial status (π<sub>0<italic>i</italic></sub>) and the other true rate of change (π<sub>1<italic>i</italic></sub>). Each part specified the relationship between an individual growth parameter and Level 2 predictor (group). Moreover, each equation included residuals (ξ), the portion of variance that remained unexplained by Level 2 predictors. As three groups were studied, the following parameters were included in Level 2 submodel:</p>

<p>where, the first structural part in brackets contained six fixed effects and the second part represented model random effects (variance components).</p>
<p>For each dependent measure, four multilevel growth models were tested: unconditional means, unconditional growth, conditional means, and conditional growth models. The two simpler unconditional models were important to test prior to adding predictors to the model as they provided the preliminary data/model examination and baselines for the further model comparison.</p>

<sec id="section18-0731948712444276">
<title>Growth Models</title>
<p>First, a growth model for performance on the sentence span measure was tested. Entering TIME as a predictor resulted in significant fixed effects and nonsignificant random effects. The models also provided nonstable parameter estimates. The visual examination of the data clearly suggested linear growth: The scores of students who were younger were more linear and increasing. At the same time, older students (about 140 months and older) showed less increase in their performance. There were many nonlinearities among the scores. The nonlinearity suggested the existence of additional variables that could potentially explain the variability among the scores (group assignment could be one of those potential variables).</p>
<p>The growth model for sentence span is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948712444276">Table 3</xref>. Unconditional means model had no predictors. The model tested the hypothesis that there was no change in memory spans within individuals. Fixed-effects intercept value provided a grand mean and was significant. As seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948712444276">Table 3</xref>, the intercept value indicated the average score across total sample on the sentence span measure was 1.34. The model also partitioned the variance. A closer examination of the variance components indicated that 34% (.4656<sup>2</sup> / [.4656<sup>2</sup> + .4274]) of between-/within-student variance were explained by other predictors.</p>

<p>The unconditional growth model included TIME as a predictor at Level 1. The results showed a significantly better fit for the data when compared with the unconditional means model, compare –2ln(L) value of 397.9 versus 377.1; χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 20.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 (397.9 – 377.1 = 20.8). An additional 12% of within-person (1 – .3746 / .4274) variance in scores was attributed to time change.</p>
<p>Conditional means model when compared with unconditional models also showed a better fit statistics and explained more unaccounted variance. The model reduced between-person variance by 71% (1 – .2514<sup>2</sup> / .4656<sup>2</sup>). Fixed effects were significant for the intercept and growth parameter estimates. Furthermore, the results showed that the intercept for PC differed significantly from that of a C (–0.3828). However, adding group as a predictor to the next conditional growth model did not show any improvement to the data fit. The conditional growth model was no better than conditional means model. Therefore, for the reasons of parsimony, it was decided to use conditional means model in the future prediction models.</p>
<p>Next, empirical Bayesian (EB) estimates for the intercept and slope for sentence span were calculated. There are several different methods for estimating individual growth parameters. However, the EB estimates when compared with other methods (e.g., ordinary-least squares [OLS] estimates) provide more precise estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712444276">Singer &amp; Willett, 2003</xref>). When estimating the model parameters, EB estimates provided the weighted combination of OLS and population average estimates. As a result, individual growth trajectories were more stable and less discrepant. Once the EB estimates for sentence span were calculated, they were added to the growth models for predicting reading and math. Adding EB estimates to reading/math models allowed determining whether they would further contribute to the additional variance among students’ scores. However, the results from the growth models for reading and math reveled that neither the sentence span intercept nor the slope estimates predicted growth for reading and math (<italic>p</italic>s &gt;.05).</p>
<p>In sum, the results have shown that WM span growth analysis did not support the initial hypothesis. Growth in WM span did not explain any additional variance in students’ reading and math performance and did not account for the growth in these areas.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether executive processes rather than WM span mediated math and reading growth. The three tasks utilized as EA/processes in the present study were Random Letter Generation, Random Number Generation, and Updating. Thus, in this part of the analysis, growth models for EA were performed; the EB estimates for the intercept and slope were estimated, saved, and then entered into math and reading conditional means models. Again, conditional means models were used rather than conditional growth models as they were more parsimonious. The results are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731948712444276">Table 4</xref> (Math) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0731948712444276">Table 5</xref> (Reading).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731948712444276">Table 4</xref> represents the results from growth modeling on Math (WISC arithmetic subtest). As seen from the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731948712444276">Table 4</xref>, the EA intercept estimates contributed significant variance in math intercept scores. When compared with conditional means model, the EA intercept accounted for 25% of between-person variance in scores. Adding EA slope estimates further reduced between-person variance for another 14%. However, when EA intercept and growth parameters were added as predictors of the slope in math, the results were not statistically significant: <italic>t</italic>(90) = −.95, <italic>p</italic> = .34 for the EA intercept and <italic>t</italic>(90) = .63, <italic>p</italic> = .53 for the EA slope parameters.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate (a) whether the rate of growth in measures of cognition (WM span, executive processing) differed as a function of reading ability, and (b) whether growth in measures of cognition was related to growth in the domains of reading and mathematics. Overall, the results revealed that students without reading difficulties had higher level of performance in WM span but similar growth rate when compared with students with poor decoding and comprehension skills. Contrary to the initial assumptions, the data did not confirm that developmental improvements in WM span contributed to students’ growth in either reading or math. However, the measures of executive processing contributed to students’ growth in crystallized intelligence. In the discussion that follows, each of the two questions will be examined in more detail. We will then discuss the limitations and the implications of the study’s findings for future research and practice.</p>
<sec id="section20-0731948712444276">
<title>Question 1</title>
<p>Does rate of change (growth) in measures of WM span and executive processing differ among reading-ability groups?</p>
<sec id="section21-0731948712444276">
<title>Growth trajectories</title>
<p>Consistent with accumulating studies in WM, the results from growth analysis confirmed the developmental changes in memory span in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948712444276">Siegel &amp; Ryan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948712444276">Swanson, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948712444276">2003</xref>). Visual examination of the students’ scores (scatterplots) clearly demonstrated the growth, with the older students being able to obtain higher WM span scores. However, when examining the growth rates in WM (sentence span) separately by subgroup, the results yielded statistically comparable growth estimates among the PD, PC, and average readers. The groups only differed slightly in the initial level of performance. HLM analysis showed that PC obtained lower scores on sentence span (−0.3832*, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948712444276">Table 3</xref>) when compared with other two groups. Even though PC and PD both had lower performance, they were not distinguishable from each other on growth rates and trajectories.</p>
<p>In general, we found that all three experimental groups had similar growth trajectories in WM span. This finding is somewhat different from the results obtained by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712444276">Gathercole et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712444276">Swanson &amp; Jerman, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712444276">Swanson and Jerman (2007)</xref> compared average readers with three reading ability groups (RD only, RD with math comorbidity, and poor readers with low verbal IQ) on four WM measures. The results from their analysis showed that skilled readers had statistically higher growth estimate rates in WM span when compared with poor readers. These discrepant findings may be due to methodological differences. For instance, different WM measures were utilized in both studies. Moreover, growth analysis of the present study was based solely on one WM measure, sentence span.</p>
<p>The results from our study are also different from other cross-sectional studies examining the developmental increases in WM span between good and poor readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712444276">Chiappe, Hasher, &amp; Siegel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948712444276">Siegel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948712444276">Siegel &amp; Ryan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948712444276">Swanson, 2003</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948712444276">Swanson (2003)</xref> compared students with and without RD across four age groups (7, 10, 13, and 20 years) on a battery of WM tasks. The results from his study showed that age-related differences in WM increased between the two groups, even after controlling for reading and math level. LD and average readers also differed in their pattern of performance on phonological, visual, and semantic tasks. Swanson concluded that “working memory differences between reading groups increased relative to Phonological and Visual-spatial tasks as a function of age when the tasks required the processing of semantic information” (p. 17).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0731948712444276">
<title>Age-related differences in growth patterns</title>
<p>Similar to other cognitive fluid processes, such as speed of processing, WM growth pace varies as a function of age, with younger children demonstrating a slightly higher growth slopes than older children. The examination of students’ scores (scatterplots) showed that the growth rate of younger students was higher than that of older students. There was also more variability in scores among the older study participants. This suggests that apart from age, other factors accounted for the differences in older students’ scores on sentence span. The relatively small sample size did not allow for statistical examination of the difference in growth rates between reading subgroups of older and younger students. However, we divided the sample into younger and older groups and then plotted students’ mean scores separately by reading-ability group and age group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948712444276">Figure 1</xref>). As seen from the figure, when the present sample was divided into younger (less than 144 month, Age Groups 1–3) and older (older than 145 months, Age Groups 4–6) students and then analyzed by reading ability subgroup, the older participants showed higher performance level for all three reading subgroups. Consistent with the results from HLM, PC had lower initial level.</p>

<p>Interestingly, however, only older students in C seem to continue showing the growth in their performance. The performance of older students in both RD subgroups plateaus, revealing no further growth at all. Looking at the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948712444276">Figure 1</xref>, we see that the growth rate of younger students is higher than that of older kids, and, for the younger reading-ability subgroups, their growth slopes are pretty much parallel and statistically not much different. As for the older students, their growth slopes seem to be different. While students in C keep showing increase, the growth rate of poor readers is minimal. In other words, we could argue that if it were possible to analyze the nonlinear trends in the present data set, we could have found different growth trajectories among the reading ability subgroups in WM span and, accordingly, support similar results of other studies.</p>
<p>In addition, the visual examination of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948712444276">Figure 1</xref> is in line with other findings in the field pointing to the fact that older students with reading deficits reach a certain threshold in their WM capacity by creating a “ceiling effect” in their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712444276">Gathercole et al., 2005</xref>); their growth rates plateau. Logically, we would expect this “ceiling limit” to affect and further constrain growth in academic domains, especially those showing strong correlations with WM measures. Accordingly, the above findings lead to the second question of the study: whether deficient growth in WM span or executive processes further constrained growth in reading and math in students with poor reading skills.</p>

<title>Question 2</title>
<p>Does growth in WM span or executive processing underlie children’s growth in reading and mathematics?</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of data showing the strong link between WM and reading and math in students, little is known about a long-term relationship between growth in WM and literacy development in children with reading problems. Moreover, the majority of studies are cross-sectional and correlational, and they do not explain whether developmental changes in WM directly account for growth in reading and math. For instance, consistent with other studies, the correlations between measures of WM (sentence span) and reading and math in Wave 1 in our study are significant and strong: <italic>r</italic> = .63 and .70 for math and reading, respectively. Correlations between WM in the first year and students’ scores in reading and math in Waves 2 and 3 are also significant and moderate: <italic>r</italic> = .63 and <italic>r</italic> = .67 for math and reading, respectively, in Wave 2 and <italic>r</italic> = .58 and .51, respectively, in Wave 3. The magnitudes of these correlations are of similar size and consistent with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948712444276">Bayliss et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712444276">Gathercole et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, research shows that performance on WM tasks predicts children’s attainments in reading and math. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712444276">Gathercole et al. (2005)</xref>, for example, explored whether WM was associated with the severity of reading difficulties in 6- to 11-year-old students. Based on the regression analysis, they found that WM was the strongest predictor of reading and math scores. WM accounted for 7.4% of variance in reading scores and for up to 5.4% of variance in math (correlations between WM and reading and math in their study were <italic>r</italic> = .56 and <italic>r</italic> = .59 for reading and math, respectively). What remains unclear, however, is whether deficits in WM span or executive processing of students with RD are not only predictive but also further affect subsequent learning in reading and math. The findings from the current study indicate that while the overall measure of WM (sentence span) failed to explain additional variance in reading and math scores of RD students, the measures of EA did. How could this be explained?</p>
<sec id="section24-0731948712444276">
<title>WM versus executive functions</title>
<p>Recent research has suggested that EA (sometimes referred to as executive functions [EF]) are frequently associated with performance on measures of fluid intelligence and WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948712444276">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712444276">Miyake, Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, &amp; Howerter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712444276">van der Sluis et al., 2005</xref>). Three separate EF have been proposed lately: inhibiting, shifting, and updating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712444276">Miyake et al., 2000</xref>). Based on Baddeley’s WM model, the central executive component is responsible for performing multiple operations and involves activation of various cognitive subprocesses. Clearly, there is a considerable overlap between WM and EF and between the processes involved in either WM or EF. Moreover, some researchers interchangeably used latent constructs of WM capacity and EF (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712444276">van der Sluis et al., 2005</xref>). In the present study, a latent variable of EA comprised three measures: updating, random number generation, and random letter generation. Our reasoning for grouping these measures together under a separate category of “EA” was based on the assumption that these tasks assessed the capacity to inhibit information, either digits or numbers (random number generation was also used as a measure of EA in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948712444276">Miyake, Friedman, Rettinger, Shah, &amp; Hegarty, 2001</xref>). However, one may argue that they can also represent measures of WM, because the central executive system also encompasses functions of information updating and inhibition of irrelevant or no-longer-relevant information. The findings from our study indicate that measures of EA, specifically measures of inhibition and updating, are related to children’s later growth in reading and math rather than measures of WM span per se.</p>
<p>At the same time, findings in the literature examining the relationship between children’s reading abilities and inhibitory skills are also contradictory. For instance, the study by van der Sluis, de Jong, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712444276">van der Sluis et al., (2005)</xref> did not find students with reading disability as characterized by deficits in inhibition and shifting. Their sample size consisted of 74 students in Grades 4 and 5 who were administered four measures of EF: two measures of inhibition and two measures of shifting. Although children with RD had lower scores on some measures (e.g., they were slower on naming letters and digits), their ability to shift between different stimuli, to inhibit, and to update was not impaired. The authors concluded that RD students were able to “maintain task goals active in the face of competition.” Other studies also failed to find differences between RD students and skilled readers on measures assessing central executive component of WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948712444276">Landern, Bevan, &amp; Butterworth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712444276">van der Sluis et al., 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948712444276">de Beni and her colleagues (1998)</xref> compared PC and skilled readers on WM tasks assessing students’ ability to inhibit irrelevant information. Based on the examination of intrusion errors, they found that PC more easily kept activated irrelevant information that had been processed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712444276">Chiappe, Hasher, and Siegel (2000)</xref> also examined reading ability and inhibitory processing in a sample of 6- to 49-year-old individuals. These authors concluded that deficits in WM found in reading disabled individuals were associated with inefficient inhibitory processing.</p>
<p>Thus, the findings in the literature remain mixed, possibly because of the difficulty to disentangle WM executive components and the complexity with assessing each distinct component of the executive system. Varieties of measures under WM category exist and are used. While the majority of researchers agree that the central executive system is not a unitary construct, they do not specify which of the executive components and/or processes of WM are examined. To make the problem even more complicated, the construct of “inhibition” is itself compound and multidimensional. Some researchers speculate the existence of various “inhibition subtypes,” because inhibition covers a wide range of diverse skills and functions, such as inhibition of overlearned responses, completely irrelevant information, no-longer relevant information, or secondary processes. Which of the inhibitory skills is deficient in RD participants, however, remains unclear. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712444276">Chiappe, Hasher, and Siegel (2000)</xref> hypothesized the existence of three inhibition functions that control performance on WM tasks: access, deletion, and restraint. They subscribe “access” function to individual’s capacity to prevent any activated but goal-irrelevant information from entering WM; “deletion” referred to removing irrelevant information from WM buffer and preventing proactive interference; and the “restraint” function referred to one’s ability to suppress either erroneous interpretations or to prevent strong responses to allow less probable responses to be considered. Based on the analysis of their study, they argue that reading-disabled individuals are characterized by deficits with the access and restraint functions of inhibition. However, more research on this topic needs to be done to get a better understanding of inhibitory/updating processes in poor readers, as well as the developmental changes in these processes.</p>
<p>The results from the present study thus indicate that students with RD have deficits in executive functioning—particularly in their inhibitory skills—and these impairments constrain students’ growth in reading and math. Although it could not be determined from the study which specific inhibitory mechanisms were deficient in the present group of students, these results nonetheless offer additional evidence to suggest that impaired inhibitory processing not only interferes with but also constrains reading comprehension (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712444276">Swanson &amp; Jerman, 2007</xref>) and problem solving (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948712444276">Bull &amp; Scerif, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712444276">Gathercole et al., 2005</xref>). Ineffective inhibition is also related to the deficient development in word recognition skills of reading disabled individuals.</p>

<sec id="section25-0731948712444276">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Like many longitudinal studies, the present study also has several limitations related to this type of design. Two are obvious. The first one is a relatively small sample size. Coupled with some attrition that took place over the period of the study, it was not possible to perform additional analyses to explain more of the unaccounted variance in students’ scores. For example, it would have been of interest to test the growth rates of younger/older students separately for the three experimental groups. In addition, the issue of attrition sometimes can be problematic because the cause of attrition is unknown. Sometimes student reduction is random and sometimes it is not: more capable students return from special to general education classes. Based on a typical flow and move of the school students, we considered the attrition to be random. Although we attempted to overcome the problem by calculating <italic>z</italic> scores based on the data provided by the participants with complete data points, one could argue that it still could affect stability of the sample and skew the results. Finally, the present sample was very homogeneous, as the majority of students came from average- to high-SES Caucasian families. Although this automatically eliminated any differences related to ethnic and SES factors, the present findings cannot be generalized to other students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0731948712444276" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results demonstrate that EA—specifically, updating and inhibition—play an important role in students’ growth in reading and math, and these processes may be impaired in students with reading disabilities. The deficits in inhibition of PD may result in the difficulty to inhibit inappropriate grapheme–phoneme correspondences required for successful word recognition. Deficits in inhibition among PC, however, could prevent them from “deactivation” of irrelevant or no-longer-relevant information, leading to the overload of their memory capacity and, accordingly, inability to further comprehend information. Students with weak inhibitory skills quickly fill up their WM capacity and then have difficulties to further handle the incoming information or they process it only partially. This would explain RD students’ problems in solving math problems, as math tasks become more complex and challenging and require maintaining of the task goal, finding plausible solutions and going through steps of problem solving amid the load of presented information. RD students’ inability to effectively discard useless information would constrain their ability to find the correct solution because (a) there is too much information to scan or (b) they have incomplete information as a result of overfilled WM capacity.</p>
<sec id="section27-0731948712444276">
<title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>The present findings provide some interesting theoretical and practical implications for individual differences in WM and for research on children with reading problems. First, the results add to our understanding of the role and functions of the central executive system. They suggest that more specific aspects of the central executive system, rather than general WM impairments, are deficient in RD students, and these deficits are associated with inadequate inhibiting and/or updating processes. However, whether both RD subtypes share common inhibitory deficit or have different inhibitory problems remains unanswered and needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Second, the results suggest that EF are critical for successful learning in school and deficits in EF result in developmental lag in learning, in reading and math. However, special effort needs to be given to developing precise and valid tasks to evaluate different functions of the central executive in RD subgroups.</p>
<p>Finally, because the results indicate that students with RD have impaired inhibitory processing that are predictive of later academic performance in the domains of reading and mathematics, some important practical implications should be considered with regard to classroom instruction. For example, some approaches to circumvent students’ difficulties related to poor inhibition should include curricular materials and teaching approaches that restrict the amount of irrelevant additional information, provide more concrete examples, and limit the number of task changes requiring switching and updating of new information.</p>
