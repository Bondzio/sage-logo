<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the grief and loss experience of adults with ID through the eyes of 18 hospice-affiliated bereavement counselors. The data included interviews with hospice affiliated counselors who had provided grief counseling to adults with ID. The interview data were analyzed using grounded theory. The participants voiced clearly that loss needs to be recognized and grief must be honored for all persons, including those with ID. The participating counselors described the long histories of unrecognized losses and the unintended consequences of protecting people with ID by avoiding informing them or including them in change, loss, and death scenarios. The interview data depicted individuals with ID being so “invisible” that they are often disregarded in times of crisis and loss. The findings from this study, along with existing published literature, point out a serious need for education and training for families and formal and informal caregivers as well as professionals. Palliative care and hospice workers have an obligation and opportunity to identify, support, and, if necessary, treat the grief of those with ID. The hope is that over time, there will be less need for end-of-life care providers to be the lone educators and supporters about death and grief for any individual.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Palliative and hospice care professionals need to have knowledge of many populations to work effectively in diverse communities. The authors, both experienced hospice social workers and faculty at a school of social work, have seen a growing need for increased knowledge about one particular population. Both authors have provided grief education and support to adults with intellectual disabilities (IDs). The first author has provided several years of grief counseling to these adults. </p>
<p>Who are adults with ID? The American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities defined intellectual disability as “a disability characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical skills. This disability originates before the age of 18.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909112439617">1</xref>
</sup> Medical technology and improved living conditions have expanded life expectancy for people with ID.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909112439617">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909112439617">3</xref> </sup>In 1930, 9 years was the limit of life expectancy for someone with Down syndrome (one form of ID). Life expectancy for someone with Down syndrome is currently reported to be 62 years. The life span of a person with ID and/or other developmental disability classifications other than Down syndrome is 72 years, up from the 20 years<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909112439617">3</xref>
</sup> expected in 1930. In the past, parents outlived their adult children with ID. Now the children outlive the parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909112439617">4</xref>(p2),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909112439617">5</xref>(p3)</sup> The shift in life expectancy of people with ID may translate to a change in living conditions for them once their parents die. In the United States, “there are an estimated 4.8 million children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities living with family caregivers, in supervised residential settings, or in their own or a spouse’s or other relative’s household.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909112439617">6</xref>(p2)</sup> Other data available provide a breakdown of living arrangements for individuals with ID and developmental disabilities (DD).
<disp-quote>
<p>In 2009, 599,152 people with ID/DD received publicly funded supports while living in the home of a family member, 122,088 while living in homes of their own, and 40,967 while living in host family or foster care setting (Lakin, Larson, Salmi, &amp; Webster, 2010). In 2009, only 276,460 people with ID/DD lived in congregate care settings and 57% of those lived with 6 or fewer people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909112439617">7</xref>(p3)</sup></p></disp-quote>
It would appear that families still provide the home for many adults with ID, and those who live outside the family home reside in a variety of small settings. These adults are served by a wide variety of providers involved in community residential support. The residential statistics show that health care staff needs to be prepared to assist families and residential providers regarding questions about grief and death/dying for adults with ID.</p>
<p>As relational beings, humans cannot escape the experience of loss. People with IDs are members of families, neighborhoods, schools, churches, and offices. They form relationships, live through inevitable life changes, experience the aging process and losses of people, pets, homes, jobs, abilities, and friendships. They face the death of others and eventually will face their own death.</p>
<p>Individuals with ID can become included in hospice and palliative care as family members, friends, and sometimes caregivers of hospice clients. Living in relationship, like all others, they face the loss of family, staff, coworkers, and friends in nonhospice-related losses. Hospices often also reach out to the general community providing bereavement services. Bereavement support is not reimbursed by third-party payers. Hospices often provide grief counseling not just to families, but to others who are struggling with loss in the community. </p>
<p>As individuals with ID face bereavement, the community and their caregivers are ill-prepared to assist them.<sup>

</sup> Higgins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909112439617">9</xref>
</sup> noted unsubstantiated assumptions are made that if adults with ID grieve, they go through the same grieving process as the general population. Persons with ID often have communication and behavioral differences that make the identification of healthy versus unhealthy grief even more challenging than in persons without a disability. Death of a family member has been documented as a trigger for symptoms of psychopathology and cause for crisis intervention for individuals with ID.<sup>

</sup> Grant<sup>

</sup> found that deaths in the family “were talked of as having profound, long-lasting but not always well understood effects on the person with a mental handicap.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909112439617">14</xref>(p47)</sup> Kauffman<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909112439617">16</xref>
</sup> blamed the overall dehumanization of people with DD for historical oversight in acknowledging grief in this population. Van Dyke<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909112439617">17</xref>
</sup> stated, “In my experience of counseling people with disabilities who lose their only parent, it is not the finality of the loss, but the aftereffects of poor planning or no planning whatsoever that leave the deepest emotional scars.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909112439617">17</xref>(p38)</sup> Gradually, social scientists and providers of care have begun to acknowledge that depth of human feeling exists for those whose cognitive abilities fall below a standard score. Little work has been completed on adults with developmental disability and the bereavement experience.</p>
<p>This article will describe data from a 2007 study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909112439617">18</xref>
</sup> designed to explore how adults with ID (IQ less than 70) experienced grief. The researcher believed that adults with ID would have increased cognitive struggles to grasp abstract concepts such as death and grief, concepts even typical adults find difficult to understand. The researcher selected this group because she believed that IQ challenges may complicate the bereavement journey and little was known about their experiences with grief.</p>
<p>The study was completed as part of an unfunded doctoral dissertation. The first author originally designed the study with involvement of 2 institutional review boards (IRBs). The state and university IRBs assessed the study risks and imposed time lines. The researcher’s access to clients with ID was limited due to her student status. These elements, in addition to the lack of funding, created challenges. The first author decided to compromise and interview bereavement counselors who had provided grief counseling to adults with ID. This compromise reduced the barriers to study completion. The study was redesigned to explore the experience of bereavement for adults with ID as perceived by grief counselors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909112439617" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To explore the issue of bereavement and ID, the first author conducted qualitative research interviewing hospice-affiliated bereavement counselors. Why qualitative research? There are 2 compelling schools of thought. The first is that not enough is known about persons with ID and bereavement, and qualitative research provides a base.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049909112439617">19</xref></sup> The second is that grief that results from bereavement is not an entity that can be objectively measured and explained by quantitative methods.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049909112439617">20</xref> </sup>
</p>
<p>The researcher developed semistructured interview questions based on the gaps in knowledge about bereavement and adults with ID. The interview data were analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Grounded theory, as developed by Glaser and Strauss,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049909112439617">21</xref>
</sup> works to derive theory from the data as they are collected from participants. The researcher found explanations of the perceived experiences of bereaved adults with ID through analysis of the interview data. The analysis process included exploring the depth of the emerging concepts in the data and how they were interrelated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909112439617">22</xref>
</sup> Charmaz<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909112439617">23</xref>
</sup> described 4 phases of implementing grounded theory: creating and refining the research, data, and the collection questions; raising terms of concepts; asking more conceptual questions on a generic level; and making further discoveries and clarifying concepts through writing and rewriting. The researcher examined the data for concepts. She then reviewed concepts looking for repeated themes and analyzed the relationships between theoretical categories.</p>
<sec id="section3-1049909112439617">
<title>Sample and Recruitment</title>
<p>The first author began recruiting bereavement counselors affiliated with hospice in the United States, focusing first on Washington and Idaho. She then added the states of Oregon and California. When the Pacific Northwest did not provide enough participants, the researcher expanded recruitment to include New York, Vermont, Arizona, and Florida, for a broader base of sampling. Arizona and Florida were selected primarily due to the availability of their hospice Web directories. Hospices were contacted via letter or e-mail with follow-up phone calls. The researcher asked who in the agency would provide grief counseling for adults with ID. If there was a contact made and the counselor met the criteria of experience counseling bereaved adults with ID, he or she was sent consent and study information. Approximately 350 general recruiting letters or e-mails were sent. The researcher made roughly 125 follow-up phone contacts. The first author utilized 18 interviews with hospice-affiliated bereavement counselors.</p>
<p>The participants all reported clinical experience counseling grieving individuals with ID. The counselors’ educational background was varied. Half (9 of the participants) had their master’s in social work. There were 2 with master of arts in marriage and family therapy, 4 with master of arts in counseling, 1 with a master of Arts in art therapy, 4 with master of arts in divinity, 1 of whom also had a doctorate in divinity. One participant had 2 master of arts degrees, 1 in divinity and 1 in counseling. The participants worked with a variety of bereavement clients. Some of the clients experienced hospice-related deaths only and some faced bereavement around nonhospice deaths. Several bereavement counselors rendered outreach to the community, specifically into group homes. Half of the participants had previous experience interacting and working with persons with ID. The participants gave estimates of the numbers of clients with ID that they had served. Two participants had each served over 100 adults with ID. In addition, the number of clients with ID reported served included 1 counselor served just 1 client; 3 counselors served 3 to 4 clients, 2 counselors served 11 to 20 clients, and 8 of the participants had worked with between 4 and 10 clients. The number of client seen by the 18 participants added up to well over 300 adults with ID.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049909112439617">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>Semistructured interview questions ranged from questions about reasons their clients with ID had been referred, details about the client’s death notification and involvement in grief rituals, how the clients showed their grief, additional losses, comparisons with other grief clients, interventions used, what worked, and what got in the way of the client coping with grief. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049909112439617">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>After phone contact and explanation of the study, consents were sent to a total of 26 bereavement counselors. Consents were received back from 23 counselors, all affiliated with a hospice bereavement program. After a participant agreed to be interviewed, consents were mailed. When the consent was returned, the researcher made a phone call to set up an interview appointment. The researcher collected all the interview data over the phone, except for 1 face-to-face interview. The researcher taped the interviews and they were transcribed by a professional typist. The first author then saved the transcripts into the ATLAS.ti qualitative software program. The transcripts were then sent to the participants to fact check. No corrections were made. The ATLAS.ti software was utilized to organize the data, write memos, and document codes and relationships of the data. The researcher had the responsibility to interpret and analyze the data using grounded theory.</p>
<p>The researcher analyzed the data on an ongoing basis. To begin the process, the researcher made notes about the data, using the memo function of ATLAS.ti. Memos included questions the data raised for the researcher and the researcher’s own reactions and observations. The researcher immersed herself into the data for long periods of time and then arranged for time away from the data to allow ideas to “simmer” and rise to the top of consciousness while in the midst of other activities.</p>
<p>After initial reading of the data, the researcher went back to the text of the interviews and started coding some of the words and phrases, looking for meaning within the data. Moving through the text, the researcher’s next job was to reduce the number of codes identified and find themes. Labels were given and categories created. Connally<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049909112439617">24</xref>
</sup> described this as the interpretive phase. “Axial coding”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049909112439617">22</xref>
</sup> is a procedure that was also used to help illustrate the dimensions of the categories and how the categories might relate to each other. This process involved looking for subcategories, as well. As Charmaz<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049909112439617">23</xref>
</sup> stated what is being done is “raising terms to concepts.”<sup>(p1163)</sup> Raw codes were numerous. The researcher reorganized and reduced them for the purpose of identifying categories or themes. For instance, originally a code for “protection” was developed as well as a code for “protection versus preparation.” These codes were merged. A more specific code, “caregiver/staff discomfort” was broadened to “discomfort.” In the following section, the authors will describe specific findings. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049909112439617">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Below is a summary of the conceptual categories of “Living Loss.” Using grounded theory methodology, the interview data coded as “history of loss,” “being protected,” and “being disregarded” formed the category Living Loss. The researcher analyzed the data supporting these codes to tell the counselors’ views of adults with ID growing up in a death- and grief-avoidant society. Participants noted that adults with ID often experienced loss of opportunities for careers, life goals, and financial stability. The data collected outlined the counselors’ perceptions of frustrations and obstacles many adults with ID face in processing their grief. The participants believed that an ID created obstacles for adults causing them to lose the privilege of information, full inclusion in decision making, and early preparation to any sort of loss or change. In Western society, ID has usually translated to dependence on others. If the adult with ID was in the care of others, the impact of the loss of a secure relationship may be downplayed or ignored due to caregiver discomfort or lack of knowledge. If the parent or caregiver died, the counselors described domino-affect secondary losses as being put into motion. The data described small social networks being drastically reduced when staff, family, or a friend died. For the client, social, recreational, resource losses accompanied the emotional aspects of loss. The data up to this point painted a picture of problems located outside the individual adult with ID. The participants stated that loss and change were inevitable. They insisted that those who are dependent on others, with small social circles must be carefully prepared for these losses. For the adults with ID discussed so far, the participants believed that they saw unintended consequences of loss heaped upon loss. In the following sections, examples of excerpts from the data Living Loss painted a picture of the counselors’ perceptions of the frustrations and obstacles many adults with ID faced in processing their grief. These challenges experienced by adults with ID included isolation, lack of information and understanding of death and grief, small support networks, and limited knowledge regarding coping skills. </p>
<sec id="section7-1049909112439617">
<title>History of Loss</title>
<p>Loss<bold> </bold>was the reason the counselors in this study came to know their clients. Primary loss through death was usually the event preceding the bereavement referral. Other losses were noted as the work with the adult with ID unfolded. Loss also involves history of loss, which is the lifelong accumulation of social injuries, missing developmental events, moves, changes, and separations from friends, roommates, family, and schools. Loss involves the realization for an adult with ID that their life was not equal to the lives of others without disability. Few achieve careers, marriages, cars, mortgages, and families. “The good life” as seen on TV is rarely their experience. Unfortunately, most live in poverty. The FINDS report states that those with ID/DD have “high levels of unemployment (85% of people with ID/DD did not have a job), decreases in employment services and unmet needs in the areas of job support.”<sup>5(iv)</sup> If they worked, they worried about making too much money and jeopardizing their Supplemental Security Income. </p>
<p>One participant described the loss often experienced by adults with ID by stating, <disp-quote>
<p>The universe seems to bring them loss after loss after loss after loss. But I’m not just talking about, you know, human loss. I’m talking about health loss. I’m talking about financial loss, security loss, relationship loss. It’s just multiple. (Participant Kim)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another participant elaborated on the loss unique to adults with ID. <disp-quote>
<p>The loss of independence, the loss of all of the usual milestones that everyone else reaches in their life, or many people, the loss of their family because they would be “put away.” So there was the loss of family; there’s a loss, I think, of privacy; a loss of comfort and intimacy, and safety, particularly for the people who were institutionalized. (Participant Dave)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The unique experience of loss by adults with ID was echoed by yet another participating grief counselor.<disp-quote>
<p>They see how other people live and they know that their life is not the same, and that’s a terrible sadness, I think, for some of them. (Participant Alecia)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As adults with ID aged, losses were described as cumulative. One, then 2 parents died. The participants discussed bereavement that was preceded by numerous other losses, moves, and deaths. As the participants told the stories of their clients, it became clear that accurate family histories may not be recorded or be available for adults with ID living in group situations. The residents may not have been able to verbally describe the deaths, the moves, or the lost friendships. The study participants described how adults with ID have experienced years of unacknowledged deaths of other residents and of staff. <disp-quote>
<p>… then all their other grief issues that they haven’t touched in their lives come rushing out. (Participant Chris)</p>
<p>Folks are aging and so, losses related to just their own bodies changing and that process. So, there’s just a lot that is going on for them that we can focus on in terms of loss. (Participant Nicole)</p>
<p>Then they might tell me about other losses—that their parents divorced, or that their dad or their mother abandoned them or left, and they were moved in with their aunt or uncle … and then they moved into some other place. (Participant Amy)</p>
</disp-quote>The data described adults with ID as no strangers to abuse and violence. Participants brought up the experience of abuse and violence as one of the defining losses shared by their clients. Loss of physical safety and fear of being hurt or victimized were evident for some.<disp-quote>
<p>When she just started discussing the rage towards her father, Mom finally had to throw him out of the house because he was abusing her. So often the grief work was over loss of safety, in that case. (Participant Marta)</p>
<p>There are things [that] came up like murder, watching father drown, watching somebody beat somebody else, a friend being shot in the street. You know, lots of losses can exist.(Participant Chris)</p>
</disp-quote>Other participants reported housing changes, staff transfers or resignations, shrinking of the social circle, fewer visits, and an array of other changes. Life changes were inevitable but for adults with ID, the social circle was described as very small. A small social network often intensified the impact of the changes that occurred within that network. A participant stated that the staff changes and reassignment of case managers had tremendous effects on the residents. She noted that it “adds to the insecurity.” Many of the other participants commented that staff changes were a major source of loss and transition for adults living in residential settings. Most noted that these losses went unrecognized and disregarded as potential losses to the residents. One participant in particular captured the ripple impact of changes in the social circle for adults with ID. <disp-quote>
<p>When a staff member leaves one of our facilities, there’s a loss. They always ask, “Well, I wonder what Jane’s doing now. Remember how she used to work with us and she really liked us, and she took us for ice cream?” That type of a loss. So they mourn a staff member leaving, or they mourn a friend moving away, and they mourn the loss of a pet. (Participant Lisa)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>“History of loss” was a rich code with many dimensions. In this case, it incorporated past losses of people, relationships, status, spaces, and opportunities, to name only a few. Casualties of self-esteem and opportunity are fitting examples of the intensely personal damage experienced as losses. The participants had the privilege and the heartbreak of seeing and hearing the clients’ experiences of being devalued and of witnessing the layers of their clients’ losses as they journeyed through life. Even for the researcher, hearing the events thirdhand, the stories of acute and chronic grief of adults with ID were still staggering.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049909112439617">
<title>Being Protected</title>
<p>Participants described many of the adults with ID as dependent on caregivers for daily needs of eating, dressing, toileting, and so on and decision making. Often these caregivers were presented as well intentioned but uninformed. There were some caregivers, for instance, who viewed adults with ID forever as children to be protected and shielded as noted in the literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049909112439617">25</xref>
</sup> Sometimes rather than being helped to move forward with all their losses, the counselors explained that the attempts to protect and shield kept their clients with ID stuck in the same place of pain and loneliness. As the researcher analyzed the data it was clear and noted in a memo that those providing the care and guidance for bereaved adults with ID live in a society that avoided discussion of death and dying and any attendant display of deep feelings. Little has been done to educate about grief and loss issues for any of society’s members, disabled or nondisabled. In Western society, the label ID usually means dependence on others. If the adult with ID was in the care of well-meaning but ill-informed others, the result may be the urge to protect the person with ID by sharing little information about change, illness, and death. Lack of information and inclusion into discussions around life changes and death can result in avoidance of discussion of losses and the perhaps inadvertent silencing of grief.</p>
<p>The data showed that many unintended consequences emerged as the result of sometimes well-meant protective reactions. Parents and caregivers were perceived by participants as viewing adults with ID as vulnerable and the parents and caregivers were described as struggling with how much to share, educate, and involve them. It was noted that the protective strategies only complicated the bereavement experience for her clients with ID for one participant. <disp-quote>
<p>There is this more socially normal avoidance of talking to children and disabled people about death, and that was one of the big factors of why, I think, they had such difficult times. (Participant Chris)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants conveyed the need to include adults with ID into discussions around life and death. <disp-quote>
<p>Allowing someone to participate in it rather than having it happen to them would be a good start (Participant Nicole)</p>
<p>This one particular person was never told. They knew their father was in bed and the mother had said he was tired and when he passed, he was not there when [the son] came home, and the mother never said where he [the father] went. (Participant Pat)</p>
<p>One client’s family just simply didn’t inform her … just sort of did everything around her. So I can say clearly that that was one family. And then I actually met with her.  They put her in a workshop, a sheltered workshop, and I actually met her at the sheltered workshop, and I think the referral was actually from the workshop, as I think about it.  It was like Mom never showed up at home and they put her in a board and care and sent her to the workshop. And, of course, she just vapor locked. (Participant Marta)</p>
<p>Don’t feel like you’re protecting that person from it, because we can’t protect people from death, you know ... . So the best thing we can do is teach them how to cope with it, and in order to teach them how to cope with it, we have to be able to let them know what’s going on. Give them the information they need so that they can have what they need to cope with it. (Participant Amy)</p>

As illustrated, limiting information and preventing early preparation or participation in death and dying discussions was described by participants as well intentioned but unhealthy for the adult with ID. Growing up and being included in adult discussions and decisions is often a missing milestone if one is labeled ID. These adults with ID were described as living almost in the shadows of their families at times of crisis or were viewed as somehow not the same as the rest of humanity, with feelings and needs overlooked. A researcher’s memo written during data analysis asked, “When does protection really deny participation?” Seasoned bereavement counselors stated that protection can impede preparation for loss and grief.</p>

<title>Being Disregarded</title>
<p>Other times, standing silently on the sideline, the adult with ID was described as forgotten or disregarded as a part of the grief or change process. The researcher noted in a memo that to be disregarded means to be overlooked, to not be attended to, or to be not seen. Visibility means easy to be seen, recognized, or discerned. It would be difficult for the feelings of a person with ID to be regarded when no one really saw him or her or perceived what he or she was trying to communicate. Neglect in paying attention to or failure in making an effort toward understanding behavior could have marginalized attempts by the adult with ID to communicate deep feelings. Participants noted that caregivers seemed to find grief-related behaviors often puzzling or annoying. Caregivers often then misunderstood these behaviors. Behavior was often reported as being what was noticed, not the person’s feelings or humanity. Participants commented that at times caregivers assumed that the client with ID was “fine” if the client did not display any problematic behavior.</p>
<p>Being overlooked can be associated with discomfort, coping obstacles, as well as with loss. Loss was a deep vein, a major component, in the counselor’s view of the experience of bereavement for adults with ID. Being separate and becoming invisible were reflected in the data below. <disp-quote>
<p>In the ideal world for me, is that we just have a culture in which however you function, you’re out there in the world functioning at your level and that we don’t have a category for people and a specialness for people. I think it’s the special container that we put people with disabilities in that enhances much more grief around life challenges. (Participant Marta)</p>
</disp-quote>
Many adults with ID also had unrecognized relationships. One participant discussed the impact of unrecognized relationships using an example of a resident who lost his long-term girlfriend.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Many of them do have long term relationships with someone and it’s an unrecognized relationship, so they aren’t necessarily included.  The group home will call the family and the family takes care of the funeral, but that doesn’t mean that the family includes his girlfriend from 30 years in the whole thing. (Participant Alecia)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other data excerpts illustrated the absence of regard given to an adult with ID.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[They] might be told by a staff member that, you know, “Your sister called and your father died last week.”(Participant Nicole)</p>
<p>One client whose mother had been on a ventilator. “February, March, April, May, June, the end of June, so five months, I was the only person that spent the time exploring his feelings with him.” (Participant Hannah)</p>
<p>I would say that people forget to think about them. They can’t call for themselves [for counseling]. (Participant Elizabeth)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In summary, the code “being disregarded” was related yet essentially a different entity when compared with the codes “being protected” and “history of loss.” Data labeled “being disregarded” contributed to the construction of the conceptual category, Living Loss.</p>

<sec id="section10-1049909112439617">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data discussed here captured the voices of grief counselors talking about bereaved adults with ID. What they expressed was that for each human being loss needs to be recognized and grief must be honored. The counselors described the long histories of unrecognized losses and the unintended consequences of protecting people with ID by avoiding informing them or including them in change, loss, and death scenarios. The interview data depicted individuals with ID being so invisible that they are often disregarded in times of crisis and loss.</p>
<p>Two broad concerns, protection and disregard spoke to how lack of preparation of families and paid staff came to shape the bereavement experience of individuals with ID. It is hoped that through summarizing key points from the data around the conceptual category Living Loss the reader can then be helped to perceive and understand the impact of death and loss. Perhaps closer attention can then be paid to the recommendations for education of the community and helping professionals, especially in palliative and hospice care. The authors believe that there are many points to begin work. Early death and grief education is essential for families. Organizations need to improve caregiver training on these topics. Death and grief education needs to be added to higher education and personnel preparation programs in health, elementary and secondary education programs, and counseling and social work curriculum. Until major changes occur in these areas, however, palliative and hospice care providers will still be dealing with the end results of misinformation and misguided responses from a reactive stance.</p>
<p>As with all research, it is necessary to begin by discussing the limitations of the study and its findings. Since the study was completed as an unfunded student dissertation, the sample size was small. The participants in this study were limited to hospice-affiliated bereavement counselors. Grief counselors in this study reported consistently that working with adults with ID who had not experienced problems coping was the exception, not the norm. It needs to be pointed out that bereavement counselors generally see the clients who are not coping well with bereavement. In addition, the data were perceptions about the adults with ID, so the experience was filtered through the eyes and worlds of the participants and then further filtered by the researcher.  </p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the findings regarding Living Loss were congruent with the existing literature. Three main concepts formed the backbone of Living Loss: history of loss, being protected, and being disregarded. Each of these concepts is reflected in the sparse existing literature. </p>
<p>Looking to the loss literature, the data supported the impact of loss as described by Brown.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049909112439617">26</xref>
</sup> The participating counselors noted the clients with ID had histories of loss of self-worth and social roles; loss of loved ones through death or staff moves; loss of home, neighborhoods, and possessions; and developmental losses such as their own aging, the aging of their parents, and the subsequent loss of parental ability to care for them. The data also supported the findings of Rando<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049909112439617">27</xref>
</sup> of secondary losses. The participants reported client moves to group homes; loss of family friends and the caregiving rituals and familiarity of their usual care. The data also echoed the findings of Dell’Aquila<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049909112439617">28</xref>
</sup> that “the social experience of being developmentally disabled does create a disadvantaged state from which to approach grief.”<sup>(p108) </sup> Most study participants noted that these losses were not acknowledged by caregivers. They also connected losses to the concept of disenfranchised grief.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909112439617">29</xref>
</sup> Study by McDaniel<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049909112439617">30</xref> </sup>described individuals with ID as feeling that they had been left out of family experiences when someone was gravely ill. Feeling left out was reflected clearly in this study’s narratives about “partial inclusion” of adults with ID in family experiences. With hospice assistance, some adults with ID were reported to be fully included around the time of death and after. The authors found that the work of Oswin<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049909112439617">31</xref>
</sup> provided a good opportunity for comparison of findings. She gathered data directly from adults with ID, as well as parents and caregivers. The first author’s and Oswin’s<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049909112439617">31</xref>
</sup> studies both documented misguided efforts of caregivers to protect or distract.</p>
<p>In summary, when adults with ID came to the grief counselor for bereavement help, it became evident to the counselor that long histories of disenfranchised grief<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049909112439617">29</xref> </sup>and unrecognized losses preceded the focal death loss. Societal disregard of persons with ID contributed to caregiver overlooking the impact of losses. In addition, participants described caregivers or guardians displaying protection behavior in times of loss. Small social circles can increase the impact of death of a loved one on an individual with ID. If these themes continue to be supported in other research findings, this has implications for palliative care and hospice workers. Professionals of all disciplines need education and training about death and grief issues for adults with ID and their families. Palliative care and hospice staff are on the front lines of identifying and legitimizing grief reactions. Education, support, and referrals should be provided as part of patient and family care. Mentoring, clinical supervision, and other means of education and training can assist helping professionals to see the commonalities between those with ID who are hurting and others in pain. In addition, workers in palliative care and hospice should provide and recommend education for informal and formal caregivers for those with ID around grief and loss.</p>
<p>Participants voiced that adults with ID do not always need specially prescribed bereavement treatments. Like everyone else, what they usually need before, during, and after a loss is someone who attends to their needs not as a person with a disability but as a person with unique abilities and needs. Any health care professional should be able to help in some way on the grief journey of an adult with ID. On the macro level, professional preparation should include working with clients with ID and their families. On the mezzo or agency level, systems supporting formal and informal care providers should also expand resources for individuals with ID and their families. Partnering with organizations such as Arc's is a way to blend scarce resources. On the micro, individual level, practitioners must increase their own comfort and knowledge working with individuals with ID. These patients deserve the quality care and professionals who will accompany them on difficult journeys of loss.</p>
<p>As death touches everyone, bringing public awareness to issues of grief and loss is beneficial to all individuals, communities, and a larger society. Hospice professionals, especially, have the knowledge, skills, and expertise to take a lead in this journey. Assisting others to see the commonalities between adults with ID and typical adults around death and grief is viewed as having potential to decrease the isolation and lost opportunities for adults with ID.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Through the lens of bereavement counselors’ perceptions, this study aimed to shed light on the bereavement experience in adults with ID. The findings from this study, along with existing literature, point out a serious need for education and training for families as well as professionals. As our society attempts to hide or avoid death and dying, individuals who experience loss often mourn alone. Until Western society becomes more comfortable with death and grief, palliative care and hospice professionals will continue to educate about “end-of-life” issues at the literal end of life. In addition, until typical people, professionals included, being to see individuals with ID as humans with the same emotions, their grief may be overlooked. Palliative care and hospice workers have an obligation to be one group of professionals who identify, support, and, if necessary, treat the grief of those with ID. The hope is that over time, there will be less need for end-of-life care providers to be the lone educators and supporters about death and grief for any individual.</p>
