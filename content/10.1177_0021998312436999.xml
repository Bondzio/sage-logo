<abstract>
<p>Polypropylene (PP)/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposites were prepared by melt compounding. Prior compounding, surface of the particles were modified with different compatilibizers such as silane and stearic acid. Modification was also done by coating the particles with maleic anhydride grafted styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS-g-MA) block copolymer dissolved in toluene. Specimens of tensile test, impact test, and antibacterial efficiency test were obtained by injection molding. The results showed that stearic acid and silane containing composites gave structures with fine distributed particles while the presence of SEBS-g-MA induced agglomerates. The presence of stearic acid increased tensile strength and impact strength but reduced elastic modulus. Silane was more effective in increasing elastic modulus. Despite the elastomeric nature of SEBS-g-MA, it did not rise impact strength due to its limited amount of usage in coating of the particles. Antibacterial properties of the composites reduced with the increment of ZnO loading because of the weak UV absorption and insufficient photocatalytic activity of the particles. On contrary, at low ZnO content, satisfactorily high antibacterial effect was observed especially in well dispersed structures including stearic acid and silane.</p>

<p>Polymer composites filled with inorganic nanoparticles provide flexibility in designing advanced materials. The inorganic particles give better surface adhesion with polymers, which is poor when they are in micron structured. This attributes the incorporation of easy formability of the polymer and high strength of the particles inducing better mechanical, electrical, and optical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312436999">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312436999">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several inorganic nanoparticles such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and ZnO being used to improve mechanical properties of the polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312436999">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312436999">6</xref></sup> Despite the significant improvement of mechanical properties, the particles can induce reduction in toughness due to their stiffness. Therefore, by addition of both elastomeric phase and inorganic reinforcement in polymer matrix, a good balance of stiffness to toughness can be achieved. The mostly experienced elastomers are styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312436999">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312436999">8</xref></sup> ethylene-propylene diene monomer elastomer (EPDM),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312436999">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312436999">10</xref></sup> and ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312436999">11</xref></sup> to increase the toughness of the hybrid composites.</p>
<p>During studying with nanoparticles, one of the problems that can be encountered is the agglomeration of particles. Agglomerates in matrix reduce the quality of composite and therefore, dispersants and compatibilizers must be used to overcome this problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312436999">12</xref></sup> Maleic anhydride,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312436999">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312436999">16</xref></sup> silane,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312436999">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312436999">17</xref></sup> and stearic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312436999">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312436999">20</xref></sup> are the most preferred compatibilizers. Polymers grafted maleic anhydride such as PP-MA or SEBS-g-MA have been generally used in hybrid composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312436999">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312436999">22</xref></sup> Tjong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312436999">23</xref></sup> used SEBS-g-MA in PP/montnorillonite composites. While SEBS increased the toughness of the composite, maleic anhydride acted as compatilibizer between the inorganic particle and the matrix. Silane is another coupling agent that provides fine dispersion of inorganic particles. Hashimoto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312436999">17</xref></sup> used silane with titan dioxide in HDPE composites and they reported that the hydrocarbon group of silane acted well with HDPE and helped to improve mechanical strength of the composite. Silane was also used in PP matrix composites filled with different metal oxides like silicate and zinc oxide by Kruenate et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312436999">4</xref></sup> They improved the optical and mechanical properties of the composite. Huang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312436999">18</xref></sup> used stearic acid as dispersant in nano-ZnO particle reinforced PP composites. They achieved structures with fine dispersed particles and they observed increment in tensile strength, flexural strength and flexural modulus of the composites.</p>
<p>Inorganic particles not only increase mechanical strength but also some of them can provide antibacterial property to the polymers. Products made from plastics can be sterilized by ethylene oxide or ionizing radiation. However, they can still be contaminated or infected by microorganisms when exposed to air. There are many methods to make polymers antibacterial by halogenazition or copolymerization but melt mixing with an antibacterial agent is the most convenient method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312436999">24</xref></sup> During the process of melt compounding, inorganic fillers are generally introduced into polymers as the antibacterial agent. The antibacterial agents like TiO<sub>2</sub> and ZnO have photocatalytic activity under UV light and by this way the production of oxygen species is effective in killing bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312436999">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312436999">26</xref></sup> Some researchers reported that nano-ZnO particles were also antibacterial even in dark but less efficiently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312436999">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312436999">28</xref></sup> Nanoparticles are known to have better antibacterial activity than micro-sized particles. Linsebigler et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021998312436999">29</xref></sup> showed that smaller semiconductor particles could increase the surface area and catalytic effect. However, the particle size, the dispersion and the concentration of the nano-ZnO used with in polymer composites are still under research.</p>
<p>Researches on the antibacterial property of ZnO had started in the early of 1950s and then studies continued on the antibacterial activities of the metal oxides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021998312436999">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998312436999">34</xref></sup> There have been many researchers from different areas investigated antibacterial effect of nano-ZnO particles. Premanathan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998312436999">35</xref></sup> used nano-ZnO in developing nanomedicine and killing cancer cells. Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998312436999">36</xref></sup> used nano-ZnO in wastewater treatment. As it is known, nanocomposites have attracted a great deal attention due to their improved properties. Akhavan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998312436999">37</xref></sup> studied two types of unfunctionalized and functionalized multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to be applied in fabrication of MWCNT–ZnO nanocomposite thin films. They investigated antibacterial activity of the nanocomposites provided by ZnO against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> on the surface of the composites and they obtained significantly strong photoinactivation of the bacteria onto the surface of the functionalized MWCNT–ZnO nanocomposites. Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021998312436999">38</xref></sup> used nano-ZnO particles in polyurethane films and they investigated antibacterial and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites. They improved both properties of the nanocomposites significantly and in their study the optimal content of ZnO was found 2 wt%. Although, the antibacterial effect of ZnO has been known for many years, there have been seen very few studies on the antibacterial property of the polymer nanocomposite parts obtained by injection molding. Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312436999">24</xref></sup> used nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> particles as antibacterial agent in observing antibacterial properties of injection molded polystyrene nanocomposites and they found that low content of TiO<sub>2</sub> such as 1 wt% gave better antibacterial property.</p>
<p>Polypropylene, one of the most popular polymer, finds widespread applications in many industrial areas. In this study, polypropylene composites including nano-ZnO particles were prepared by melt compounding and different compatibilizers were employed for better adhesion and dispersion. Then, the composites were injection molded and their antibacterial and mechanical properties were investigated according to nano-ZnO content and the compatibilizers.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0021998312436999"><title>Experimental study</title>
<p><italic>Materials</italic>. Polymer material used in this study was polypropylene copolymer (56M10, Sabic Company) with melt flow index of 6.2 g/10 min, density of 0.902 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312436999">3</xref></sup>. Nanomaterial was ZnO (20 nm, Nabond Company, China). Vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS, Aldrich), stearic acid (Merck, Germany) and SEBS-g-MA (Kraton, France) were used for modifying particles.</p>
<p><italic>Modification of ZnO particles with compatibilizers</italic>. Nano-ZnO particles were modified with three different materials: silane, stearic acid, and SEBS-g-MA. Prior modification, all ZnO particles were dried under vacuum. For silane coating, a solution of 96% absolute alcohol and 4% distilled water with 1% silane was prepared. Pure nanoparticles was added slowly into this solution and mixed for 3 h with a mechanical mixer (IKA RW 20 digital). The mixture was pulverized after drying the mixture at 50°C for 8 h. In stearic acid application, stearic acid was dissolved in chloroform in 24 h at room temperature. Then, pure nano-ZnO particles were added into this solution and mixed for 3 h followed by pulverization. The amount of the stearic acid was 6% of the ZnO particles. SEBS-g-MA was used by dissolving it in toluene in 48 h at room temperature. Then, pure nano-ZnO particles were added slowly into the solution. The amount of the SEBS-g-MA was 3% of the ZnO particles. Drying and pulverization were similar to silane and stearic acid treatment.</p>
<p><italic>Compounding</italic>. The surface modified nano-ZnO particles were added into polymer in three different ratios as 1, 3, and 5 wt%. A twin-screw extruder (Rondol MicroLab, England) with L/D ratio of 20 was used for compounding. The operation temperature was set as 220°C, 200°C, 180°C, 120°C, and 75°C and the speed of the screw was 60 rpm. The extrudate strands were granulized and dried at 80°C under vacuum for two hours. The codes of the composites were given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312436999">Table 1</xref>.

<p><italic>FT-IR</italic>. FT-IR spectra of the pure ZnO and surface modified ZnO particles were obtained between 650 and 4000 cm<sup>−1</sup> by using of Perkin Elmer Spectrum 100.</p>
<p><italic>Differential scanning calorimetry</italic>. The melting and crystallization behaviors of the composites were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Perkin Elmer DSC-7) in nitrogen atmosphere. The samples (4–5 mg) were heated from 40°C to 180°C at 10°C/min and held at 180°C for 5 min and then cooled back to 40°C at 10°C/min and held 5 min at 40°C. Then, second heating cycle was performed to delete the thermal history of the samples. The melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>), crystallization temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub>), and degree of the crystallization (<italic>X</italic><sub>c</sub>) were obtained. For calculating degree of crystallization, the enthalpy of the 100% crystalline phase of PP was taken as 209 J/g.</p>
<p><italic>Injection molding.</italic> The dried composite granules were injection molded with a 40 tone injection molding machine (Yelkenciler, Turkey) to obtain tensile test specimens (ISO 527) and impact test specimens (ISO 180). Antibacterial test specimens were also obtained by injection molding as plaques of 30 mm × 30 mm. The mold temperature was 40°C, injection pressure was 65 MPa, holding pressure was 45 MPa, holding time was 15 s and cooling time was taken as 10 s.</p>
<p><italic>Mechanical test</italic>. Tensile test was carried out by universal tensile machine (Zwick Z010) at room temperature. The speed of the cross head was 50 mm/min. The izod impact test was performed on the notched specimens by using a 5.4 J pendulum hammer on the Zwick impact test machine. The tests were repeated for three times and their average was taken.</p>
<p><italic>Scanning electron microscope</italic>. Morphology of the fracture surface of the each specimen was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (XL-306 ESEM FEG, Philips). All the specimens were coated with gold prior SEM analysis.</p>
<p><italic>Antibacterial test</italic>. Bacterial activity of the injection molded composite specimens (30 mm × 30 mm plaques) was evaluated by examining their killing capability of <italic>E. coli</italic> using viable cell counting technique, a standard method, JIS Z 2801.The schematic picture of the method is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312436999">Figure 1</xref>. Prior the test, the plaques were firstly disinfected with ethanol and then they were exposed to UV light with the wavelength between 300 and 400 nm for 2 h. The distance between the UV light and the specimen was kept as 10 cm. In order to apply antibacterial test to the plaques, 50 µL of the solution containing of <italic>E. coli</italic> of 10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units was dropped onto the composite plaques and then nontoxic polyethylene films were used to cover the specimens having Luria Bertani (LB) agar. The cultures were grown at 37°C for 24 h. Then, films were washed in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution. The diluted series were prepared from the washed suspensions of the cells and these series were incubated again. The surviving bacteria in the diluted solution were counted by using spread plate method. The difference between number of surviving viable cells on the antibacterial composites and that on the comparison culture dish was first calculated out and the logarithmic reduction of the surviving viable cells on the comparison culture dish was determined.

<p>IR spectra of the modified ZnO particles were given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312436999">Figure 2</xref>. The spectra of the ZnO particles modified with different compatibilizers (b-c-d) give peaks that are absent in the spectrum of pure ZnO (a). The band of 1018 cm<sup>−1</sup> in spectrum (b) is due to Si–O bonds in silane. Silane undergoes some chemical reactions during hydrolysis and drying. SiOCH<sub>3</sub> group transforms into SiOH. Then, the hydrolyzed alkoxysilanol can be absorbed into the surface and condenses with hydroxyl group of ZnO. This formation induced the peak of 940 cm<sup>−1</sup> that corresponds to Si–O–Zn. The peak seen in spectrum (c) about 2928 cm<sup>−1</sup> was due to stretching of C–H of stearic acid. The strong peak of 1740 cm<sup>−1</sup> is because of stretching of C=O groups of stearic acid. In the spectrum of SEBS-g-MA coated ZnO particles (d), strong and sharp peaks were observed between 2800 and 3000 cm<sup>−1</sup> due to the stretching of the CH<sub>3</sub> group of SEBS and peaks of 1740 cm<sup>−1</sup> was attributed to the C=O group of maleic anhydride. All these showed that the surface of the nano-ZnO particles was modified with these compatibilizers successfully.

<sec id="sec5-0021998312436999"><title>Thermal properties of the composites</title>
<p>The DSC results of the composites were given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312436999">Table 2</xref>. Melt temperature, crystallization temperature, and degree of crystallization of the composites varied according to the compatibilizers. Silane increased all thermal properties of the composites slightly. The apparent increment in degree of crystallization showed that silane was effective in dispersion of the nanoparticles and molecular movement of the polymer chains was not prevented by the particles. As Rybnikar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998312436999">39</xref></sup> reported, surface treatment of the inorganic particles is very effective on the nucleating agent behavior of the particles. Nucleating efficiency can be increased or decreased by a suitable surface treatment. As a consequence, in this study, ZnO particles modified with silane behaved like nucleating agent. On the other hand, stearic acid coated ZnO particles decreased crystallization temperature and degree of crystallization of the composites. This is because, the treatment of ZnO with stearic acid, apparently reduced the surface energy of the ZnO particles and therefore it could not act as strong nucleating species as has been seen in some previous study on inorganic particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021998312436999">40</xref></sup> Similarly, ZnO particles modified with SEBS-g-MA gave serious reductions in the amount of crystallinity. This showed that SEBS-g-MA coated ZnO particles were not dispersed well and insufficient adhesion between phases induced possible agglomerates, given in following SEM results, preventing crystal growth of PP. Also, as seen in previous study of Kusmono et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998312436999">41</xref></sup> SEBS-g-MA tended to decrease of crystallinity of the matrix due to its elastomer nature.

<p>The results of mechanical tests are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312436999">Figures 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436999">5</xref>. Variation of tensile strength according to compatibilizers and ZnO content is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312436999">Figure 3</xref>. Tensile strength generally increased with the increase of ZnO content due to the stiffness of inorganic particles. The higher tensile strength was obtained in the presence of stearic acid. PP/ZnO/SA5 gave highest tensile strength followed by PP/ZnO/Silane5. Although PP/ZnO/SEBS-g-MA 5 contains the same amount of ZnO with PP/ZnO/SA 5 and PP/ZnO/Silane 5, it gave lower tensile strength due to the presence of elastomeric phase of SEBS-g-MA. The compatibilizing effect of SEBS-g-MA is provided by maleic anhydride groups. As it is known, metal oxide nanoparticles has a polar and PP has non polar surfaces, for this reason the surface adhesion between them is very poor. When the particles were coated with SEBS-g-MA, maleic anhydride functional groups grafted to ethylene butylenes (EB) mid block of the SEBS could react with hydroxyl groups of the particle surfaces during melt mixing. As a result of adhesion, higher tensile strength than that of pure PP was obtained but not higher than that of composites with stearic acid.

<p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436999">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436999">5</xref> display the elastic modulus and impact strength of the composites, respectively. The presence of stearic acid provided toughness to the composites by means of molecular flexibility of the polymer matrix and this induced higher impact strength but lower elastic modulus as seen in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312436999">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312436999">5</xref> (No. 2,3,4). The reason of lower elastic modulus than that of pure PP was the plasticizing effect of the stearic acid. Silane gave increment of elastic modulus, especially in 5% ZnO content. As explained before, the fine dispersion of the silane-coated particles and good adhesion between the matrix and particles enhanced elastic modulus. On the other hand, the composite with SEBS-MA gave high elastic modulus only in the low ratio of ZnO content like 1% (PP/ZnO/SEBS-g-MA 1) which almost gave the same value with PP/ZnO/Silane 5. With the increment of the ZnO content (No. 6,7), the elastic modulus decreased because of the presence of the agglomerates as discussed before. When the particle content increased, because SEBS-g-MA did not provide good dispersion as much as silane and stearic acid, agglomerates increased and interfacial filler–polymer adhesion diminished. Depending on that, despite the presence of the elastomer phase in the composites of PP/ZnO/SEBS-g-MA (No. 5,6,7), lower impact strength was observed. As it is known, each agglomerate induces cracking effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312436999">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021998312436999">42</xref></sup> and this reduces impact strength and also tensile strength of the material. This confirms the result of the low tensile strength of SEBS-MA including composites. Also, another reason of the poor effect of SEBS-g –MA in increasing the impact strength of the composites was due to the usage of it in very low ratio differently from the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998312436999">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021998312436999">43</xref></sup> In the previous studies on hybrid composites of inorganic particles and polymers, SEBS-g-MA was added directly into extruder in higher ratios and researchers aimed to increase the toughness of the composite. In this study, during coating of nanoparticles with dissolved SEBS-g-MA, it is impossible to use high ratio of SEBS-g-MA because pulverization of the particles can not be performed when the nanoparticles were coated with the high amount of solidified SEBS-g-MA.</p>

<p>The antibacterial effects of the injection molded composites is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312436999">Table 3</xref>.

<p>According to the standard JIS Z 2801, the logarithmic reduction must be equal to or higher than 2 in order to accept the material antibacterial. The general trend seen among the composites given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312436999">Table 3</xref> is the better antibacterial efficiency of silane and stearic acid including composites while SEBS-g-MA included composites are not successful that much. This result was confirmed with the photographs given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312436999">Figure 7</xref>.</p>
<p>The antibacterial mechanism of ZnO is based on photocatalytic activity of the particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021998312436999">34</xref></sup> When the particles in the matrix do not disperse well, the photocatalytic activity of the particles decreases because the particles may mask each other during UV exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312436999">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998312436999">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021998312436999">45</xref></sup> As given in SEM micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312436999">Figure 6(a)</xref>, the composites including SEBS-g-MA showed a structure of having big agglomerates and many of them are almost bigger than 1 µm in size, which explains the reduction of antibacterial activity of them. In the antibacterial mechanism of ZnO, Zn<sup>+2</sup> is responsible for the antibacterial activity and the role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion is the binding of the ions to the membranes of microorganisms that can prolong the lag phase of the microbial growth cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021998312436999">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021998312436999">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concentration of ZnO in the composite is also another important factor in antibacterial efficiency due to achieving higher photocatalytic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312436999">24</xref></sup> In this study, it was observed that in lower concentrations of particle content, higher logarithmic reduction was observed. The reason of this is due to the of better photocatayltic activation of the particles without masking each other as given above.</p>
<p>The EDAX x-ray mappings (FEI Phillips XL30 ESEM-FEG) of the surfaces of the specimens confirm this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312436999">Figure 9</xref>). In these mappings Zn element distribution was observed that correspond to the composites having the best (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312436999">Figure 9(a)</xref>) and the worst (Figure (b)) antibacterial property, respectively. There have been seen many overlapped particles in the map of PP/ZnO/SA5 while more dispersed element distribution was observed in the map of PP/ZnO/SA1.

<p>Stearic acid, silane, and SEBS-g-MA were used as compatibilizers in preparation of PP/ZnO nanocomposites. Stearic acid and silane showed better compatibilizing effect than that of SEBS-g-MA which influenced both mechanical and antibacterial properties of the composites seriously. Composites included stearic acid gave higher tensile strength and impact strength but lower elastic modulus when compared with the other composites. On the other hand, the presence of silane induced higher elastic modulus in high content of ZnO particles. SEBS-g-MA coated ZnO particles tended to agglomerate and as a result, mechanical properties of PP/ZnO/SEBS-g-MA were generally poorer than that of others. Antibacterial efficiency of the specimens was investigated after UV light exposure. Depending on the fine and uniform dispersion of the particles, the composites of PP/ZnO/Stearic acid and PP/ZnO/Silane showed better antibacterial property against <italic>E. coli</italic>. On the contrary, SEBS-g-MA containing composites gave lower reduction of grown bacteria colonies (&lt;log2) which is not antimicrobial according to the standard. Furthermore, it was observed that in high ZnO addition like 5%, antibacterial property became worse. Randomly and fine dispersed ZnO loadings of 1% and 3% gave better results due to higher absorption of UV light and better photocatalytic reaction.</p>
