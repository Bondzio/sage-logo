<p>The editors and the editorial committee of <italic>East European Politics and Societies and Cultures</italic> grieve the passing of Michael Heim, professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures, University of California, Los Angeles. Michael was one of the most active and influential members of the old Joint Committee on Eastern Europe, which brought forth our journal. As a member of our editorial committee from 1990, during the past twenty-two years he significantly contributed to our achievements in East European literatures, a field that he mastered as only a true comparativist can. He was equally at home in Russian, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, and Hungarian literatures, from which he extensively translated, but no less so than in various West European literatures, his translations from French and German being no less representative. He rendered various works of Milan Kundera, Bohumil Hrabal, Danilo Kiš, Péter Esterházy, Dubravka Ugrešić, Miloš Crnjanski, György Konrád, and many no less significant authors into subtle English. The playfulness of his skill is evident from the example of Ugrešić’s title <italic>Forsiranje romana reke</italic>, which Heim turned into <italic>Fording the Stream of Consciousness</italic> (1988). An important scholar of twentieth-century Russian literature in his own right, Michael will be most remembered as a herald of literary trends from the tension-ridden European societies. He was somewhat disappointed in the literary effects of East European democratic transition. Turning away from the dullness of the recent fare and true to his calling, Michael was of late learning Chinese. We shall miss him greatly.</p>
