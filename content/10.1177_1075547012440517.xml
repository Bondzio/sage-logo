<abstract>
<p>This study investigated effects of frames, science background, and stem cell source on attributions of ethicality, credibility, and usefulness of stem cell research. Framing did not influence perceptions of ethicality, but science majors tended to perceive embryonic research to be more ethical than did nonscience majors. Nonscience majors perceived stem cell research to be less credible than did science majors in an Economic Prospects frame. Science majors perceived embryonic research to be more useful than did nonscience majors except in a Conflict frame. Results suggest that frames cue heuristics that bias science and nonscience majors’ cognitions about stem cell research differently.</p>

<p>Frames, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547012440517">Entman’s (1993)</xref> definition, “select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described” (p. 52). Science communication scholars have identified a number of recurring frames that shape public communication about science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547012440517">Nisbet &amp; Scheufele, 2007</xref>) and have argued that scientists need to strategically frame their work in order to win public support for controversial scientific research and ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547012440517">Nisbet &amp; Moony, 2007</xref>). For example, the National Academy of Science finds that framing evolution in terms of social progress, “as the building block for medical advances,” is an effective strategy for winning over skeptical audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547012440517">Nisbet, 2010</xref>, p. 53). In the context of socioscientific controversies, “comprising communicative events and practices in and from both scientific and nonscientific spheres” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547012440517">Stewart, 2009</xref>, p. 125), various communicators, including scientists, journalists, and members of the public, use frames to “help simplify complex issues by lending greater weight to certain considerations and arguments over others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547012440517">Nisbet, 2010</xref>, p. 44). In other words, frames are features of messages that resonate with audiences’ “interpretive schema” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547012440517">Nisbet, 2010</xref>, p. 44) and thereby influence members of the public to accept or reject controversial scientific ideas or policies. Operationally, frames are message variables that can be strategically deployed (or experimentally manipulated) to influence individuals’ cognitive responses to messages and thus influence their attitudes or opinions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547012440517">D’Angelo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547012440517">Scheufele, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study is to investigate three potential influences on people’s opinions toward stem cell research: news frames (Scientific Progress, Economic Prospects, or Political Conflict), academic background (majors in a natural or health science field vs. a general undergraduate sample), and the source of the stem cell (embryonic vs. adult). As science communication scholars have long noted, there is no distinct line separating lay from expert audiences for science communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1075547012440517">Gregory &amp; Miller, 1998</xref>). That is, prior knowledge, interests, and attitudes vary among audiences for public communication about science. While college students comprise a convenience sample for this study, this sampling strategy allows for the comparison of two groups of educated lay people with differing levels of science education, interest, and motivation: science majors and nonscience majors. The following section describes public controversies about stem cell research and potential influences on public opinion in the context of such controversies. The next section then proposes dual-process theories of information processing and framing as a possible explanatory framework for how news messages influence individuals’ beliefs and attitudes about stem cell research. Finally, the present study’s framework and hypotheses are presented.</p>

<title>Public Controversies Over Stem Cell Research</title>
<p>Debates over embryonic stem cell research constitute a socioscientific controversy where framing plays an important role. Human embryonic stem cell research has been the subject of public controversy in the United States ever since these cells—which have the potential to become “any cell or organ in the body”—were first isolated in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547012440517">Scott, 2006</xref>, p. 10). Research on biotechnology, including stem cell research, tends to be framed in terms of Scientific Progress and Economic Prospects (benefits to the economy, investors, etc.) until it becomes the subject of socioscientific controveries, at which point political frames, such as conflict frames, become more prevalent in news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547012440517">Dahinden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547012440517">Nisbet &amp; Lewenstein, 2002</xref>). In 2001, former President George W. Bush instituted a ban on federal funding for research that would use new stem cell lines derived from human embryos while supporting research on stem cells derived from adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547012440517">Bush, 2001</xref>). Political Conflict frames dominated much of the discourse about stem cell research at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547012440517">Nisbet, Brossard, &amp; Kroepsch, 2003</xref>), and embryonic and adult stem cells were frequently positioned in opposition to one another in public discourse. Embryonic stem cells were represented either as having the potential for medical breakthroughs or as leading to the destruction of a human life; adult stem cells were represented either as ersatz stem cells or as equally useful and ethically less problematic than embryonic stem cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547012440517">Kitzinger &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1075547012440517">Lynch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547012440517">Williams, Kitzinger, &amp; Henderson, 2003</xref>). Recent studies confirm that Political Conflict and strategy frames predominate U.S. newspaper coverage of embryonic stem cell research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547012440517">Dahmen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547012440517">Fahmy, Relly, &amp; Wanta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1075547012440517">Reis, 2008</xref>), although the overall valence of the coverage in three major U.S. newspapers is positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547012440517">Fahmy et al., 2010</xref>). Recent years have seen scientific breakthroughs in human adult stem cell research and President Barack Obama allowing federal funding for research on new embryonic stem cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547012440517">Obama, 2009</xref>). However, the use of human embryos in stem cell research remains controversial.</p>

<title>Influences on Opinions About Stem Cell Research</title>
<p>As discussed above, various content and qualitative analyses have shown how U.S. news media frame embryonic and adult stem cell research. Experimental studies have shown how these frames influence individuals’ attitudes and opinions toward stem cell research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547012440517">Lee, McLeod, and Shah (2008)</xref> compared the effects of a strategy frame (emphasizing politics) and a values frame (emphasizing morals and ethics) on the considerations influencing individuals’ support for embryonic stem cell research. Strategy framing removed the influence of political partisanship but amplified the influence of abortion attitudes on support for embryonic stem cell research, compared to both a values frame and a control condition. In a similar comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012440517">Yun, Nah, &amp; McLeod, 2008</xref>), strategy and ethical frames differently influenced participants who are high or low in personal involvement on the stem cell issue. In the strategy frame, highly involved participants showed significantly greater “anger toward the Bush administration” (p. 313), whereas in a values frame, less involved participants showed greater support for embryonic stem cell research. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart, Dickerson, and Hotchkiss (2009)</xref> found that frames influence participants’ evaluations of the ethicality of an adult versus an embryonic stem cell study. Participants exposed to a conflict frame judged the adult stem cell study to be much more ethical, those exposed to an economic prospect frame judged the adult stem cell study to be somewhat more ethical, and those exposed to a Scientific Progress frame judged the adult and embryonic stem cell studies to be equally ethical.</p>
<p>Besides news frames, previous research reveals a number of other influences on people’s opinions about embryonic stem cell research. These include religiosity and political ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547012440517">Ho, Brossard, &amp; Scheufele, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012440517">Liu &amp; Priest, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547012440517">Nisbet, 2004</xref>), beliefs about the relationship between science and religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>), beliefs about when life begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547012440517">Nisbet &amp; Goidel, 2007</xref>), beliefs about the moral status of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547012440517">Pardo &amp; Calvo, 2008</xref>), use of science media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547012440517">Ho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012440517">Liu &amp; Priest, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>), science knowledge or background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547012440517">Ho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>), and trust in scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547012440517">Critchley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012440517">Liu &amp; Priest, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547012440517">Pardo &amp; Calvo, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Dual-Process Theories and Framing Effects</title>
<p>Each of the variables discussed above may influence how individuals process messages about stem cell research by influencing whether they generate more positive or negative cognitive responses to a message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547012440517">Petty &amp; Caccioppo, 1986</xref>). News frames may also influence the valence of these cognitive responses that shape the formation of attitudes when processing messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547012440517">Igartua &amp; Cheng, 2009</xref>). With respect to processing news stories about stem cell research, frames influence the degree to which political partisanship and abortion attitudes predict support for embryonic stem research, suggesting that frames alter the considerations that people use when evaluating a message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547012440517">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). That is, a conflict frame may increase the extent to which, for example, one’s antiabortion attitudes contribute to negative cognitive responses toward using human embryos in research. Similarly, the difference in perceived ethics between an adult and embryonic stem cell study depends on framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that conflict framing may lead to more negative cognitive responses when evaluating the ethics of an embryonic stem cell study relative to an adult stem cell study.</p>
<p>Dual-process theories of information processing, such as the elaboration likelihood model (ELM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547012440517">Petty &amp; Cacciopo, 1986</xref>) and the heuristic systematic model (HSM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012440517">Todorov, Chaiken, &amp; Henderson, 2002</xref>), posit that individuals with sufficient cognitive resources, such as ability and attention, and higher motivation will tend to engage in more careful processing of messages. In this kind of processing, referred to as central route processing in the ELM or systematic processing in the HSM, message effects on attitudes and opinions are the result of positive or negative cognitive responses to substantive message features. Conversely, when motivation and ability to process a message are low, people tend to engage in peripheral (ELM) or heuristic (HSM) message processing. Under these circumstances, message cues (e.g., source attractiveness) are more influential in affecting recipients’ attitudes. Frames may function as heuristic or biasing cues in message processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547012440517">Igartua &amp; Cheng, 2009</xref>). Heuristic cues trigger “simple rules, schemata, or heuristics” that enable easy evaluations of a message in heuristic message processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012440517">Todorov et al., 2002</xref>, p. 197). Similarly, framing effects on the individual level—the level at which the HSM works—have been described as “activating” preexisting schemata, modifying preexisting schemata, establishing new schemata, or finally, “alter[ing] attitudes or opinions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547012440517">Scheufele &amp; Scheufele, 2010</xref>, p. 112).</p>
<p>The HSM does not presuppose that message recipients only engage in either systematic or heuristic message processing. Heuristic processing can occur in tandem with systematic processing, such that heuristic cues can bias systematic processing of ambiguous messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012440517">Todorov et al., 2002</xref>). Dual-process theories such as the HSM complement a cognitive approach to individual framing effects because they suggest that frames will have interactive effects with participant variables, such as personal issue involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012440517">Yun et al., 2008</xref>), preexisting attitudes and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547012440517">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), group identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547012440517">Igartua &amp; Cheng, 2009</xref>), or cultural background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1075547012440517">Ko &amp; Kim, 2010</xref>), that may influence how messages are processed (heuristically or systematically), the valence of cognitive responses in systematic processing, and the heuristics that are likely to be cued for message recipients by a particular frame, which may bias cognitive responses in systematic processing.</p>
<sec id="section4-1075547012440517">
<title>Science Background and Heuristic/Biased Processing</title>
<p>Variation in knowledge about science can have important influences on attitudes toward science in general (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547012440517">Sturgis &amp; Allum, 2004</xref>) and toward controversial science, such as embryonic stem cell research, in particular. Higher science knowledge predicts more positive attitudes toward embryonic stem cell research for individuals who are low in religiosity, are more politically liberal, and show higher deference to scientific authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547012440517">Ho et al., 2008</xref>). Deference to scientific authority is positively associated with science education; that is, more science education is related to greater deference to scientific authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547012440517">Brossard &amp; Nisbet, 2006</xref>). Compared to other college students, science majors have been shown to have more positive general attitudes toward science compared to nonscience majors. Science majors have more favorable attitudes regarding, for example, the “value of science in society” and “motivation in science” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547012440517">Gogolin &amp; Swartz, 1992</xref>, p. 491). In a study involving students at three U.S. universities, science majors tended to more strongly hold beliefs that are supportive of science in relation to a number other cultural issues, such as the role of science in public policy, public health, and the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>If frames function as biasing cues, then they do not necessarily influence attitudes (i.e., “a person’s general evaluation of an [attitude] object”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547012440517">O’Keefe, 2002</xref>, p. 6) directly but instead make available or accessible heuristics that may bias the valence of more systematic cognitive responses to a message (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547012440517">Chaiken &amp; Maheswaran, 1994</xref>). Framing effects will therefore depend not only on a receiver’s message-processing strategy (heuristic vs. systematic) but also on the heuristics that are cued by a frame. Consequently, framing effects on attitudes or beliefs about controversial science topics may not be observed primarily as a main effect (Frame X uniformly leads to more positive evaluations than Frame Y) but rather in interaction effects with variables such as motivation and ability in science, as well as prior attitudes and knowledge about science, that may influence (a) whether message processing tends to be more systematic or heuristic and (b) what specific heuristics or biases may be cued by a particular frame.</p>
<p>Of course, in an experiment, it is impossible to randomly assign participants to high and low science motivation, knowledge, or attitude groups. However, university students have self-selected into such groups: science and nonscience majors. One might expect that science majors are more likely to engage in systematic processing of science-related messages than are nonscience majors, due to their having higher motivation (due to interest in science) and greater science-relevant cognitive resources (due to greater knowledge about and experience with science) than nonscience majors. However, science majors also start with more positive attitudes and beliefs toward science and will also likely utilize heuristics as they process messages about controversial science; in particular, they may be more likely to use a “deference to scientific authority” heuristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547012440517">Brossard &amp; Nisbet, 2006</xref>). Due to their being less invested in science’s status as a way of knowing (and future source of income), nonscience majors will likely use different heuristics when processing science-related messages. For example, an Economic Prospects frame may cue heuristics related to skepticism regarding privately financed scientific research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547012440517">Critchley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012440517">Liu &amp; Priest, 2009</xref>). Because of these differences in their motivations, knowledge, and attitudes about science, we expect that science and nonscience majors will be differentially influenced by news frames, as will be evidenced by different cognitions in response to different news frames.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1075547012440517">
<title>Cognitions and Attitudes Toward Stem Cell Research</title>
<p>In order to determine how frames may influence attitudes or opinions about stem cells, it is necessary to determine what cognitions likely contribute to those attitudes. Specifically, this study focuses on cognitions in terms of beliefs, or “the strength of the person’s expectations that the [attitude] object has a particular set of attributes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1075547012440517">Perloff, 1993</xref>, p. 30). While some previous studies on stem cell research measure attitude directly (i.e., as a general evaluation), others measure relevant beliefs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012440517">Liu and Priest (2009)</xref> measured attitudes toward embryonic stem cell research with a single item asking to what extent such research “might benefit society” (p. 711). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547012440517">Nisbet and Goidel (2007)</xref> used the composite of two items asking to what extent such research is “useful” and “morally acceptable for society” (p. 431). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547012440517">Pardo and Calvo (2008)</xref> measured attitudes toward embryonic stem cell research using the composite score from a 10-item scale. This scale comprises items mostly related to both morality/ethicality (e.g., “Allowing research with embryos that are a few days old in order to obtain stem cells will lead to other morally reprehensible uses”) and usefulness (e.g., “Research with stem cells from embryos that are a few days old should be supported as a means of finding efficient cures for diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, or diabetes as soon as possible”; p. 43). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al. (2009)</xref> measured how ethical, credible, and useful university students judged both an embryonic and an adult stem cell study to be.</p>
<p>The above studies suggest that the attributes of ethicality/morality and/or perceived usefulness (i.e., benefits or efficient cures) are considered particularly relevant to attitudes toward stem cell research. Another attribute, credibility of stem cell research, was measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al. (2009)</xref>, while credibility of university scientists was measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012440517">Liu and Priest (2009)</xref> as a predictor of perceptions of the benefits of embryonic stem cell research. Credibility is an important attribute in socioscientific controversies, as the credibility of science and scientists is often at the crux of such controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547012440517">Stewart, 2009</xref>). For example, the so-called Climategate scandal was clearly an effort to influence attitudes toward climate change by undermining people’s belief that climate scientists and research are credible. Indeed, “Climategate” was recently invoked by conservative critics of embryonic stem cell research in order to attack the credibility of embryonic stem cell scientists:</p>
<p>The patterns of behavior promoting public funding of [embryonic stem cell research] have been strikingly similar to Climategate: selective use of data, manipulation of the peer review process, demonizing colleagues who question the prevailing orthodoxies, and appeals to a bogus scientific “consensus,” among others.

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>This study investigates the influence of news frames (Scientific Progress, Economic Prospects, and Political Conflict), science background (science vs. nonscience majors), and stem cell source (embryonic vs. adult) on three relevant cognitions or attributions: the extent to which participants believe stem cell scientists and research to be ethical and credible and how useful participants believe stem cell research to be to both science and society. These attributions will be analyzed separately because, as shown in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>), frames may not influence these attributions uniformly. This study tests three hypotheses. First, because embryonic and adult stem cells have been positioned in opposition to each other in public communication and previous research has shown greater support for adult compared to embryonic stem cell research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547012440517">Nisbet, 2004</xref>), we predict more favorable attributions for adult stem cell research in the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-1075547012440517" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Adult stem cell research will be rated as more (a) ethical, (b) credible, and (c) useful than embryonic stem cell research.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Second, since there is evidence that science majors tend to have more favorable attitudes toward and beliefs about science compared to nonscience majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547012440517">Gogolin &amp; Swartz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>) and may tend to show more deference to scientific authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547012440517">Brossard &amp; Nisbet, 2006</xref>), we predict in the following hypothesis that science majors will make more favorable attributions overall:</p>
<list id="list2-1075547012440517" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Science majors will rate embryonic and adult stem cell research as more (a) ethical, (b) credible, and (c) useful than will nonscience majors.</p></list-item></list>
<p>And third, we predict that news frames will also influence attributions about embryonic and adult stem cell research. The three frames selected for comparison in this study are derived from the typology of general, recurring science frames identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547012440517">Nisbet and Scheufele (2007)</xref>: Scientific Progress, Economic Prospects, and Conflict. Among the various frames in Nisbet and Scheufele’s typology, prior content analyses have shown that these three frames are the most frequently occurring in public communication about biotechnology and stem cell research in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547012440517">Nisbet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547012440517">Nisbet &amp; Lewenstein, 2002</xref>). Specifically, Scientific Progress and Economic Prospects frames predominate news coverage of biotechnologies, especially in early stages, with Conflict frames becoming more frequent in more recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547012440517">Nisbet &amp; Lewenstein, 2002</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547012440517">Fahmy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1075547012440517">Reis, 2008</xref>). Scientific Progress frames emphasize “new developments” and “breakthroughs,” Economic Prospects frames emphasize “economic potential” and “profits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547012440517">Nisbet &amp; Lewenstein, 2002</xref>, p. 372), and Conflict frames emphasize “who’s ahead or behind in winning a debate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547012440517">Nisbet, 2010</xref>, p. 46). Because these are the frames that members of the public are most likely to encounter in news discourse about stem cell research, it makes sense to investigate them experimentally, since these frames are the most likely to influence public opinion about stem cell research. While many heuristics (or schema) that might be cued by frames are broadly socially shared, some will differ based on individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547012440517">Scheufele &amp; Scheufele, 2010</xref>). If these frames cue different heuristics depending on the recipient’s background in science, frame effects on cognitions will interact with effects of science major. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list3-1075547012440517" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: News frames will moderate the effects of science major on attributions of (a) ethicality, (b) credibility, and (c) usefulness of embryonic and adult stem cell research.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Finally, because previous experimental studies on framing effects on attitudes/opinions about stem cell research found varying interaction effects, but not main effects, for framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547012440517">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012440517">Yun et al., 2008</xref>), we do not hypothesize a main effect for framing. However, given Hypothesis 3, each frame may result in higher, lower, or no difference for science majors compared to nonscience majors. Formal directional hypotheses for each frame are not strongly determined based on existing research and theory. Instead, we pose the following research question:</p>
<list id="list4-1075547012440517" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How do Scientific Progress, Economic Prospects, and Political Conflict frames differentially influence science and nonscience majors’ attributions of (a) ethicality, (b) credibility, and (c) usefulness of embryonic and adult stem cell research?</p></list-item></list>

<sec id="section8-1075547012440517">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Ninety students at an urban public university in the southern United States participated in the study (49 science majors and 41 nonscience majors). Science majors (biology, chemistry, earth sciences, physics, or nursing) were recruited via visits to upper division courses in these fields, e-mail messages sent to these majors, and flyers posted in the buildings housing these departments. Nursing majors were included as science majors because they are required to complete significant biology coursework (e.g., microbiology and anatomy and physiology are prerequisites for the major). Ultimately, 39 biology majors and 10 nursing majors volunteered and agreed to participate in the study. Potential participants from other science disciplines were not excluded. The nonscience majors came from a variety of humanities, social science, and fine and performing arts fields, with communication (<italic>n</italic> = 11) and psychology (<italic>n</italic> = 6) being the most common majors represented. Women comprised 65.6% of the sample. The mean age was 23 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.50). Volunteers for the study made an appointment with the investigator and completed the study using paper and pencil either individually or in a small group in an office or a classroom. In accordance with human subject regulations, the institutional review board approved the research protocol before data were collected, and all participants signed an informed consent form before beginning the study. After completing the study, all participants were debriefed and compensated with a $10 Barnes &amp; Noble gift card. The study was funded by a faculty research grant awarded by the investigator’s college.</p>

<title>Pretest questionnaire</title>
<p>The pretest questionnaire comprised questions on demographics: age, gender, and major. Additionally, it asked about political orientation on social/cultural issues (1 = <italic>very liberal</italic>, 6 = <italic>very conservative; M</italic> = 2.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.50) and on economic/fiscal issues (<italic>M</italic> = 3.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.41), frequency of religious attendance (1 = <italic>once a week</italic>, 5 = <italic>seldom or never; M</italic> = 2.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.60), religious affiliation (70% identified as Christian), science knowledge (1 = <italic>very good</italic>, 5 = <italic>very poor; M</italic> = 2.41, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.85), science interest (1 = <italic>very high</italic>, 5 = <italic>very low; M</italic> = 2.11, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.08), frequency of reading about science in popular media (1 = daily, 5 = never; <italic>M</italic> = 2.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.11) and of obtaining information about science from other audio/visual media (<italic>M</italic> = 2.59, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.03), and level of interest in four socioscientific issues (1 = <italic>very high</italic>, 5 = <italic>very low</italic>): global climate change (<italic>M</italic> = 2.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.02), teaching evolution versus intelligent design (<italic>M</italic> = 2.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.56), stem cell research (<italic>M</italic> = 2.39, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.14), and human cloning (<italic>M</italic> = 2.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.24).</p>
<p>Science majors statistically differed from nonscience majors on the four items related to their interest and motivation in science. Science majors reported greater science knowledge—<italic>M</italic><sub>sci</sub> = 2.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.80; <italic>M</italic><sub>nonsci</sub> = 2.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.76; <italic>F</italic>(1, 88) = 16.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; higher science interest—<italic>M</italic><sub>sci</sub> = 1.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.77; <italic>M</italic><sub>nonsci</sub> = 2.78, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.01; <italic>F</italic>(1, 88) = 42.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; more frequent reading of popular science—<italic>M</italic><sub>sci</sub> = 2.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.12; <italic>M</italic><sub>nonsci</sub> = 3.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.04; <italic>F</italic>(1, 88) = 5.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03; and more frequent consumption of other science media—<italic>M</italic><sub>sci</sub> = 2.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.09; <italic>M</italic><sub>nonsci</sub> = 2.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.87; <italic>F</italic>(1, 88) = 6.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02; than did nonscience majors.

<sec id="section11-1075547012440517">
<title>News message and framing conditions</title>
<p>After completing the pretest questionnaire, participants were instructed to read a newspaper article carefully and told that they would answer questions about their opinions and take a short memory quiz on what they read. In order to ensure ecological validity, a real news text was used. This text, which was originally published in <italic>The Miami Herald</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547012440517">Tasker, 2010</xref>), reported on recent developments in human adult stem cell research (that stem cells derived from human adults are similar to those derived from embryos) and embryonic stem cell research (that stem cells derived from human embryos are still necessary for both basic and applied research), as well as the potential (and limitations) for both to lead to therapeutic applications. Therefore, regardless of frame condition, all participants were exposed to both embryonic and adult stem cell research in the news message. The content of the message was generally positive, but it was ambiguous insofar as it contained arguments potentially favoring either embryonic stem cell research (e.g., “The embryotic stem cell is the prototype, the ultimate stem cell,” Hare says. “It has the greatest capacity to become any other type of tissue. It’s essential to work with both kinds of stem cells.”) or adult stem cell research (e.g., “The embryonic stem cell might not be the most valuable property in actual therapy. When you’re treating a heart attack, you might do better with an adult stem cell.”).</p>
<p>The dominant frame for this text was Scientific Progress, with conflict as a secondary frame (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547012440517">Nisbet et al., 2003</xref>). Because this dominant frame and the subsequent manipulations for the other conditions are instantiated throughout the text, a control (“no frame”) condition was not feasible. That is, because frames were not manipulated only in a headline or other text that could simply be removed, a “no frame” condition was not practicable. The original news text constituted the Scientific Progress frame condition (1,152 words) and emphasized medical advancement, scientists, and scientific achievements. The other two frame conditions were created by editing the subheadline and other parts of the text to create a dominant frame. The headline, “Research Into Stem Cells of Adults Stirs Hopes,” was held constant across the frame conditions. The Economic Prospects frame (1,162 words) was edited to emphasize investing, investors, and economic potential of new therapies and the Political Conflict frame (1,182 words) to emphasize politics, debate, and links to the abortion issue. The texts in the three frame conditions were identical except for those sections reproduced in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1075547012440517">Table 1</xref>. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of these frame conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 30); there were no statistically significant differences between frame condition groups on any of the pretest questions.</p>

<title>Dependent measures</title>
<p>When participants finished reading the article, they were given a 12-item questionnaire measuring attributions of the ethicality, credibility, and usefulness of both embryonic and adult stem cell research, therefore allowing for a within-subjects comparison between embryonic and adult stem cell research. The following six questions were asked, first of embryonic stem cell research, then of adult stem cell research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>): How ETHICAL are <italic>scientists</italic> who work on [embryonic or adult] stem cells? How ETHICAL is <italic>scientific research</italic> on [embryonic or adult] stem cells? (1 = <italic>not at all ethical</italic>, 6 = <italic>completely ethical</italic>); How CREDIBLE are <italic>scientists</italic> who work on [embryonic or adult] stem cells? How CREDIBLE is <italic>scientific research</italic> on [embryonic or adult] stem cells? (1 = <italic>not at all credible</italic>, 6 = <italic>completely credible</italic>); How USEFUL is <italic>scientific research</italic> on [embryonic or adult] stem cells to <italic>society</italic>? How USEFUL is <italic>scientific research</italic> on [embryonic or adult] stem cells to <italic>science</italic>? (1 = <italic>not at all useful</italic>, 6 = <italic>very useful</italic>). The items measuring each dependent variable were acceptably reliable (Ethicality, α = .74; Credibility, α = .82; Usefulness, α = .75). Therefore, the two items measuring each dependent variable for embryonic and adult stem cell research were averaged for each participant.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section13-1075547012440517">
<title>Manipulation Check: Motivation and Ability to Process</title>
<p>Finally, participants’ motivation and ability to process the text were checked. Participants’ motivation was measured using a single item rating their interest in reading the article (1 = <italic>not at all interested</italic>, 6 = <italic>very interested; M</italic> = 5.34, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.00). Ability to process the message was checked with 10-item multiple-choice questions designed (in consultation with an educational psychologist) to check that participants recalled substantive features of the article’s content (e.g., “Adult stem cells are more flexible than previously believed,” “Embryonic cells are still useful because they can become any other type of tissue”; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547012440517">Chaiken &amp; Maheswaran, 1994</xref>). The mean number of questions answered correctly was 7.37 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.43, <italic>Mdn</italic> = 8.00). Science and nonscience majors did not differ significantly on either the interest rating or the memory quiz. These results suggest that, overall, participants were motivated and able to systematically process this text and that science and nonscience majors were roughly equivalent in terms of their systematic processing of the message. Interaction effects between frame condition and major are likely the result of frames cueing different heuristics for these groups, potentially biasing the valence of these groups’ cognitions about stem cell research.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1075547012440517" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Main and interaction effects were tested for each dependent variable using 2 (stem cell source) × 2 (participant major) × 3 (frame condition) mixed-factor analyses of variance, with stem cell source as a within-subjects factor and participant major and frame condition as between-subjects factors. Preliminary analyses showed no effects for gender or age on any of the dependent variables. Therefore, gender and age were not included as factors in subsequent analyses. Planned <italic>t</italic>-test comparisons were conducted to compare science and nonscience majors, within stem cell source or framing conditions, when there were significant interaction effects with participant major. Separate post hoc <italic>t</italic> tests compared means between frame conditions separately for science and nonscience majors when the data suggested that participants within each of these groups differed based on framing condition. Finally, correlations were computed between the dependent variables and the following predictor variables: religious attendance, general political orientation (the mean of self-reported social and economic political ratings, α = .80), and overall science interest and exposure (the mean of self-reported science knowledge, interest, reading, and media consumption, α = .83). Consistent with prior research, there were no main effects for framing (<italic>F</italic>s &lt; 2.0, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .16).</p>

<p>Hypothesis 1c was partially supported.

However, this main effect is attenuated by an interaction effect between major and stem cell source: <italic>F</italic>(1, 84) = 4.85, <italic>p</italic> = .03, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .06.

<p>Planned comparisons showed that for embryonic stem cell research, science majors perceived the research to be more useful than did nonscience majors in both the Scientific Progress frame: <italic>t</italic>(28) = −2.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03, <italic>r</italic> = .78; and in the Economic Prospects frame: <italic>t</italic>(28) = −4.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>r</italic> = .60.

Science and nonscience majors did not significantly differ in the Political Conflict frame condition for either embryonic or adult stem cell research.</p>
<p>Post hoc comparisons were conducted to determine whether science majors perceived embryonic and adult stem cell research to be less useful in the Political Conflict frame compared with the other two conditions. Science majors gave significantly lower usefulness ratings for embryonic stem cell research in the Political Conflict frame than in the other frame conditions; for both comparisons: <italic>t</italic>(30) = 2.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>r</italic> = .44. The same pattern emerged for science majors’ ratings of usefulness of adult stem cell research, with lower ratings in the Political Conflict frame than in the Scientific Progress frame: <italic>t</italic>(30) = 2.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>r</italic> = .37. The difference between the Conflict and Economic Prospect frame just missed the .05 threshold for statistical significance: <italic>t</italic>(30) = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06, <italic>r</italic> = .32.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1 predicted that, in general, participants would make more favorable attributions about adult stem cell research, perceiving this research to be more ethical, credible, and useful compared to embryonic stem cell research. This hypothesis was supported for both ethicality and credibility and was partially supported for usefulness. Only nonscience majors perceived adult stem cell research to be more useful than embryonic stem cell research, whereas science majors did not differ between embryonic and adult stem cell research. Hypothesis 2 predicted that compared to nonscience majors, science majors would make more favorable attributions about ethicality, credibility, and usefulness of both embryonic and adult stem cell research. This hypothesis received partial support. Science majors perceived embryonic stem cell research to be more ethical than did nonscience majors, but these groups did not differ on adult stem cell research. Science majors did not perceive stem cell research to be more credible than did nonscience majors overall but did perceive stem cell research to be more useful than did nonscience majors. Finally, Hypothesis 3 predicted that news frames would interact with science background in influencing attributions of the ethicality, credibility, and usefulness of embryonic and adult stem cell research. This hypothesis was not supported for attributions about ethicality but was supported for both credibility and usefulness.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of this study support the notion that news frames cue heuristics that bias cognitive responses to messages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547012440517">Chaiken &amp; Maheswaran, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547012440517">Iguarta &amp; Cheng, 2009</xref>). Both science and nonscience majors showed evidence of being motivated (based on self-reported interest) and able (based on memory for details of the story) to process this message carefully, suggesting that both groups engaged in roughly equal levels of systematic processing. The overall highly favorable attributions suggest generally favorable cognitions regarding stem cell research. This effect supports the idea that “deference to science authority” is a broadly shared heuristic but one that may be particularly influential on science majors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547012440517">Brossard &amp; Nisbet, 2006</xref>). However, the interaction effects between major and frame on attributions of credibility and usefulness are consistent with the idea that frames cue additional heuristics (or schemata) and that these heuristics differ between science and nonscience majors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547012440517">Scheufele &amp; Scheufele, 2010</xref>). If science majors were simply more favorable toward stem cell research than nonscience majors, and if frames directly affected both science and nonscience majors’ cognitions in the same way, then there would have been main effects for both major and frame condition but not an interaction effect between these variables. Instead, the results of this study show interaction effects between major and frame condition, consistent with the idea that frames cue heuristics and that these heuristics vary based on participants’ background in science.</p>
<p>The Economic Prospects frame appears to be particularly influential on nonscience majors’ cognitions. With respect to attributions of credibility, nonscience majors exposed to the Economic Prospects frame perceive both embryonic and adult stem cell research to be significantly less credible than do science majors. Additionally, nonscience majors in the Economic Prospects frame tend to perceive embryonic stem cell research to be less credible than do nonscience majors in the other two frame conditions. These results are consistent with the idea that a frame highlighting economic concerns may have cued a heuristic such as <italic>science is less credible when it is motivated by profits or investors</italic>, resulting in less favorable attributions of credibility compared both to science majors and to nonscience majors in the other frame conditions. A similar trend was found for attributions of usefulness. The Economic Prospects frame results in significantly lower perceived usefulness of both embryonic and adult stem cell research compared to science majors. And although not statistically significant, nonscience majors in the Economic Prospects frame tend to perceive embryonic stem cell research to be less useful than in the other two frame conditions. Therefore, this frame may have a similar biasing effect for nonscience majors’ attributions of usefulness as it does for credibility.</p>
<p>The Political Conflict frame appears to bias science majors’ attributions of usefulness. Science majors perceive embryonic stem cell research to be significantly more useful than do nonscience majors except in the Political Conflict frame, where these attributions do not differ. Furthermore, science majors exposed to the Political Conflict frame tend to perceive both embryonic and adult stem cell research to be less useful than science majors exposed to the other two frames. In general, science majors perceive stem cell research to be more useful than do nonscience majors, consistent with a deference to scientific authority heuristic, but Political Conflict framing may cue an additional heuristic such as <italic>useful science is noncontroversial</italic>, resulting in less favorable attributions of usefulness in the Conflict frame compared with science majors in the other frame conditions and equivalent ratings to nonscience majors.</p>
<p>Two other interaction effects are relevant to the idea that science and nonscience majors’ cognitions differ when they process messages about stem cell research differently. First, although there was no framing effect for ethicality, science and nonscience majors make different attributions of ethicality only for embryonic stem cell research. Second, only nonscience majors attributed adult stem cell research to be more useful than embryonic stem cell research. Both of these results are consistent with the idea that science and nonscience majors use different considerations when making attributions about the ethicality and usefulness of embryonic and adult stem cell research. Because these science and nonscience majors do not differ in terms of their religiosity or political orientation, differences between these groups based on their different backgrounds in science are likely responsible for these effects. While these specific attributions may precede exposure to this message, they potentially influence how members of these groups process messages about stem cell research, perhaps resulting in different cognitive evaluations of the message content or in the use of different heuristics, when forming judgments about stem cell research. Although the means show overall highly favorable attributions of ethicality, credibility, and usefulness of embryonic and adult stem research for both science and nonscience majors, the results of this study demonstrate that news frames and science background both have measurable influences on attributions about stem cell research.</p>
<p>The results of the present study support the idea that frames function as heuristic or biasing cues and therefore influence not only what, but how, information in messages is processed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547012440517">Igartua &amp; Cheng, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547012440517">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). By focusing on message variables, this study does not attempt to model how various beliefs predict public attitudes about stem cell research but, instead, attempts to shed light on how media messages, and specific features of those messages, influence individuals’ beliefs about stem cell research. The main and interaction effects found in this study are consistent with a simple model in which the three independent variables in this study are related to each other in this way: Science frames (which vary in terms of message features) cue cognitive heuristics (which differ based on receiver’s background in science), which in turn bias cognitions about stem cell research (which vary as a function of the source of the stem cell). These variables are not meant to explain or model public opinion about stem cell research, as would be the case for large-scale survey research. Instead, it is an effort to investigate and better understand how media messages influence individuals’ cognitions about stem cell research.</p>
<p>The findings of the current study are consistent with previous research on trust in scientists and public support for embryonic stem cell research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547012440517">Critchley (2008)</xref> reports that whether stem cell research is presented as being conducted by public or private interests predicts perceptions of self-interests of scientists, benevolence of scientists, access to benefits from stem cell research, and trust in scientists (which is predicted by perceived benevolence and access). Trust in scientists in turn predicts approval for embryonic stem cell research. In other words, framing stem cell research as a private, profit-driven enterprise is associated with less support for this research. This finding is consistent with a <italic>science is less credible when it is motivated by profits or investors</italic> heuristic. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012440517">Liu and Priest (2009)</xref> report that trust in university scientists is positively associated with perceived benefits of embryonic stem cell research. This finding suggests a <italic>university-supported scientific research is likely to be useful</italic> heuristic, which would be consistent with the trend for lower usefulness ratings of embryonic stem cell research in the Economic Prospects frame for nonscience majors, since only this frame highlighted nonuniversity financial interests in stem cell research.</p>
<p>The present findings are also mostly consistent with previous research on framing effects on opinions toward stem cell research. Like the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547012440517">Lee et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012440517">Yun et al. (2008)</xref>, it finds that frames have interaction effects with other variables, suggesting that news frames influence audience opinions of stem cell research by influencing cognitive evaluations of stem cell messages, which are also influenced by participant variables that affect message processing. The present study compared the same frames on similar dependent variables as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012440517">Stewart et al. (2009)</xref>. However, unlike Stewart et al.’s study, it finds no effect for framing on ratings of ethicality; instead, it finds framing effects on ratings of credibility and usefulness, where Stewart et al. find none. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the present framing effects are the result of a study design that could detect interactions between participant academic major and framing that Stewart et al. did not test for. However, there are some differences in the tasks between the two studies as well. Participants in the Stewart et al. study evaluated two specific stem cell research studies, whereas participants in the present study made attributions about embryonic and adult stem cell research in general. People’s evaluations of specific research studies may differ from their attributions about more general research fields. Finally, it is also the case that frame effects likely interact in important ways with other features of messages, which were not the same between these two studies.</p>
<p>There are, of course, limitations to the present study. Although the sample size is relatively small, the study design has more than sufficient power to detect the main effects of interest in Hypothesis 1 and adequate power to detect medium or larger effects (η<sup>2</sup> ≥ .06; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012440517">Cohen, 1988</xref>) for the interaction effects of interest in Hypothesis 3. Two marginally nonsignificant main effects testing Hypotheses 2a and 2b were of moderate effect size, but both are attenuated by significant interaction effects, so these effects for participant major are accounted for in the analysis. While there is sufficient power to detect planned pairwise differences between science and nonscience majors, this study’s power is limited with respect to the post hoc comparisons. In particular, it seems likely that with a larger sample, nonscience majors in the Economic Prospects frame would have been revealed to perceive embryonic stem cell research as significantly less useful than in the other two frame conditions, which would further support the conclusion that this frame functions as a heuristic cue for nonscience majors. Grouping participants into science versus nonscience majors is only a rough proxy for differences in science educational experiences. However, science majors report significantly higher knowledge and interest in science, as well as more frequent popular science reading and science media consumption, indicating higher interest, ability, and motivation in science than is the case for nonscience majors. It is worth noting that science majors are not less religious or more politically liberal than nonscience majors, eliminating two potential confounds with academic major.</p>
<p>Future research should investigate whether these frames function similarly with respect to other biotechnology controversies, as well as the effects of frames associated with other socioscientific controversies such as global climate change. Ideally, future experimental studies would incorporate multiple messages into the study design in order to determine how frames interact with other substantive message features and heuristic/biasing cues to influence cognitive evaluations of messages. Additionally, sampling nonstudent populations with varying backgrounds in or knowledge of science will be important to demonstrate the generalizability of these framing effects on opinions about stem cell research. Since all of the science majors in this study were in biology or nursing, it may be the case that these effects would not hold for individuals whose background in science is in other disciplines. That is, individuals whose background is in earth sciences may look like other nonexperts when making attributions about stem cell research, while those whose background is in biological sciences may look like other nonexperts when making attributions about climate change research. Finally additional methods, such as thought-listing procedures or qualitative interviews, should be used to more fully investigate participants’ processing and cognitive evaluations of stem cell messages and the nature of the heuristics or biases triggered by news frames for different audiences.</p>
<p>The present study contributes both theoretically and empirically to research on socioscientific controversies. It shows that dual-process theories of information processing offer an important contribution to framing research in science communication, predicting that framing effects may depend on different message receivers’ backgrounds in science. Therefore, in the context of socioscientific controversies, the role of specific frames may vary depending on individuals’ experiences with science or science education. Specific to stem cell controversies, it shows how the frames most commonly associated with media coverage of stem cell research—Scientific Progress, Economic Prospects, and Conflict—have different effects, depending on participants’ academic major, even though both groups were likely equally systematic in their message processing. Economic Prospects framing leads to less favorable attributions of credibility for nonscience majors, whereas Political Conflict framing leads to less favorable attributions for science majors, consistent with the idea that these groups’ cognitive evaluations were biased by different heuristics. These results suggest that science communication scholars interested in framing should attend to how specific message frames interact with relevant participant-based variables in order to better understand how media messages shape the cognitions that form the basis for individuals’ and, consequently, the public’s attitudes about controversial science.</p>
