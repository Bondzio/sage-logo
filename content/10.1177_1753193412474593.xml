<title>Main results</title>
<p>Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs), all at high risk of bias, and four economic evaluations were included. Apart from one study, the times to fracture healing were comparable between the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and control groups. There was some evidence for increased healing rates in acute, mainly open, tibial fractures, without requiring a secondary procedure when treated with BMP as opposed to standard treatment without BMP (risk ratio (RR) 1.19, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.43). The pooled RR for achieving union for nonunited fractures was 1.02 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.15). One study found no difference in union for patients who had corrective osteotomy for radial malunions treated with or without BMP. Data from three RCTs indicated that fewer secondary procedures were required for fractures [where?] treated with BMP versus controls (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83). Adverse events [when]? This is unclear, experienced were infection, hardware failure, pain, donor site morbidity, heterotopic bone formation and immunogenic reactions.</p>
<p>The evidence on costs for BMP-2 for acute open tibia fractures is from one large RCT. This indicates that the direct medical costs associated with BMP would generally be higher than treatment with standard care, but this cost difference may decrease as fracture severity increases; plainly relatively, but absolutely? This is unclear. Limited evidence suggests that the direct medical costs associated with BMP could be offset by faster healing and reduced time off work for patients with the most severe open tibia fractures.</p>

<title>Authors’ conclusions</title>
<p>This review highlights a paucity of data on the use of BMP in fracture healing, as well as considerable industry involvement in currently available evidence. There is limited evidence to suggest that BMP may be more effective than controls for acute tibial fracture healing, however, the use of BMP for treating nonunion remains unclear. The limited available economic evidence indicates that BMP treatment for acute open tibial fractures may be more favourable economically when used in patients with the most severe fractures.</p>

<title>Comment on Garrison KR, Shemilt I, Donell S, et al. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) for fracture healing in adults. <italic>Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews</italic> 2010</title>
<p>Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are growth factors implicated in bone formation and repair. BMP-2 and BMP-7 have generated interest as potential therapeutic options. There remains limited clinical evidence for the use of BMPs in the management of acute fractures and established non-unions of the hand and wrist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412474593">Kujala et al. (2004)</xref> reported that BMP on a bio-coral scaffold resulted in scaphoid union in only two of eight cases. However, in a study of 17 scaphoid non-unions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412474593">Bilic et al. (2006)</xref> reported that recombinant BMP-7 (rhBMP-7) with bone autograft or allograft resulted in faster scaphoid union (measured by blinded evaluation of four radiographs by a senior radiologist), enhanced bone vascularity (measured by computed tomography scintigraphy at 24 months following surgery) and improved functional outcomes relative to autologous bone graft alone. In three single case reports, partially purified human BMP has also been used to heal a metacarpal defect following enchondroma curettage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412474593">Urist et al., 1986</xref>), a scaphoid non-union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412474593">Jones et al., 2005</xref>) and as an adjunct in the management of Keinbock’s disease, when the first dorsal metacarpal pedicle was used to revascularize the lunate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412474593">Jones et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412474593">Garrison et al. (2010)</xref> evaluated the evidence for the use of BMPs in 11 randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving 976 patients. One study evaluated rhBMP-7 versus autologous bone graft following osteotomies to correct 30 distal radius mal-unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412474593">Ekrol et al., 2008</xref>). Ekrol et al. reported that the control group (osteotomy and bone graft) healed significantly faster and with more robust cortical bridging than the intervention group (osteotomy and rhBMP-7). Indeed, the intervention group developed non-union in four of 14 cases and necessitated a change in fixation strategy after the first ten patients owing to osteolytic lesions. Of the remaining ten studies, one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412474593">Calori et al., 2006</xref>) included 29 heterogeneous fractures, 16 of which were treated with rhBMP-7 and these included two ulna and one radius fracture. Eight studies (893 patients; 91%) included only tibial fractures and established tibial non-unions and the remaining series included 24 fibular defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412474593">Geesink et al., 1999</xref>). In each of these studies, union times were comparable between the intervention and control groups, with the exception of one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412474593">Govender et al., 2002</xref>) that reported faster union with a high dose of rhBMP-2 than the control (intramedullary nailing alone) in the management of 145 open tibial shaft fractures. Potentially confounding variables existed, as the intervention group were significantly younger and reamed intramedullary nailing was more frequently used.</p>
<p>Recombinant human BMP-7 was used in six studies; rhBMP-2 was used in two studies and extracted BMP was used in the remaining three studies. Collagen sponge was used as a delivery vehicle in five cases. Only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412474593">Geesink et al., 1999</xref>) adequately controlled for the delivery vehicle. Blinding was reported in five of 11 studies. Industry funding was also reported in five of 11 studies. The review concluded that the body of evidence was of poor quality, with small sample sizes, poorly designed controls, subjective outcomes, lack of robust concealment and allocation practices, and industry sponsorship of particular concern.</p>
<p>No studies included any patient with fractures of the carpal bones, metacarpals or phalanges. Consequently, the extent to which the findings from the Cochrane review can be extrapolated to fractures of the hand and wrist remain unclear. In the absence of specific trial evidence for hand and wrist fractures, added to the absence of evidence for their use in other clinical situations, current data do not support the use of BMPs in enhancing bone healing in the forearm, wrist or hand. There appears to be no role either as an adjunct to, or as a replacement for, standard therapeutic options in the management of either fractures or established non-unions of the hand and wrist, other than in a trial setting.</p>
