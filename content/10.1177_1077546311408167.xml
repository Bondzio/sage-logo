<abstract>
<p>Modal damping was conceived as a vibration control concept that could possibly be applied to a select set of long, flexible structures. The approach was designed to exploit damping mechanisms inherent in structures by capitalizing on distinctive dynamic properties existing among the structure’s vibration modes. Modal damping transfers vibration energy from the fundamental mode where most vibration energy of civil structures of interest resides, to higher order modes where vibration impedance was found to be more effective. The closed-loop, semi-active control concept was first investigated by way of dynamic simulation. The results reflected improved settling times and prompted a concept demonstration test using a small-scale structure that was modeled after a real-world and highly dynamic structure. The experimental results were found to corroborate those of the simulation. Of particular interest was the engineered control system designed to effect inter-modal energy transfer using motion control forces virtually self-generated by the motion of the structure itself.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1077546311408167"><title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Modal damping is a vibration control concept directed at highly dynamic, yet structurally simple systems as characterized by aluminum roadside light and steel high mast poles, where overly sophisticated and expensive augmentations are not warranted. Modal damping was developed to capitalize on the dynamic tendencies of such structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311408167">May, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077546311408167">May and Menzemer 2010</xref>), particularly their easily excitable and under-damped character. The damping approach is ‘modal’ in nature in that it attempts to redirect vibration energy from the fundamental mode where most vibration energy of these civil structures of interest resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077546311408167">Xu, 1996</xref>), to higher order modes where vibration impedance was shown to be more effective. This phenomenon was modeled and the transfer strategy initially investigated by dynamic simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311408167">May, 2009</xref>). The results prompted additional testing using real-world hardware coupled to an automated control system.</p>
<p>Conceptual design and engineering of a real-world, physical control system that could effect modal energy transfer was required for the experimental model. This process began with the premise that individual vibration modes of an elastic system can be distinctly excited. One approach would be to subject the structure to a harmonic forcing function whose frequency matched that of the mode to be excited to achieve a resonant coupling of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077546311408167">Malatkar and Nayfeh, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, a distributed forcing function could be introduced to deform the structure to the displaced shape of the particular mode of interest. When such a forcing function is then quickly removed a free vibrating transient response is produced that contains the desired modal component. The forcing function <inline-formula id="ilm1-1077546311408167"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-1077546311408167"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> required to achieve such a deformation would be directly related to the spatial displacement function of the desired mode <inline-formula id="ilm2-1077546311408167"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-1077546311408167"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where,

</p>
<p>This alternative approach was adapted for the concept demonstration even though the forcing function given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1077546311408167">equation (1)</xref> would be difficult to effect with minimal complexity and cost. Precision was therefore conceded. Instead, a simple three-point tendon was introduced as the controlled actuator to intelligently induce structural deformation forces to facilitate vibration energy transfer. Simulation results indicated that the single tendon judiciously coupled to a cantilever structure could adequately deform the structure to approximate the shape required to develop 2nd mode vibrations. A single command input was likewise shown to be all that was required to control tendon action. An intelligent, closed-loop controller logic was designed to coordinate and generate the automated control input to the tendon. The algorithm was based on system energy dynamics and tailored to power the control forces using only the motion of the structure.</p>
<p>The conceptual geometry of the candidate cantilever structure and control tendon pair is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077546311408167">Figure 1</xref>. The figure includes the cantilever, the tendon showing the selected connection geometry, and the approximate deflection shapes of the fundamental and 2nd vibration modes overlaid for reference.

<sec id="sec2-1077546311408167"><title>2. Dual cantilever approach</title>
<p>Admittedly, the three-point tendon ‘awkwardly’ projecting from the cantilever is impractical for a real-world implementation. However, the simple arrangement is made for straightforward modeling and simulation geometry while offering the necessary force distribution input necessary for control. A more palatable implementation of the three-point tendon force set evolved for the experimental testing. An innovative adaptation was arrived at enabling the three-point tendon to be ‘folded’ to fit inside a given structure by using additional connection points. And, although folded, analysis would show that the tendon would still retain the fundamental force distribution attributes of the simpler three-point connection if the additional connections were of a roller/pulley-type. The folding of the tendon at each story level was found to generate extremely small residual lateral forces when adjacent story heights were not equal, yielding anti-symmetric tendon geometries. Since residual forces were small, they did not affect the overall effectiveness of the control tendon. Folding was realized by way of a second cantilever as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311408167">Figure 2</xref>. The two cantilevers when connected with ‘story-like’ horizontal members took on a high-rise look. For a more dramatic and dynamic experiment, story connections to the vertical cantilevers were a non-moment, hinge-type. The structure maintained a simple and flexible cantilever behavior as opposed to the stiffer moment-resisting frame action.

<p>The measured modal behavior is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311408167">Figure 4</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311408167">Figure 4(a)</xref> compares frequencies of the first four modes and includes measured data for the full dual-cantilever model (with and without the tendon), the single-cantilever model, and analytical data of the baseline roadside pole from which the experimental model was scaled. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1077546311408167">Figure 4(b)</xref> compares the normalized, analytical mode shape functions of the dual-cantilever model to that of the roadside pole.
<fig id="fig4-1077546311408167" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Experimental model dynamic properties. a) Measured modal frequency comparison; b) 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> mode shape comparison.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311408167-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The measured vibration frequencies indicate that the tendon and actuation subsystem had negligible effect on the overall system behavior of the experimental model. The minor differences in frequency between the dual and single-cantilever models were due to the added masses of the stories. Modal frequencies of the full, dual-cantilever model satisfactorily matched those of the baseline roadside pole, particularly the first two modes. The normalized analytical mode shapes for the experimental model and baseline roadside pole show reasonable correlation, particularly the fundamental mode. The slight difference between their 2nd mode shapes stems from the differing cross-section geometric designs. The experimental model had a uniform cross-section, while the baseline pole has a tapered cross-section. Cross-sectional geometries impact stiffness distribution along the longitudinal axis, which in turn affects all mode shapes.</p>
<p>The equivalent dynamic behaviors of the experimental model and baseline roadside pole imply similar deformation rates and distributions given comparable excitation conditions. Hence, the experimental model would be expected to develop comparable damped anelastic energy distributions as the real-world, baseline structure. This was a goal of the demonstration effort.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1077546311408167"><title>3. Control actuator</title>
<p>The actuator associated with modal damping was diagrammed in the schematics of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311408167">Figure 2</xref> as being embedded within the structure itself. However, it was moved off-structure during the design of the experimental model to isolate and minimize coupling of dynamics associated with its mass and motion. This decision meant that the control mechanization of the experimental model would somewhat differ from its analytical counterpart. The simulation strategy assumed that the control tendon length ADC remained constant within the structure while the length of the control element BD was controllable and could be utilized to compensate for geometry variations during the cantilever sway cycle to eliminate tendon slack (reference <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077546311408167">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving the control element off structure eliminated the requirement for the controllable element BD. Consequently the control tendon length within the structure was allowed to vary during sway. To compensate, the off-structure actuation mechanism was designed to include a ‘wind-up’ function to eliminate slack and maintain a minimum and relatively constant tension on the tendon throughout the sway cycle. An off-the-shelf electro-magnet/disc brake served as the actuator active element. On command, it prevented tendon wind-out using rotational braking. The specific braking device was selected based on performance criteria established by dynamic simulation that included tendon tension forces, rotation rates, inertias and torques. The selected rotational brake is shown mounted to its bulkhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311408167">Figure 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1077546311408167">5(b).</xref>

<p>The rotational mechanics and dynamics of the actuation subsystem design were investigated to ensure that they dovetailed with those of the primary vibrating structure. Mass, stiffness and damping of the rotating components were chosen accordingly and their respective mechanical properties are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077546311408167">Table 2</xref>.

<sec id="sec4-1077546311408167"><title>4. Control algorithm</title>
<p>The control algorithm strategy evolved directly from the simulation developmental phase and was based on the real-time state of the system energy. Accelerometers mounted at stories two, three, and four enabled the estimation of maximum system potential energy occurrences associated with the fundamental mode component during the sway cycle. The identification of the key system energy states facilitated the time-correlation of the modal energy transfer sequence embodied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1077546311408167">Figure 6</xref>.
<fig id="fig6-1077546311408167" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Modal damping control sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311408167-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The schematics show the structure as it sways from left to right while the tendon control maintains minimum tension. The tendon wind-out is locked by the controller once the desired potential energy state is reached and identified. System energy is then monitored as the structure transitions back through one additional kinetic phase to the potential state at the opposite point in the sway cycle. When the control conditions are met, the tendon lock is removed. The release of the controller-induced, deformed shape yields 2nd mode vibrations. The modal damping energy transfer algorithm was nonlinear in nature and took the form of what is commonly referred to as BANG-BANG logic. All system intelligence resided in software; none was designed into the sensor/actuator hardware interface for this demonstration. The high-level functional flow diagram is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1077546311408167">Figure 7</xref>. A lower level logic diagram can be found in the published dissertation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311408167">May, 2009</xref>).

<p>A real-time operating system is often imperative to achieving time dependent closed loop control. Processing and throughput demands for the demonstration were considered low and did not warrant a classic real-time environment. In this case, the NI USB 6009 DAQ (National Instruments) was chosen as the real-time enabling component. It contained a programmable internal clock that was configured to periodically sample the necessary system states at prescribed sample rates. It was also configured to monitor operating system execution timing to ensure that software tasks were completed within prescribed limits; or else system errors would be set. Control of, and communication with, the NI USB 6009 DAQ was achieved using existing National Instrumentation NI-DAQmx driver software that is specifically designed for text-based programming language. The algorithm was coded in C++, compiled, and linked to generate a stand-alone executable.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1077546311408167"><title>5. The Pluck Test</title>
<p>The ‘Pluck Test’ represents a condition often utilized by industry for real-world characterization of aluminum cantilever poles and was selected as the baseline for the concept demonstration. The test is based on forcing an initial predetermined structural displacement condition that is held until residual dynamics dissipate. When released, the initial conditions produce a desired free vibration transient. The Pluck condition is attractive because it primarily excites fundamental mode vibrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077546311408167">May, 2009</xref>). A schematic drawing along with the actual concept demonstration Pluck Test set-up configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1077546311408167">Figure 8</xref>.
<fig id="fig8-1077546311408167" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Pluck Test implementation. (a) Analytical model; (b) experimental model.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1077546311408167-fig8.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1077546311408167"><title>6. Characterization testing</title>
<p>A series of tests were conducted to characterize the experimental model with and without the control subsystem. An unexpected dominant coulomb damping mechanism was observed in the system response with the control subsystem attached. The unpredicted frictional damping was attributed to the mechanical implementation of the tendon function. The selected tendon was a small diameter (0.047 inch) multi-stranded (49) stainless steel cable. Although lubricated, it is believed that strand interaction during dynamic deformation was the unpredicted source of the observed frictional damping. However, the unexpected friction is believed to have little impact on the conclusions established by the demonstration. Three natural damping mechanisms are all inherent to the structures of interest to some degree: anelastic, drag, and coulomb. Even the simple roadside cantilever will contain frictional damping within the mechanical connection to its transformer/break away base. Modal damping was designed to exploit the increased damping impedance of higher order modes regardless of what mechanism the damping might be attributed to.</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1077546311408167">Figure 9</xref> illustrates key measured data and controller generated data captured during a typical Pluck Test. The figure encapsulates the sequence of logical events that occurred during one modal damping energy transfer event.

<p>The control sequence was coupled to the behavior of the fundamental mode component that was distilled from raw acceleration measurements. Its filtered and integrated component was used to estimate relative position in the sway cycle that was in turn used to assess the state of the system energy. The maximum potential energy state triggered the modal energy transfer event. The data illustrates dominance of the 2nd vibration mode component immediately after the modal damping event. The 2nd mode component noticeably decays more rapidly, as expected and desired.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1077546311408167">Figure 10</xref> attempts to illustrate the improved settling time of the vibrating system after one energy transfer event. The filtered fundamental mode acceleration of the top node (Node-5) was used to compare the settling behavior of the system with and without modal damping augmentation. The measured responses show that nearly 25% improvement was achieved.

<p>The demonstration next investigated the effects on vibration energy dissipation time given the sequential execution of multiple modal damping events that were offset in time by three fundamental sway cycle periods. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1077546311408167">Figure 11</xref> as a composite of four fitted Gaussian distributions functions that attempt to model vibration settling times for the conditions: without, with one, with two, and with three modal damping events.

<p>The zero or no modal damping event set represents free vibration behavior of the naturally damped experimental model and was established as the baseline condition. Its average time to settle is shown normalized to 100%. The other distributions were scaled and positioned according to the baseline and illustrate the damping performance improvement realized utilizing the modal damping strategy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077546311408167">Table 3</xref> is a numerical summary of modal damping effectiveness.

<p>The table reveals the number of tests performed for each modal damping condition, the total settling time improvement achieved compared with the baseline, and the incremental settling time improvement achieved due to the extra modal damping event. Marginal improvement was observed beyond two modal damping events for the experimental model using the implemented three-point tendon configuration.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1077546311408167"><title>8. Conclusion</title>
<p>An alternative vibration energy damping approach that employs inter-modal energy transfer to augment the natural dissipation capability inherent in tall, flexible structures was experimentally investigated yielding the following findings:
<list id="list1-1077546311408167" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Vibration energy could be transferred between the fundamental mode and the 2nd order mode using a relatively simple but uniquely engineered controllable three-point tendon with an intelligent nonlinear control law and sampled acceleration measurements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sixty-six individual tests were established as the Demonstration Test Set and included zero, one, two and three modal damping events. The zero modal damping event test was established as the baseline to measure performance of the modal damping.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Statistically combined results show that the single modal damping event improved overall settling time by approximately 24%. The two-modal damping event test improved settling time by approximately 38% overall. The three-modal damping event showed minor improvement over the two-event test, but improved overall settling time by approximately 40% over the baseline.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No additional energy was introduced into the vibrating structure to effect energy transfer between the vibrations modes. The modal damping control forces were self-powered by the kinetic energy associated with the fundamental mode.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Characterization testing revealed an unexpected dominant coulomb damping mechanism in the system response, but it was considered to have minor impact on test findings. Modal damping was designed to exploit the increased damping impedance of higher order modes regardless to what mechanism the damping might be attributed.</p></list-item>
