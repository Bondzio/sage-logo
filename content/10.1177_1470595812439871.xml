<abstract>
<p>This paper examines the relationship between organizational justice and work withdrawal in a Chinese context, using the cultural syndrome allocentrism and idiocentrism as moderators. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the proposed model. The results indicate that distributive justice and procedural justice have negative relations with work withdrawal behaviors. Allocentrism and idiocentrism moderates the linkage between procedural justice and work withdrawal. Specifically, perceptions of procedural justice have a negative effect on work withdrawal but this effect is weaker for individuals high on allocentrism and low on idiocentrism. Results indicate that the interacting effects of allocentrism and idiocentrism were not established in the case of distributive justice. This study makes significant theoretical contribution to both cross-cultural management literature and organizational justice literature. It also indicates that cultural orientation should be taken into consideration by managers trying to understand why there might be different reactions from different employees to the same practices and policies in organizations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>China has become an important economic power since the Chinese government launched the Economic Reform and Open Door Policy in 1978 (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470595812439871">Rosen, 1999</xref>). After more than 30 years of rapid growth, the Chinese economy has become the third largest behind the US and the EU in GDP (purchasing power parity) (CIA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470595812439871">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because it is a huge consumer market and has a low-cost labor force, international businesses have been flooding into China, and its foreign direct investment inflow keeps growing. Both multinational corporations (MNCs) and researchers are increasingly interested to understand the cultural values of Chinese employees in order to manage them effectively. Many studies have compared the cultural differences of Chinese employees with employees from western societies and other parts of the world, but few have noted that even among the Chinese there are cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1470595812439871">Yi et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is now believed that culture is not limited at the national level. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470595812439871">Lawler et al. (2008</xref>: 8) pointed out, ‘culture is a group-level characteristic, but cultural attributes generally have analogous cognitive structures at the individual level’. It is inherently a multi-level phenomenon and culture can differentiate between individual, organizational, and national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470595812439871">Taras et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470595812439871">Triandis, 2005</xref>). Cultural characteristics of one level should not be generalized and applied to another. In addition, nearly all cultural measurements are based on assessment of values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470595812439871">Taras et al., 2009</xref>), which means national cultures are measured as aggregates of the cultural values of individual members within society. In this study, we hope to contribute to knowledge of the role of culture at the individual level. We attempt to extend traditional cultural studies to explore the within-nation cultural differences of a particular country and advocate the new development of cross-cultural theories and methodology. Finally, we hope to advance our knowledge of how cultural values influence employee behaviors and how managers respond to such behaviors against a cross-cultural background.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of the current study is to understand how a pair of important <italic>individual cultural values</italic> or <italic>personal cultural orientations</italic> affects organizational behavior in Chinese companies: allocentrism and idiocentrism. Specifically, we want to explore how these individual cultural syndromes interact with perceptions of justice to jointly affect work withdrawal behaviors. Another purpose of this study is to fill the gap in justice literature by examining how organizational justice affects work withdrawal behaviors. The organizational justice literature suggests that perceived decision-making procedures are related to outcomes such as organizational commitment, job satisfaction, performance, and citizenship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470595812439871">Colquitt et al., 2001</xref>). However, there have been very few studies investigating the relation between organizational justice and employees’ behaviors of work withdrawal. In addition, it is well-documented that the antecedents of justice and its consequences are influenced by culture. For instance, different cultural groups may react differently given similar justice situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470595812439871">Leung and Kwong, 2003</xref>; Leung and Morris, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470595812439871">2000</xref>). In fact, a major review of cross-cultural research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470595812439871">Messick, 1988</xref>) singled out justice as one of the few areas where cross-cultural research had significantly influenced mainstream theories. In this study, we hope to understand the relationship between procedural justice and work withdrawal behaviors in a Chinese context.</p>

<title>Theory and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Individualism/collectivism is a central cultural value with important influences on social behavior (Triandis, 1989). It is believed the most significant cultural dimension in cross-cultural studies and seems to explain more cross-cultural variations than the other dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470595812439871">Triandis, 1995</xref>). It is the ‘deep structure’ of cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470595812439871">Greenfield, 2000</xref>) and an ‘umbrella concept’ that is rich in content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470595812439871">Triandis, 2005</xref>). When examining individualism-collectivism and the preferences for distributive rules among American, Japanese, and Korean university students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470595812439871">Leung and Iwawaki (1988</xref>) surprisingly did not find a difference among these three cultural groups. The possible explanation is that these individual cultural orientations exist in all societies as well as in all individuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470595812439871">Schaubroeck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1470595812439871">Triandis et al., 1990</xref>). Because individualism and collectivism were not measured, it is unclear whether the non-significant results are due to a similar level of individualism in Japanese and Americans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470595812439871">Leung and Iwawaki (1988</xref>) acknowledged the absence of cultural differences in their study and suggested that this may be attributable to the similar level of individualism among the three cultural groups. Like this study, most work in justice research with a cultural perspective has been cross-cultural and existing attribution studies often compare individualistic with collectivistic cultures; very few relate attribution patterns to individual-level measures, whereas there is considerable evidence to suggest that a distinction between collectivists and individualists may exist within cultures in the form of individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470595812439871">Hui and Triandis, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470595812439871">Triandis, 1995</xref>). Examination of cultural tendency as a within-culture individual difference has become more important for organizational research.</p>
<p>Triandis and his colleagues distinguish groups on the basis of individualist and collectivist values and distinguish individuals on the basis of allocentrism and idiocentrism (1988, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470595812439871">1996</xref>). Allocentrism versus idiocentrism is a within-culture phenomenon that corresponds to collectivism versus individualism at the cultural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1470595812439871">Triandis et al., 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470595812439871">Triandis (1995)</xref> argues that allocentrics, by definition, are individuals who believe, feel, and act very much like collectivists do around the world and likewise idiocentrics are people who act the way individualists do around the world. Furthermore, the authors suggested using idiocentrism and allocentrism to capture the within-culture variation of personality attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1470595812439871">Triandis et al., 1990</xref>). We should also observe the full distribution of both types in every culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439871">Markus and Kitayama, 1991</xref>; Triandis, 1989).</p>
<p>It is believed that collectivism and individualism (or allocentrism and idiocentrism at the individual level) are two distinct constructs instead of two ends of a continuum that can coexist in varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470595812439871">Triandis, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470595812439871">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1470595812439871">Triandis et al., 1985</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470595812439871">Oyserman et al.’s (2002)</xref> meta-analysis of the individualism/collectivism studies of the past two decades supported this notion. Following the suggestion that allocentrism and idiocentrism are within-culture individual differences and internalized cognitive structures that could guide people via ‘basic principles of right and wrong’ in their decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470595812439871">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), this study examines the effect of these cultural orientations on the linkage of justice perception and consequent work withdrawal behaviors.</p>
<sec id="section3-1470595812439871">
<title>Organizational justice, social exchange theory and work withdrawal</title>
<p>Employees’ perception of justice can be formed to respond to the outcome (distributive justice) or to the procedure (procedural justice) by which the outcome is derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812439871">Colquitt, 2001</xref>). Distributive justice deals with a comparison of individuals’ expectations and actual outcome, and an individual will perceive distributive justice if the received reward at least meets or exceeds the anticipated level. Procedural justice concerns the extent to which the processes or system in place are fair in making these organizational decisions. Procedural justice is experienced if these processes or systems are perceived as fair and consistent and when one has voice and influence in the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470595812439871">Greenberg, 1990</xref>). We focus on distributive justice and procedural justice in this study for the following reasons. First, these two justice constructs are very important aspects of justice and are considered better predictors (among different facets of justice, such as interactional justice, etc.) of attitudinal and behavioral reactions to the organization as a whole, upper management, and human resource systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470595812439871">Folger and Konovsky, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1470595812439871">Taylor et al., 1995</xref>). Secondly, distributive justice and procedural justice have established their legitimacy, whereas some other justice constructs such as interactional justice have been at the center of controversy when it comes to construct distinctiveness and construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470595812439871">Bies, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470595812439871">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Work withdrawal refers to ‘behaviors individuals use to avoid aspects of their specific work-role or minimizing the time spent on their specific work tasks while maintaining their current organizational and work role’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470595812439871">Hanisch and Hulin, 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439871">1990b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812439871">1991</xref>). Study of work withdrawal behaviors are very important because withdrawal behaviors of employees can be very costly to organizations and work withdrawal is an important concept in academic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470595812439871">Hanisch and Hulin, 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439871">1990b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812439871">1991</xref>). Limited empirical evidence has shown a positive association between organizational injustice and counterproductive behavior (Folger and Skarlacki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470595812439871">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470595812439871">Greenberg, 1990</xref>; Modde et al., 1995), whereas the linkage between perceived injustice and work withdrawal has not been addressed.</p>
<p>According to social exchange theory, organizations are forums for transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470595812439871">Cropanzano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470595812439871">Randall et al., 1999</xref>). Social exchange relationships are different from those based on purely economic exchange. Unlike economic exchange relationships, the obligations of the parties in a social exchange to one another are often unspecified, ambiguous, and the standards for measuring contributions are often unclear. Social exchange relationships develop between two parties through a series of mutual, although not necessarily simultaneous. exchanges that yield a pattern of reciprocal obligations to each party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470595812439871">Blau, 1964</xref>). Social exchange theory posits that individuals will ‘give back’ commensurately what they perceive to have received (or fail to have received) from the other party in the relationship (Cropanzano, 2002). Situations that are seen as unjust elicit an adaptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470595812439871">Jex and Beehr, 1991</xref>) or negative emotional reactions and people monitor and appraise exchange relationships constantly to achieve balanced or matched exchange relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470595812439871">Spector, 1998</xref>). It is reasonable to anticipate that, when treated unfairly, employees tend to ‘hold back’ and reduce their work efforts to match the perceived unfairness or injustice. We hypothesize that work withdrawal is negatively associated with perceived organizational justice.</p>

<title>Moderating effect of allocentrism and idiocentrism on work withdrawal</title>
<p>Research has shown that people in different cultures may use different criteria in implementing justice rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470595812439871">Morris et al., 1999</xref>). Other research has suggested that people in different cultures may form different distributive justice perceptions by weighing their outcomes differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470595812439871">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>). Some studies used individual cultural values such as individualism and collectivism (even though they were not always labeled as allocentrism and idiocentrism) in their analysis to examine cross-cultural differences in employee behaviors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1470595812439871">Van de Vliert et al., 2004</xref>). However, relatively little is known regarding the moderating mechanisms of individual differences through cultural lenses in the justice literature.</p>
<p>Allocentrism represents an individual’s belief that collective or group interests should take precedence over individual self-interests. They view the self as embedded in social contexts and are concerned with interpersonal harmony and the welfare of the collective or group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470595812439871">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812439871">Lam et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470595812439871">Triandis (1995)</xref> concurred that for allocentric individuals, in many domains of social life, one’s opinions, preferences, and needs are assigned secondary roles as the interdependent self desires more strongly to maintain in-group harmony, and a tendency to subordinate personal priorities to those of the in-group. The identities of allocentric individuals tend to be grounded in goals that they share with other members of their groups (Chen et al., 1998b). Unlike allocentrics, idiocentrics believe they have independent self, are concerned with personal achievement, and give their personal interest higher priority over the interest of collectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812439871">Lam et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The sense of self plays an important role in justice perceptions and group behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1470595812439871">Tyler and Blader (2003</xref>)’s group engagement model argues that procedural justice provides identity security, which in turn helps people identify with the group by merging their sense of self with the group. When people feel that the group makes decisions with fair procedures, their self can be safely merged with that of the group, which provides people with positive feelings of self-worth and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1470595812439871">Tyler and Blader, 2003</xref>). We argue that allocentrics, whose self is construed to be interdependent, merge more of their sense of self with the group than idiocentrics with independent self; therefore, they are more willing to engage in positive group behaviors and subordinate personal negative experiences to organizational interests and may refrain, to an extent, from withdrawal behaviors even when they perceive injustice in the group. Conversely, the group identity is shaken when idiocentrics perceive injustice in group decisions, as their self is independent and not as merged in the group as the allocentrics, so they are more likely to engage in withdrawal behaviors.</p>
<p>Interdependence entails seeing oneself as part of an encompassing social relationship and recognizing that one’s behavior is contingent on what the individual perceives to be the thoughts, feelings, and actions of important others, namely, the in-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470595812439871">Markus and Kitayama, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1470595812439871">Wasti (2003</xref>) suggested that while the employment relationship may have normative implications for allocentrics, such concerns are less influential in determining the behavior of idiocentric individuals who attend to and highly regard personal goals and preferences. Some evidence found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470595812439871">Brockner et al. (2000</xref>) suggests that the linkage between procedural justice and outcome favorability was stronger for participants with more interdependent self-construal compared to those with independent self-construal. Research has shown that people with collectivist values form stronger bonds with the group and are more likely to make sacrifices for the interest of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470595812439871">Ho and Chiu, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470595812439871">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470595812439871">Triandis, 1995</xref>), making withdrawal less likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470595812439871">Jackson et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Social exchange theory still applies to situations where allocentrics experience injustice and frustration, but the negative emotional reactions might not be as strong for allocentrics because of their tendency to see the greater purpose of their group. For allocentrics, social exchange relationship per se is evaluated more on a team or group level rather than the personal exchange equations. Situations that are seen as unjust may just elicit an adaptive response (Jex and Beehr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470595812439871">1991</xref>) rather than deliberate withdrawal. Allocentrics are more likely to become conscious that withdrawal behaviors are debilitating rather than salutary for group performance. In this sense, when individuals perceive the same level of injustice, allocentrics are more likely than idiocentrics to abstain from withdrawal behaviors because in-group or organizational goals are prioritized. Indeed, parallel arguments have been made at the societal level, suggesting that in individualist cultures, the employer–employee relationship is a business relationship and that the employee is committed to the organization to the extent that the individual feels that it is to his or her advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470595812439871">Allen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470595812439871">Redding et al., 1994</xref>). This ‘business relationship’, based on psychological contract of the employer and employee, involves the employee providing working effort with the organization and the employer rewarding the employee with money, security, social status, respect, and personal fulfillment. When encountering injustice, individuals higher on allocentrism are more likely to refrain from withdrawal behaviors for the sake of harmonious relationships at work and good relationships with organizations, while those high on idiocentrism consider it a breach of the psychological contract and seek withdrawal behaviors to reduce its negative effect on their individual interest.</p>
<p>Based on these arguments, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data were collected using a cross-sectional questionnaire with employees of four Chinese companies. 633 employees in total from four organizations participated in the anonymous survey and 520 participants completed it. These organizations are in heavy and light manufacturing industries. Although there were some supervisors and mid-level managers participating in the survey, most participants were lower-level workers in the factories. 52% were men. The average age was 28.5 years (SD = 8.7), and average tenure was 8.90 years(SD = 9.58). The average education (years of schooling) was 12.2 (SD = 2.86).</p>

<title>Translation</title>
<p>The entire questionnaire including the items, the introduction and instructions, was double translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470595812439871">Brislin, 1980</xref>), first into Chinese and then back to English. All translators were native Chinese speakers who were fluent in English. Each translator performed the translation independently and then the translation results were compiled and compared. To resolve the discrepancies between the two translated versions the resulting single translation was given to two additional translators who then back-translated the questionnaire into English. The back-translation was compared to the original English version. If the back-translation was not the same or equivalent to the original version, the translation process was repeated. When discrepancies were still not resolved, a meeting was held with both translators and back translators to resolve differences stemming from different interpretations of the meaning of items. This translation process minimized systematic error due to the translation mechanism and thus further ensured construct validity of the measurement.</p>

<title>Measurements</title>
<sec id="section9-1470595812439871">
<title>Allocentrism and idiocentrism</title>
<p>We used two separate eight-item scales developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470595812439871">Triandis and Gelfand (1998)</xref> to measure allocentrism (e.g. ‘I feel good when I cooperate with others’ and ‘If a co-worker gets a prize, I would feel proud’) and idiocentrism (e.g. ‘My personal identity, independent of others, is important to me’ and ‘I would rather depend on myself than others’). These scales were previously tested in Chinese samples in most recent studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812439871">Lam et al., 2002</xref>). The reliabilities for allocentrism and idiocentrism were .80 and .87, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section10-1470595812439871">
<title>Procedural justice</title>
<p>Employees completed a three-item measure of procedural justice that was originally developed and used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470595812439871">Moorman (1991</xref>), representing three aspects identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470595812439871">Leventhal (1980</xref>): ‘My organization uses procedures that collect accurate information to make decisions’ (accuracy of information); ‘My organization makes decisions in an unbiased manner’ (bias suppression); ‘I am able to question the performance appraisal arrived at by the process’ (correctability). We adapted the measure to our context by excluding the representativeness and ethicality aspects of the measure, considering that ethicality is very culture-specific and that there is a lack of democracy and participative management in the Chinese tradition. Respondents used a five-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree to report their level of agreement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470595812439871">
<title>Distributive justice</title>
<p>A single item measurement was justified in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470595812439871">Colquitt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470595812439871">Milkovich and Newman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470595812439871">Schminke et al., 1997</xref>). This single item is ‘My reward is justified, given my performance’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470595812439871">Sackett and Larson (1990</xref>) further concurred that single-item scales are adequate for narrowly defined and unambiguous constructs, which holds true for the construct of distributive justice. Many studies have measured distributive justice using a single item (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470595812439871">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470595812439871">Schminke et al., 1997</xref>). In this study one additional item was added to measure the perceived fairness of the outcomes in relation to the outcomes received by others in a similar job. This item (i.e. ‘The most productive employees in my organization receive the highest rewards’) was described in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470595812439871">Lipponen et al., 2004</xref>) and was added to ensure fuller grasp of the concept. Therefore, distributive justice was measured with two items that were modified based on justice literature.</p>

<title>Work withdrawal</title>
<p>The Work Withdrawal scale, developed by Hanisch (1990) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470595812439871">Hanisch and Hulin (1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470595812439871">1990b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470595812439871">1991</xref>) represents one of two dimensions of organizational withdrawal. Work withdrawal focuses on the behavioral attempts of the employee to escape from work and work tasks, including tardiness, absenteeism, and tampering with equipment so that work could not be accomplished. The 12-item Work Withdrawal scale asks respondents to indicate the frequency with which they engage in these behaviors using a five-point Likert response scale ranging from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>all of the time</italic>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1470595812439871">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Control variables in this study include tenure and educational level. As career stage indicators, tenure has been found to influence job turnover intentions or work withdrawal behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470595812439871">Lynn et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470595812439871">Manlove and Guzell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470595812439871">Riordan et al., 2003</xref>). Education was also found to be positively correlated with withdrawal behaviors (e.g. turnover intentions) in work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470595812439871">Cotton and Tuttle (1986</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470595812439871">Steel and Rentsch (1995</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-1470595812439871">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The potential problem of common method variance might be present when both independent and dependent variable measures come from the same source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470595812439871">Campbell and Fiske, 1959</xref>). Consistent with recent research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470595812439871">McFarlin and Sweeney, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1470595812439871">Vandenberg and Scarpello, 1990</xref>), this study used Harman’s Single Factor procedure to address the issue of common method variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470595812439871">Podsakoff and Organ, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470595812439871">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>). An unrotated principal components factor analysis identified four factors with eigenvalues greater than one, explaining 69 percent of the total variance. Thus, the threat of a single factor accounting for a majority of the variance in the data has been dealt with cautiously.</p>
<p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the models depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470595812439871">Figure 1</xref>, namely, the main effects and the moderating effects. All of the predictors were centered to control for possible multicollinearity among the predictor variables before the testing of interaction effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470595812439871">Aiken and West, 1991</xref>). With continuous variables, all possible products of the measured indicators should be computed as indicators of an interaction latent variable in order to examine the interaction effects using a latent variable analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470595812439871">Holmbeck, 1997</xref>). For example, in the present study there were three six-item parcel indicators of procedural justice (or three distributive justice), and three indicators of the allocentrism latent variable. Thus, there would be nine indicators for each of the two latent variables representing interactions between allocentrism and procedural justice (or distributive justice). On the other hand, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439871">Joreskog and Yang, 1996</xref>) also argued that as long as several constraints are being imposed to test the significance of the interaction effects, only one product variable would be necessary.</p>
<p>Methodologists argue (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439871">Joreskog and Yang, 1996</xref>) that the model can be sufficiently identified with one product variable with the model remaining parsimonious. The addition of more product variables may simply add more manifest parameters without adding new parameters to be estimated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439871">Joreskog and Yang, 1996</xref>, for a discussion of these issues). In the present study, we tested two models that included interaction effects, one for procedural justice and the other for distributive justice. We followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470595812439871">Joreskog and Yang’s (1996)</xref> recommendations to examine the interaction effects using the maximum likelihood estimation method with one product variable. For the procedural justice model, we selected the observed variable with the largest factor loading from the procedural justice latent variable (accuracy Parcel 1) and the observed variable with the largest factor loading from the allocentrism latent variable (allocentrism) to create the interaction latent variable with one indicator, accuracy Parcel 1 _ allocentrism (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470595812439871">Figure 2</xref>). The same procedures were followed for distributive justice model.</p>

<p>Interaction plots were constructed on the basis of forming equal-sized groups of high and low levels of allocentrism/idiocentrism. The group assignment was accomplished by using a single-factor model of latent allocentrism/idiocentrism to produce unstandardized factor loadings for the three indicators. We then multiplied these unstandardized factor loadings by the raw score of their corresponding indicator and summed to create a composite index of allocentrism/idiocentrism. The distribution of these scores was used to form two equally sized groups of high and low allocentrism/idiocentrism. A multiple-group model was tested for these two groups using procedural justice as a predictor of work withdrawal. In testing this model, the loadings of the measured variables on the latent variables of procedural justice and work withdrawal were constrained to be equal for the two groups. The path from procedural justice to work withdrawal were allowed to vary across the groups, as was the structured mean on the work withdrawal latent variable. The results show that when allocentrism is high, there is a smaller increase in work withdrawal for each unit decrease in procedural justice; whereas when allocentrism is low, the increment in work withdrawal for each unit decrease in procedural justice is relatively larger. Also, means on the work withdrawal latent variable were found to vary across the two groups, with the highest level of work withdrawal found for the group that was low in allocentrism. In sum, the interaction indicates the negative association between justice and work withdrawal was weaker for allocentrics. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470595812439871">Figure 3</xref>, the interaction effect of allocentrism and procedural justice was illustrated. The results show that when idiocentrism is high, there is a larger increase in work withdrawal for each unit decrease in procedural justice and distributive justice; whereas when idiocentrism is low, the increment in work withdrawal for each unit decrease in procedural justice is relatively smaller. In sum, the interaction indicates the negative association between justice and work withdrawal was stronger for idiocentrism.</p>

<title>Contributions and implications</title>
<p>Our results indicate that distributive justice and procedural justice do have negative relations with work withdrawal behaviors. The lower levels of distributive justice or procedural justices both are associated with a higher level of work withdrawal. Results also indicate that allocentrism and idiocentrism moderate the linkage between procedural justice and work withdrawal, yet the interacting effects of allocentrism and idiocentrism were not established in the case of distributive justice.</p>
<p>This study contributes to our knowledge about employees’ perceptions of justice and its consequences with a focus on moderating effects of allocentrism on the linkage between justice perception and its consequences. Studying differences based on cultural values will become more important in an era of increasing globalization and heterogeneity in the cultural values of individuals within an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470595812439871">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). This study promotes and expands the scope of our understanding of the role of culture that cultural values at the individual level, not just at the national level, are important variables that need to be accounted for in empirical studies of procedural justice. It verifies the common belief that cultural values vary among individuals within a country and the traditional cross-cultural methodology of using country as a proxy for culture may cause serious potential problems that may impede our explorations for deeper understandings of factors that contribute to various organizational phenomena. New development of theories and methodology may be needed to expand the horizons of cross-cultural management research.</p>
<p>Our findings have practical implications for multinational corporations that have interests in doing business in China. The understanding of Chinese culture should not be overly generalized and applied to every individual because even in collectivist China there are people who have idiocentric cultural orientations. Members who endorse allocentrism are less likely to engage in work withdrawal behaviors when they perceive procedural injustice, while those who endorse idiocentrism are more likely to engage in work withdrawal behaviors when they believe that the organization is not fair in many procedural aspects. However, managers should not simply conclude that idiocentrics are ‘worse’ employees than allocentrics. Instead, managers could check the allocation rules and procedures when withdrawal behaviors are identified in an organization. Taking cultural orientation into consideration may help to explain why there are different employee reactions to the same practice and policy in the organizations. It will also help managers anticipate and better manage (in selection, recruitment, promotion, and training, etc.) how specific employees react to situations where justice concerns arise.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470595812439871">Ambrose and Arnaud (2005</xref>) argued that, although procedural justice and distributive justice are two distinct constructs, they should not be treated as though they are completely independent. Therefore, it is worth noting the impact of procedural justice and distributive justice simultaneously. It is interesting to note that when both justice measures are studied at the same time, procedural justice had a predominant influence on people’s reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470595812439871">Alexander and Ruderman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1470595812439871">Tyler and Blader, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1470595812439871">Tyler and Caine, 1981</xref>). An explanation provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1470595812439871">Tyler and Blader (2003</xref>) was that when people had information about both distributive justice and procedural justice, procedural justice has the main effect in influencing people’s reactions to their experiences in the organization. Our study added to the literature and confirmed that both (in)justice perceptions have a negative effect on employee work withdrawal behaviors. In addition, the relative impact of procedural and distributive justice perceptions reflects on the interactional effect of allocentrism and idiocentrism. There is no difference for the reactions of allocentrics or idiocentrics to perceptions of outcome unfairness; at the same time, they focus on procedural justice and respond differently to perceptions of procedural unfairness. An implication of this conclusion is that organizations, while trying to allocate resources fairly to the employees, should pay more attention to the rules of distribution, as procedural justice plays the major role in forming people’s overall justice perceptions.</p>
<p>Cross-cultural research of organizational justice gains even more significance in economies that are increasingly multinational and global (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470595812439871">Adler and Ghadar, 1990</xref>). As Chen and his co-authors (Chen et al., 1998a) pointed out, companies and individuals with different national origins and culture backgrounds will inevitably engage in cooperative activities and their interaction will be based on assumptions and norms of how resources and rewards should be distributed. Understanding factors and cultural differences that determine people’s concepts of justice and fairness is therefore essential for cross-cultural management.</p>

<title>Limitation and future research</title>
<p>The data were obtained using self-report questionnaires. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470595812439871">Dunlop and Lee (2004</xref>) have argued that, given the nature of focus on affective and behavioral responses to the perceived rather than ‘objective’ environment, the difficulty of obtaining uncontaminated measures of withdrawal behavior, and ethical concerns with the possibility of putting research participants at risk in the accumulation of evidence of counterproductive, self-report methods are commonly accepted in the research of counterproductive behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470595812439871">Fox et al. (2001</xref>) agreed with this speculation and suggested that anonymous self-reports provide the closest available approximation of these deviant work behaviors.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is its focus on allocentrism and idiocentrism without considering other cultural values. This approach could be too narrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470595812439871">Gelfand et al., 2007</xref>). One good cultural dimension to incorporate in future research would be power distance. There is scant research studying power distance at the individual level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470595812439871">Lam et al. (2002</xref>) found that power distance moderated the relationship between perceived justice and satisfaction. It would be interesting to examine how power distance, together with allocentrism and idiocentrism, influence people’s reaction to justice perceptions. A measure to be used could be Triandis and colleagues’ horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism measure that cross-linked the individualism/collectivism measure and power distance measure and created a new construct (horizontal and vertical individualism/collectivism).</p>
<p>This will help us further understand what roles different types of allocentrism and idiocentrism play in the justice processes.</p>
<p>Other suggestions for future research include experimental and longitudinal studies conducted in the laboratory and in the field. These investigations should aim to establish the causal nature of the relationship between variables. Not necessarily a limitation of this study, the context is set in a relatively collectivistic Chinese society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470595812439871">Hofstede, 2001</xref>), where highly allocentric values tend to be more normative and thus exhibit less variance. It would be interesting for future research to replicate these findings in other cultural contexts. More interestingly, while looking at the individual-level cultural differences, a comparison between the data from a nationally individualistic country and a collectivist country would generate stronger results and better generalizability of our study.</p>
