<abstract>
<p>During development of the nervous system, large numbers of neurons are overproduced and then eliminated by programmed cell death. Puma is a BH3-only protein that is reported to be involved in the initiation of developmental programmed cell death in rodent retinal neurons. The expression and cellular localization of Puma in retinal tissues during development are not, however, well known. Here the authors report the expression pattern of Puma during retinal development in the rat. During the period of programmed cell death in the retina, Puma was expressed in some members of each retinal neuron, including retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and photoreceptor cells. Although the developmental programmed cell death of cholinergic amacrine cells is known to be independent of Puma, this protein was expressed in almost all their dendrites and somata of cholinergic amacrine cells at postnatal age 2 to 3 weeks, and it continued to be detected in cholinergic dendrites in the inner plexiform layer for up to 8 weeks after birth. These results suggest that Puma has some significant roles in retinal neurons after eye opening, especially that of cholinergic amacrine cells, in addition to programmed cell death of retinal neurons before eye opening.</p>

<p>The retina originates from the developing brain and belongs to the central nervous system. Because of its highly organized cellular architecture and easy accessibility, the retina has been extensively studied as a model of development in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155412452737">Stevens et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2010</xref>). During retinal development, excess retinal neurons are born that are later eliminated by programmed cell death (PCD). PCD is a physiological process that is indispensable for normal development of the retina, and impairments in PCD result in abnormal retinal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155412452737">Bähr 2000</xref>). Different retinal neurons undergo PCD at specific stages of retinogenesis. In rodents, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die predominantly during the first 11 days after birth, most during days 2–5. Amacrine and bipolar cells die mostly between postnatal day (P) 3 and 8 and before P14, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022155412452737">Young 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155412452737">Horsburgh and Sefton 1987</xref>). Most retinal neurons die prior to eye opening (around P14), and all PCD in the retina is almost complete by 3 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412452737">Péquignot et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>During retinal development, Bcl-2 family members have critical roles in the induction of PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155412452737">Bähr 2000</xref>). Activation of Bax and Bak, as well as the consequent permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, is a pivotal step in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412452737">Chipuk and Green 2008</xref>). Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) prevent activation of Bax and Bak, whereas proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (including Bim, Bid, Puma, Bad, Hrk, and Noxa) activate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412452737">Chipuk and Green 2008</xref>). BH3-only protein family members are activated through transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms, depending on the death-inducing stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2005</xref>). A variety of death-inducing stimuli converge on a common downstream pathway through BH3-only proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155412452737">Puthalakath and Strasser 2002</xref>). Among BH3-only proteins, Bim, Bid, and Puma are the major initiators of apoptosis because they activate Bax and Bak directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155412452737">Kim et al. 2009</xref>). The contributions of these molecules to PCD of the developing nervous system have been intensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155412452737">Putcha et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412452737">Krajewska et al. 2002</xref>). In Bim-null mice, PCD of retinal neurons is delayed, but the effect is transient, and the final number of retinal neurons is not significantly different from that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412452737">Doonan et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Puma is considered a critical mediator of neuronal apoptosis in normal development as well as in certain pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155412452737">Geng et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022155412452737">Steckley et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155412452737">Niizuma et al. 2009</xref>). In Puma-deficient mice, the number of RGCs, bipolar cells, and a specific subtype of amacrine cells is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412452737">Harder and Libby 2011</xref>), suggesting that Puma regulates developmental PCD in retinal neurons. However, the expression of Puma in various retinal cell types and at different developmental stages during normal retinogenesis remains to be explored. To elucidate the physiological function of Puma during retinal development, we analyzed the expression pattern and cellular localization of Puma in the rat retina by immunohistochemistry.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Prenatal and postnatal male and female rat pups and male Wistar rats (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were used in this study. Animals were raised under 12/12-hour cyclic light/dark conditions. Adult and postnatal animals were sacrificed by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. Prenatal rat pups were decapitated. Treatment of all animals was in strict accordance with institutional and National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and treatment of laboratory animals. The experimental protocols were approved by the animal ethics committee at Kansai Medical University.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022155412452737">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemical staining was carried out as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155412452737">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2010</xref>), with minor modifications. Under deep pentobarbital anesthesia, newborn and adult rats were cardiac perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Eyes were postfixed by immersion in the same fixative overnight. Prenatal rats were decapitated, and their eyes were enucleated and immersion fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Flatmount of the retina was prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155412452737">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2010</xref>). For cryostat sectioning, 20% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was used as a cryoprotective agent. Cryogenic sections (20 µm thick) were made through the optic disc in a dorsal to ventral direction. The specimens, both sections and flatmounts, were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with primary antibody, in phosphate- buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4C overnight. Primary antibodies were detected with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488- (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or Cy3-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The specimens were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 to visualize the nuclei and observed under a confocal microscope (LSM510 META, Carl Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany). Alexa Fluor 488 was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser, and the emitted green fluorescence was detected at 505–530 nm. Cy3 was excited at 543 nm using helium neon laser, and the emitted red fluorescence was detected at 561–753 nm. Hoechst 33258 was exited at 405 nm using a laser diode 405, and the emitted blue fluorescence was detected at 420–480 nm.</p>
<p>Primary antibodies used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022155412452737">Table 1</xref>. The anti-Puma (StressMarq, Victoria, BC, Canada) is an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against synthetic N-terminal polypeptide of human Puma α isoform (Uniprot number Q9BXH1). The specificity of the anti-Puma antibody was confirmed in this report as described in the Results section. It detects a single 23-kDa band in rat retinal lysate. Immunostaining was prevented by preabsorption with the antigen peptide. Most of the results were obtained using this antibody. We also used another anti-Puma antibody from ProSci Inc (Poway, CA), which was raised against a synthetic polypeptide of the human Puma α N-terminal region. The labeling patterns were consistent between these two anti-Puma antibodies.</p>

<title>Developmental Expression of Puma in the Retina</title>
<p>Puma localization in the developing rat retina was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. During retinal development, PCD is first observed around embryonic day (E) 16. PCD of RGCs occurs predominantly in the first postnatal week and that of other retinal neurons peaks at the second postnatal week and is almost complete within the first 3 weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022155412452737">Young 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412452737">Péquignot et al. 2003</xref>). Thus, we first examined retinal expression of Puma from E16 to P21. Puma immunoreactivity was detected in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) at E16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412452737">Fig. 1</xref>). At prenatal and early postnatal stages, Puma expression was relatively restricted to the GCL, but scattered labeling was also observed throughout the neuroblastic layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412452737">Fig. 1</xref>, E16–P2). Puma immunoreactivity in the neuroblastic layer was predominantly restricted to the inner half of the layer by P7, when the neuroblastic layer is divided into the inner and outer nuclear layers (INL and ONL) by the formation of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 2010</xref>). Thus, Puma appears to have been restricted to the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412452737">Fig. 1</xref>, P7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412452737">Fig. 2</xref>, P7).

At P14, immunoreactivity was clearly localized in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412452737">Fig. 1</xref>, P14 inset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412452737">Fig. 2</xref>, P14). The antibody labeled the cell somata in the GCL and the innermost part of the INL more strongly as compared with other layers. Labeling was faint in the ONL, the OPL, and the middle of the INL. In addition, two linear dense bands were readily detected in the inner plexiform layer (IPL).</p>
<p>Because Puma antigen was readily detected at P21, we continued to investigate expression in the older animals. After P21, immunoreactivity declined with age, especially in the cell somata in the INL and GCL. However, two bands in the IPL were still detected even at 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412452737">Fig. 1</xref>, arrowheads). No significant Puma immunoreactivity was detected in the retina at 15 weeks. Thus, Puma expression was predominantly detected in the cell somata of the rat retina until P21, and faint but significant labeling in two bands of the IPL continued for at least 8 weeks after birth.</p>
<p>To confirm the specificity of the antibody, we performed peptide neutralization experiments. The antibody was raised against the N terminus of the Puma α isoform, which does not share homology to the Puma β isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412452737">Nakano and Vousden 2001</xref>). When the Puma antibody was preincubated with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 30 amino acids of Puma α, no significant staining was detected in the P14 rat retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412452737">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412452737">Fig. 3a</xref>) or in the presence of a nonspecific peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412452737">Fig. 3c</xref>), Puma immunoreactivity was readily detected.

<title>Cell Types that Express Puma During Retinal Development</title>
<p>Most of the retinal neurons express Puma during postnatal development, which includes RGCs, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and photoreceptor cells. In contrast, Puma is most likely not expressed in glial cells, because the Puma-positive cells were not immunoreactive for the Müller cell marker S100β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155412452737">Terenghi et al. 1983</xref>) or the astrocyte marker GFAP. In the GCL, some Puma-positive cells were also positive for C38, which labels RGCs. Approximately 70% of RGCs were positive for Puma; thus, subpopulations of RGCs were negative for Puma. There are more than 20 subtypes of RGCs even in rodents, and we did not identify which subtypes were negative for Puma. It is possible that certain RGC subtypes do not express Puma during the period of development. A subset of cells in the GCL was positive for Puma but negative for C38. These were displaced amacrine cells, because approximately half the neurons in the rat GCL are displaced amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155412452737">Perry 1981</xref>), which are not labeled by C38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155412452737">Wakabayashi et al. 1996b</xref>). Some of the Puma-positive cells in the GCL were also positive for ChAT or calretinin, which labels subpopulations of amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155412452737">Keeley et al. 2007</xref>). But calretinin-positive cells negative for Puma were also observed. This further supports the possibility that Puma is expressed in subpopulations of displaced amacrine cells. The Puma antibody also labeled the somata of amacrine cells in the INL.</p>
<p>Puma immunoreactivity was faint in the outer half of the INL as compared with the GCL and the inner half of the INL. Nevertheless, Chx10-positive bipolar cells that expressed Puma were occasionally observed, and C38-positive horizontal cells in this layer were weakly labeled with Puma. Furthermore, Puma labeled the segment layer of photoreceptors. Taken together, these observations show that Puma is developmentally expressed at least in some members of each of the retinal neurons, including RGCs, amacrine cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and photoreceptor cells.</p>

<sec id="section12-0022155412452737">
<title>Contribution of Puma to Developmental Cell Death in Retinal Neurons</title>
<p>In Puma-deficient mice, RGCs, bipolar cells, and a subpopulation of amacrine cells were increased in number in the adult retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412452737">Harder and Libby 2011</xref>). These results, in part, are comparable to our observations that Puma was expressed in RGCs and bipolar cells, both of which require Puma for developmental PCD. In these cells, Puma is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm rather than the nuclei. Puma exhibits its proapoptotic activity by activating proapoptotic or inhibiting antiapoptotic proteins interacting in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155412452737">Vousden 2005</xref>). In addition, Bcl-2 family proteins are known to regulate dendritic development and synapse formation by regulating mitochondrial morphology and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412452737">Liu and Shio 2008</xref>). Thus, Puma is mostly localized to the cytoplasm. In contrast, although the number of ChAT-positive amacrine cells and the number of horizontal cells were not significantly different between wild-type and Puma-knockout mice, we found that Puma was expressed in these cell types. Cholinergic amacrine cells are overproduced and subsequently reduced in number by PCD during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155412452737">Strettoi and Volpini 2002</xref>), and we clearly showed that Puma expression was detected in almost all cholinergic amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0022155412452737">Fig. 8a</xref>−<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0022155412452737">h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0022155412452737">Fig. 9</xref>). Although Puma was highly expressed in cholinergic amacrine cells during development, there is no apparent increase in the number of cholinergic amacrine cells in Puma-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412452737">Harder and Libby 2011</xref>). The reasons for this discrepancy are not currently clear. It is possible that other BH3-only proteins such as Bim or Bid are responsible for developmental PCD in cholinergic amacrine cells. However, in Bim- or Bid-deficient mice, PCD during the development of retinal neurons is delayed, but in the adult there are no apparent changes in retinal cell numbers as compared with the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412452737">Doonan et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412452737">Harder and Libby 2011</xref>). The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins can antagonize the proapoptotic effect of Puma in cholinergic amacrine cells, but Bcl-2 is predominantly expressed in Müller cells rather than in retinal neurons after P10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412452737">Chen et al. 1994</xref>). Almost all cholinergic amacrine cells were labeled by anti-Puma, in contrast to the subpopulations of Puma-positive cells in other retinal neuron types. We suggest that at least in cholinergic amacrine cells, Puma may have some role(s) other than as an inducer of apoptosis, as discussed below. In the case of horizontal cells, they are not overproduced in large numbers during retinal development, and their developmental PCD is independent of Bcl-2 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155412452737">Strettoi and Volpini 2002</xref>). Thus, it may be possible that even if Puma is expressed in horizontal cells, apoptosis is not induced in these cells.</p>

<title>Functional Significance of Puma Expression in Retinal Neurons After Eye Opening</title>
<p>During retinal development in the rat, PCD begins to taper off before the eyes open and is complete by P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022155412452737">Young 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412452737">Péquignot et al. 2003</xref>). We also confirmed that there were no apoptotic cells in the retinas after 4 weeks (data not shown). Puma was highly expressed in retinal neurons until postnatal 2−3 weeks. This suggests that Puma has a significant role in developmental PCD in at least some cell types. However, even after eye opening, Puma was expressed in the inner retina. Furthermore, for up to 8 weeks postnatally, Puma was expressed in two bands in the IPL that corresponded to cholinergic amacrine cell dendrites. Puma was expressed in almost all cholinergic amacrine cell bodies, in which PCD is independent of Puma activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412452737">Harder and Libby 2011</xref>). These results strongly suggest that Puma has additional roles in cholinergic amacrine cells other than inducing PCD. Increasing reports indicate that Bcl-2 family of proteins regulate morphological and functional maturation of dendrites and synapses by modifying mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155412452737">Hansen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412452737">Li et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022155412452737">Tsubouchi et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412452737">Jiao and Li 2011</xref>). The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulate synaptic function without inducing cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155412452737">Jonas et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412452737">Jonas et al. 2005</xref>). More recently, caspase 3, a key mediator of apoptosis that is activated by Puma, has been shown to regulate synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412452737">D’Amelio et al. 2010</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Puma protein expressed in cholinergic amacrine cells contributes to the regulation of dendrite and synapse development. Continuous expression of Puma predominantly in the dendrites rather than in the somata suggests this possibility. Synaptic activity reduces Puma-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155412452737">Léveillé et al. 2010</xref>), and during retinal development, cholinergic amacrine cells receive rhythmic synaptic inputs and undergo spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022155412452737">Zhou 1998</xref>). Thus, it is possible that synaptic activity suppresses the proapoptotic effects of Puma in cholinergic amacrine cells. The retina is a powerful tool for analyzing the contribution of Bcl-2 family proteins to synaptic activity in an in vivo model of the central nervous system, because it is relatively easy to manipulate synaptic activity in this system (i.e., through light deprivation). Further investigation is necessary to resolve the reasons for continuous Puma expression in the retina.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>During retinal development, Puma was expressed in most retinal neuron types. Puma expression was predominantly found in neurons in the inner retina, although faint but significant expression was also seen in the outer retina. Puma immunoreactivity continued for up to 8 weeks after birth, mostly in the dendritic processes of cholinergic amacrine cells. Our results suggest that Puma may have significant functions in the retina other than in initiating PCD.</p>
