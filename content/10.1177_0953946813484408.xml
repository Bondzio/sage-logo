<abstract>
<p>Can moral theories of the kind Evagrius Ponticus upheld be useful today? Is his ethics one of many other virtue ethical theories or is it something else entirely? I argue that Evagrius’s theory of virtue is an instance of traditional Christian moral theory. Moreover, as a Christian theory, Evagrius’s moral system stands apart from non-Christian moral theories, virtue, consequentialist and deontological. I further maintain that his morality is robust, because it is able to undercut some of the strongest critiques generally made against moral theories: those of inconsistency and selfishness. It is also successful, because it produced fertile cultural movements that continue at present. I conclude, however, that its theistic, kenotic and inverted nature presents a direct challenge to ethical assumptions of today.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Evagrius of Pontus (c. 345–399) was a Christian philosophical theologian, known especially for his systematization of Christian virtue ethics and epistemology. Alongside consequentialism and deontology, various forms of virtue ethics (hereafter VE) and virtue epistemology have become some of the more influential approaches within normative ethics. Given Evagrius’s authority in antiquity and the growing interest in his psychology today, an assessment of his moral position and of some of the arguments for and against it promises to be fruitful.</p>
<p>The first section expounds Evagrius’s views on virtue and morality in the order in which he presents the sequence of the stages of moral growth as it unfolds within the individual: from simple <italic>praxis</italic> (meaning simple obedience to the moral commandments) to <italic>apatheia</italic> (freedom from destructive passions) to <italic>bios theoretikos</italic> (a life based on the vision of God) and <italic>gnosis</italic> (actual experience of God). Contingent issues, such as whether there are many virtues or one unified virtue, if virtues are strong or fragile, and if virtues should be taught or are natural, will likewise be discussed, if only in passing. Thus, as regards virtues and the good that is their goal, this article will argue that Evagrius is both a pluralist and a unitarian, depending on the specific moral stage in question. While lower virtues are multiple and may direct their possessor to multiple goods, the perfected virtue is one and tends towards one unified ultimate good. Fundamentally, the first section will establish the dependence of Evagrius’s morality on Christian doctrines of creation, the fall and salvation in God.</p>
<p>Due to lack of space, the second section will address only one of the currently perceived criticisms of VE and situate Evagrius’s Christian morality in relation to it. This is the problem of applicability. It will be argued that what makes Evagrius’s VE difficult to apply today is precisely what sets it apart from modern ethical and virtue ethical theories: its theocentric and objectivist nature and its dependency upon early Christian metaphysics of the creation out of non-existence, the objectivist <italic>logoi-</italic>doctrine and the teaching about the primordial fall and eschatological restoration in Christ. The dilemma one faces on account of a VE like this is as follows: do we establish a common denominator of values so as to include the diverse culture-specific views about right and wrong and thereby trim classical Christian VE such as Evagrius’s to size? Or do we keep ancient Christian VE intact but then pay the price (which a Christian might argue is a price worth paying) of failing to implant it within the moral cultures of today?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946813484408">
<title>Contours of Evagrian Moral Perfection Theory</title>
<p>Evagrius’s ethical system appears to belong within Christian virtue ethical systems. In turn, it is customary to place Christian VE under the umbrella of ancient VE, with Plato and Aristotle being its most prominent non-Christian representatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946813484408">1</xref></sup> It is often claimed that three commitments unify all virtue ethical systems: the concept of virtues; the category of intelligent virtue akin to Aristotle’s <italic>phronesis</italic>; and the idea of an ultimate good, or <italic>eudaimonia</italic>, in respect of which virtues are excellences toward. Although founded on metaphysical principles different from those of Plato and Aristotle, Christian VE (Evagrius’s included) operates with these three key virtue ethical concepts.</p>
<sec id="section3-0953946813484408">
<title>Virtues</title>
<p>Evagrius’s morality satisfies the first criterion for VE in that his appears to be a virtue-based morality. For him, one progresses towards becoming a perfect human being (a <italic>gnosticus</italic>) by acquiring or desiring to acquire virtues, <italic>aretai</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946813484408">2</xref></sup> It is in this sense that his morality is a virtue-based morality. Accumulated virtues make their possessor a virtuous person or a virtuous person in the making. So what are Evagrius’s virtues? A broad definition for virtues might be that these are characteristics and traits of character, revealing themselves in moral dispositions and moral acts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946813484408">3</xref></sup> There may be virtues for oneself and for others, in respect of whether certain traits are meant to foster features of autonomy or those of relationships. Virtues, however, are not any characteristics but only those of a certain kind: activities and underlying them properties such as being deceptive or being a smoker presumably are not virtues, whilst honesty, courage, humility and some forms of love presumably are. Consequently, virtues are excellent and admirable properties of character capable of motivating right actions and producing beneficial states of affairs for individuals and entire groups. Virtues are excellences of being for the good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946813484408">4</xref></sup> Virtues are thus supposed to be both intrinsically and instrumentally good: they are goods in their own right and they bring about greater goods. There is normativity and prescriptivity associated with virtues. For Evagrius, however, virtues are all of these things but also something else. They are character traits with a theistic point of reference: virtues are the true good, because they are ‘the glory that comes from God alone’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946813484408">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946813484408">
<title>Virtues as True Nature</title>
<p>Are virtues given or learned? There is a tension in Evagrius between an optimistic view of the naturalness of morality, on the one hand, and the divorce between the actual and ideal state of our humanity, on the other. Our capacity for acting morally is based on our very nature. To early Christians, virtuous inclinations and behaviours are part of the humans’ authentic natural make-up, and there is a sense that humans possess virtuous inclinations at birth. No one is born either evil or a tabula rasa. Consequently, to Evagrius, virtues are eminently learnable and teachable: to acquire moral sense, one need not embark upon moral education from scratch, mastering an alien new subject. All that is needed is to remember and renew in oneself moral dispositions that are already there, encoded in the very structure of the mind. On this view, evil and immorality are an acquired secondary condition of the psyche. ‘If death is secondary to life and sickness comes after health’, holds Evagrius, ‘it is clear that evil too is secondary to virtue’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946813484408">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>For natural goodness to flourish, then, acquired evil habits simply need to be unlearnt. At the same time, however, there is an understanding that good traits of character are laborious to cultivate: in the actual state of humanity, they lie dormant, having been all but choked by opposing proclivities towards non-virtuous behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946813484408">7</xref></sup> These are destructive impulses often ingrained as character faults—Evagrius and his tradition call them passions-vices (<italic>pathe</italic>), which the first humans acquired as they fell from the original grace and goodness of their condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946813484408">8</xref></sup> In the present state of the human race, therefore, re-learning virtues involves excavating and re-growing them in repentance and conversion, before any system of ethics can be founded on them at all. Consequently, Evagrius’s virtue-based outlook is sobering: virtue is not an actual state of humans as they are observable in everyday life, but a state of things and of humanity as they once were and as they will be when all become re-converted to Christ. In other words, for Evagrius, the capacities of humans, excellent at their creation, were distorted by the fall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946813484408">9</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0953946813484408">
<title>The Structured Self and Tri-divisional Moral Progress</title>
<p>Evagrius develops his virtue theory by both following classical models and reinterpreting them. Flourishing in the soul, established virtues become its character traits. As the soul has multiple levels, so its virtuous and other characteristics are manifold too. Evagrius uses the philosophic language of his time to describe the soul as a structure of three levels:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946813484408">10</xref></sup> the two lower ones, the irascible part (<italic>thumos</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946813484408">11</xref></sup> and desiring part (<italic>epithymia</italic>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946813484408">12</xref></sup> and the peak of the soul, the rational mind-<italic>nous</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946813484408">13</xref></sup> The virtues attach themselves to all three parts; some are lower, while others are more exalted. Thus, moral dispositions that relate to our irascible and desirous powers are the simpler and lower ones, tending towards moral goods of a lesser dimension or magnitude, while those associated with our rationality, the so-called virtues of the mind,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946813484408">14</xref></sup> are the loftier moral excellences, generative of more ultimate moral goods. This diversity forms a hierarchy of moral dispositions, whereby multiple virtues are dynamic powers of excellence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946813484408">15</xref></sup> all tending upwards toward one virtuousness and good. It is thus hoped that, as one’s life unfolds, the many and variable good dispositions of the self will all concur into one total virtuousness of character. Evagrius calls this unified goodness of character ‘passionlessness’, <italic>apatheia</italic>, and ‘knowledge’ of ultimate things, <italic>gnosis.</italic> However, while Evagrius borrows his division of the human psyche into three parts from Hellenic philosophers, he overturns the Greek philosophical model, putting it, in <italic>Practicus</italic> 1, into the Christian framework, which suggests that the moral ascent commences, unfolds and culminates within the schema of the Christian life and that Christianity is the necessary condition of morality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946813484408">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>This architecture of the soul corresponds to Evagrius’s three stages of Christian moral growth: the Christian begins to form his moral sense from cultivating simpler practical virtues (those of <italic>praxis</italic>), then progresses to more spiritual and contemplative ones (those of <italic>theoria</italic>) and finally is perfected through the knowledge of God (<italic>theologia</italic>), as described in <italic>Practicus</italic>, 1:
<disp-quote>
<p>Christianity is the doctrine of our Saviour Jesus Christ composed of practical virtue (<italic>praktike</italic> or <italic>praxis</italic> in other contexts), natural contemplation (<italic>phusike</italic>), and theology (<italic>theologia</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946813484408">17</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0953946813484408">
<title>Praxis—Beginners’ Virtues and Goods</title>
<p>As a converted Christian, one embarks on a life-long moral ascent by engaging in simpler moral acts and cultivating more basic virtuous behaviour, which Evagrius calls the stage of <italic>praxis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946813484408">18</xref></sup></italic> What are these simpler moral acts and their corresponding virtues, which Evagrius terms ‘the bodily virtues’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946813484408">19</xref></sup> Do they exist in human beings at all? Beginners’ moral acts and virtues are those with which one <italic>begins</italic> to be moral. Just as in everyday life, in learning a profession, such as farming, or being a soldier or teacher, one starts by carrying out relatively easy tasks and then progresses to becoming fully professional, so in learning to be moral one starts off by rising up to smaller moral challenges and then moving on to greater ones. For instance, one might begin by performing moral acts of a limited nature, such as abstaining from chocolate only on certain days of the week or being friendly only to a limited circle of friends, and that merely <italic>from time to time</italic>, and then progress to acting as a morally upright subject might be expected to act in a wide variety of situations and striving to do so <italic>all of the time</italic>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, beginners’ virtues and good dispositions fall short of perfection, because these virtues are fragile, requiring an effort to act upon and a greater one to do so habitually. They are easily overpowered and defeated by the subject’s situational inexperience, external challenges, the force of her own less than virtuous habits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946813484408">20</xref></sup> Thus, gluttony vies with abstinence, attachment to money with generosity, the inflated ego with a humble idea of oneself. In sum, ‘Evil thoughts cut off (or fight against) good thoughts, and in turn are cut off by good thoughts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946813484408">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A beginner’s virtues are mini-virtues, with only a limited scope of effectiveness in reviving our moral sense and bringing about what is good. These virtues are multiple and fragmented, because they depend on manifold specific situations. That they are multiple and fragmented means that they may be in conflict with one another, so that in pursuing one moral outcome the agent overlooks another, possibly as valuable as the first but whose achievement may require a different course of action altogether. These virtues are imperfect because their owner as yet knows neither the art of their prioritizing nor the kind of moral goods they are meant to produce.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946813484408">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evagrius’s picture of the fragile morality and unstable freedom at the beginner’s stage of <italic>praxis</italic> appears to fit in with recent sets of experiments in empirical psychology, where subjects (usually children) manifested a confused understanding of what constituted a moral act and inconsistency in choosing to act morally, such as to be truthful and not cheat, in a range of situations. These results were taken as a basis for questioning the very existence of virtues and of freedom, or for that matter of any traits of character at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946813484408">23</xref></sup> Evagrius, however, would counter this by emphasizing that virtuousness is dynamic growth and presupposes attention not merely to acting itself but to the motives and goals of acting. Consequently, early-stage virtues may be fragile and inconsistent, productive of confused or even failed moral results, and yet they are real moral traits in respect to their Christian motivation and direction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946813484408">24</xref></sup> What makes Evagrius’s position here tenable is his conception of the two contrasting states of human nature: the actual, less than optimal one, and the ideal moral one.</p>
<p>Beginners’ virtues, then, exist, and deserve respect, and nurturing the novice’s embryonic moral qualities is the centrepiece of Evagrius’s moral project both in the <italic>Practicus</italic> and <italic>On the Thoughts.</italic> Evagrius may be reluctant to sweep novices prematurely into loftier moral spheres, because ‘those at the level of practical virtue (<italic>practikoi</italic>) understand [mere] practical morality; the masters [alone] (<italic>gnostikoi</italic>) will see the [wisdom of] gnostic things’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946813484408">25</xref></sup> Yet this reluctance comes from genuine care for those young in spiritual living. In spite of their frailty and imperfection, beginners’ virtues are genuine intrinsic moral goods directed towards greater goods. Importantly, they mature to generate his or her virtues:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946813484408">26</xref></sup>

<p>Let the virtues of the body lead you to those of the soul; and the virtues of the soul to those of the spirit; and these, in turn, to immaterial and principal knowledge.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section7-0953946813484408">
<title>Apatheia, the Unified Virtue</title>
<p>Evagrius’s second-tier virtue is <italic>apatheia. Apatheia</italic> (‘passionlessness’) is a stable, happy and peaceful disposition of the moral agent. Plato and Aristotle are known to operate with the category of practical wisdom, <italic>phronesis</italic>, and <italic>apatheia</italic> in early Christian and Stoic thought is akin to it. Like Aristotle’s <italic>phronesis</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946813484408">27</xref></sup> <italic>apatheia</italic> is a condition of mature virtue, which distinguishes moral adults from nice children. It is virtuousness of a higher degree, because it situates itself within the highest part of the soul, the intellect. <italic>Apatheia</italic> is stable, consistent and is the moral compass (the awakened conscience<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946813484408">28</xref></sup>) of the moral agent. <italic>Apatheia</italic> grows out of the beginner’s multiple virtues and unites them into integrated virtuousness, enabling its possessor to practise all virtues ‘equally (ἐΠíσηj) and constantly (ἀεì).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946813484408">29</xref></sup> <italic>Apatheia</italic> is both created by <italic>praxis</italic> and generates <italic>praxis</italic> of a higher degree.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946813484408">30</xref></sup> <italic>Apatheia</italic> is about understating moral reasons and principles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946813484408">31</xref></sup> and being able to follow them consistently and wisely. <italic>Apatheia</italic> enables the agent to act morally and out of right motives in all situations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946813484408">32</xref></sup> Like <italic>phronesis</italic>, therefore, <italic>apatheia</italic> is an intelligent virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946813484408">33</xref></sup> <italic>Apatheia</italic> is a unified moral good leading to higher moral goods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0953946813484408">
<title>Dual Aspect of Apatheia</title>
<p><italic>Apatheia</italic> presupposes a two-fold work of psychological introspection, which consists of negations and affirmations. It arises through the agent’s psychological dissociation of himself from harmful mental attitudes, while cultivating beneficial ones. The subject gazes inside herself so as to separate authentic features of the self from delusions posing as these.</p>
<p>The false tendencies in the soul are those that do violence to the authentic moral deep self by attempting to force it to become irrationally obsessed with objects and situations in the world. Once entrenched as thought-habits, these mental tendencies will progressively erode one’s freedom of decision-making, so that one’s mental gaze moves from fixating upon evil concepts in the mind (<italic>logosmoi</italic>) to acting these fantasies out in reality. This is how passions, <italic>pathe</italic>, affect the mind. The term signifies established deleterious patterns of thinking and acting, where <italic>pathos</italic> is ‘suffering’: the self remains passive vis-à-vis its own irrational impulses and loses its decision-making power. Consequently, nurturing <italic>apatheia</italic> requires an inner struggle to restore the mind’s sovereignty over its agency. Being in charge of one’s desires and imaginations is where control over one’s life begins. <italic>Apatheia’</italic>s negative aspect, therefore, consists in asserting one’s freedom by detaching oneself from the irrationality of the <italic>pathe</italic>, and Evagrius is confident that all irrational and unreasonable desires can eventually be completely rejected and transformed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946813484408">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the exercise implies not the cessation of all interaction with things themselves but the elimination of the impassioned component of thought about them, such as irrational anger, greed or lust. Disengagement from impassioned attitudes to things is accompanied by the cultivation of calm, peaceful and neutral dispositions in the soul. In a famous passage Evagrius likens the purification of the mind’s concepts and thoughts to the work of the shepherd protecting his sheep (good thoughts and concepts) by chasing away the predatory wolves (evil impulses in the lower soul):
<disp-quote>
<p>The Lord entrusted the concepts of this age to man as…sheep to a good shepherd… He joined to [man] the irascible part and the desirous part, so that with the one he would put to flight the representations that are from the wolves, and with the other he would cherish the sheep.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946813484408">35</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The key point in this morality of purification and cultivation is that the objects in the world are neither evil nor do they of themselves move us to evil. ‘Nothing is evil among created beings’, states Maximus the Confessor in a distinctively Evagrian mode.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946813484408">36</xref></sup> Is it then the mind’s function of forming concepts of things that is evil? As every natural function is good and it is the mind’s natural function to think thoughts, this function is not blameworthy. Rather, evil is the mind’s acquired propensity of the ‘fallen state’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946813484408">37</xref></sup> to form concepts in a ‘passionate’ way. Evagrius expounds this in this key passage:
<disp-quote>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that a thought full of avarice is suggested to you. Distinguish between the component elements: the intellect, which has accepted the thought, the intellection of gold, gold itself, and the passion of avarice. Then ask: in which of these does the sin consist? Is it the intellect? But how then can the intellect be the image of God? Is it the intellection of gold? But what sensible person would ever say that? Then is gold itself the sin? In that case, why was it created? It follows, then, that the cause of the sin is the fourth element, which is neither an objective reality, nor the intellection of something real, but is a certain noxious pleasure which, once it is freely chosen, compels the intellect to misuse what God has created. It is this pleasure that the law of God commands us to cut off.<italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946813484408">38</xref></sup></italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maximus the Confessor follows Evagrius’s account of perception and concept-formation by emphasizing: ‘Vice is the wrong use of our conceptual images of things, which leads us to misuse the things themselves.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946813484408">39</xref></sup> He continues: ‘Things are outside the intellect, but the conceptual images of these things are formed within it. It is consequently in the intellect’s power to make good or bad use of these conceptual images. Their wrong use is followed by the misuse of things themselves.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946813484408">40</xref></sup> Consequently, ‘If a man does not first sin in his mind, he will never sin in action.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946813484408">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is therefore the mind-<italic>nous</italic> that is responsible for a good or evil use of objects. The key to behaving morally at all times, then, is to disentangle normal perception and the thinking process from the passionate component. The habit of doing this at all times eventually produces the virtuous state of <italic>apatheia.</italic></p>
<p>Consequently, <italic>apatheia</italic>’s goal is to build the moral self up rather than tear it apart. Separating oneself from harmful inner inclinations does not kill off any of the soul’s powers. Instead it turns them around. This kind of virtue-based morality essentially adumbrates the idea that at the heart of the soul’s wrongful movements lie aspirations for the good, albeit distorted from their original design. <italic>Apatheia</italic>, therefore, sublimates, redirects and heals all of the soul’s powers and all its parts restoring the soul to its authentic healthy nature (φύσις) whereby ‘the appetitive part desires virtue, the irascible part contends for it and the rational part devotes itself to the contemplation of beings’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946813484408">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>It does so through exercises of ascetic introspection that early Christian traditions call a ‘flight from the body’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946813484408">43</xref></sup> Here the ‘body’ one endeavours to separate oneself from is not the actual material component of the human person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946813484408">44</xref></sup> (Corporeality is part of what it is to be fully human and the numerical identity of each body continues: each body will be resurrected at the Last Judgment as itself, albeit in a more spiritual form,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946813484408">45</xref></sup> and not as some other body or as somebody else’s body.) But one separates oneself from what St Paul declares to be ‘the body of this death’ (Rom. 7:24): the fallen condition of the human being, what Evagrius terms ‘the entire life of wickedness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946813484408">46</xref></sup> The fallen ‘life of wickedness’ manifests itself in the irrational thought-patterns in the lower soul that disrupt the self’s normative moral function.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of Evagrius’s <italic>apatheia</italic> in this building up of the moral person has virtually no bounds, in that practically any state of depravity can be transformed into instances of virtue. Thus, <italic>apatheia</italic> manifests itself in virtuous combative action and confrontation with the society’s agendas of immorality and one’s own less than moral inclinations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946813484408">47</xref></sup> It cultivates spiritual pleasures (πνϵυματικήν ἡδoνήν) such as the knowledge of sublime divine mysteries, <italic>gnosis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946813484408">48</xref></sup> <italic>Apathea</italic> transforms destructive sadness (λύπη) over a frustrated desire<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946813484408">49</xref></sup> into attributes of merit by directing it to hone in on one’s imperfections such as the great distance between one’s actual less than perfect state and the final moral perfection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946813484408">50</xref></sup> Therein Evagrius is an anthropological maximalist who holds that ‘the powers of the soul’ are ‘good or bad according to their usage’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946813484408">51</xref></sup> allowing for limitless horizons for self-reform.</p>

<sec id="section9-0953946813484408">
<title>Eudaimonia and Telos</title>
<p>In accordance with classical virtue traditions, Evagrius’s moral system is likewise founded on the third fundamental concept, that of <italic>telos</italic>, goal, understood as <italic>eudaimonia</italic>, happiness or flourishing, in respect to which virtues are excellences toward.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0953946813484408">
<title>Virtuousness as Happiness</title>
<p>There is a traditional understanding that virtues are good traits of the self that are beneficial to have, so that possessing virtues and leading a virtuous life are goods in their own right. Conversely, true enjoyments and pleasures are virtuous, because non-virtuous pleasures are not truly happy. The collocation of virtues, enjoyment and happiness is, for instance, what Aristotle’s <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic> is about. For Aristotle, happiness, <italic>eudaimonia</italic>, presupposes virtuous action, even if virtue itself is not yet happiness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946813484408">52</xref></sup> Book I of the <italic>Ethics</italic> clearly indicates that virtues are at least components of happiness. In line with this account, <italic>apatheia</italic> in Evagrius and other Christian ethicists is a truly happy state in which the person ‘does not distance his heart from any spiritual joy’ (πνϵυματικῆς ϵύφρoσύης)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946813484408">53</xref></sup> and ‘blessedness’ (μακαριότις), because ‘blessedness is the end of [virtuous] man’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946813484408">54</xref></sup> Conversely, for him, spiritual happiness presupposes virtues and <italic>apatheia</italic>. Evagrius’s ethical views are therefore eudaimonic and thus fulfil the third criterion for VE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0953946813484408">
<title>Bios Theoretikos, Universalism and Moral Prescriptivism</title>
<p>Virtues, however, are also instrumental goods leading to goods beyond themselves. As in other instances of VE, the greater goods that virtues lead towards are eudaimonic and consist in the flourishing of the moral agent. Thus, Aristotle maintains that the truly happy life consists in the activity of contemplation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946813484408">55</xref></sup> Similarly in Evagrius, flourishing presupposes the possession of knowledge and the <italic>bios theoretikos</italic>.</p>
<p>Where Evagrius the Christian fundamentally diverges from both his Greek antecedents and modern non-theistic virtue ethics is the specifics of this contemplative flourishing. For his objective excellences Plato has the Forms and especially the Form of the Good,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946813484408">56</xref></sup> of which one partakes through contemplation, but Plato lacks any articulated doctrine of God the Creator fashioning the universe from non-existence into being. As a Christian, Evagrius operates with these foundational tenets,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0953946813484408">57</xref></sup> and the shape of his moral and metaphysical universe is dictated by his grounding in the Christian faith in God the Trinity who begets beings by creating them and then engaging with them in a variety of merciful and loving ways, and in particular through the Incarnation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The objects of his <italic>theoria</italic> are the objective immaterial goods locked in beings, the <italic>logoi</italic>, which the divine Logos implanted in the universe at its creation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0953946813484408">58</xref></sup> The <italic>logoi</italic> manifest God’s action upon creation and the ways he sustains it in its timeless destiny, what Evagrius calls God’s ‘finger’ upon the universe<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0953946813484408">59</xref></sup> and the principles of his providence and judgment for beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0953946813484408">60</xref></sup> God manifests himself through his glory in the universe and in history, and the <italic>logoi</italic> reflect it. The knowledge of the glory of creation and of God is the key to the personal flourishing of the moral agent and is the basis for the early Christian doctrine of deification, where one develops into the moral agent one is meant to be by modelling oneself on the prototype Christ, who in his Incarnation assimilated himself to the human condition as much as was possible. In a reciprocal process, contemplation assimilates one to the Creator and his Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0953946813484408">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evagrius’s moral theory at this point is rather complex in that he holds that the glory that is in beings <italic>also</italic> reflects the blueprints of creation in the mind of God. The Creator performs the work of creating by referring to these blueprints in an act of his own primordial contemplation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0953946813484408">62</xref></sup> Consequently, in contemplating the created universe, the agent learns contemplation from the Creator himself. Since God’s creation is contemplation, and humans, who are in the divine image, are called to contemplate, they are required to become micro-creators.</p>
<p>So what kinds of flourishing does human contemplation of the universe produce? One of them is what Charles Taylor calls <italic>attunement</italic>. In Evagrius, contemplation makes the person <italic>attuned</italic> to the natural world in its primordial goodness—once the latter has been re-discovered in its <italic>logoi</italic>. Contemplation thus gives the person the understanding of the true nature of things and his place in nature—an understanding that Taylor identifies as the fundamental principle of rationality that works for all cultures and times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0953946813484408">63</xref></sup> In Evagrius, however, the attunement is more far-reaching and concerns not merely man and nature but also the relationship between man and God, so that, through assimilation, the contemplating human subject comes to possess some of the divine characteristics: if God is free, infinite, uncreated, good and Creator, and if divine activity <italic>ad extra</italic> regarding contingent beings manifests at least some of God’s immanent properties, then Evagrius expects to find corresponding properties in the fully virtuous human agent leading a <italic>bios theoretikos.</italic> Some of these might be: God-orientated autonomy and freedom, goodness, created infinity understood as possibilities of created immortality through entering the Kingdom and, as mentioned above, creativity. Virtuous contemplative creativity, in particular, is our re-creating the universe and ourselves through progressively uncovering the glory of God in beings and in us and then offering this glory back to him as a sacrifice of praise.</p>
<p>Contemporary philosophical studies in ethics frequently focus on the issue of how morality forms persons. The autonomous person authors his/her own life by exercising his/her ability to make free choices about directions of their life,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0953946813484408">64</xref></sup> which the person can thus re-write and redeem, present, future and even the past. Evagrius’s anthropology, however, transcends this. While pointing to new quasi-limitless anthropological possibilities in terms of auto-(re)constitution,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0953946813484408">65</xref></sup> it is ultimately a form of biblical <italic>theo</italic>-centrism based on the principle of human beings being made in the image of the Creator.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0953946813484408">66</xref></sup> Accordingly, to be a fully formed moral person is growing to become ‘the new Adam’, who is ‘made again according to the image of his Creator’—an Adam in whom, thanks to dispassion (<italic>apatheia</italic>), there is ‘neither male nor female’ and thanks to singleness of faith, there is ‘neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but Christ is all, and in all’ (Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:10-11).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0953946813484408">67</xref></sup> It is these moral truths of salvation as deification that are the objects of human contemplation, because they sum up God’s providence and judgment for the creation. And it is these moral truths that Christian contemplation is instrumental in bringing about. Inasmuch as attunement with the cosmos and the Creator, creativity and the building up of oneself might be seen as empowering, these features of Evagrius’s morality would be of interest to ethicists and a broader public today.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0953946813484408">
<title>The Fall and the Kenotic Nature of Christian Morality</title>
<p>But there is a catch. In the same way as other early Christian thinkers, Evagrius works with the premise that God’s original creation, in particular human beings, was ‘very good’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0953946813484408">68</xref></sup> meaning that there was no evil in the original creation at all. Humans, moreover, were made in the divine ‘image and likeness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0953946813484408">69</xref></sup> The goodness of creatures becomes impaired and all but lost in the fall, which Evagrius calls the ‘Movement’ of the first rational beings. The incarnation of the divine Logos becomes the necessary means for the restoration of the original ‘good’ creation that was lost. Consequently, Evagrius’s Christian morality is essentially restorative of the goodness that was lost, and the specific virtues that contemplation and <italic>praxis</italic> cultivate are the Christian commandments of the love of God and neighbour taken in a radical and kenotic sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0953946813484408">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The requirement of our <italic>kenosis</italic>, or sacrificial self-emptying, as a <italic>sine qua non</italic> condition of morality is a further key feature of Evagrius’s VE and this creates more difficulties. Blissful as <italic>apatheia</italic> and contemplation of God’s glory<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0953946813484408">71</xref></sup> may be, they are also categorical and involve sacrifices. Our becoming as persons is not a gentle hyperbole but a radical moral parabolic U-turn from one’s present morally undesirable condition to a new virtuous one in God, which Evagrius describes with metaphors of extreme sacrifice, warfare, crucifixion and death in the spirit of Paul’s theology of the cross.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0953946813484408">72</xref></sup> Thus, the Philocalic <italic>Evagriana</italic> bases its teaching about the blessings of <italic>hesychia</italic>, life of stillness, on the following radical sayings: ‘Go and sell all you have and give to the poor’ (Matt. 19.21) and ‘deny yourself, taking up your cross’ (Matt. 16:24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0953946813484408">73</xref></sup> ‘Let the dead bury their dead, says the Lord; but come, follow me’ (cf. Matt. 8:22);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0953946813484408">74</xref></sup> ‘the sufferings of this present time’…‘are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us’ (Rom. 8:18);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0953946813484408">75</xref></sup> and ‘seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things as well will be given to you’ (Matt. 6:33).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0953946813484408">76</xref></sup> This small selection points to the otherworldly and self-sacrificial nature of Evagrius’s moral goods and <italic>eudaimonia</italic>. Christian <italic>eudaimonia</italic> may be the enjoyment of the Kingdom, yet this Kingdom is not of the order of the pleasures ‘of this world’ (cf. Jn 18:36), such as the life of prosperity and political success Plato and Aristotle might emphasise, but the kenotic <italic>eudaimonia</italic> of the beatitudes of the Kingdom of Matt. 5 cited previously.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0953946813484408">77</xref></sup> What we have in Evagrius, therefore, is an ‘inverted’ VE, where the taxonomy is ‘upside down’: the ethical norms of ‘this world’ are upturned as in Matt. 5: ‘You have heard that it was said by them of old time… But I say unto you…’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0953946813484408">78</xref></sup> These are the kenotic commandments of Christ’s inverted morality of perfection: it responds to the kenosis of the Incarnation by emptying the self of its fallen selfish content and filling it with a new spiritually altruistic one in the likeness of Christ.</p>

<title>Internal and External Problems</title>
<p>So what are we left with? The main aspects of Evagrius’s theory of virtue expounded, how useful is it to current philosophical debates and to a wider public interested in matters of spirituality? It is expedient at this stage to address one specific puzzlement that Evagrius’s morality presents: its applicability in wider social contexts today. As based on a universalist, monist metaphysics, his is an absolute moral realism. On one hand, this might seem philosophically attractive: if virtues and goods are universal features and part of the ‘furniture of things’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0953946813484408">79</xref></sup> and of the self they are discoverable and the same for all. This helps eliminate moral ambiguity and makes it absolutely clear how I am to act in every situation for my own and everyone else’s good. One responds to a situation of apparent moral dilemma not by modifying one’s ethics but by discovering the overall moral principle. The unified metaphysical goods also provide the explanatory principles necessary for virtuous traits to ‘sit on’ and so not to be ‘blind’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0953946813484408">80</xref></sup> Conversely, what we have in Evagrius’s metaphysical goods of <italic>apatheia</italic> and contemplation is not just bare rigid principles and sets of rules as what seems to obtain in Kant,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0953946813484408">81</xref></sup> but flexibility with regard to specific situations that are to be acted upon through experience and intuition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0953946813484408">82</xref></sup> All of this contributes to this being a well-grounded robust philosophical moral theory. On the other hand, however, Mackie could not be more right<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0953946813484408">83</xref></sup> and suggesting that, to uncover an answer to a moral perplexity, one ought to have a spell of contemplation, may hardly be an option in the current post-enlightenment secularized context. But this is not what Evagrius suggests. The knowledge of the ‘first principles’ requires noetic spiritual vision, which very few have. This is where the spiritual fatherhood of the <italic>gnosticus</italic> comes into the picture: through turning to spiritual directors, Christians desiring to act morally receive instruction as to how to act in a specific situation. In this way, Evagrius’s ethics is both rigorous and not condemnatory. Instead, it is constructive and loving.</p>
<p>More specifically, how are we to apply Evagrius’s Christian inverted ethics in contexts where one’s interests conflict with the interests of others? Where personal welfares are at stake, might not the kenotic nature of this morality create situations where not mere respect for the otherness of the other but a kenotic preference for their interests and prosperity over mine would be requisite? This raises more hard questions about potentially irreconcilable conflicts between currently acceptable forms of social and political altruism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0953946813484408">84</xref></sup> and the Christian kenotic altruism Evagrius promulgates. Kenotic moralities are problematic to practise in non-kenotic environments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0953946813484408">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>To modern morality and non-Christian VE, then, Evagrius presents a challenge and a stumbling block.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0953946813484408">86</xref></sup> His theory of virtue is not about finding a cure for cancer or balancing the adults’ sexual and emotional needs with the needs of children in a family. His ethics is otherworldly and eschatological, challenging all hedonistic, utilitarian and immanent ethical systems. It is not a means of synthesis but an indicator of a profound disagreement: that between the ‘is’ and the ‘ought’ in Christ, and between the ‘fallen’ and the ‘unfallen’, and there is no covering it up. Therein lies the value of Evagrius and the rest of Christian thinking even to secularist ethics of today. Ultimately it is about re-discovering the dynamic humanity in Christ towards the infinity of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Hence Evagrius’s instruction about the evil thoughts (<italic>logismoi</italic>) vying with the opposing virtuous dispositions in <italic>Practicus</italic>, 6-15. The tutoring in <italic>Practicus</italic> is needed because the vices are still strong, while the opposing virtues are ‘young’. It is on the basis of chapters such as these that Evagrius is credited to be the first to articulate a list of fundamental eight evil thoughts or spirits of malice, which in Western middle ages crystallised into the ‘seven deadly sins’.</p>

<p>As Kallistos Ware has remarked in private conversation (15 January 2013), an ultimate difficulty with this type of morality for today is that it admits of no double standards: there is no perfection for some and mere basic precepts for others. Perfection is the only gold standard for all (cf. Matt. 5:48). There is no basic minimum but only the Christ-like maximum.</p>
