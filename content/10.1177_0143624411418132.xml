<p>In this study, test reference year (TRY) data for three UK cities are generated from the new UKCP09 climate change projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> for a variety of future time horizons and carbon emission scenario assumptions. The data are applied to the energy simulation of three commercial buildings and one house for the three city locations (London, Manchester and Edinburgh), three future time horizons in this century and three carbon emission scenarios. Results are compared with those generated using alternative TRYs from two other research groups who used UKCP09<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> as well as with the existing TRY data sets which form the CIBSE Future Weather Years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411418132">2</xref></sup> in order to produce robust results. Results of future simulations of peak summer operative temperatures, peak cooling demand, annual cooling energy, peak heating demand and annual heating energy are presented for the four building case studies benchmarked against control weather data for the period 1960–1989. The results show increasing internal operative temperatures (non-air-conditioned) and increasing air-conditioning demands (air-conditioned) throughout this century and though peak heating demands remain similar to control data, annual heating energy consumptions can be expected to fall sharply.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Practical applications:</italic></bold> Currently, practitioners can use Test Reference Years for use in building energy simulations. In 2009, the CIBSE released Future Weather Years, which go further by allowing practitioners to explore the thermal and comfort behaviour of buildings at future time horizons thus helping to ‘future proof’ a design. In 2009, the United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme released a new generation of climate change scenario data (the UKCP09 climate change projections) using probabilistic methods. These are the most comprehensive data yet and provides a greater degree of detail than was available to generate the CIBSE Future Weather Years. It is therefore likely that the new data will gradually become the normal basis for investigating future building thermal and comfort response. In this study, a sample of TRY is generated from the UKCP09 data and applied to the simulation of a sample of ‘real’ buildings. The results are compared with both the existing CIBSE Future Weather Years as well as with Test Reference Years generated using UKCP09 by two other research groups. The results provide a robust way forward for simulating building thermal and comfort response using future weather data.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0143624411418132"><title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Predictions published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicate an increase in global average surface temperature in different scenario ranges of 1.1–2.9°C to 2.4–6.4°C from a 1990s baseline towards the end of the twenty-first century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624411418132">3</xref></sup>. The growing impact of this on the built environment will be increased internal temperatures, particularly during summer, increased air-conditioning demands and reduced winter heating demands. Since most buildings in the UK are either not air conditioned or partially air conditioned, the implications of this for the design of future buildings, and in the operation and refurbishment of existing buildings are profound. Many of the buildings that will be in use in the later part of this century already exist. It is therefore of considerable interest to establish how these buildings will respond to the effects of a changing climate both from the point of view of the design of new buildings in the immediate years ahead as well as from the point of view of the development of mitigation strategies for application inthe periodic refurbishment of existing buildings.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) is a UK-based agency, which was established to provide support and advice to organisations concerning adaptiveness and resilience to climate change. Among other things, it has coordinated the generation and dissemination of predicted climate change scenarios to assist organisations to assess levels of risk and strategies for remediation arising from a changing climate in the UK. There have been five of these scenarios during the past 20 years, the most recent and sophisticated of which were published in 2009 and termed the UKCP09 climate change projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> (abbreviated simply to UKCP09). UKCP09 superseded the previous (UKCIP02<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624411418132">4</xref></sup>) climate change scenarios which form the basis of the current Future Weather Years (FWY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411418132">2</xref></sup> recommended by the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) for use in the simulation modelling of buildings in the UK.</p>
<p>UKCP09 differs from the UKCIP02 climate change scenarios in two fundamental respects. UKCP09 provides monthly projections of climate change and absolute future climate data on a 25 km grid-scale over seven 30-year time-slices starting with a baseline of 1961–1990 and for three carbon emission scenarios.The data were generated by the UKs Meteorological Office Hadley Centre Climate Model ‘HadCM3’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> An accompanying Weather Generator is used to spatially downscale the 25 km data to 5 km and to temporally downscale the monthly data to daily or hourly data. The Weather Generator uses stochastic modelling methods to perform the downscaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> The earlier UKCIP02 climate change scenario data were generated by downscaling an existing climate model to give, at 50 km resolution, predictions of changes in the monthly average values of 15 climate variables at three time slices and four carbon emission scenarios. Uncertainty bounds were attached based on results from other climate models. Extraction of future weather data for building simulation requires to be constructed from an existing hourly time series (described in detail later), whereas hourly time series data can be extracted directly from UKCP09 and uncertainties form an inherent part of the probabilistic method used.</p>
<p>UKCP09 expresses a probability that a given climate change outcome will arise. Results are usually expressed as a cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives a plot of the probability (%) of a climate variable’s change being less than a given amount. Key thresholds are the central estimate (50% probability) at which a climate change amount is as likely to be exceeded as not, and UKCP09 interprets a cumulative probability of 90% as ‘very likely to be less than’ (or very unlikely to be greater than) and 10% as ‘very unlikely to be less than’ (or very likely to be greater than).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study is to generate test reference years (TRY) from UKCP09 for a variety of future time slices and carbon emission scenarios and to apply the data to the simulation modelling of a variety of building case studies in order to investigate probable patterns of overheating and likely changes in air-conditioning and heating demands over time.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143624411418132"><title>2 Literature review</title>
<p>In some of the earliest work seeking to predict the impact of future weather on buildings, Cullen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624411418132">5</xref></sup> attempted to create a predicted 2050 weather pattern by scaling external dry bulb temperature by 2 K above an established 1961–1990 mean value of 15.3°C. In a further development of this approach, Belcher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624411418132">6</xref></sup> developed a method (called ‘morphing’) for transforming existing CIBSE TRY and the Design Standard Year (DSY) weather files to future weather data. Current hourly CIBSE weather data were adjusted according to the monthly climate change prediction values of the UKCIP02<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624411418132">4</xref></sup> scenario data sets. A ‘shift’ (i.e. scale), ‘stretch’ (i.e. project) and a combination of ‘shift’ and ‘stretch’ methods are used to modify total solar irradiance on the horizontal, diffuse solar irradiation on the horizontal, sunshine duration, cloud cover, dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind speed.</p>
<p>Guan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143624411418132">7</xref></sup> reviewed methods of preparing future weather data to study the impact of climate change on building performance and compared the following four techniques: the extrapolating statistical method, the imposed offset method (morphing), stochastic weather models and global climate models. A conclusion was that the imposed offset method (morphing) may be the most suitable method to be adopted by building consultants for building simulation studies.</p>
<p>Jensch et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143624411418132">8</xref></sup> recognised that no bespoke climate change weather files are readily available that can be loaded directly into environmental simulation software. Again, they used a morphing method to transform current CIBSE TRYs and DSYs into climate change weather years and presented a tool to convert these to a Typical Meteorological Year and other file formats readily readable by building simulation packages. These weather data were used to perform simulations of a naturally ventilated building to assess the potential summer overheating problems caused by climate change. They found a ‘significant difference’ in applying current and future weather data in building simulation and compare the predicted results with some observed temperature readings in a case study building. Numerous modelling studies have since been conducted using morphed weather data based on the UKCIP02 climate change scenarios applied to building comfort, energy use and ventilation performance analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143624411418132">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624411418132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624411418132"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143624411418132"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143624411418132">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recently, work has been carried out using the UKCP09 projections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> UKCP09, UKCIP02 and historical measured data were used to analyse likely changes in temperature, sunshine duration and solar irradiation by Tham and Muneer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143624411418132">14</xref></sup> They studied three locations in the UK and found that both data sets showed an increase in these three variables when compared to the measured historical data as well as concluding that data based on UKCP09 produced abnormally elongated sunshine duration for some scenarios. Eames et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624411418132">15</xref></sup> discuss a method for the creation of future probabilistic reference years using UCKP09 for use in simulating the thermal performance of buildings. They identify a number of parameters not produced by the generator such as wind speed and direction, air pressure and cloud cover which have to be calculated separately. Kershaw et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143624411418132">16</xref></sup> used the UKCP09 weather generator to generate 3000 example weather years and created probabilistic future reference years using the method detailed in Eames et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624411418132">15</xref></sup> They found that the external data from the reference years compared very well to the 3000-year weather data. Building simulations were then carried out for all 3000 example years andthe reference years to compare the results. They found that the probabilistic reference years can be adequately used to assess the risk of building failure and risk to occupants but a number of these reference years need to be considered in order to represent the variation in possible future climates.</p>
<p>Watkins et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624411418132">17</xref></sup> present a method to construct a future weather file using UKCP09. They highlight that the UKCP09 data have no wind or cloud data and detail algorithms to produce these for their inclusion in a TRY. Wind speed was calculated from the potential evapotranspiration values included in the UKCP09 data. Historical weather files were used to provide typical wind directional data. The UKCP09 data only include diffuse and direct solar irradiation on the horizontal plane; so they adjust the solar data so that the direct normal radiation can be correctly calculated. Day time cloud cover is generated from sunshine hours and linear interpolation is used to produce night time cloud cover data. They produce a single composite TRY to provide a common, practical weather year against which designers can compare the average performance of their buildings. In related work, Watkins and Levermore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624411418132">18</xref></sup> use the CIBSE calculation method (CIBSE Guide A) to examine the effect that future increases in external temperature have on the peak cooling load on a building. They found that relatively small increases in external temperature could have a significant effect on the peak load and its associated plant items. Patidar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143624411418132">19</xref></sup> investigate the use of a probabilistic method of analysing the overheating of buildings in the future. They use a domestic dwelling to demonstrate a technique of linear filtering and regression analysis to analyse its thermal performance for various climate change scenarios and compare the results to building simulation software analysis. A linear predictor is constructed for the bedroom temperature corresponding to climate data from a preceding period of time. Least squares regression is used to fit the model. They found that results from their model were just as reliable as a detailed building simulation for many different climates; however, the regression relationship might not be suitable for more complex buildings.</p>

<p>In this study, the nominal time periods of 2030s, 2050s and 2080s were chosen together with the control period data, the former representing a sample of future time slices looking sufficiently far towards a time horizon likely to be of interest for the life span of buildings currently under development and construction. The number of probabilistic variations (or change factors) used by the UKCP09 Weather Generator for hourly data is 100. Thus, for each 30-year band of climate data, 3000 annual files of hourly and daily weather data were extracted to represent each of the four selected time slices (including the control data) at each of three carbon emission scenarios. The following procedure was then used:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143624411418132">20</xref></sup></p>

<p>Because each TRY consists of different statistically representative months ‘stitched’ together to form 1 year, there were inevitable step transitions in the values of certain variables at midnight on the last day of each calendar month.

<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The CIBSE FWY series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411418132">2</xref></sup></p></list-item>

</list>
<p>The CIBSE FWY series forms an important reference point because it is the currently available data in use by practitioners. These data were generated using the climate change scenario data forming the earlier UKCIP02. Because these scenarios were presented in the form of monthly data, it was necessary to decompose the data into hourly time series suitable for building simulation such that the hourly data preserve the same statistical distribution as the original monthly data. This was done using a technique called morphing full details of which can be found in Belcher et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624411418132">6</xref></sup> Briefly, files of existing CIBSE TRY climate data each consisting of ‘typical’ months derived from 1983–2004 records of actual weather data were used. These files were used to generate projected future weather data by either ‘shifting’, ‘stretching’ or shifting and stretching each existing climate variable. A shift involves adding the absolute mean change (from the UKCIP02 scenario data) to each existing hourly value for the relevant month and is applied when the climate change scenario is in the form of an absolute change to the monthly mean. A stretch involves a multiplicative adjustment of the existing variable based on the fractional change in the monthly mean value for the relevant month and is used when the scenario data are defined as a fractional or percentage change. A combination of shift and stretch is applied when both the mean and variance are required (e.g. a daily mean and its maximum and minimum values).</p>
<p>In the selection procedure applied by Exeter University,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624411418132">15</xref></sup> 100 ‘typical’ years from 100 samples of each year in each 30-year band were captured using the FS statistic (using a procedure similar to that described above but involving different variables). Each set of 100 months was then ranked based on ascending values of the mean monthly temperatures. They then select each month based on the same chosen percentile value (e.g. 50th, 90th, etc). Thus, the 50th percentile January is joined by the 50th percentile February and so on to form a complete year. This two-stage process places a strong emphasis on dry bulb temperature which, it is argued, will form greater coherence between variables in each month. However, there is virtually no concurrency between months with this method (i.e. there is a negligible chance that a January from the original set of 100 Januarys will be joined by the corresponding February in the February set). Step changes in variables occurring at midnight on the last day of each month were smoothed by taking the average of the 5 h of data either side of midnight. In this study, the 50th percentile weather files from Exeter were used as TRY with the assumption that they would be most ‘typical’.</p>
<p>The method used by Manchester University<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624411418132">17</xref></sup> is very similar to that used in this study. Both Manchester University and Northumbria University used the method recommended by BS EN ISO 15927-4:2005, but applied the method directly to 3000 years of weather data (100 probabilistic sets of 30 years data). There are two significant differences between this method and the method used by Exeter University. First, Exeter University applied the FS statistic equally to dry bulb temperature, global horizontal solar irradiation and wind speed, whereas this method applied the FS statistic to dry bulb temperature, global horizontal solar irradiation and relative humidity (step 4 above) to select three candidate months, and then one month out of the three with lowest wind speed deviation was selected as the ‘best’ month to be included in the TRY. The second difference was the method of ranking. The method reported here added the separate ranks of the FS statistic values of the three climate variables together then chose three months with lowest total rank, while Exeter added absolute values of FS statistic of their three climate variables together, and then chose the month with lowest total FS statistic value. In terms of interpretation, users may choose an Exeter file with a high percentile (e.g. 90th) to factor in risk. In this study, design and risk are dealt with using an alternative ‘Design Reference Year’ file of climate data which involves selections of candidate months using probabilistic percentiles. This study is currently under development and will be reported at a later date.</p>
<p>As to the relatively minor differences between the Manchester and Northumbria approaches, Manchester University implemented the ISO method in Turbo Pascal using conventional programming based on element-wise calculations, while Northumbria University applied the same method in Matlab to take advantage of superior array-handling, resulting in a significant reduction of computation time. The results of both methods werecross-checked and there are two minor differences in calculation procedures. First, Manchester included weather data of the 29th February in leap years, whereas Northumbria did not include these days in order to compare the annual energy consumption among 365-day years only. Second, Manchester used 15 ms<sup>−1</sup> as an upper limit when generating daily wind speed from Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0143624411418132">4</xref>), whereas Northumbria used 20 ms<sup>−1</sup> after examining the typical distribution ranges of windspeeds in historical UK weather data. The two differences will occasionally cause different selections of ‘typical’ months when precisely the same raw data are used; so they are not expected to give exactly the same climate data, but the both will result in reasonably comparable ‘typical’ climate data files.</p>

<p>For dry bulb temperature, there is good agreement between the various data sets, all of which support an increasing trend in temperature throughout this century, the precise extent of which depends on the carbon emission scenario. The maximum dry bulb temperatures are notably higher for the CIBSE FWY data set than for all of the UKCP09-based results. This is considered to be due to the higher control temperatures (also evident in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624411418132">1</xref>) which form the baseline for the CIBSE FWY data. Control data for the latter are based on original data from the period 1983 to 2004, whereas all UKCP09-based methods use a control period from 1960 to 1989. Whilst there is some inevitable scatter in predictions of absolute maximum and minimum external dry bulb temperatures due to the differences in the methods described above, the deviations in mean external air temperature between those methods using UKCP09 are negligible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143624411418132">3</xref>).</p>
<p>For global horizontal solar radiation, there is again good agreement between the various data sets though the UKCP09-derived data all suggest higher peak radiation intensities than those predicted using the morphed UKCIP02-based data of the CIBSE FWYs. An inspection of the data suggests that UKCP09<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> tends topredict higher periods of bright clear sunshinethan existing data would suggest as first reported by Tham and Muneer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143624411418132">14</xref></sup> Deviations between methods for those cases using UKCP09 are, however, very small (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143624411418132">4</xref>).</p>

<p>Four contrasting buildings were selected for energy simulation using the new TRY data sets described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0143624411418132">Section 3</xref>. The intention was to select ‘real’ buildings that either exist or have received planning consent and are therefore likely to be built, as well as to capture a range of construction styles and activity levels that would ensure contrasting thermal comfort and energy demand results.

The aged persons’ accommodation was selected because it is used by a vulnerable social group sensitive to extremes in thermal comfort standards. The hospital building is a recently constructed oncology department which was selected due to extensive deep space planning, high internal heat gains due to scanning equipment, etc. The house is ageneric type from a commercial house builder’s prospectus and depicts a small terraced row. In this study, only the end-terraced unit is used. Both the aged persons’ accommodation and hospital are in continuous use, whereas the office building is used during normal weekday office hours only and the house is occupied by a family of four during weekday nights and weekends. A constant effective mean allowance for infiltration of 0.5 air changes per hour was applied to all buildings and, additionally, an allowance fornatural/mechanical fresh air ventilation during occupied hours only of 10 Ls<sup>−1</sup> per person was applied.

<p>With the exception of the office building, the buildings have been recently built and conform to the UK Building Regulations, Part L, 2006 edition. Briefly, the 2002 edition of these Regulations sets minimum standards of<italic>u</italic>-values for external walls and roofs of 0.35 Wm<sup>−2</sup>K<sup>−1</sup> and 0.25 Wm<sup>−2</sup>K<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and external elevations glazed to a maximum of 35% of the overall envelope area using double air-cavity glazing. The later 2006 edition of the regulations sets the same ‘notional’ standard but goes on to require a 23–28% reduction in carbon emission beyond that standard. The office building was refurbished to an earlier standard not greatly different to the current standards. The thermal capacity of each zone was calculated using the simplified method set out in ISO 13786:2007 based on a maximum effective element thickness of 0.1 m. Total values for each zone were added to give a building total and this value was then divided by the gross building floor area for comparative purposes.</p>
<p>The occupancy densities, occupied period profiles and internal heat gain allowances for all zone types in all buildings were selected according to standard data presented in the UK National Calculation Method database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143624411418132">25</xref></sup> The values selected would be used in current practice for, among other things, building regulation compliance modelling.</p>
<p>Three simulations were then carried out on all buildings using the new TRY weather files for London, Manchester and Edinburgh:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A ‘freefloat’ simulation to generate the average of zone peak operative temperatures for each building under conditions of natural ventilation. In all cases, a natural ventilation rate of 4 air changes per hour was used and this was switched to become active in any zone when the internal operative temperature reached 25°C. Results from these simulations were extracted during the warmest summer months (June–August). In practice, these results would be used to help inform design decisions regarding the need for zone air conditioning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A cooling simulation in which it was now assumed that all treated zones would be air conditioned to a nominal set point temperature of 22°C (dry bulb). Results from these simulations include both hourly time series cooling demands as well as annually integrated total cooling energy consumption.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A heating simulation with all treated zones heated to set points of between 19°C and 21°C (depending on the nature of usage). Again, results from these simulations include both hourly time series heating demands as well as annually integrated total heating energy consumption.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the ‘freefloat’ case, the winter heating was not activated which had the advantage of reducing simulation run times slightly. In practice, the heating would in any case be inactive outside the normal heating season periods (typically from May through to October). Therefore, at least 1 month will elapse from the end of the heating cycle and the start of cooling or peak summertime temperature cycle such that the heating cycle is unlikely to influence the cooling cycle significantly.</p>

<p>In general, the trend lines for advancing time (and carbon emission intensity assumption) suggest a smoother growth in values due to the scaled and stretched CIBSE FWY<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411418132">2</xref></sup> data than is the case with the probabilistic data from UKCP09.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> The Manchester and Northumbria results are generally in reasonably close agreement but there are minor anomalies mainly due to the different maximum windspeed assumptions used as detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0143624411418132">Section 3</xref>. The more pronounced differences between the Exeter results and those from both Manchester and Northumbria are due to differences in the methods used to select climate data as discussed in detail in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0143624411418132">Section 3</xref>. Nonetheless, results from any of the methods selected here point to broadly similar conclusions which are summarised below.</p>
<p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0143624411418132">6</xref> shows the results of the average zone peak temperatures during the warmest summer months for all buildings in all selected UK cities, all TRY data sets, time slices and carbon emission scenario assumptions. These values represent the average of all absolute peak zone operative temperatures (whenever they occur) for each building. All data sets for all city locations chosen are suggesting internal comfort temperature growth of around 5 K through to the end of the present century from typical control data values of around 30°C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0143624411418132">6</xref>). The spread in values across the four contrasting buildings is quite narrow – typically 1–2K though it is slightly wider for the UKCP09 data than is the case with the CIBSE FWY-based data. All data tend to point to a higher degree of warming in London towards the end of the century than is the case in the two northern cities chosen though there are apparent anomalies in some results (2080s Edinburgh from the Exeter set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624411418132">15</xref></sup> and 2080s London ‘high’ carbon from the Manchester set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624411418132">17</xref></sup>). In particular, the house is exhibiting mean peak operative temperatures in excess of 30°C from the middle of this century which has major implications for a trend towards at least partial air conditioning in the UK for the first time.</p>
<p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0143624411418132">7</xref> shows results of the spread of simulated zone (sensible) cooling loads expressed here as the peak of the sum of simultaneous zone cooling loads divided by the treated floor area of the building. The much higher peak cooling loads evident in the hospital example reflects high internal heat gains in this case due to scanning, diagnostic and radio therapy equipment. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0143624411418132">8</xref> gives the simulated annual zone sensible cooling energy demand (whole building) expressed in kilowatt hour per unit of treated floor area. Sensible room (zone) cooling demands can be expected to increase throughout this century towards 100 Wm<sup>−2</sup> from control values of around 50 Wm<sup>−2</sup> for conventional narrow-plan buildings and from 100 Wm<sup>−2</sup> towards 150 Wm<sup>−2</sup> for the high-intensity deep plan hospital building used in this study. However, the impact on annual cooling energy use is, if anything, even more pronounced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0143624411418132">8</xref>) with most results suggesting a near doubling inannual energy use for room cooling in air-conditioned buildings with reference to control data. The house example suggests a lower trend due to the operational assumption of it being unoccupied during weekday periods as family members attend work and school, etc.

<p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0143624411418132">9</xref> shows results of the spread of simulated zone heating loads, again expressed as the peak of the sum of simultaneous zone heating loads divided by the treated floor area of the building. Note that the higher peak heating loads evident in the hospital example reflect high mechanical air heating loads dueto the deep plan nature of this building. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0143624411418132">10</xref> gives the simulated annual zone heating energy demand (whole building) expressed in kilowatt hour per unit of treated floor area. Heating demand simulations tend to suggest very little decline (contrary to what at first might be expected, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0143624411418132">9</xref>) with conventional narrow-plan building types continuing to have typical peak demands of around 50 Wm<sup>−2</sup> if trends in insulation and air tightness were to remain unchanged. However, there are likely to be significant improvements in the latter over the course of the next few years if the UK is to meet its various carbon reduction targets and so sharp reductions unrelated to climate change might be expected as existing buildings receive refurbishment and future new buildings roll through. An investigation of the impact of these expected improving standards is a matter for further work. Of interest, though the peak heating demands are barely affected by the climate change features captured in our data, the annual energy use due to heating shows a marked reduction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0143624411418132">10</xref>) of, typically, 50% of the control values. This would seem to suggest that a need towards radical improvement in thermal insulation standards in the UK, as mentioned above may require to be considered in a measured and incremental manner.

<p>All the results point to a generally good predictive agreement between simulation results obtained using the former (UKCIP02) climate change scenario data which form the CIBSE FWY set,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624411418132">2</xref></sup> and methods that draw from UKCP09.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec9-0143624411418132"><title>6 Conclusions</title>
<p>Data from the new UKCP09 climate change projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> can be more easily and directly translated into future TRY suitable for building energy simulation than was the case with previous data sets of this kind. In this study, TRY data have been generated for a range of future time slices based on UKCP09 and used to simulate the future response of four contrasting building types. The results have been compared with future weather data produced by other researchers including the CIBSE FWY which forms the basis of current practice as far as the simulation of future building behaviour is concerned. The results of this study show that UKCP09<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> produces simulated building performances that give a good agreement with those obtained from the CIBSE FWY in spite of radically different methods being used to generate the two data sets. Results also confirm the findings of a growing number of studies which point to steady increases in comfort temperature throughout this century for buildings without air conditioning and increased cooling demands and annual cooling energy use for buildings with air conditioning. Though the results also point to negligible reductions in peak winter heating demands through this century due to climate change alone, they do suggest a significant reduction in overall seasonal heating energy use.</p>
<p>Further work is required in five areas. First, the need to develop robust methods for obtaining values of variables and climate modelling parameters that are currently either not defined or badly defined. In particular, hourly wind speed (and direction) from UKCP09<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624411418132">1</xref></sup> and data leading to the opaque could cover parameter which is needed for surface-to-sky radiation heat transfer modelling. Second, work is needed to develop mechanisms for adjusting the TRY data in inner-city areas to account for the impact of urban heat island effect. Third, there is a need to explore alternative future insulation, massing, shading and air tightness standards as future buildings inherit these standards and existing buildings undergo refurbishment cycles, and to harmonise the results of this with changing energy use due to climate change. This is particularly important both from the viewpoint of increasing insulation standards (reduced winter heating) and improved shading and massing (reduced summertime overheating). Fourth, a better understanding of how occupancy patterns (including patterns of use) in buildings might be expected to evolve in future will help in the development of mitigation strategies such as adaptive comfort algorithms and exposure limits in building inclined to overheating. Finally, there is a need to construct alternative file types containing weather data that can be used for future plant and equipment sizing together with simplified methods for practitioners to use to help to arrive at these design decisions.</p>
