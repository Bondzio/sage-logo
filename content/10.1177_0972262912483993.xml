<p><italic>Dishonesty is so grasping it would deceive God himself, were it possible.</italic></p>

<p>This is the third book by Dan Ariely, the previous two books were, <italic>The Upside of Irrationality</italic>: <italic>The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic</italic> and <italic>Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions</italic>. First book by Ariely, <italic>Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912483993">2008</xref>) was about Irrationality. His second book, <italic>The Upside of Irrationality</italic> was also an attempt to capture the complexity of humans’ irrationalities but mainly the other side of irrationality which was quite positive rather than negative.</p>
<p>Through this book, Dan Ariely has revealed or one can say he has explored the dark side of human nature. The protagonist of this book is ‘dishonesty’<italic>.</italic> Considering, dishonesty is a widespread problem, the author focuses in this book on the fact that people are prone to be dishonest or they lie to everyone especially to themselves when given the opportunity.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this book is to look at the rational cost benefit forces that are supposed to drive dishonest behaviour, but, according to author, they often do not and the irrational forces that we think don’t matter but often they do matter.</p>
<p>This book is about his fascination of issues like cheating and dishonesty. He thought through these issues questions like what is the human capacity for both honesty and dishonesty? Whether dishonesty is a widespread problem? Initially he tried to explain about the causes of dishonesty by Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC). His concern was if dealing with dishonesty through SMORC model is accurate then society has two clear means for dealing with dishonesty. He mentioned first is to increase the probability of being caught may be through hiring more police officers or through surveillance cameras. The second is to increase the magnitude of punishment for people who get caught. Further this book explores if SMORC is an imperfect model of the causes of dishonesty then what forces determined people to cheat.</p>
<p>After exploring the basic tendencies underlying dishonesty this book also addresses some experiments that will help discover the psychological and environmental forces that tend to enhance or reduce honesty in our day today lives.</p>
<p>Dan Ariely is an Israeli American professor of psychology and behavioural economics. He teaches at Duke University and is the founder of the Centre for Advanced Hindsight. Both of his books became New York Times best sellers. He was a physics and mathematics major at Tel Aviv University, but transferred to philosophy and psychology when he found the writing too physically taxing. However, in his last year he dropped philosophy and concentrated solely on psychology, in which he received his B.A. He also holds an M.A. and Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from the University of North Carolina. He did a second doctorate in business administration at Duke University at the urging of Nobel economic sciences laureate Daniel Kahneman.</p>
<p>This book has ten chapters, excluding introduction chapter, where author introduces the concept of dishonesty and emphasises on ‘why is dishonesty so interesting’. The methodology adopted by the author is amalgamation of his research work and other researchers. Work published in this book is a collaborative effort of several researchers. Innovative methods to study dishonesty have made this book a very interesting read. He has relied on personal and academic findings to address the issue of dishonesty and cheating. This book well orchestrates most of the research work by Dan Ariely and other renowned researchers in the domain of dishonesty.</p>
<p>Some of the interesting themes discussed in this book are ‘why we blow it when we’re tired’ or ‘why wearing fakes makes us cheat more’. These themes have been explained and explored via different experiments. Considering the theme of ‘why we blow it when we’re tired’, author mentions that there is a baffling connection between exhaustion and the consumption of junk food and reasons for why so many diets die on the stressful day and also why people start smoking again after a crisis. Further, elucidating the reason for this he mentions that there is a struggle between the impulsive (system 1) or emotional and the rational or deliberative (system 2) parts of ourselves. This book has mentioned several experiments providing evidences that when our deliberative reasoning ability is occupied, the impulsive system gains more control over our behaviour. (The term ‘Systems 1 and 2’ were originally proposed by Psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West. This system 1 and 2 are two types of cognitive processes. System 1 is executed quickly with little conscious deliberation and system 2 is slower and more reflective. Frederick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0972262912483993">2005</xref>] introduced cognitive reflection test [CRT] relating it to system 1 and 2. He also examined the relation between CRT and decision making characteristics (time preference and risk preferences.)</p>
<p>In another theme mentioned in this book about ‘why wearing fakes makes us cheat more’ has revealed interesting issues through several studies and their results suggest that wearing a genuine product does not increase honesty. But once we deliberately put on a fake product, moral constraints diminish to some degree, making it easier for us to take further steps down the path of dishonesty.</p>
<p>This book can be beneficial to both academicians as well as practitioners. On one side, this book can give insights to researchers who are interested in exploring research work in the field of dishonesty. This book can help in generating new ideas on dishonesty; its innovative methods to study dishonesty can guide or help researchers to explore this area with new methods. On the other side, this book can be relevant for practitioners as well. Some of the insights developed in this book can be very valuable for human resource department. In hiring process they can screen cheaters or can streamline the procedure to get rid of dishonest people.</p>
<p>Broadly, this book can be useful in Public policy, Marketing, Organizational behaviour and Psychology field. The experiments and the findings of this book are published in top most journals of academia. This book is a good read. I highly recommend this book to people who have not read any of Dan Ariely’s books earlier because if you would have read any of his books earlier you will definitely pick this book from the book store without fail.</p>
