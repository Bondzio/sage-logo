<abstract>
<p>With increasing costs for conducting surveys, many survey agencies resort to implementing call strategies. Obtaining contact in panel surveys as early as possible, without annoying people by contacting them at undesired times and ultimately causing them to refuse, requires using efficient call time strategies. In this research, the author uses call data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), a centralized Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) survey with a randomized (experimental) call-household assignment. Using random effects models, the author analyzes the efficiency gains of obtaining initial contact by assigning optimal times to first calls, and times and spacing to second and later calls depending on household sociodemography and prior call patterns. The author concludes with some recommendations for making early and successful contact during fieldwork.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of factors determine success or failure in obtaining contact within a survey household, including household characteristics, at-home patterns of householders, or timing and frequency of contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X11417966">Groves and Couper 1998</xref>). To increase contact rates, contact protocols that have proven successful are sometimes used (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X11417966">Stoop et al. 2010</xref>). If household at-home patterns can be anticipated based on information from the sampling frame or previous waves in panel studies, calling times can also be adapted. Much of the literature for both face-to-face (f2f) surveys (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X11417966">Lipps and Benson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X11417966">Purdon et al. 1999</xref>) and telephone surveys (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X11417966">Brick et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X11417966">Greenberg and Stokes 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11417966">Weeks et al. 1987</xref>) point to efficiency improvements associated with obtaining initial contact by optimizing interviewer’s call effort. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X11417966">Purdon et al. (1999)</xref> conclude that there are three dimensions for improved timing and spacing of calls:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>adjusting the time of day and the weekday;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>deciding the number of times a household is called before deeming it to be a noncontact; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>deciding the time between subsequent calls at the same household.</p>
</list-item>
</list>Generally, attempts made on weekday evenings are most likely to yield successful contact with a household member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X11417966">Groves et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X11417966">Kulka and Weeks 1988</xref>). If the first call was a noncontact, then the optimal time for the second call still appears to be a weekday evening, irrespective of when the first call has been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X11417966">Purdon et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11417966">Weeks et al. 1987</xref>). This reflects general at-home patterns and at-home availability of household members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X11417966">Barton 1999</xref>). The higher efficiency of weekday evenings is reversed somewhat for second calls as opposed to first ones when the prior calls were also made during these times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X11417966">Weeks et al. 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X11417966">Purdon et al. (1999)</xref> also consider the outcome of the first <italic>contact</italic>—refusal, appointment, or interview. They find little variation in the refusal rate by time of first contact. However, householders tend to give an immediate interview if contact is made in the daytime rather than in the evening. An appointment is more often agreed on if contact is made in the evening.</p>
<p>On the latter issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X11417966">Lipps and Benson (2005)</xref> analyze the <italic>ultimate</italic> household decision to participate or not, rather than investigating the outcome of the <italic>current</italic> contact. They report that <italic>first</italic> contacts at Sunday and Saturday mornings and some time on Sunday evenings by f2f appear to generate annoyance that leads to decreased willingness of respondents to ultimately participate. This means that refusal might be expressed at a later contact and not necessarily at the first one. Since the purpose of the contact is the sample member’s participation, I believe that the ultimate survey status is more important than that made after the first contact.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X11417966">Dennis et al. (1999)</xref> had some success in a large random digit dialing (RDD) survey with a CATI call scheduler that assigns calling times according to <italic>aggregated</italic> sociodemographic information from the census. Their research suggests that to improve household contact efficiency, the first call attempt for RDD surveys should be made on Sunday through Thursday evenings between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. In addition, they identify optimal calling times for the second and the third calls. However, only a small amount of the variance in obtaining contact can be explained with aggregate household characteristics.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. (2009)</xref> used sociodemographic information of <italic>individual</italic> sample members available from census data to schedule call patterns that control for household characteristics and prior call information. They also used interactions between day and time of call and household characteristics. Using call data from six different f2f surveys from the United Kingdom, they confirm previous findings about the higher probability to contact households with children, especially on weekday afternoons and evenings. Households without children are least likely to be contacted on weekdays during the day, whereas weekday evenings are better times. Households without employed persons can be better contacted on weekday mornings or afternoons. Especially in households with a retired person present, it is better to call during the week and comparatively less so at the weekend. The more members in a household, the easier it is to establish contact with the household. Having controlled for household characteristics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. (2009)</xref> find no type of area effect on contact probability. Finally, they report that varying the timing of subsequent calls in case of noncontact increases the likelihood of finding someone at home. Generally, evenings and weekends are good times to call. Leaving a few days between calls increases the probability of contact compared to calling again on the same day.</p>
<p>Although informative about optimal calling times, the amount of explained variance in obtaining contact in the studies described is small. Overall, existing studies suffer from four shortcomings:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>nonrandomized assignment of interviewers to calls. First, there might be learning effects when trying to obtain contact by cumulating experience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X11417966">Beerten 1999</xref>). In f2f surveys, usually the same interviewer works on one household. If the same household is approached repeatedly, information on preferable times to contact the household may be gathered (e.g., asking neighbors when the household can be reached);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>lack of possibilities to include household characteristics beyond those available from census or interviewer observations from outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. 2009</xref>);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>lack of possibilities to include unobserved household heterogeneity; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>lack of possibilities to analyze call times already proven to be successful for the same household</p>
</list-item>
</list>The latter three issues can be investigated using panel data, the first when calls are assigned at random to interviewers. Both aspects are usually given in centralized telephone household panel surveys. In panel surveys, in waves after the first wave, information is not only available on the sociodemography of the households but also on their contacting properties from previous waves. Both could be used by call schedulers to better plan calling times. There may be efficiency improvements especially about the timing of the first call but also for subsequent calls. In this research, I primarily analyze first and later calls with respect to an optimal time/household assignment in panel surveys. I analyze the following research questions:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What are the best times of the day to establish contact with certain household types? Is it a good idea to call on Saturdays? Do calls at these “best” times lead to a first contact that differs in terms of ultimate <italic>cooperation</italic> behavior?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If the first call does not lead to a contact, what are the best strategies for subsequent calls?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To what extent do individual household-specific properties and their prior call patterns play a role in terms of (ultimately successful) contactability?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To what degree can the specifics of panel data be utilized?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows: First, I present the data and the variables used in the models, such as sociodemography, calling times, their interactions, and prior call patterns. Next, I analyze first calls with respect to calling times that are most likely to lead to a contact, using a two-level random effects model. I use the same model to check if calling at certain times may annoy people if they are first contacted at these times, with respect to their ultimate cooperation. Then, using a three-level model, I make later calls if the household was not contacted at the first call. Finally, I discuss the results and make some recommendations for fieldwork.</p>

<sec id="section2-1525822X11417966">
<title>Data</title>
<p>I use call<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1525822X11417966">1</xref> data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), a nationwide, centralized CATI panel survey, conducted annually. The advantage of using the SHP is that calls to households are randomized, both within and between waves so as to be as flexible as possible, given the continuously changing number, working shifts, qualifications of interviewers, and call-back times. Once an interviewer is free, the next still unused number pops up on the screen to be dialed. Such completely randomized calling times are virtually impossible in f2f surveys and less so in f2f panel surveys. This makes the SHP an excellent data source to investigate optimal calling times under experimental conditions.</p>
<p>The SHP uses stratified random sampling; the strata are the seven large regions of Switzerland. Currently, the SHP consists of two samples, each independently drawn from the telephone directory, and each being representative of the Swiss residential population. The first sample started in 1999 with about 5,100 randomly selected households (original sample), the second in 2004 with about 2,600 households (refreshment sample). Each year, the household reference person is asked about the household composition and basic sociodemography of all household members, using the CATI grid questionnaire. Preferably, the household reference person is the same individual across waves. However, if the previous year’s reference person is not available, another adult in the household who is knowledgeable about the household can replace him or her. It takes 3–10 minutes to complete the grid questionnaire. After the grid, the CATI household questionnaire is completed (about 10 minutes), again by the reference person. After the household-related information is provided, each household member 14 years and older is eligible to complete his or her own CATI individual questionnaire (about 35 minutes).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1525822X11417966">2</xref>
</p>
<p>I restrict my analysis to contactability of households during the first step (i.e., recruitment to complete the grid questionnaire). Each year, after the <italic>regular</italic> fieldwork phase is finalized, households that refuse to answer the grid questionnaire are reapproached after some time in the <italic>refusal conversion</italic>
<italic>phase</italic> unless the fieldwork managers consider recontacting to be hopeless. The number of calls to a household is not limited in principle, but it is at the discretion of the fieldwork managers to decide not to make further attempts to contact a household. Some households remain “unworked” in the sense that either they cannot be contacted or that an appointment is still pending. In this research, I use call data from both the original and the refreshment samples during both survey phases, between the 2005 and the 2009 waves.</p>
<p>To calculate contact rates, I use the definition of CON1 from the American Association for Public Opinion Research, for the definition of COOP1.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1525822X11417966">3</xref> As I am interested in household contactability, I only use calls until the first contact, or—if contact cannot be established—all calls. I ascribe characteristics of households from which no information is available in the wave under consideration from previous waves, starting with the most recent one. If, for example, information on household size is missing in 2005, it is imputed from the information in 2004, if available, and so on. Household sample sizes were 5,388 in 2005; 5,700 in 2006; 5,945 in 2007; 5,463 in 2008; and 5,564 in 2009. Households were called up to 467 times until the first contact; the total number of calls was 180,484. The mean number of calls (contacts) to one household amounts to 5.91 (.99) in 2005; 6.16 (.97) in 2006; 5.81 (.92) in 2007; 6.99 (.96) in 2008; and 7.33 (.91) in 2009.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X11417966">Figure 1</xref>
, I depict the contact success rate by number of calls to a household until the 50th call. The shape of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X11417966">Figure 1</xref> is in line with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X11417966">Groves and Couper 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X11417966">Purdon et al. 1999</xref>). The contact rate in the SHP remains above 1% throughout.</p>

</list>and the following sociodemographic household characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. 2009</xref>):<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>number of persons in the household (1, 2, 3+);</p>

<list-item>
<p>presence of any child under the age of 16 in the household; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>presence of any retired or unemployed people in the household.</p>
</list-item>
</list>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. (2009)</xref>, these household characteristics and their interactions with day and time of call determine at-home patterns and the lifestyle of households. Both are correlated with accessibility (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X11417966">Stoop 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Distinguished by the first two household characteristics, the mean contact rate of <italic>first</italic> calls is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1525822X11417966">Figure 2</xref>
. Accessibility is better, the larger the household (upper panel) and the later the call is made. Saturday mornings appear to be better than weekday mornings but worse than weekday evenings. A child present in the household (lower panel) also increases the chance of making contact with someone over the phone, irrespective of time of day. Weekday mornings seem to work comparatively well in households without children.</p>

<sec id="section3-1525822X11417966">
<title>Modeling</title>
<p>It can be expected that contact success from calling identical households successively over waves is not independent of the household composition. Rather, in panel data like those used here, time points are clustered in households. An intercept-only model suitable for testing for higher level effects results in highly significant model improvements for both the first and later calls.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1525822X11417966">4</xref>
</p>
<sec id="section4-1525822X11417966">
<title>First Calls</title>
<p>Using the results of these tests, I model the binary variable “obtaining contact,” using a random effects (two-level) logit model with waves as the first level and households as the second. Note that variables that change over time affect the first level, while variables that change across households affect the second. Before I fit the multilevel model, I test contact efficiency improvement using a logistic regression model on pairwise combinations of the following variables:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>household characteristics (number of persons, child present, retired or unemployed person);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>time of day; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>day of the week (Monday–Friday or Saturday).</p>
</list-item>
</list>Specifically, I enter the following variables into a backward selection regression (removal level: .01), to test for entry into the two-level model:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>(time of day) × household size;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(time of day) × child present;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(time of day) × retired person present;</p>

<list-item>
<p>(time of day) × (day of the week);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>all main effects;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the control variables wave (1–5: linear), original sample (vs. refreshment from 2004, binary), refusal conversion phase (vs. not, binary), and “Swiss German–speaking” (vs. French/Italian, binary). The idea to include the latter is to capture different at-home patterns due to cultural differences or different lifestyles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X11417966">Koch et al. 2009</xref>); and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>if the call time window coincides with the time of day at which the household was first contacted in the previous wave (set to 0 if no previous wave available).</p>
</list-item>
</list>The backward logistic regression removes all interaction variables with the exception of:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>(weekday evening) × (retired person in household);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(Saturday) × (retired person in household);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(weekday early afternoon) × (child in household);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(weekday late afternoon) × (child in household); and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(weekday evening) × (child in household).</p>
</list-item>
</list>The main effects are kept, with the exception of wave and sample.</p>
<p>Altogether, these variables explain only 3.7% (pseudo <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) of the variance in the likelihood of successfully making contact with a household. In the two-level random effects model, all variables that result from the backward regression are still significant at the 1% level, with the exception of the “weekday early afternoon,” and the interactions (Saturday) × (retired person in household) and (weekday early afternoon) × (child in household). I drop the nonsignificant variables from the final two-level model. The resulting coefficients (odds ratios) together with their <italic>z</italic>-values, and the within-household standard deviation are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X11417966">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The within-household variance portion (10.0%; standard error = .8%) of the total variance is almost three times as high as the explained variance from the independent variables in the one-level regression model (3.7%). This shows the importance of controlling for the household-specific effects (unobserved heterogeneity) by using a two-level model.</p>
<p>It is possible that people living in the Swiss German–speaking part of Switzerland are more easily contacted because of cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X11417966">De Heer and De Leeuw 2002</xref>). That households in the refusal conversion fieldwork phase are more difficult to be accessed could be expected: They might anticipate a call from the SHP because a special refusal conversion letter was sent to them before the conversion phase began. Also, the fact that larger households are much easier to contact (1.49 times per additional household member) as well as households with retired persons or those with children confirms previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X11417966">Groves and Couper 1998</xref>). This is probably because the chance of meeting someone at home is higher in larger households and in households where someone is taking care of children. Retired people generally spend more time at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X11417966">Beerten 1999</xref>: table 3); the same is true for schoolchildren who are at home after school.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1525822X11417966">5</xref>
</p>
<p>Retired households can be better accessed on a weekday late afternoon, which is in line with at-home patterns and at-home availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X11417966">Beerten 1999</xref>: table 3). Similar results hold for households with children when they are called after 5 p.m. This is probably because these groups engage in fewer out-of-home evening activities than do those in the labor force and those without children at home. Generally, the later the time on working days, the easier it is to make contact with households at the first call. Calling when the household has first been accessed in the previous wave also increases the likelihood of contact.</p>
<p>I checked to see if calling at these favorable times may eventually backfire in that some of these calls may cause annoyance among the households and <italic>ultimately</italic> lead to a decrease in <italic>cooperation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X11417966">Lipps and Benson 2005</xref>). Instead of calls to first contact, I use first <italic>contacts</italic> only and analyze ultimate cooperation as a binary dependent variable, again using a two-level model and including the same variables. Log odds are listed in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X11417966">Table 1</xref>. It turns out that obtaining contact at <italic>first successful call</italic> times from the previous wave actually led to a higher ultimate <italic>cooperation</italic> rate. Specific daytimes are, however, not significant for ultimate cooperation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1525822X11417966">
<title>Second and Later Calls</title>
<p>In the next step, I analyze later calls if the household could not be contacted at the first call. Similar to the work of others, I limited the number of calls per household to a maximum of 10 calls. I do not test interactions of the (household characteristics) × daytime here, which is difficult to follow in real fieldwork anyway, from the second call on. Instead, I examine whether choosing a time at successive calls at which the household was never called before in the current wave pays off. Specifically, I include the main effects mentioned above (i.e., household characteristics, wave, original sample, refusal conversion phase, household size, German-speaking area, same time of day at which the household was first contacted in the previous wave, time of day, Saturday), plus the time elapsed since the previous call and the following interactions in the backward regression:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>(Number of call: 2, 3 … 10) × (time elapsed since previous call)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(Number of call: 2, 3 … 10) × (new time window in current wave)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(Number of call: 2, 3 … 10) × (same time at which the household was first contacted in the previous wave)</p>
</list-item>
</list>Each call number is taken separately to detect nonlinearities when choosing the optimal time window and waiting-time specific strategy. The backward selection model (removal level: .01) removes <italic>all</italic> (Number of call: 2, 3 … 10) variables interacted with all three time window and waiting-time specifications such that only the respective main effects remain in the final model. Also, the sample control and the time from 1 p.m. until 4:59 p.m.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1525822X11417966">6</xref> are dropped. The pseudo <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> of the second through tenth call logistic regression model amounts to .08 and doubles that of the first call regression model. In addition to controlling for the clustering of waves in households, I control for the clustering of calls in waves in the final second through tenth call hierarchical level-three logistic regression.</p>
<p>There are surprisingly high similarities with the coefficients of the first call model. It is likely that accessibility at later calls follow similar reasons than for first calls. The within-household variance amounts to .71 and is slightly higher than that from the two-level model for first calls. There are negative (linear) effects on accessibility with additional waves. This might be related to the increased risk of not being tracked over waves. Also for later calls, the chances of contacting someone are higher in the Swiss German–speaking part and lower during the refusal conversion phase. Looking at household characteristics, contactability again improves with increasing household size, in households with children, and especially with retired persons. For times of day, again the later the calling times, the more favorable the rate of contact. Saturdays are better than weekdays—but I don’t know why. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X11417966">Figure 1</xref> suggests, the higher the number of unsuccessful calls made to the household, the smaller the likelihood of obtaining first contact. And for later calls, choosing the same time frame that was successful for making contact in the previous wave increases the probability of contact. The same holds if a new time window <italic>within the current wave</italic> is chosen. These findings indicate a certain stability of at-home patterns both within and between waves. Confirming other research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X11417966">D’Arrigo et al. 2009</xref>), letting some time elapse after the previous (unsuccessful) call improves the chances of first contacting someone.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The strategy during the first days of fieldwork in a centralized household CATI survey is to obtain contact with as many households as soon as possible. This saves time and makes planning the interviews easier. In this research, I examine calling strategies that increase the likelihood of making early contact with households. I use data from the SHP survey, which are representative of the Swiss residential population and uses random interviewer-call assignments. Panel data allow controlling for unobserved household heterogeneity of being contacted by modeling within-household effects.</p>
<p>Starting with using first calls to households across five panel waves, I show that the unobserved heterogeneity at the first call is considerable and much higher than the explained variance portion by fieldwork controls, household type, and calling time and day. Such high values make the use of panel models necessary. Using a two-level random effects model, I confirm previous findings that large households, those with children, and especially those with a retired person are easier to reach, and that late afternoons and evenings are good times to reach someone on the phone. I provide evidence that using the time frame at which the household was first contacted in the previous wave increases the contact probability in the current wave. In addition, using the first contact times from the previous wave increases the chances of <italic>ultimately</italic> obtaining <italic>cooperation</italic>, if contact can be made. There seems to be a tendency that household-specific preferable calling and contact times persist across years.</p>
<p>In a second step, I analyze second and higher calls where previous calls did not lead to a contact. In the three-level random effects model used, I find rather high within-household correlations and a substantive within-household within-wave correlation. Concerning successful calling times for obtaining contact, I find similar times to those for first calls. Further, the household types that are easier to reach are the same as for first calls. Although the likelihood of reaching someone over the phone generally decreases with the number of calls, letting some time elapse after the previous call increases the likelihood of obtaining contact.</p>
<p>A new strand of research could be day-to-day and/or year-to-year variations of at-home patterns of household members. This can be analyzed using multiday-multiperiod time use surveys. One example is the German Mobility Panel,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1525822X11417966">7</xref> conducted yearly since 1994 and representative of the German residential population. Each individual in the sampled households fills in a travel diary for 1 week, including the start and end time of each trip made. This is repeated for 3 years.</p>
<p>I have some recommendations concerning optimal calling times until contact is established: Like findings from other studies, I confirm that more calls should be conducted on late afternoons (especially for households with retired people), particularly evenings (especially for households with children). The household should be called more often during the same time (window) at which it was first contacted in the previous wave, especially at the first call. This is also correlated with higher ultimate household <italic>cooperation</italic>. Although alternating time windows is positively correlated with obtaining contact, it is not always possible and contradicts the idea of replicating the successful call time from the previous wave. Because of the higher chance of obtaining ultimate cooperation, I conclude that although calling at the previous’ wave successful call time is a good strategy to start with, this should be changed for later calls. Finally, a certain amount of time should elapse between later calls.</p>
