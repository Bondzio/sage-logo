<p>This book is a must for every mental health service, training program, and any group private practice where long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic medications are prescribed. The authors review the evidence for non-adherence and its impact on patient outcomes. A systematic review of medication non-adherence in schizophrenia found a mean rate of 41.2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212475329">1</xref></sup> In a five year longitudinal study of 104 first-episode patients, the cumulative first relapse rate was 82% and the second relapse rate was 78%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212475329">2</xref></sup> Clearly, non-adherence remains a major barrier to recovery and it would seem that many patients are not receiving sufficient information about LAIs as a sensible and effective treatment option.</p>
<p>Non-adherence lies on a spectrum, is dynamic and usually covert. Partial adherence, where the patient misses a varying number of doses, is common and clinicians are often not aware when their patient is not taking his/her medication. There is some evidence that treatment responsiveness reduces with each relapse and that patients may become refractory to treatment. Apart from the obvious and potentially disastrous consequences of relapse: hospitalisation, reduced chance of remission and risk of suicide,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212475329">3</xref></sup> there are other devastating effects on the patient’s social relationships, housing tenure and self-esteem.</p>
<p>The history of LAIs is discussed in the book. The first long-acting injection of antipsychotic medication, fluphenazine enantate, was introduced in 1966, followed by fluphenazine decanoate in 1967. The Cochrane reviews of first generation antipsychotic long-acting injections (FGA-LAIs) provided unequivocal evidence of superiority over placebo in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, with no major difference between individual FGA-LAIs in terms of efficacy and tolerability except for a modest superior efficacy for zuclopenthixol decanoate. Risperidone LAI was the first commercially available second generation antipsychotic (SGA) LAI, gaining approval from the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003. In 2009, paliperidone LAI (PLAI) was approved by the FDA, and more recently olanzapine LAI (OLAI) was approved by the FDA and in Europe. The latter formulations have become available in Australia and New Zealand over the past 24 months.</p>
<p>The newer LAI technologies are described. Chemically, the FGA-LAIs are esters of the parent FGA combined with a long chain fatty acid (principally decanoic acid). Esterification allows the FGA to be dissolved in an oily base such as sesame oil. Once injected, the ester slowly leaves the oil from the reservoir in the muscle tissue. With regular injections, FGA LAIs take some weeks or months to reach steady state and have a correspondingly slow elimination period. The risperidone in RLAI is encapsulated in a biodegradable polymeric microsphere. The biodegradable polymers are slowly hydrolysed after intramuscular injection. The erosion of the micropsheres is delayed for 2–3 weeks post-injection, with peak release at about day 28. In practical terms, steady state plasma levels of RLAI are obtained after eight weeks. When RLAI is ceased, there is maintenance of adequate plasma levels for 4–5 weeks before there is a rapid reduction. By eight weeks after the last injection, there is no residue of RLAI. Paliperidone palmitate (PLAI) is a crystal-based LAI. The peak plasma concentration occurs some 13 days following injection although, as with OLAI, there is immediate release of clinically active levels of paliperidone. There is an initiation strategy for paliperidone, with the first two injections being given in the first two weeks (150mg eq then 100mg eq) and the deltoid muscle preferred for the first injection as deltoid injections of PLAI achieve higher plasma levels. OLAI is also a crystal based LAI. It is a salt of pamoic acid and olanzapine suspended in water. Following injection, the pamoate salt slowly dissolves, releasing free olanzapine and pamoic acid and causing peak plasma levels to occur some 2–4 days later and an apparent half-life of about 26 days (2–4 weeks). With regular injections, the time to steady state is about 2–3 months. Although the OLAI crystals are somewhat insoluble in muscle tissue, if they come in contact with blood, there is a rapid dissolution and release of free olanzapine. It is thought that damage of blood vessels during injection with extravasation of blood into the depot site may account for the post-injection syndrome (PIS) seen with OLAI. Although the incidence of PIS with olanzapine LAI is &lt; 1.0%, the requirement to observe the patient for a minimum period of three hours is a barrier to its use in some settings.</p>
<p>Lower LAI doses may be required in people of Asian background due to lower body mass rather than because of any primary effect of carrying slow metabolizer genes. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion of adverse effects of all the LAIs, and advice on switching from oral to LAI formulations and between LAI agents. There is a chapter on RLAI, which presents the evidence for RLAI and provides numerous clinically relevant observations and tips on the practical aspects of treating patients. RLAI is licenced in Australia for treatment refractory bipolar disorder. Studies of FGA LAIs seem to indicate that while they are effective in preventing manic relapse and days spent suffering from mania, they do not necessarily prevent depressive relapse and days spent in a depressive phase.</p>
<p>The authors examine the attitudes of patients and clinicians to LAI medications. Patients tend to favour their current formulation (oral or LAI). Patient preferences indicate a high level of support for LAIs: 39–89%. The negative subjective experience, or ‘neuroleptic dysphoria’, more frequently encountered with FGA-LAIs, is closely related to non-adherence. Other side effects associated with non-adherence include sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction and the symptoms related to raised prolactin. Not all clinicians have an adequate knowledge base in relation to LAIs and this is a barrier to rational prescribing. For example, 70% of psychiatrists expected poorer control of the antipsychotic effects with FGA-LAIs compared to the oral formulation of the same drug.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212475329">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The way discussions occur with patients around the range of available antipsychotic medications is very important to a sense of personal control and promotion of the therapeutic and recovery alliances. This area is sensitively developed in Chapter 9, with reference to illness belief models and the evidence base for strategies that promote adherence.</p>
<p>The authors discuss the current utilisation of LAIs. Internationally, rates of prescribing LAI antipsychotic medications for patients with schizophrenia differ according to region. The UK LAI prescribing rate is around 30%. Italy, Australia and New Zealand have rates around 25%; the USA appears to underutilise LAIs with rates of 4–15%, while Hong Kong (33%) and Thailand (15%) have higher rates than Japan, Korea and mainland China (with rates around 2%).</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, there was a fall in LAI prescribing rates with the introduction of oral SGAs. However, aside from clozapine, SGAs do not have improved rates of adherence compared to FGAs. Second generation antipsychotic long-acting injections are an important option for patients and clinicians to consider on the road to recovering from psychosis.</p>
