<abstract>
<p>Blood triacylglycerol (TG) and lipoproteins are important variables for evaluating nutritional status of wildlife, but measurements are often expensive and difficult. Performance of a small, portable blood analyzer intended for human medical diagnostics was evaluated in measuring these variables in plasma and serum from free-ranging polar bears (<italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>), which are experiencing nutritional stress related to sea ice loss. The analyzer accurately tracked changes in concentration of total cholesterol (C<sub>total</sub>), cholesterol associated with high-density lipoprotein (C<sub>HDL</sub>), and TG during a validation protocol of diluting samples and spiking them with exogenous cholesterol and glycerol. Values of C<sub>total</sub> and TG agreed well with values obtained by other methods (ultracentrifugation followed by colorimetric assays); agreement was variable for values of cholesterol associated with specific lipoproteins. Similar to a study of captive polar bears, ultracentrifugation methods revealed greater TG in very low-density lipoproteins than in low-density lipoprotein, which is unusual and merits additional study.</p>

<p>Whether an animal is fasting or feeding is reflected by blood values of cholesterol associated with high-density lipoproteins (C<sub>HDL</sub>), low-density lipoproteins (C<sub>LDL</sub>), very low-density lipoproteins (C<sub>VLDL</sub>), and total cholesterol (C<sub>total</sub>), as well as by values for triacylglycerols (TG<sub>HDL</sub>, TG<sub>LDL</sub>, TG<sub>VLDL</sub>, TG<sub>total</sub>). For example, C<sub>total</sub> and TG<sub>total</sub> often rise during mobilization of endogenous fat while animals are fasting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638713486114">8</xref></sup> Thus, lipoprotein measurements provide important inferences regarding the nutritional state of free-ranging animals that may or may not be fasting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638713486114">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several methods are available for lipoprotein quantification, including colorimetric assays in lipid panels and ultracentrifugation techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638713486114">13</xref></sup> However, ultracentrifugation is expensive, labor-intensive, and not easily performed in research field camps; therefore, many researchers instead send samples to laboratories for colorimetric assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638713486114">1</xref></sup> The objective of the current study was to validate assay applicability and performance for samples from wildlife species, particularly assays that have the potential to be performed in field camps, allowing immediate analysis and decreasing risks of sample deterioration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713486114">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Blood samples from polar bears (<italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>) were analyzed with a portable blood analyzer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref></sup> designed for human diagnostic procedures. The analyzer is also available for veterinary diagnostics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638713486114">b</xref></sup> but the human version<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref></sup> includes software for lipoprotein analysis. Both instruments<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1040638713486114">b</xref></sup> are small (height 32 cm, width 15 cm, depth 20 cm, mass 5 kg) and can easily be used in field camps provided there is electricity (AC 100–240 volts and 50–60 Hz, DC 15 volts and 5.0 Amperes) and that ambient temperatures remain within 15°C and 32°C. Both instruments use disposable rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> requiring 100 µl of sample. Thus, total equipment required for lipoprotein analysis includes the analyzer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref></sup> disposable rotors,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> and a pipette. A printer is built into the analyzer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref></sup> and results are produced in approximately 12 min. Disposable lipid rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> include assays for C<sub>total</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713486114">9</xref></sup> C<sub>HDL</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638713486114">19</xref></sup> and glycerol as a TG proxy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638713486114">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638713486114">12</xref></sup> Other variables are calculated: C<sub>VLDL</sub> = TG<sub>total</sub>/5, and C<sub>LDL</sub> = C<sub>total</sub> – C<sub>HDL</sub> – TG<sub>total</sub>/5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638713486114">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 3 assays have been certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (United States) for blood from fasted human beings and validated for point-of-care use with human patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638713486114">19</xref></sup> The current study tested the assays on blood from free-ranging polar bears and compared the results to values obtained by ultracentrifugation followed by analysis using commercial kits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1040638713486114">d</xref></sup> Accurate lipoprotein measurements are particularly useful in polar bear research. Research suggests that sea ice loss is leading to extended fasting and potential population declines in these carnivores,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638713486114">18</xref></sup> and lipoprotein measurements have been successfully used to understand polar bear nutritional state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638713486114">8</xref></sup> Additionally, polar bears are unique because they consume a high-fat diet (e.g., 80% seal blubber),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638713486114">2</xref></sup> and a previous study of captive bears reported greater TG<sub>LDL</sub> than TG<sub>VLDL</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638713486114">8</xref></sup> This is unusual because in human beings, LDLs are synthesized from TG-depleted VLDLs, implying that TG<sub>LDL</sub> is less than or equal to TG<sub>VLDL</sub>.</p>
<p>Portable analyzers enable the ideal scenario in which analyses are performed immediately after sample collection, avoiding deterioration risks of storage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1040638713486114">5</xref></sup> However, it is also important to validate assays if logistics prevent immediate analysis and samples must be stored. Validations were performed with samples collected during ongoing studies of polar bears in the Southern Beaufort and Chukchi seas, Alaska, USA (details on capture and sample collection described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638713486114">10</xref></sup>). Blood was collected from the femoral vein or artery in ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and no-additive containers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1040638713486114">e</xref></sup> centrifuged at 2,000 RCF for 10 min, then plasma or serum was siphoned into cryovials and stored at −20°C or −40°C until analysis.</p>
<p>Four validation experiments (A–D) were conducted as follows: A) plasma was diluted, then exogenous C<sub>HDL</sub> and TG were added, and percent recovery measured with lipid rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> after both manipulations; B) results were compared from lipid rotors when analyzing serum versus EDTA plasma samples; C) results were compared from lipid rotors and kits<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1040638713486114">d</xref></sup> for C<sub>total</sub> and TG<sub>total</sub>; and D) ultracentrifugation was used to separate HDL, LDL, and VLDL, then cholesterol and TG were quantified for each class.</p>
<p>In experiment A, preliminary trials with 2 bears indicated plasma contained C<sub>HDL</sub> levels above the detection limit of the blood analyzer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref></sup> (100 mg/dl). Bear 1 required a 20:1 dilution (volume of plasma-to-sterile saline), and bear 2 required a 3:4 dilution, to reduce C<sub>HDL</sub> to a measurable concentration. Additional dilutions were then performed (bear 1—5:2, 4:3, 3:4, 2:5; bear 2—1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:7). For each dilution, C<sub>HDL</sub> and C<sub>total</sub> were measured on 3 separate rotors; mean values were calculated, then divided by predicted values (based on the first dilution), and the results were converted to percent recovery (%). To each dilution, 4 μl of exogenous C<sub>HDL</sub> (606 mg/dl)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1040638713486114">f</xref></sup> was added, and new expected concentrations were calculated. Measurements for C<sub>HDL</sub> and C<sub>total</sub> were repeated and the percent recovery calculated.</p>
<p>Triacylglycerol was measured on bear 3 without dilution, as the concentration was within detection limits. The sample was then diluted (7:2, 9:7, 1:2, and 1:7) and percent recovery calculated for each dilution. Next, 5 μl of exogenous glycerol used as a TG standard (1,000 mg/dl)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1040638713486114">g</xref></sup> was added to each dilution, TG measurements were repeated, and the percent recovery was calculated.</p>
<p>For consistency with previous studies of lipoproteins in bears,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638713486114">6</xref></sup> the plasma was analyzed. However, the anticoagulant EDTA may negatively bias some colorimetric measurements of C<sub>HDL</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638713486114">20</xref></sup> although measurements of C<sub>total</sub> seem unaffected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638713486114">9</xref></sup> In experiment B, lipid rotor<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> assays were performed on both serum and EDTA plasma for 10 bears, and results were compared using linear regression.</p>
<p>In experiment C, C<sub>total</sub> and TG<sub>total</sub> were measured in plasma from 8 bears, using kits<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1040638713486114">d</xref></sup> and lipid rotors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> Results were compared with linear regression. In experiment D, ultracentrifugation was used to create a gradient based on density, separating HDL, LDL, and VLDL. For 8 plasma samples, 21 fractions of lipoproteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638713486114">6</xref></sup> were identified: VLDL (1–3), LDL (3–11), and HDL (11–20). Some VLDL remained on the meniscus surface in the separation column, forming fractions 20 and 21. In each fraction, cholesterol and TG were measured using the same kits as in experiment C. The area under the curve was then calculated for each fraction and multiplied by C<sub>total</sub> and TG<sub>total</sub> to derive cholesterol and TG for each lipoprotein.</p>
<p>In experiment A, lipid rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> accurately measured diluted and spiked samples of plasma. After dilution and spiking, mean recovery rates (± standard deviation) for C<sub>HDL</sub> and C<sub>total</sub> were 91% (±3%) to 105% (±3%). Recovery rates for TG after dilution and spiking were 100% (±2%) to 106% (±7%).</p>
<p>In experiment B, EDTA plasma samples yielded data similar to serum samples. Of the 10 bears for which both sample types were analyzed, 1 sample of EDTA plasma had extremely low values of C<sub>total</sub> (38 mg/dl), C<sub>HDL</sub> (22 mg/dl), and TG<sub>total</sub> (43 mg/dl), whereas the serum appeared normal (353 mg/dl, 187 mg/dl, and 255 mg/dl, respectively); this sample was excluded from further analyses. For TG<sub>total</sub>, EDTA plasma yielded results nearly identical to serum (in linear regression, 95% confidence intervals for slope included 1, and for intercept included 0). In contrast, slopes differed from 1 and intercepts differed from 0 for C<sub>total</sub> and C<sub>HDL</sub>, indicating these variables were measured differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638713486114">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Lipid rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> accurately measured diluted samples and samples with added HDL and glycerol, indicating there were no interfering substances in polar bear plasma. The EDTA plasma samples yielded lower C<sub>total</sub> and C<sub>HDL</sub> than serum samples. This may be because EDTA causes osmotic shifting of water out of red blood cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638713486114">20</xref></sup> influencing the concentration of C<sub>total</sub> and C<sub>HDL</sub> in plasma (although TG<sub>total</sub> was not reduced). Alternatively, it is possible that EDTA interferes with the chemical reactions within the rotor. Regardless, significant slope parameters and high <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values suggest a consistent and precise relationship, allowing for reliable correction of data derived from plasma samples. One bear (of 10) exhibited extremely low values of all variables in EDTA plasma, but normal values in serum; it is unclear whether this is a risk when analyzing EDTA plasma or a chance occurrence. It is recommended that 1 sample type be used when comparing individuals or sampling events and that the results be compared to the published range of the species.</p>
<p>Measurements of C<sub>total</sub> and TG<sub>total</sub> from lipid rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> and kits<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1040638713486114">d</xref></sup> accurately tracked each other. It is not clear why C<sub>HDL</sub> measurements differed between lipid rotors and ultracentrifugation. The lipid rotor precipitates non-HDL lipoproteins and quantifies the remaining cholesterol that must be associated with HDL. However, the non-HDL precipitation may be inaccurate because it depends on recognition of apolipoprotein-B, which can vary in structure among species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638713486114">14</xref></sup> and may differ between human beings and polar bears. The ultracentrifugation method separates lipoproteins by density and then quantifies cholesterol in each layer. In dogs, HDL are divided into 2 subtypes, 1 of which overlaps with LDL in density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638713486114">15</xref></sup> It is not known if polar bears possess HDL subtypes similar to dogs; if so, this may make it difficult to separate HDL and LDL by density. Neither method should be affected by chylomicrons, which likely precipitate with non-HDL in lipid rotors, and which have a much lower density than HDL and thus, in ultracentrifugation, should not appear in the HDL layer. Causes of the discrepancy between methods are unclear and merit further investigation.</p>
<p>Dissimilarities in C<sub>HDL</sub> between lipid rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> and ultracentrifugation must have contributed to inconsistencies in C<sub>LDL</sub> because the blood analyzer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref></sup> software uses C<sub>HDL</sub> to calculate C<sub>LDL.</sub> Intriguingly, C<sub>VLDL</sub> calculated from the rotor measurement of TG<sub>total</sub> was approximately 6× higher than C<sub>VLDL</sub> measured after ultracentrifugation. This pattern, in combination with the unusual distribution of TG among VLDL and LDL (discussed in the following), suggests that lipoproteins may be different in polar bears than in human beings.</p>
<p>Ultracentrifugation methods revealed that, similar to polar bears in captivity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638713486114">8</xref></sup> free-ranging polar bears consistently have greater TG<sub>LDL</sub> than TG<sub>VLDL</sub>. In contrast, TG<sub>LDL</sub> is less than or equal to TG<sub>VLDL</sub> in black bears,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638713486114">6</xref></sup> human beings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638713486114">3</xref></sup> rats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638713486114">17</xref></sup> and ground squirrels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638713486114">16</xref></sup> Dogs with greater TG<sub>LDL</sub> than TG<sub>VLDL</sub> have been reported in studies where, similar to the current study, the VLDL fractions may have contained chylomicrons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638713486114">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638713486114">21</xref></sup> In dogs, however, TG<sub>LDL</sub> was about 2× TG<sub>VLDL</sub> whereas in the present study, TG<sub>LDL</sub> was approximately 10× TG<sub>VLDL</sub>. It is speculated that if HDL and LDL do not separate completely because of an overlap in density, TG<sub>LDL</sub> may include TG<sub>HDL</sub>, elevating the former measurement. This topic requires further study.</p>
<p>In summary, lipid rotors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638713486114">c</xref></sup> yielded accurate, precise measurements of C<sub>total</sub> and TG<sub>total</sub>, but more variable measurements of cholesterol associated with specific lipoproteins, in blood from free-ranging polar bears. These results, in combination with ease of operation and field portability, indicate that the portable blood analyzer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638713486114">a</xref></sup> evaluated in the current study is a useful tool for research on polar bears, and potentially other wildlife species.</p>
