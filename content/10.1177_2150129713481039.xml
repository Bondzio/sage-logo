<abstract>
<p>The limited existing research on the asthma perceptions of older adults suggests that this population perceives asthma to be a childhood disease and, therefore, believe that they are not susceptible to developing the condition as an adult. The asthma mortality rate is much higher for older adults than for children, and there is considerable negative impact on health-related quality of life. However, health promotion regarding asthma is rarely aimed at this population. To address this issue, social marketing campaign messages and materials about asthma were developed for an older adult population based on quantitative survey data. Through a series of community focus groups, these messages and materials were pretested with older adults to establish the types of asthma health promotion messages, taglines, and images that engage this target audience. Materials that conveyed a “human element” appealed most to older adults, enabling them to relate to the individuals and situations depicted in the images. Positive, empowering messages containing novel information and asking questions of the target population resonated best with older adults. These features should be considered in the development of health promotion campaign materials about chronic disease targeting older adult populations.</p>

<p>Asthma is a chronic condition characterized by narrowing of the airways. While the prevalence of asthma in adults varies greatly across the world,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150129713481039">1</xref></sup> Australia has one of the highest rates of asthma diagnosis and asthma symptoms internationally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150129713481039">2</xref></sup> Approximately 1 in 10 older Australians have an asthma diagnosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713481039">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713481039">4</xref></sup> and there are many older adults living with undiagnosed asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129713481039">5</xref></sup> Although limited research exists on the asthma perceptions of older adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150129713481039">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150129713481039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150129713481039"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150129713481039"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150129713481039">10</xref></sup> a recent study demonstrated that older adults generally consider asthma to be a childhood disease and perceive that they are not susceptible to developing the condition later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150129713481039">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, there are key symptoms—such as tightness in the chest and a cough at night—that older adults may experience but are not likely to consider indicative of asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129713481039">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite public perception that asthma has the most serious consequences for children, the asthma mortality rate is higher for older adults than for children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150129713481039">4</xref></sup> Asthma also has a considerable negative impact on health-related quality of life among older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713481039">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, while the health outcomes of children with asthma have steadily improved over the past decades, the outcomes for older adults with the disease have worsened.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713481039">3</xref></sup> Although asthma in older individuals is often more persistent and severe than in children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150129713481039">3</xref></sup> community asthma awareness and self-management promotion is usually aimed at children and their caregivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150129713481039">13</xref></sup> Older adults have been largely neglected in asthma promotion activities, and they would benefit from increased community awareness about asthma prevalence and its health impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150129713481039">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Social marketing is an effective framework to increase awareness of health issues and promote health behavior change,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150129713481039">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150129713481039">15</xref></sup> including health promotion interventions specifically targeting older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150129713481039">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150129713481039"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150129713481039">18</xref></sup> The social marketing framework requires involvement of the target audience in the development of health promotion campaigns to ensure that health promoters understand the target audience’s knowledge, perceptions, and opinions about a health issue and its associated behaviours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129713481039">19</xref></sup> One component of the social marketing process that has often been poorly executed is rigorous formative research involving members of the target population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150129713481039">20</xref></sup> This stage of research is necessary to ensure that interventions are appropriately tailored to the needs of the distinct target audience segments.</p>
<p>The development of appropriate campaign materials primarily involves segmenting the target audience into meaningful groups and then determining the main messages of the campaign for these groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129713481039">21</xref></sup> Segmentation can be based on demographic, psychographic, geographic, and epidemiological factors and is necessary because populations are typically heterogeneous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150129713481039">22</xref></sup> “Blanket” approaches to health promotion, treating entire populations as having the same perceptions and behaviors, are rarely effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150129713481039">19</xref></sup> Subgrouping target audiences on relevant variables allows interventions to address different perceptions and health behaviors within the larger target population. Subsequently, it is important that campaign messages be developed for each target segment in accordance with their particular defining characteristics.</p>
<p>Messages for target segments are then further developed into campaign concepts consisting of suitable images and taglines to convey key ideas and issues. Following their development, the campaign concepts and materials are pretested with the target audience using established materials testing methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150129713481039">21</xref></sup> One of these methodologies is the use of focus groups. The aim of pretesting with focus groups is to ascertain the appropriateness of proposed materials in effectively conveying key messages to particular audience segments. Focus group participants are presented with various concepts for a campaign and asked to respond to a set of structured questions to assess message comprehension, relevance, readability, level of engagement, and aspects of the materials they like and dislike.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129713481039">23</xref></sup> Campaign concepts and materials are then refined based on the advice and criticism received from the target audience.</p>
<p>Social marketing campaigns involve the use of multiple strategies, including the 4Ps of the traditional marketing mix: product, price, place, and promotion. This study focused primarily on the promotion element of the mix, examining the development and pretesting of campaign materials to increase asthma knowledge and address asthma misperceptions in people aged 55 years and older. The aim of the study was to develop and pretest asthma awareness campaign materials with older adults in order to determine the types of messages, taglines, and images that appeal to, and engage, them. The study sought to ascertain aspects of the campaign materials that were generally liked and disliked, to determine which types of taglines and images were effective in conveying particular messages, and to obtain suggestions for improvements on the materials.</p>
<sec id="section1-2150129713481039">
<title>Background to the Current Study</title>
<p>Target audience segmentation was based on data from a large-scale, quantitative study on the asthma knowledge and perceptions, and experience of respiratory symptoms, among older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129713481039">12</xref></sup> The survey was mailed to 9000 adults aged 55 years and older randomly selected from the Australian Electoral Roll and was completed by 4131 individuals (response rate 46.8%). The final sample included 4066 respondents. The mean age of respondents was 67.9 (SD = 9.0) years; ages ranged from 55 to 96 years. Forty-five percent of the respondents were male, and individuals with an asthma diagnosis accounted for 17.7% of the sample.</p>
<p>Respondents with recent experience of breathlessness had significantly poorer general health and worse mood. Other key variables differentiated between those with and without an asthma diagnosis. Not surprisingly, respondents with an asthma diagnosis had higher asthma knowledge and higher asthma-related self-efficacy than those without an asthma diagnosis. Unexpectedly, individuals with an asthma diagnosis were more likely to consider that asthma was not a serious disease. Therefore, audience segmentation was determined by (<italic>a</italic>) the presence or absence of recent experience of breathlessness and (<italic>b</italic>) an asthma diagnosis. Four distinct audience segments were identified: <italic>Strugglers</italic> (35%; n = 1303), <italic>Wheezers</italic> (14%; n = 540), <italic>Breathers</italic> (3%; n = 112), and <italic>Bloomers</italic> (48%; n = 1792).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150129713481039">12</xref></sup> <italic>Strugglers</italic> had recently experienced respiratory symptoms but did not have an asthma diagnosis. <italic>Wheezers</italic> had an asthma diagnosis and had recently experienced respiratory symptoms. The smallest group, <italic>Breathers</italic>, had an asthma diagnosis but had not recently experienced symptoms. <italic>Bloomer</italic>s had neither asthma nor recent symptoms. The 2 key target segments selected for the campaign were those with recent respiratory symptoms: <italic>Strugglers</italic>, those without an asthma diagnosis; and <italic>Wheezers</italic>, those diagnosed with asthma.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-2150129713481039">
<title>Message Development: What Do We Want to Convey?</title>
<p>Messages were developed for each target segment based on the survey findings related to asthma knowledge and perceptions. The primary campaign aims were to communicate that asthma can have serious consequences for those aged 55 years and older, and to increase community awareness of the importance of self-management of asthma among older adults. For both target segments, the aim was to promote active self-management of respiratory symptoms. The intent was to have 1 campaign with 2 distinct executions. The first message was to encourage <italic>Wheezers</italic> (those individuals with an asthma diagnosis who are experiencing symptoms) to take control of their asthma, properly self-manage it, and not allow their symptoms to lower their quality of life. The second message, targeting <italic>Strugglers</italic> (those individuals with symptoms but no asthma diagnosis), aimed to increase awareness that respiratory symptoms are not a normal part of getting older and, as the presence of these symptoms in older adults could indicate asthma, they should visit a health professional.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150129713481039">
<title>Materials Development: How Do We Convey the Messages?</title>
<p>Three groups of designers developed campaign concepts to convey the message that asthma can have a serious impact on lifestyle and that persons experiencing respiratory symptoms should take action to manage them. Each group of designers was asked to use appropriate images, taglines, and slogans to develop messages into a poster format to portray the benefits of controlling asthma symptoms. Designers were instructed that the designs would be used in various formats for different campaign communication strategies, including billboards, postcards, brochures, and Web pages, in addition to the poster format. Each group designed one set of materials; consequently, 3 separate sets of campaign posters were developed for pretesting.</p>
<p>The first campaign design was composed of 3 posters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150129713481039">Figure 1</xref>). The first poster targeted <italic>Wheezers</italic> and compared 2 older males, named Frank and Bill, who have asthma: Frank was pictured coughing, while Bill was shown energetically balancing his grandchild on his shoulders. The images compared one man who does not control his symptoms with another who has well-controlled symptoms and therefore is able to get more out of life. The other 2 campaign posters targeted <italic>Strugglers</italic> and highlighted a key symptom of asthma (ie, breathlessness) that, when properly managed, should not hinder individuals in their daily life. One poster was of a man holding a small child in a wheat field with the tagline “Don’t let shortness of breath get in the way of life!”; the other poster depicted a golfer on a putting green with the tagline “Don’t let breathlessness hold you back!” All posters had “Be informed. Reclaim your life” at the bottom, along with the peak asthma organization’s logo and toll-free information line number.</p>

<p>The second set of campaign posters illustrated that asthma symptoms should not get in the way of everyday activities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150129713481039">Figure 2</xref>). Through the use of the phrase “This is not . . .,” each poster depicted an activity that would be difficult (or even impossible) for someone who does not properly control his or her respiratory symptoms. These posters targeted both <italic>Strugglers</italic> and <italic>Wheezers</italic>. The “This is not Mt Everest” poster showed a relatively flat golf green; the “This is not the stairway to heaven” poster showed the well-known stairs leading up to the Sydney Opera House; and the “This is not a two-man job” poster depicted a granddaughter helping her unfit grandfather mow the lawn. The text beneath the primary taglines highlighted key asthma symptoms and included prevalence statistics of asthma in older adults. The secondary tagline was “Get your life back”; the call to action was “Confront asthma today” followed by the toll-free information line number. Logos of the peak asthma organization and the University were displayed in the bottom left-hand corner.</p>

<p>The third set of campaign posters highlighted that older people can develop asthma too, and was primarily directed at <italic>Strugglers</italic> using the tagline “Not just child’s play” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150129713481039">Figure 3</xref>). The images were black outlines with sketched color, akin to a child’s coloring-in book. One image showed a woman in a hospital bed with a respirator, while the other depicted a man sitting alone on a bench. The text stated that “1 in 10 Australians aged 55 and over suffer from asthma.” Both posters had the toll-free asthma information line number prominently displayed at the bottom, along with the logos of the peak asthma organization and the university.</p>

<title>Pretesting of Messages and Materials</title>
<p>Interested respondents from the initial survey provided their contact details for future participation in research; 289 participants provided an email address. Recruitment of potential participants for the pretesting focus groups was undertaken via email. The target of 30 participants was recruited within 5 days.</p>
<p>Four focus groups involving 34 participants were held in community centers and libraries across the target region. There were between 7 and 10 participants in each group. Twenty-two (64.7%) participants were female; participant ages ranged from 56 to 78 years (M = 63.4, SD = 5.2). More than one third (n = 12) of the focus group attendees had been diagnosed with asthma at some stage of their life, and 15 had recently experienced respiratory symptoms. All 4 audience segments (<italic>Strugglers, Wheezers, Bloomers</italic>, and <italic>Breathers</italic>) were represented in the focus groups.</p>
<p>Participants were shown each set of campaign posters separately and asked to comment on what they liked and disliked about the posters. The groups discussed the messages within each of the 3 campaign concepts, and the effectiveness of the taglines and the images. Participants debated the relevance of the posters to other individuals from their own demographic and offered suggestions for improvement. Finally, participants made suggestions of locations to place campaign materials in the community. The order in which concepts were presented varied across the focus groups to minimize bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150129713481039">23</xref></sup> Focus groups lasted for approximately hour and were audio-taped.</p>
<p>The transcripts from the focus groups were coded to identify strengths and weaknesses of each proposed set of campaign posters on the basis of the chosen images, taglines, and how well they conveyed the campaign messages. The results are expressed qualitatively, highlighting common themes and opinions that emerged across the groups.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-2150129713481039" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The focus group participants engaged with the comparison of 2 people with asthma, but were unmoved by the 2 other posters from the first set of campaign designs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150129713481039">Figure 1</xref>); they agreed that the comparison would largely appeal to those already diagnosed with asthma, as those without an asthma diagnosis may disregard the poster. The majority of participants engaged with the overall idea of the second set of campaign posters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150129713481039">Figure 2</xref>); they thought it was clever to highlight the difficulty of everyday tasks for individuals who experience asthma symptoms. The third set of campaign posters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150129713481039">Figure 3</xref>) was least liked by focus group participants; the majority disliked the images and commented that the posters would not appeal to older adults. The findings from the focus groups are organized by the different elements of the campaign posters: messages, taglines, images, text, and suggestions for placement of the campaign materials.</p>
<sec id="section7-2150129713481039">
<title>Messages</title>
<p>Participants discussed their perceptions of the messages conveyed in the posters and commented on the clarity of those messages. They also judged the importance and personal relevance of the messages to themselves and others in the target demographic. Some participants noted that the posters could be promoting a number of things and only realized that the messages were about asthma after reading the smaller text.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’d read that and discount it. It certainly wouldn’t leap out at me as being anything about asthma. I would presume that it’s more related to something like a heart condition, and knowing I don’t have a heart condition I wouldn’t read any further. (Focus Group 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While some participants stated that it was not initially obvious that the posters were about asthma, others commented that this might make campaigns more effective in reaching those without a diagnosis. When campaign messages were obviously about asthma, participants without a diagnosis tended to ignore the messages because they did not perceive that they could develop asthma at their age.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To me if I haven’t developed asthma by now I think “I won’t have it.” (Focus Group 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants mentioned that if they read the word “asthma,” or the logo of a known asthma organization was prominently displayed, they would automatically assume that the message was not relevant to them if they do not have asthma.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If I see the asthma logo, I wouldn’t read any further, because I don’t have asthma. . . . I wouldn’t read any further, because I’d think I’m overweight and I’m out of condition. (Focus Group 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants suggested that older adults without an asthma diagnosis may engage with the campaign if the messages highlight key symptoms and the impact they have on daily activities, without an initial emphasis on the word “asthma.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think that the biggest problem you face is everybody, and I’m just as guilty, everybody thinks “it’s never going to happen to me.” (Focus Group 3)</p>
<p>It’s just that I think that after 55 if you have any of these symptoms the last thing you think of is asthma I guess. (Focus Group 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants responded well to the phrase “shortness of breath is not a normal part of getting older,” as they were engaged by facts that they did not already know. In the same way, it was noted that the posters would be more effective if they emphasized lesser known symptoms like tightness in the chest, in addition to the obvious symptoms such as wheezing, and relate these to asthma in older adults.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just would make it just more specific symptomatic things. . . . What about coughs and wheezing—and or—wheezes or coughs at night. (Focus Group 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants responded positively to the comparison between the 2 people with asthma; many commented that it was clever to show the difference in quality of life between controlled and uncontrolled asthma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150129713481039">Figure 1</xref>). It was noted that Bill looked younger than Frank; this age difference was seen as the main contributor to the apparent difference in health. They suggested that the 2 individuals being compared be the same age so that the only difference having an impact on their health is the presence of asthma control.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s got the wow factor. . . . I like that one, two men, you see one really fit, but of course one’s a lot younger than the other one. (Focus Group 3)</p>
<p>I quite like it. I think it’s good having two, that’s what draws your attention, the fact there’s two different things on it. So I actually think that attracted me. (Focus Group 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2150129713481039">
<title>Taglines</title>
<p>Participants commented on the taglines in the 3 sets of campaign posters. The catchphrase “Reclaim your life” was well received by participants; they liked the empowering nature of the phrase, though some participants commented that the language could be simplified to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I like the catchphrase “reclaim your life” it asserts what the problem is. . . . I like that. (Focus Group 3)</p>
<p>It’s all about being informed. (Focus Group 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants also liked the phrase “Get your life back,” commenting that it was direct and simple. Most participants responded positively to the phrase “Confront asthma today,” although some felt that the use of “confront” had negative connotations.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But “get your life back” is much better than “reclaim your life,” more simple speak. (Focus Group 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, participants were attracted by the combination of image and tagline in the “This is not . . .” posters and were intrigued to read further to find out what the campaign was about. Participants did not engage readily with the “This is not the stairway to heaven” tagline, but responded positively to the taglines “This is not a two-man job” and “This is not Mt Everest”.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The tagline I think is quite good, “this is not a two-man job” so it makes me ask the question to look at an answer of “why” so it got my interest in looking at it, which then was why I would then look further and read on. I really like this one. (Focus Group 1)</p>
<p>I think that says it all because that ultimately indicates that there’s just so much of life that’s lost by having asthma. It appeals to me immediately. (Focus Group 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tagline of the third campaign confused some participants. They noted the phrase “Not just child’s play” means that something is easy, whereas the designers intended for the phrase to have an alternative meaning, that is, that asthma does not only affect children.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t get this message at all. (Focus Group 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2150129713481039">
<title>Images</title>
<p>Participants commented on the appropriateness of the images and the extent to which they would engage and attract the attention of older adults. Some participants preferred “anonymous” images (with people, but no faces or distinguishing features) so more people could relate to them, and the image did not “take away” from the message. However, most participants commented that these types of images were often boring and would not gain their attention. To add life to the posters, participants suggested the images should portray older adults who are at least 55 years old, both males and females, and who are “everyday people,” thereby allowing the target audience to identify with them.</p>

<p>The audience needs to be able to relate to the activities depicted in the campaign. Some participants indicated they would disregard the posters with images of golf courses because they were not golfers and thus could not relate to the images, even though they recognized that golf was a common sport among people aged 55 years and older. They suggested changing the setting from golf to another everyday activity so that more people could identify with the people in the campaign.</p>
<p>The image of the Sydney Opera House was perceived as being too general and could be interpreted as being a tourist advertisement. Participants recommended an image of another set of stairs, perhaps a staircase that is climbed more regularly by people in the target community than those at the Sydney Opera House, as well as ensuring an older adult is in the image.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think I would look at it and say well I don’t really climb Mount Everest, the Opera House, I’m not there every day—so what, whereas this with family, most of us have a garden, most of us have mowing, so that’s more part of everyday life. (Focus Group 1)</p>

<p>Participants responded positively to images that contained both older adults and children, illustrating a relationship between grandparents and grandchildren.</p>

<p>This one here I really like this one because it does have some dynamic to it. It’s unusual because you don’t see that one every day so it attracted my attention to it.

<p>The images in the “Not just child’s play” posters were perceived as being too confronting and extreme. These types of images did not resonate well or engage participants to interact with the campaign.</p>

<title>Text</title>
<p>Contrasting the color of the text on the chosen image was identified as being important. Many participants commented that grey text on a green background, for example, made it difficult to read because the text blended into the graphic. They emphasized that the text should be in stark contrast to the image, and the font size be large and in bold type for maximum readability.</p>
<p>Most participants suggested that the call to action text be more prominent on the poster and that a Web site should be an option for people who would like more information. It was suggested that the size of the text be increased to draw attention to the call to action.</p>

<title>Placement of Campaign Materials</title>
<p>In addition to discussing the look and feel of the campaigns, focus group participants suggested a variety of locations for placement of the print materials, including posters, billboards, brochures, and postcards. The places that were consistently recommended were community centers and libraries, doctors’ surgeries and community medical centers, pharmacies and chemists, and the waiting rooms of other health professionals including physiotherapists, podiatrists, and dentists. Participants also proposed other locations where older adults tend to go such as gyms and leisure centers, cafes, shopping centers and grocery stores, sports clubs, and other community clubs. Other options suggested for placement of the print materials included bus shelters and on buses, train stations and on trains, the Internet, local newspapers, and publications produced specifically for seniors in the local area.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Participants highlighted positive and negative aspects of all 3 sets of campaign posters and suggested specific modifications to the images, wording and amount of text, font size, and color contrast. Focus group participants preferred the first and second sets of campaign designs “Be informed. Reclaim your life” and “This is not . . .” over the third campaign design “Not just child’s play.” Participants thought it was clever to highlight the potential difficulty of everyday tasks—like walking along a flat stretch of ground, going up stairs, or mowing a lawn—for individuals who experience asthma symptoms. Participants also agreed that a comparison between 2 people with asthma would largely appeal to those already diagnosed with asthma; those without an asthma diagnosis may perceive the message as being irrelevant and disregard the poster. Participants preferred images that included people and commented that this would complement the health messages and increase engagement with the posters.</p>
<p>The overall impressions, reactions, and comments of participants from the target audience should be integrated into the design of final campaign materials. Focus group findings from the current study revealed key features of health promotion materials that older adults responded well to, as well as those aspects that they did not find appealing or engaging. These aspects emerged across all the focus groups and are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150129713481039">Table 1</xref>. Many of the features that appealed to participants involved the “human element”—the inclusion of people in campaign materials who portray relationships and activities that they can personally identify with.</p>

<p>Three interesting themes emerge from the data. First, older adults experiencing shortness of breath, without an asthma diagnosis, do not perceive that messages about asthma are relevant to their own health. In the current study, the 2 target audience segments needed distinct messages and, therefore, necessitated separate designs for health promotion materials. For example, prominently displaying the word “asthma” would engage <italic>Wheezers</italic> but may cause <italic>Strugglers</italic> to disregard campaign materials. The findings suggest that target populations should not be treated in a homogenous manner, as different segments require different campaign materials. Second, older adults without an asthma diagnosis would likely attend to messages focused on specific symptoms that they are experiencing. This position is supported by research and theory indicating that individuals attend more to relevant messages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150129713481039">24</xref></sup> and are more likely to change their health attitudes and behaviors when messages are perceived as relevant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150129713481039">25</xref></sup> Third, older adults engage more with health promotion materials when they can “see themselves” in the images and messages. This familiarity occurred when there were images of people of the same gender, age, and race, as well as when the image depicted relationships with which they had an emotional link. The depictions of the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren resonated particularly well in this study. Previous studies have demonstrated that messages that are emotionally meaningful are preferred and are recalled more easily by older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150129713481039">26</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section13-2150129713481039">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Particular limitations are associated with focus group data collection and analysis. The participants were a convenience sample from the general population of older adults in the region, spread across the 4 audience segments. This methodological feature limits the generalizability of our findings. While the findings of this study cannot be generalized to the entire older Australian population, we can assume that the shared opinions and perceptions of focus group participants are indicative of their particular communities and may be of value to those interested in targeting health promotion interventions toward similar communities of older adults. Focus group research relies heavily on the skills of both moderators and data analysts; thus, bias may be present in the processes of data collection and transcript coding. These limitations were minimized by following standard protocol throughout the research process, from data collection to coding and final analysis. Importantly, this study has a number of strengths. The pretest materials were informed by data from a large-scale survey with a sample of older adults randomly selected from the Australian Electoral Roll. Researchers tested 3 sets of professionally designed materials with expert input from a peak asthma organization, as opposed to simple storyboards that are often used in pretesting.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Recommendations for Asthma Educators</title>
<p>Social marketing campaign messages and materials about asthma were developed for an older adult population based on quantitative survey data. These messages and materials were then qualitatively pretested with older adults to ascertain the types of health promotion messages, taglines, and images that appeal to this target audience. The primary finding from the focus groups was that older people want a “human element” to be depicted in campaign materials. This includes having people in the images that they can relate to, portraying important relationships (eg, that of grandparents and grandchildren), and everyday activities that they can readily identify with. It is crucial for this human element to be present so that older adults actually engage with campaigns. Older adults without an asthma diagnosis who are experiencing respiratory symptoms did not find direct messaging about asthma salient; these individuals are likely to respond better to messages centered on specific symptoms. Campaigns should also present novel information that the target audience is largely unaware of and engage the audience by asking questions. The focus of messages should be positive rather than negative or confrontational and should clearly promote the targeted health behaviors. Text on the materials needs to be direct and concise. Campaign materials should be placed in locations where older adults have the opportunity to see and interact with them. Such locations could include medical center waiting rooms, pharmacies, libraries, community centers, bus shelters, and shopping complexes. Health promoters should consider these elements and incorporate them into campaigns directed at older adults to ensure maximum audience engagement and, subsequently, improvements in the targeted health behaviors.</p>
