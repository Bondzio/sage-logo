<sec>
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Seizures are a common complication in patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Optimal management is unclear with no defined guidelines and pharmacological management poses many controversies. Due to a hypothesized lack of consistency, we aimed to retrospectively review seizure management in patients with high-grade CNS tumors in our institution.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The medical records of patients with high-grade CNS tumors referred to the specialist palliative medicine service in our institution from January-June 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Seizure incidence, antiepileptic drug (AED) choice, neurology input, medication interactions, and appropriate drug level monitoring were assessed.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Twenty-seven patients were included for analysis. Fifteen (56%) were female. The mean age was 58.8 years (range 31-82 years). Three (11%) patients presented with seizures and 8 (30%) developed seizures subsequently. Eight (73% of those with seizures) were on monotherapy AED. Six different agents were used as first-line agents. Phenytoin was the most common AED used (n = 4). Three (27%) patients were on combination AEDs. Five (45.5%) patients had been seen by neurology and 6 (54.5%) had appropriate drug level monitoring performed. Six (55%) patients had potential AED-non-AED interactions. None of the patients had instructions documented in the clinical notes against driving.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Seizure management in patients with CNS tumors is not consistent and remains very much a neglected area. Appropriate choice of AED is crucial. Physicians should be aware of potential drug interactions. Ownership and regular follow-up of this group is required to ensure optimum patient management.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Patients with primary brain tumors comprise about 2% of all new cases of cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111434367">1</xref>
</sup> Seizures are a frequent problem in patients with brain tumors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111434367">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111434367">3</xref>
</sup> In about two thirds of patients, a seizure is the presenting symptom of their illness, and about half of the patients will experience seizures during the course of their illness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111434367">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111434367">3</xref>
</sup> The frequency of seizures is approximately 80% in low-grade gliomas, up to 40% in high-grade gliomas, and 15% to 20% in those with brain metastases, while the incidence of brain tumors in patients with epilepsy is approximately 4%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111434367">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111434367">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111434367"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111434367">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The incidence of seizures varies with tumor type and location and with peritumoral and genetic factors. The highest risk is associated with tumors in the temporal cortex or primary sensorimotor cortex, with hemorrhagic tumors or with multifocal disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111434367">7</xref>
</sup> Of patients presenting with seizures, about 50% have generalized tonic–clonic seizures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111434367">8</xref>
</sup> Irrespective of the tumor type, patients who present with seizures are at an increased risk of recurrent seizures despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Seizures can significantly impact on patients’ quality of life even if the primary tumor is under control. Tumor-associated epilepsy has important social and clinical implications but is a poorly understood mechanism. There is an increased risk of anxiety, depression, and suicidality among patients, with driving restrictions also enforced on patients.</p>
<p>The initiation of an AED is justified after the patient presents with a first seizure. Monotherapy should be employed if possible. The American Academy of Neurology discourages the routine use of AED prophylaxis in newly diagnosed brain tumors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111434367">9</xref>
</sup> In patients who have not had a seizure, tapering and discontinuing operative prophylactic anticonvulsants after the first week is appropriate, particularly in those who are medically stable and who are experiencing anticonvulsant-related side-effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111434367">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Few prospective studies on the medical treatment of seizures in patients with brain tumors exist.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111434367">6</xref>

</sup> Antiepileptic drugs are often prescribed by neurosurgeons and oncologists. The pharmacological management of seizures poses many controversies, such as the utility of prophylactic AEDs, interactions between AEDs and chemotherapeutic agents, and the complications associated with adverse-effects. There are conflicting recommendations as to the appropriate first-line AED to use, with no convincing clinical data favoring one over another. The optimal management of seizures in patients with high-grade central nervous system (CNS) tumors is thus unclear with no defined guidelines.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The referrals of all adult patients over 18 years with high-grade CNS tumors referred to the SPMS in St Luke’s Hospital, Dublin (a large tertiary referral radiotherapy center) from January to June 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients with histologically proven high-grade tumors were included. The clinically relevant data were collected from patient medical records and drug kardexes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-seven patients were included for analysis: 15 (56%) female and 12 (44%) male. The median age was 58.8 years (range 31-82 years). Twenty-four (89%) patients had died at the time of writing, 2 (7.5%) were still alive, and 1 (3.5%) was lost to follow-up. Mean time from diagnosis to death for the patients who had died (n = 24) was 7.5 months (range &lt;1-19 months). Seventeen (63%) had a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 8 (30%) anaplastic astrocytoma, 1 (3.5%) anaplastic ependymoma, and 1 (3.5%) medulloblastoma (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111434367">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Ten patients (37%) had subtotal debulking performed, 10 (37%) patients had biopsy only, and 7 (26%) patients had radical resection performed. All (100%) patients received cranial radiotherapy and 16 (57%) received systemic chemotherapy: single-agent temozolomide (n = 14), combination PCV (procarbazine–lomustine–vincristine; n = 1) and single-agent vincristine (n = 1). All (100%) patients were on corticosteroids (dexamethasone) in various dosing schedules.</p>
<p>Eleven (41%) of the 27 patients had seizures. Three (27% of those with seizures) had seizures as the presenting feature of their neurological illness and 8 (73%) developed seizures during the course of their illness. Eight patients (73% of those with seizures) were on monotherapy AED. Six different AEDs were employed as first-line agents: phenytoin (n = 4), levetiracetam (n = 3), carbamazepine (n = 1), oxcarbazepine (n = 1), pregabalin (n = 1), and valproic acid (n = 1; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049909111434367">Figure 2</xref>). Three patients were on combination AEDs, with 3 different agents used as second-line AEDs: phenytoin (n = 1), valproic acid (n = 1), and levetiracetam (n = 1) resulting in 2 different combinations of AED: phenytoin with levetiracetam (n = 2) and phenytoin with valproic acid (n = 1). Six (55%) patients had potential AED-non-AED interactions: 1 drug interaction (n = 1), 2 drug interactions (n = 4), and 3 drug interactions (n = 1). Medications involved in the AED-non-AED interactions included corticosteroids (n = 6), fluconazole (n = 3), haloperidol (n = 1), bromazepam (n = 1), and omeprazole (n = 1).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Seizures are a common complication of both primary and metastatic brain tumors, yet seizure management and AED prescribing in patients with brain tumors appears to be very much a neglected area. Our study shows that the management of seizures in patients with high-grade CNS tumors is not consistent. Input from neurology specialists was shown to be infrequent. Ongoing review by neurology may be of benefit in this group of patients. The appropriate choice and dose of AED is crucial for optimum patient management. Six different agents were employed as first-line AED in our study, which highlights the uncertainty on the most appropriate AED to use. Currently the most favored AEDs are (1) levetiracetam and (2) valproic acid, and less recommended AEDs include (1) carbamazepine, (2) lamotrigine, and (3) topiramate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111434367">10</xref>
</sup> Levetiracetam is at present the most favorable due to its efficacy, good safety profile, twice daily dosing schedule, ease of titration, few drug interactions, few side-effects, and no requirement for drug level monitoring.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111434367">10</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Our study has also shown a high percentage of potential drug interactions. Physicians should be aware of potential drug interactions between AEDs and chemotherapeutic agents. Interactions between AEDs and chemotherapy may lead to (1) insufficient control of the tumor, (2) increase in seizures, and (3) toxic effects of one or both. There is a growing consensus favoring the use of nonenzyme-inducing AEDs in order to avoid hepatic enzyme induction, and the use of enzyme-inducing AEDs (including phenytoin, phenobarbitone, carbamazepine, and primidone) is discouraged.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111434367">7</xref>
</sup> These agents induce the cytochrome p450 pathway and may decrease the effectiveness of corticosteroids and chemotherapies.</p>
<p>As corticosteroids are used in almost all patients with brain tumors at some stage during their illness it is important to consider potential interactions between AEDs and corticosteroids in order to avoid causing interactions that may increase a patient’s risk of further seizures. Phenytoin induces the hepatic metabolism of dexamethasone, significantly reducing its half-life and bioavailability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111434367">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111434367">15</xref>
</sup> Conversely, dexamethasone induction of these cytochrome p450 enzymes may reduce serum phenytoin levels, potentially compromising seizure control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111434367">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Physicians should also be aware of potential drug interactions between AEDs and commonly used medications including benzodiazepines, antacids, antibiotics, and antifungal agents. Interactions also exist between AEDs and other AEDs. Three patients in our study were on combination AEDs: phenytoin–levetiracetam and phenytoin–valproic acid. The combination of phenytoin and valproic acid can lead to phenytoin toxicity due to displacement from binding and also due to decreased metabolism. These potential AED-AED interactions must also be taken into consideration if a patient is to be commenced on combination therapy. Patients’ quality of life can be significantly improved with better seizure control and from the use of AEDs with a better adverse-effect profile.</p>
<p>Regular follow-up of this patient cohort is necessary for many reasons: to ensure compliance with medications, monitoring of drug levels if appropriate, biochemical monitoring (full blood count and renal and liver function), assessment of medication adverse-effects, monitoring of the psychosocial aspects of their disorder (ie, driving restrictions), and monitoring of the psychological aspects, such as disturbances in mood.</p>
<p>The treatment of seizures in patients with brain tumors requires a multidisciplinary individualized approach that not only involves the use of AEDs but also gives consideration to other disciplines such as neurosurgery, medical oncology, radiation oncology, neurology, and the patient’s own general practitioner (GP). Ownership of this important group of patients is required in order to ensure optimum patient management, but with which of these disciplines should the primary responsibility lie? No consensus exists on this matter and thus this remains to be clarified.</p>
<p>Some limitations of our study include the fact that it is a retrospective study thus making it difficult to accurately assess the data. Another limitation is that the study is not inclusive of all high-grade brain tumors treated in our institution during the defined study period. It merely reflects the patients with high-grade CNS tumors referred to and managed by the specialist palliative medicine service during this time period. We also acknowledge that the numbers in our study are small. Nonetheless we feel that this study highlights a very important finding and focuses on a much neglected area.</p>
<p>At present there are few robust data for the appropriate management of seizures in patients with brain tumors. No specific guidelines exist. Further studies with the newer antiepileptic agents in people with cancer may help clarify their safety and efficacy in this population and thus guide the physician in this complex area in order to determine the optimal regimens for this important patient cohort.</p>
