<p>A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>1</sub>AR) activation within the central nervous system induces torpor, but in obligate hibernators such as the arctic ground squirrel (AGS; <italic>Urocitellus parryii</italic>), A<sub>1</sub>AR stimulation induces torpor only during the hibernation season, suggesting a seasonal increase in sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling. The purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship between body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) and sensitivity to an adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist in AGS. We tested the hypothesis that increased sensitivity in A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling would lead to lower T<sub>b</sub> in euthermic animals during the hibernation season when compared with the summer season. We further predicted that if a decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> reflects increased sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR activation, then it should likewise predict spontaneous torpor. We used subcutaneous IPTT-300 transponders to monitor T<sub>b</sub> in AGS housed under constant ambient conditions (12:12 L:D, 18 °C) for up to 16 months. These animals displayed an obvious rhythm in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> that cycled with a period of approximately 8 months. Synchrony in the T<sub>b</sub> rhythm within the group was lost after several months of constant L:D conditions; however, individual rhythms in T<sub>b</sub> continued to show clear sine wave–like waxing and waning. AGS displayed spontaneous torpor only during troughs in euthermic T<sub>b</sub>. To assess sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR activation, AGS were administered the A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist N<sup>6</sup>-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA, 0.1 mg/kg, ip), and subcutaneous T<sub>b</sub> was monitored. AGS administered CHA during a seasonal minimum in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> showed a greater drug-induced decrease in T<sub>b</sub> (1.6 ± 0.3 °C) than did AGS administered CHA during a peak in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> (0.4 ± 0.3 °C). These results provide evidence for a circannual rhythm in T<sub>b</sub> that is associated with increased sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling and correlates with the onset of torpor.</p>

<p>Hibernation is an adaptation of energy conservation that in the arctic ground squirrel (AGS, <italic>Urocitellus parryii</italic>) is expressed according to a robust circannual rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748730413490667">Sheriff et al., 2011</xref>). We and others have found that stimulation of A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptors (A<sub>1</sub>AR) within the central nervous system induces torpor onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730413490667">Tamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730413490667">Iliff and Swoap, 2012</xref>). We also found that in AGS, A<sub>1</sub>AR activation induces torpor only during the hibernation season. This finding suggests that a seasonal increase in sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling underlies the transition into the hibernation phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2011</xref>). Because stimulation of A<sub>1</sub>AR decreases body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) in nonhibernating species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748730413490667">Anderson et al., 1994</xref>), we hypothesized that a seasonal increase in sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR would lead to lower T<sub>b</sub> in nontorpid animals. A decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> precedes onset of torpor in free-ranging AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730413490667">Sheriff et al., 2012</xref>), and torpor expression is preceded by a decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> and metabolic rate in other hibernating species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730413490667">Arai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730413490667">Levesque and Tattersall, 2010</xref>). Tonic A<sub>1</sub>AR activation maintains T<sub>b</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748730413490667">Barros et al., 2006</xref>), and in rats fed a restricted diet a lower T<sub>b</sub> predicts increased sensitivity to an A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, T<sub>b</sub> in euthermic AGS at rest may reflect sensitivity in A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling and be functionally linked to seasonal expression of the hibernation phenotype.</p>
<p>Here we test the hypotheses that euthermic T<sub>b</sub> in AGS decreases during the hibernation season and that a decrease in daily euthermic T<sub>b</sub> reflects increased sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR activation and predicts torpor onset. We monitored T<sub>b</sub> and spontaneous torpor in AGS housed at an ambient temperature of 18 °C throughout an 18-month period. Animals displayed an apparent circannual rhythm in nontorpid (euthermic) T<sub>b</sub> where the hibernation season, indicated by spontaneous torpor in AGS housed, was noted by troughs in euthermic T<sub>b</sub>. We tested A<sub>1</sub>AR sensitivity by administering an A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist during the highs and lows in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> and found that animals in a T<sub>b</sub> trough displayed greater A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist sensitivity. We also monitored food intake.</p>

<title>Body Temperature and Food Intake Monitoring</title>
<p>Procedures were approved by the UAF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Arctic ground squirrels (AGS; <italic>Urocitellus parryii</italic>) were captured near 66°38′N, 149°38′W under permit from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. AGS were housed individually at an ambient temperature of 18 °C on a 12:12 L:D cycle and fed rodent chow ad libitum. To monitor T<sub>b</sub>, IPTT-300 transponders (Bio Medic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford DE; calibrated at 30 °C with an accuracy of ±0.5 °C between 24 and 40 °C) were inserted between the scapulae. Others have shown these transponders to provide reliable data (±0.6 °C) over subcutaneous temperature of 21.4 to 36.9 °C in small mammals that do not vary with ambient temperature and indicate when animals are torpid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748730413490667">Wacker et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Subcutaneous T<sub>b</sub> was measured between 1030 and 1130 h daily in a total of 24 AGS (12 male and 12 female); 16 AGS were monitored for 16 months from 24 September 2008 until 1 February 2010, and 8 AGS were monitored for 9 to 13 months beginning on 24 September 2008. Animals were noted to be torpid if they were unresponsive to touch and displayed a T<sub>b</sub> less than 30 °C. Daily mass of food intake was measured from 2 June 2009 to 18 December 2009 in 16 of the 24 AGS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0748730413490667">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>Seasonal changes in T<sub>b</sub> and food intake were monitored as described above. To determine whether seasonal lows in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> predicted increased sensitivity to T<sub>b</sub>-lowering effects of A<sub>1</sub>AR activation, the A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist N<sup>6</sup>-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) or vehicle (phosphate buffered saline [PBS]) was administered to 22 AGS on 2 separate occasions.</p>
<p>AGS were handled and weighed the day before treatment. This handling induced arousal if animals were torpid. CHA was dissolved in PBS and filtered through 0.22-µm syringe filters into a sterile BD vacutainer. Baseline T<sub>b</sub> was collected for 1 h before the drug was administered. CHA (0.1 mg/kg, ip) or vehicle (PBS) was injected using 25-gauge, 1.5-inch needles. T<sub>b</sub> was recorded every 30 min for 4 h following the injection and again at 24 h post injection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0748730413490667">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Seasonal fluctuation in T<sub>b</sub> and food intake was assessed as present or absent from graphs of individual animals. In cases where a rhythm was evident during the 6-month observation period in both T<sub>b</sub> and food intake, the temporal relationship between the waxing and waning of T<sub>b</sub> and that of food intake varied. In some animals T<sub>b</sub> decreased before food intake, and in others T<sub>b</sub> and food intake decreased at approximately the same time. No animals showed a clear decrease in food intake before a decrease in T<sub>b</sub>. We compared the frequency of animals that decreased T<sub>b</sub> before or at approximately the same time as food intake to an expected random (50-50) distribution using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test.</p>
<p>Each individual animal’s euthermic T<sub>b</sub> cycle was assessed and the position assigned as a trough, a peak, or an intermediate position by a person unaware of the drug response. A 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare drug-induced change in T<sub>b</sub> between AGS tested during a trough and those animals tested during a peak in T<sub>b</sub>. Regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between euthermic T<sub>b</sub> and magnitude of drug response in all animals tested (MSExcel). Significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Data shown are mean ± SEM.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All 24 animals showed a waxing and waning in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> that ranged between 30 and 40 °C and fluctuated with a circannual period between 7 and 9 months. Group synchrony was noted in the rhythm during the first 8 months but was lost in later months. T<sub>b</sub> rhythms for individual animals persisted under constant L:D conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413490667">Fig. 1</xref>). Torpor, illustrated by a precipitous drop in T<sub>b</sub>, was observed only during troughs in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748730413490667">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To test the hypothesis that a decrease in food intake produced the decrease in T<sub>b</sub>, as described for rats fed a restricted diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2010</xref>), we compared the temporal patterns of food intake and T<sub>b</sub>. Food intake varied between 0 and 80 g/day, including days when animals were torpid. None of the AGS showed a decrease in food intake that preceded a decrease in T<sub>b</sub>. Fourteen of the 16 AGS showed a clear waxing and waning in food intake and T<sub>b</sub> during the 6-month monitoring period. In 6 of these 14 AGS, T<sub>b</sub> began to decrease before food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413490667">Fig. 2B</xref>), and in 7 of these 14 AGS, T<sub>b</sub> and food intake decreased at about the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748730413490667">Fig. 2A</xref>). The distribution of occasions when food intake decreased (1) before T<sub>b</sub> decreased, or (2) after or at the same time as T<sub>b</sub> decreased, was different from an expected 50:50 distribution χ<sup>2</sup>(1,14) = 0.0002].</p>

<p>AGS tested with the A<sub>1</sub>AR agonist CHA during their trough in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> showed a greater decrease in T<sub>b</sub> (1.6 ± 0.3 °C) than AGS tested during their peak in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> (0.4 ± 0.3 °C; <italic>t</italic> test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 trough vs. peak, <italic>n</italic> = 6 CHA tests during a trough and 6 tests during a peak in a total of 8 AGS; 4 males and 4 females).

Regression analysis of euthermic T<sub>b</sub> and CHA-induced change in T<sub>b</sub> in all animals tested with CHA (<italic>n</italic> = 22) was not statistically significant. By contrast, the position within an individual animal’s rhythm in T<sub>b</sub> predicted response to CHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0748730413490667">Fig. 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hibernation is a robust seasonal phenomenon, but mechanisms that regulate the transition into the hibernation phenotype displayed during the hibernation season are poorly understood. A<sub>1</sub>AR activation within the central nervous system is necessary and sufficient to induce torpor in AGS and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748730413490667">Tamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748730413490667">Iliff and Swoap, 2012</xref>). However, in AGS, stimulating A<sub>1</sub>AR induces torpor only during the hibernation season, indicating that a higher order of regulation controls the ability of adenosine to induce torpor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2011</xref>). Our results support the hypothesis that this higher order of regulation involves increased sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR-induced cooling. We show that a seasonal minimum in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> reflects increased sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR-induced cooling that waxes and wanes between the summer and the hibernation seasons. This seasonal rhythm in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> predicts and is fundamental to the expression of spontaneous torpor.</p>
<p>Field data collected using data loggers implanted in the abdominal cavity in the fall and retrieved in the spring show a decrease in core T<sub>b</sub> to 34 to 35 °C beginning 45 days prior to entrance into the first torpor bout. Body temperature during interbout arousals does not exceed this lowered basal temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730413490667">Sheriff et al., 2012</xref>). A decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> precedes onset of torpor in other hibernating species as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748730413490667">Arai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748730413490667">Levesque and Tattersall, 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, predrug body temperature in CHA-treated AGS in summer and winter was similar and did not predict CHA-induced torpor. This may be because baseline T<sub>b</sub> prior to CHA administration did not accurately reflect T<sub>b</sub> of animals at rest. Although animals were administered CHA at the same time each day, handling and movement from the home cage to the test cage likely resulted in an increase in activity and predrug T<sub>b</sub>.</p>
<p>A seasonal increase in sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling may underlie seasonal rhythms in sleep drive as well as T<sub>b</sub>. The seasonal decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> reported here coincides with a seasonal increase in sleep duration observed in ground squirrels housed under conditions similar to the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730413490667">Walker et al., 1980</xref>). Hibernation is an extension of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748730413490667">Walker et al., 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748730413490667">1979</xref>), where homeostatic sleep drive is mediated in part through the activation of A<sub>1</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748730413490667">Benington et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748730413490667">Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997</xref>). Golden mantled ground squirrels sleep more during the hibernation season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748730413490667">Walker et al., 1980</xref>), and sleep is associated with lower euthermic T<sub>b</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748730413490667">Berger and Phillips, 1988</xref>). Indeed, the lower euthermic T<sub>b</sub> noted in the present study could be due to the animals sleeping.</p>
<p>The gradual transition into the hibernation season is consistent with a gradual decrease in the irritability of hibernating animals as the hibernation season progresses and a gradual increase in irritability as spring approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748730413490667">Twente and Twente, 1968</xref>). Waxing and waning in the sensitivity to A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling were expected based on the observed gradual increase in the effectiveness of CHA to induce torpor in the midhibernation season compared with the early hibernation season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it was surprising to see the period in T<sub>b</sub> rhythm decrease under constant L:D conditions, the results are consistent with shortening of circannual rhythm period in spontaneous torpor that we have noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2011</xref>). Constant daylight is known to phase advance the circannual cycle of obligate hibernators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748730413490667">Pengelley et al., 1976</xref>). In the present study, group synchrony in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> rhythm subsided while individual euthermic T<sub>b</sub> began to free-run on a 7- to 9-month cycle. The rhythm was clearly associated with the hibernation season since animals displayed torpor only during troughs in T<sub>b</sub>. These observations are consistent with other observations of circannual rhythms in captive ground squirrels housed under constant L:D conditions where the circannual cycle persists but begins to free-run, that is, oscillate on a cycle slightly shorter than 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748730413490667">Lee and Zucker, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748730413490667">Hiebert et al., 2000</xref>). Surprisingly, absolute euthermic T<sub>b</sub> did not predict the magnitude of response to CHA except in animals expressing a maximum or minimum in euthermic T<sub>b</sub>. If altered sensitivity in A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling leads to a gradual decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> and seasonal torpor, we would expect to see a correlation between T<sub>b</sub> and the magnitude of response to CHA. The lack of a statistically significant correlation in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> and response to CHA could be due to the relatively small sample size studied and other factors that influence T<sub>b</sub>.</p>
<p>Euthermic T<sub>b</sub> is lower during interbout arousal than during summer euthermy in free-living as well as captive AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730413490667">Barnes, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730413490667">Karpovich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748730413490667">Sheriff et al., 2012</xref>). However, the gradual waxing and waning in T<sub>b</sub> are not evident in AGS housed under natural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748730413490667">Barnes, 1989</xref>). Rather, T<sub>b</sub> during interbout arousal remains at about 35 °C throughout the hibernation season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748730413490667">Karpovich et al., 2009</xref>). The range of euthermic T<sub>b</sub> in this study was greater than the range of euthermic T<sub>b</sub> reported in free-living AGS during the summer season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730413490667">Williams et al., 2012b</xref>). Although the T<sub>b</sub> highs near 40 °C are similar to field data, lows near 30 °C are lower than T<sub>b</sub> of summer, free-living AGS. We expect that in free-living animals, ambient temperatures near 0 °C promote onset of torpor so that circannual fluctuation in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> is masked by torpid T<sub>b</sub>.</p>
<p>Daily T<sub>b</sub> readings did not allow for analysis of circadian variation in T<sub>b</sub>, so it remains unclear whether circannual rhythm in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> reflects a vertical shift in the entire circadian T<sub>b</sub> curve and thus a decrease in maximum and minimum T<sub>b</sub> or a change in the amplitude of the T<sub>b</sub> rhythm. Daily T<sub>b</sub> readings also cannot rule out the possibility that a circannual influence on the period of the circadian T<sub>b</sub> rhythm explains the seasonal fluctuation in daily measures of T<sub>b</sub>. In free-living AGS, body temperature rhythms persist during the summer season but are not detected during hibernation at T<sub>b</sub> near 0 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730413490667">Williams et al., 2012a</xref>). Diurnal T<sub>b</sub> rhythms in AGS entrain to approximately 24-h periods in fall and spring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748730413490667">Williams et al., 2012b</xref>) and a period of 24-h persists throughout the summer season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748730413490667">Williams et al., 2012a</xref>). Since it is not clear what AGS entrain to under the midnight sun and since AGS in the present study were housed at constant 12:12 L:D and ambient temperature, it is difficult to extrapolate between these observations and observations made in free-living AGS.</p>
<p>A decrease in T<sub>b</sub> was found to precede or decline at the same time as the decrease in food intake. These results do not support our original hypothesis that voluntary dietary restriction prior to onset of torpor increases the response to CHA. Instead, they suggest that lower T<sub>b</sub> may reflect a seasonal decrease in thermogenesis and thus metabolic rate that leads to, or is associated with, a decrease in food intake. Thus, it appears that the mechanism regulating seasonal fluctuation in T<sub>b</sub> in AGS differs from the mechanism that sensitizes A<sub>1</sub>AR during dietary restriction in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748730413490667">Jinka et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present results suggest that an increase in sensitivity of A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling is correlated with a decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> and predicts torpor onset. This finding is significant because a seasonal rhythm in A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling represents a molecular mechanism that, in part, defines the hibernation season. More work will be required to determine the molecular basis of the seasonal fluctuation in A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling to determine where in the brain changes occur, whether changes occur in extracellular levels of adenosine and/or at the receptor level, and what processes underlie these changes. Whether the decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> reflects an increase in sleep remains to be determined, but both sleep and T<sub>b</sub> likely result from increased sensitivity in A<sub>1</sub>AR signaling. The ability of a decrease in euthermic T<sub>b</sub> to predict the onset of the hibernation season is also significant because secondary influences of torpor confound interpretation of seasonal differences in gene and protein expression.</p>
