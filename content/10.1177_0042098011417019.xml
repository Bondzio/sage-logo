<abstract>
<p>Questions of property rights are central to the organisation of urban space yet remain weakly theorised in the context of sexuality. Tracing battles over spaces of commercial sex in inner Sydney, this paper argues that particular claims to privacy and property underpin exclusionary actions restricting the boundaries of sexual citizenship. However, the paper also notes the potential for the emergence of ‘sexual commons’ where claims to an enhanced notion of sexual citizenship can be made. The paper concludes that property rights consist of overlapping and complex claims to space in which questions of sexuality and the sanctity of family life are often brought to the fore. In arguing this, the paper demonstrates that property rights constitute a key mechanism in the management and regulation of the (nocturnal) city.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While the Western city has long been recognised as a space of sexual experimentation, radicalism and freedom, urban authorities have typically sought to govern sexual conduct through a range of legal and administrative instruments enacted by state agents such as the police, the judiciary, medical officials, planners and licensing officers. Collectively, such instruments have endeavoured to make clear demarcations between appropriate and inappropriate sexual practice, often layering these distinctions with understandings of where and when specific sexual acts are permissible, constructing a veritable moral geography. Sexual identities and behaviours are hence construed and regulated within the overlapping complexity of such geographies, with the striation of the city into legally defined realms (for example, the home, the street, the neighbourhood) attaching moral and legal values to particular sexual practices and identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011417019">Hubbard <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite much scholarship on sexuality still treating the city as a backdrop rather than an active agent in the making of our sexual lives, recent research has begun to foreground the importance of such processes of urban ordering including policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011417019">McGhee and Moran, 1998</xref>), licensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011417019">Hubbard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>) and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011417019">Godden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417019">Prior, 2008</xref>). Whilst property rights are another key mechanism that contributes to the management of urban space, little, if anything, has been said about how property rights are used to manage the spatiality of sexual practices. More widely, this reflects a neglect of property within the social sciences and a (misjudged) acceptance that the rights to enjoy, develop and protect one’s own property follow, logically, from ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011417019">Blomley, 2005</xref>). If we consider property as a relational social practice in which rights are contested, then it is clear that property is an iterative realm of political practice integral to the making of urban space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011417019">Cooper, 2007</xref>). In this sense, urban space does not simply divide up into ‘private’ and ‘public’ spaces, the values of each having been legally pre-determined; rather, people make claims to property in incredibly varied, overlapping and often collectively oriented ways, meaning that ‘the commons’ (i.e. land and environmental resources used collectively by communities) are still very much with us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011417019">Blomley, 2005</xref>, p.127).</p>
<p>Focusing on inner Sydney, this paper investigates the relationship between sex and property rights in the city by highlighting the territorial claims of different constituencies to spaces within the suburbs of East Sydney, Darlinghurst, Potts Point (which includes Kings Cross) and Woolloomooloo. These areas have a history of street-based sex work spanning over 100 years and a high concentration of sex industry premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417019">Perkins, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011417019">Frances, 2007</xref>). These diverse premises exercise considerable influence over the character of these neighbourhoods, with the character and use of inner Sydney streets changing considerably at dusk as sex industry premises open and sex workers emerge onto the streets. Sex-on-premises venues and sex entertainment sites are also predominantly used at night (although they are also an all-day affair at weekends). At such times, street-based sex work and sex premises compete with multiple stakeholders—including residents, other commercial establishments and institutions, such as churches and schools—for a finite number of property objects in both the commons and private space.</p>
<p>Drawing on emerging theoretical frameworks that insist property rights analyses address property’s relational social, economic, environmental and cultural dimensions (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011417019">Arnold, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417019">von Benda-Beckmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), this paper shows that claims to property are made simultaneously at the level of ideology (i.e. cultural assumptions about the nature of property), the level of legislation (i.e. the legal consolidation of those assumptions) and the concrete level of practice (i.e. the enactment and contestation of legality). It accordingly uncovers the complex constellation of relations that has resulted in the current landscape of property rights related to commercial sex in inner Sydney, a landscape that is as much a result of the territorial battles that unfold between sex commerce and residents within the streets of East Sydney as it is the outcome of battles played out in the courtroom.</p>

<title>No Claim to Property? Sex Work in the City</title>
<p>Within Western cities, the sex industry has long been figured as standing at the boundary between sexualities that are considered good, healthy and normal, and those that are not. Such distinctions are inherently spatialised in the sense that the state and law set limits on where commercial sex can be accommodated within the city, often justifying this in terms of the amenity impacts or the secondary effects associated with such land use. Although appearing divorced from moral considerations, planning and environmental decisions about what types of commercial sex are allowed to occupy specific spaces inevitably privilege particular sexual practices at the expense of others</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>signify[ing] which … are virtuous and useful, which are … dangerous and inadequate, [and] which … will be rewarded and which penalised through governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417019">Kerkin, 2004</xref>, p. 185).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Indeed, it has been repeatedly argued that the spatialised discourses of planning and urban ordering have tended to privilege heterosexual, monogamous relationships, with this particularly manifest in landscapes which normalise the heterosexual family (for example, through the design and layout of residential neighbourhoods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011417019">Frisch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011417019">Gorman-Murray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011417019">Hubbard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). Yet these discourses are not stable, with some sexual identities and practices situated at the borders of acceptability having become more mainstream and ‘normal’ over time: for example, the emergence of prominent areas of gay commerce has been identified as evidence of homonormative planning practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011417019">Bell and Binnie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098011417019">Sibalis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011417019">Brown, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This flux is also evidenced in the effective decriminalisation of many forms of prostitution and its increasing recognition as ‘sex work’ within the ‘adult entertainment’ industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417019">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Since the emergence of medico-moral codes and discourses suggesting that the sexualised and undressed body is something that affronts both public health and morality when encountered in public view, commercial sex has been the source of much social anxiety. At the same time, however, sex work and commercial sexual exchange have remained valued and sought-after, meaning that spaces have effectively been created where sex can be bought and sold, within limits. We refer to these sites as ‘sex industry commons’. The notion of the commons is adopted here because of the semi-public to public nature of the sex industry; that is to say, the role that the sex industry plays in creating forums within which people can experience or purchase sexual services via consensual, contractual arrangements. Whilst some sex industry commons have the broadest of public access, the majority have some degree of restricted access. This is, in part, to ensure that these spaces provide safe and controlled spaces for sex, via an enclosure of the bodies of participants within a space subject to forms of surveillance and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011417019">Godden, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Following Foucault, numerous scholars have identified the panoptic qualities of many spaces of commercial sex and have traced the instruments employed by agents of the state as they seek to police and monitor these sites as spaces of potential criminality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011417019">Corbin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011417019">Howell, 2009</xref>). Such enclosure fulfils dual purposes, as it is also an attempt to restrict access for those who might be offended by the sights and sounds of commercial sex or do not wish to participate. In most jurisdictions, there has been a clear anxiety to make such spaces off-limits to minors. Likewise, there have also been attempts to distance the sexual commons from specific cultural and religious groups who object to commercial sex on moral grounds (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417019">O’Neill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>, on different degrees of tolerance).</p>
<p>Within such constraints, the placement of sex work commons within cities has traditionally been controlled by the state and legislative framework in the interests of maintaining the social and economic value of particular land uses that might be adversely affected by the secondary impacts and negative externalities of sex premises. Sex work rarely equates to the ‘highest and best use of land’ and is hence something that is usually displaced by commercial and residential land use. Indeed, land used for commercial sex is often considered as land easily sacrificed to other possible land uses. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011417019">Papayanis (2000)</xref> has explored how sex shops were ‘zoned out’ of existence in Manhattan to allow for more profitable—or at least more corporate—land uses. In such cases, the loss of sex businesses is rarely discoursed as an economic or social loss <italic>per se</italic>, but as making the city safer, more commodious and family-friendly. In this case, commercial sex was depicted as an obstacle to consumer-fuelled regeneration, with the association made between ‘family’ consumption, residential land use and corporate gentrification widely noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011417019">Hubbard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011417019">Kerkin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098011417019">Sanchez, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This given, commercial sex often enjoys only a precarious position within contemporary property regimes, despite the evidential demand and supply of sex for sale in Western cities, past and present. However, this is beginning to change, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098011417019">Sullivan (2010)</xref>, for example, describing a ‘moderate opening’ in the space for legal sex work resulting from the activities of feminist movements arguing for legal change, the strength of sex worker advocacy groups and a liberal authoritarianism that increasingly regards sex workers and their clients as able to take some responsibility for self-governance (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417019">Sanders <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Commercial sex has begun to move from spaces of transient ownership (for example, in public parks and wasteland, pseudo-industrial districts and areas in transition) to more visible and commercial sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011417019">Ryder, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>While discourses of legitimacy and rights provide rationales for the territorialisation of commercial sexuality within urban contexts, the ability of authorities to make space for sex work depends on a complex assemblage of mechanisms (for example, planning, licensing, policing, social work) within which the regime of property rights predicates the institutional arrangements. Value and quality are located between the subject (the human being) and the object (the physical property/real estate). The right to property can hence be understood as one means through which human beings regulate their relationship with the objects they value. These are part of property relations that involve social units (for example, individuals, family, general publics or corporations), socially constructed property objects and the different sets of rights and obligations social units can have with respect to such objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417019">von Benda-Beckmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Western cities hence comprise a milieu of competing property rights, with the inevitable density of urban life meaning there are always conflicting demands and expectations on property objects such as streets, parks and buildings</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Property is the focus of struggle at all levels of social organisation, within and between families, communities, classes and states. The distribution of property objects has been contested throughout history, as have the legal property regimes themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417019">von Benda-Beckmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, p. 2).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This contested ‘web’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011417019">Arnold, 2002</xref>), ‘mosaic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011417019">Boydell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) or ‘constellation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417019">von Benda-Beckmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) of property rights, obligations and restrictions “cannot easily be captured in one-dimensional political, economic or legal models” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417019">von Benda-Beckmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>The analysis within this paper accordingly draws on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417019">von Benda-Beckmann <italic>et al.</italic> (2006)</xref> identification of three layers of property rights. The first layer consists of a consideration of the cultural norms and values (we might perhaps use the term ‘ideology’) which, in relation to sex premises and businesses, determines the property rights, obligations and restrictions that are generally considered to be appropriate for sex premises as, for example, distinct from residential properties.</p>
<p>The next layer of mapping consists of an analysis of the political and legal property rights regulations drawn up within specific jurisdictions (in this case, the City of Sydney Council, COS). This is the layer typically privileged in the economic and legal model of property rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011417019">Barzel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011417019">Bromley, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011417019">Cole and Grossman, 2002</xref>). Exploring this layer leads to the identification of emerging property rights for street-based sex workers and sex industry premises resulting from legislation implemented by the New South Wales government (for example, the <italic>Prostitution Act 1979, Prostitution Amendment Act 1983</italic> and <italic>Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995</italic>), which amended previous legislation that had effectively criminalised sex work in Sydney.</p>
<p>Finally, the case study explores the layer of ‘practice’: the concretised level where it is possible to explore how property “actually gets put to work in the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011417019">Blomley, 2005</xref>, p.127). The case study does this through an analysis of the sex industry’s presence within the inner Sydney suburbs. While street-based sex work occurs in a range of locations throughout New South Wales—including Canterbury Road, the Great Western Highway, Cabramatta, Port Kembla and Newcastle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011417019">COS, 2006b</xref>)—studies have found that the highest concentration of street-based sex workers is in the inner Sydney suburbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417019">Perkins, 1991</xref>). During the second half of the 20th century, inner Sydney also became recognised for its high concentration of adult entertainment and sex industry premises—primarily in the form of brothels, massage parlours, gay bathhouses and sex clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417019">Prior, 2008</xref>). These suburbs and the streets within them, perhaps more than any other area within Sydney, have attracted antagonism and conflict revolving around issues of property. Within this third layer of the analysis, we accordingly enter into the “relationships between actual property-holders with respect to concrete valuables” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011417019">von Benda-Beckmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>, p.19).</p>

<sec id="section3-0042098011417019">
<title>Legislating for Commercial Sex and Property Rights in NSW</title>
<p>The legislative and institutional framework that has governed how sex work is able to operate within the public and private property markets of Sydney and New South Wales has changed considerably since the 1970s. The two key legislative changes have been, first, the decriminalisation of solicitation for the purposes of prostitution in a public place via the <italic>Prostitution Act 1979</italic> (and subsequent amendments) and, secondly, the dismantling of criminal legalisation surrounding brothels via the <italic>Disorderly Houses Amendment Act</italic> 1995 (and subsequent amendments). These steps to remove criminal sanctions did not stem from any articulated free-market policies but rather from a concerted feminist campaign that suggested existing laws were outmoded and failing to protect female workers from violence at the hands of clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011417019">Frances and Gray, 2007</xref>). Influenced by arguments that sexual morality was a private matter and that it was not in the public interest to intervene in sex work markets where there was no nuisance caused, law-makers were also persuaded by arguments that criminal sanctions were actually responsible for the creation of many problems (for example, police corruption, the growth of organised crime).</p>
<p>The decriminalisation of street-based sex work in 1979 was introduced as part of wider public order reforms and presaged a period of unhindered right to solicit for sex work in public places—streets, parks, etc.—within New South Wales, recognising that street soliciting did not constitute ‘truly offensive behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011417019">Frances and Gray, 2007</xref>). This liberal period was short-lived, however, and in 1983 the <italic>Prostitution Act 1979</italic> was amended. Soliciting in a public street near a dwelling, school, church or hospital became an offence. In the Second Reading in NSW Parliament of the <italic>Prostitution (Amendment) Bill 1983</italic>, it was stated that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The aim of this legislation is to ensure that persons who reside in basically residential areas are not subjected to the flagrant and unseemly aspects of prostitution, which cause severe inconvenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098011417019">Walker, 1983</xref>, p. 5244).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The purpose of this amendment was to contain soliciting to areas that would not cause annoyance to residents or sensitive uses. Among the key drivers for this shift in legislation, as we will discuss in the next section, was the tension and conflicts that emerged in public streets between sex workers and residents within the inner Sydney areas of Darlinghurst and East Sydney. In 1988, the <italic>Prostitution Act 1979</italic> was repealed and replaced with the <italic>Summary Offences Act 1988</italic>. The new solicitation offences were very similar to those in the previously amended Prostitution Act; solicitation remained prohibited near a dwelling, school, church or hospital, although the scope of the prohibition was widened to ‘within view’. Significantly, legal definitions of soliciting referred to both sex workers and their clients.</p>
<p>In 1995, the <italic>Disorderly Houses Amendment Act</italic> removed that part of the <italic>Disorderly Houses Act 1943</italic> (called the <italic>Restricted Premises Act 1943</italic> from 2003 onwards) which made it a criminal office to operate a brothel or other commercial sex on premises venues. Records of the parliamentary debates leading up to the amendment of the Act show that decriminalisation of brothels was preferred over other models such as legalisation, registration and licensing. Under decriminalisation, it was thought that existing laws regulating businesses (for example, environmental health and taxation laws) were sufficient to regulate brothels. The amending legislation removed the prohibition on private property being used as a brothel within NSW and gave local councils power to regulate brothels through their plan-making powers, governed by the <italic>Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)</italic>. This served as a catalyst throughout the following decade for the development of a myriad of Local Environmental Plans (LEPs) and Policies and Development Control Plans (DCPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011417019">Ratcliff, 1999</xref>) that provided guidelines on where brothels could be placed within particular local government areas. General planning principles for brothels (and sex industry premises more generally) are set out in section 17 of the <italic>Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995</italic>, which provides the grounds upon which councils may make an application to the NSW Land and Environment Court to close a sex industry premise. The majority of the grounds (s.17(5)(b–g)) are consistent with relevant considerations specified in s.79(c) of the <italic>Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979</italic> about amenity impacts. In addition, the Act imports a consideration borrowed from the legislation that was developed for the placement of sex work within Sydney in 1983 and 1988. Under s.17(5)(a) of the <italic>Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995</italic> a brothel can be closed if it is operating “near or within view from a church, hospital, school or any place regularly frequented by children for recreational or cultural activities”. In 2007, the <italic>Brothels Legislation Amendment Act 2007</italic> was introduced to amend the <italic>Restricted Premises Act 1943</italic> (formerly called <italic>the Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995</italic>) to provide local councils within NSW with more power to identify and shut down unauthorised brothels and to widen the base for amenity-based complaints.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the <italic>Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995</italic>, approximately half the councils in NSW have developed planning principles that are specific to brothels. A small number of councils including South Sydney City Council (SSCC) (which was amalgamated in the COS in 2004) and the COS, have produced development control plans that move beyond the placement of brothels to address a diversity of sex industry premises types (such as ‘restricted premises’ selling pornographic books and materials). Many of the councils that developed planning principles for brothels were guided by a 1996 NSW government directive that told councils they could not ban brothels outright, but could restrict them to industrial zones. This enabled these councils effectively to make sex premises in residential and commercial areas unlawful.</p>
<p>Hence, whilst legislative reform in NSW paved the way for both public and private property to be legally used for selling sex, prohibitions placed limits on the locations that could be used. This particularly impacted on densely populated parts of the state such as inner Sydney, where there are few areas not in view or near to schools, churches, hospitals and other such establishments. Nevertheless, the state and legislative framework has allowed the sex industry to develop new formal relationships to the broad spectrum of public and private property within New South Wales. Solicitation for street-based sex work is no longer prohibited in the commons and sex industry premises have become a legitimate use for private commercial property subject to local council development approval. Whilst blanket prohibitions have been removed, prohibitions still exist around their placement near sensitive land uses. These prohibitions reinforce a long-running perception that sex work adversely affects and impacts on vulnerable members of local communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417019">O’Neill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). As will be discussed in the next section, the fraught definition of when sex work is ‘near’ or in ‘view of’ sensitive uses has made the use of much public and private property for commercial sex hotly contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417019">Roxburgh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011417019">COS, 2006b</xref>).</p>

<title>Property-holders Contesting the Place of Sex Work</title>
<p>While reform in New South Wales gave the sex industry certain rights to the city, when these rights were put into practice these often resulted in contestation over the use and occupation of space. Responding to the perceived and real impact of sex work on other property-owners (such as private residents), local councils developed a unique set of planning policies and controls. These formal policies and informal institutional arrangements about property rights effectively bridged the structured property rights promulgated within NSW legislation and the concrete reality of the competition for the use and control of limited property assets within the inner city. Involving residents and resident groups, police, local councils, the sex industry and sex workers themselves, this competition for property is often far from convivial.</p>
<sec id="section5-0042098011417019">
<title>Disputing Street Sex Work</title>
<p>Whilst sex work occurs mainly off-street, with just 2  per cent of New South Wales’ 10 000 or so sex workers estimated to be in street-based sex work, the explicit and visible nature of street-based sex work makes it the obvious target of much contestation. This is nowhere more apparent in NSW than in the suburbs of East Sydney, Darlinghurst, Potts Point (which includes Kings Cross) and Woolloomooloo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011417019">Figure 1</xref>), where the long-established presence of sex work has led it to have some degree of tolerance among local long-term residents. Yet almost immediately after sex workers were provided with new rights in 1979 to solicit openly for work on the streets, territorial confrontations over the public streets began to emerge between sex workers and local residents, with conflicting views emerging on the impact of the new rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011417019">Parliament of New South Wales, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417019">Perkins, 1991</xref>). The expansion of street sex-based work into the Forbes and Liverpool Street areas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011417019">Figure 1</xref>) in the 1980s prompted campaigns of local opposition from residents designed to ‘reclaim the streets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011417019">Frances and Gray, 2007</xref>). Some vocal resident groups blamed the relaxed controls for increased levels of traffic, the increasingly reckless disposal of needles in gutters, the use of laneways as places for sex, the verbal abuse of residents by sex workers, the frequent accosting of female residents by clients (who may wrongly assume that all females in the streets are sex workers), concern over the corruption of children and the threatening behaviour of voyeurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011417019">Parliament of New South Wales, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417019">Perkins, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The gentrification of the Inner East in the later decades of the 20th century appears to have increased levels of conflict between sex workers and residents, with more residents demanding that the area be ‘cleaned up’ and sex work relocated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011417019">Hilden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, p. 43). The street-based sex workers themselves took aim at the media, blaming the on-going media coverage for drawing voyeurs to the area. Whilst police during this period expressed their inability to assuage residents’ complaints, they resorted to other laws such as ‘obstructing traffic’ and ‘serious alarm and affront’ under the <italic>Offences in Public Places Act 1979</italic> as a means of managing street-based sex work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011417019">Parliament of New South Wales, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011417019">Perkins, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The combination of a successful campaign by the NSW police force and the cacophony of complaints that were emerging from vocal resident groups, clergy and others in Darlinghurst resulted in the aforementioned 1983 and 1988 amendments to the Prostitution Act 1979 that made soliciting illegal ‘near or within view’ from dwellings, schools, churches or hospitals. These new laws represented a compromise for the state government that was seeking to manage the perceived negative impacts of street-based sex work whilst retaining its liberal, pro-feminist stance. Yet without reform of off-street work, the changes in soliciting laws had somewhat predictable consequences, displacing sex workers from mainly residential spaces towards street-based ‘beats’ in more commercial districts such as William Street (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011417019">Figure 1</xref>). Whilst the shift of many of the sex workers into more commercial areas reduced the overall level of conflict within inner Sydney, the level of ambiguity emerging from the use of the terms ‘near’ and ‘within view’ meant that no clear understanding could be drawn about what constituted a legal territory within inner-city streets for street-based sex work (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011417019">Roxburgh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011417019">COS, 2006b</xref>). Indeed, some groups of residents such as the East Sydney Neighbourhood Association (ESNA) continued to press for the laws to be used to eradicate or relocate street-based sex work and ‘change any perceived culture of the area as a homeland for the sex industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011417019">ESNA, 2002</xref>). Supporting this, the East Sydney Neighbourhood Association argued that the prohibition of soliciting for prostitution ‘near or within view from a dwelling, school, church or hospital’ meant that “there is therefore no place in East Sydney where street prostitution is legal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011417019">ESNA, 2002</xref>). This position is extreme given that, in making the 1983 and 1988 amendments, it was clearly not the intention of Parliament to prohibit soliciting in all public areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011417019">Bligh and Rasaiah, 2001</xref>). Yet, for the ESNA, the amendments to the Prostitution Act 1979 clearly supported their presumption of territorial rights over sex workers in a battle for the public streets in inner Sydney, for, as one member of the ESNA noted</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s all about territory, and sex workers who work in the street, they honestly believe they have a <italic>right</italic> to be there, and they believe that we do not, or that we should at least make way for them. So it’s a sort of a psychological warfare if you like, over territory, and that itself is very wearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011417019">Carrick, 2002b</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These battles were not just limited to the written word but have manifest themselves often violently within physical confrontations in the streetscape of inner Sydney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011417019">Hilden <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, p. 43). For example, one campaign by ESNA against the presence of sex workers on residential streets resulted in an altercation between sex workers and local residents where assault charges were laid against a sex worker and police investigated allegations against two ESNA members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011417019">Carrick, 2002b</xref>). This altercation reflected ESNA’s position that “street sex worker[s] have developed an unfounded sense of ‘territory’ … The residents are now reclaiming the streets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011417019">ESNA, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the on-going confusion and discrepancy about what is meant by such terms as ‘near or within view’, the Kings Cross Police, COS Council (which previously included South Sydney Council), the Kings Cross Chamber of Commerce and advocates of the sex industry identified precincts as designated areas for solicitation activities associated with street-based sex work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011417019">COS, 2006b</xref>). Designated areas (or ‘preferred areas’ as they were also known—see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011417019">Figure 1</xref>) were first identified by the on-street prostitution Working Party in 1992 and included commercial parts of Darlinghurst Road and William Street (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011417019">Street-based Sex Work Strategy Working Party, 2006</xref>, p. 4).</p>

<p>By 2002, the SSCC Street Prostitution Working Group had considered 13 alternative inner-city sites, but concluded that none satisfied both amenity and safety concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011417019">Street-based Sex Work Strategy Working Party, 2006</xref>, p. 7). Hence, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011417019">2006</xref> legal and preferred areas were identified that were consistent with the 1992 designated areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011417019">Street-based Sex Work Strategy Working Party, 2006</xref>, p. 4). Like the unofficial toleration zones that existed at the time in England and Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098011417019">Sanders and Campbell, 2007</xref>) or the <italic>tippelzones</italic> in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011417019">Campbell and van Doorninck, 2006</xref>), these designated areas were not officially recognised but were informal institutional arrangements that comprised part of a memorandum of agreement between different members of the working party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011417019">COS, 2006b</xref>). Research indicates that street-based sex workers in Sydney are generally aware of these locations and, in one study, workers indicated that they actively sought to work in designated areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011417019">COS, 2006b</xref>). The designated areas can be thus understood as a type of commons in the classic sense of being open for general public use.</p>
<p>In addition to the creation of designated areas, councils sought to use traffic management (including road closures), parking controls, street lighting and urban design to prevent street-based sex workers from using areas outside the designated locations for solicitation. There was a diversity of opinions among residents about the effectiveness of road closures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011417019">Lowman, 1992</xref>, on the UK experience). In submissions on the issue to council some residents thought that the road closures had improved the area and made it safer, while others contended that the visible presence of sex workers on the street actually increased safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011417019">COS, 2002a</xref>). Irrespective, the majority of residents reported a decrease in street-based sex work activity in the road closure areas and a relocation of these activities to other nearby streets. In addition, a number of related problems were raised including accessing businesses in closed streets and the loss of parking amenity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011417019">COS, 2002b</xref>).</p>

<title>Sex Industry Premises and the Kings Cross Precinct</title>
<p>In contrast to those local councils within NSW that have used planning directives effectively to exclude brothels and other sex industry premises, SSCC and the COS have promoted the development of a legal and safe sex industry through planning instruments and policies. For example, between 1998 and 2000, SSCC developed not just a brothel policy but a sex industry policy that addressed the placement of the broad gamut of sex industry premises types, creating “planning guidelines and assessment criteria for their location, design and operation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011417019">SSCC, 2000</xref>, p. 2).</p>
<p>These guidelines were not developed in isolation from the council’s planning policies but rather through a collaborative, consultative and communicative process with the sex industry, local residents and businesses. For brevity, here we will briefly highlight this point through reference to the processes surrounding development applications made for one gay bathhouse—Bodyline Space and Sauna in inner Sydney in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417019">Prior, 2008</xref>). As with the case of the objections received for street-based sex work a decade earlier, residents objected to this business in the belief that both the venue and their clients would have negative impact on residential amenity. Submissions argued that clients would engage in anti-social behaviour, such as public urination and vomiting, as they entered or left the premises and “that they would attract gay-bashers to the area” (interview, council officer, City of Sydney, 2001). A few objections went so far as to proclaim that the gay bathhouse would attract persons with a criminal record and would increase crime in the area, affecting both commercial and residential properties. In light of these strong objections from local residents, the council denied consent for the development, only to have their decision overturned in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court, which declared that Bodyline Spa and Sauna provided an important service to the gay community within the surrounding environs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417019">Prior, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2000, SSCC adopted a broadened ‘<italic>Sex industry policy</italic>’. This policy adopted geographical restrictions reflected in the provisions of the <italic>Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995</italic>, requiring brothels and sex industry premises to be located at a distance from sensitive land uses such as day-care or child-minding centres, primary and secondary schools, churches, parks, playgrounds and any other place frequented by children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011417019">SSCC, 2000</xref>, p. 8). These spatial restrictions were also accompanied by guidelines about cumulative impact, reflecting the long-standing perception that the clustering of sex premises would undoubtedly adversely impact on economic, social and environmental amenity, and lead to the formation of red-light districts like Kings Cross. The planning formula for reducing cumulative impact required sex industry premises, such as gay bathhouses and brothels, to be a minimum of 75 metres apart (with the exception of the Kings Cross Precinct given its already saturated nature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011417019">SSCC, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Mapping Sexual Property Rights</title>
<p>What emerged out of the policies adopted in Sydney was a unique set of property rights creating a series of ‘sexualised commons’ with varying degrees of access ranging from unrestricted public access to private leasehold property with limited public access rights. The first type of sex industry commons identified in policy is the classic version of the commons, open for general public use. This is found in the designated street-soliciting zones as well as the recognition of Kings Cross as an historical precinct for the clustering of sex industry premises. Planning policy, in effect, formalised a previously informal institutional arrangement that had existed for half a century—that the Kings Cross precinct was a ‘toleration zone’ where sex industry premises could co-locate and operate. Whilst accepted as a commons in which sex industry premises could be clustered, the council sought to intervene in the commons management by “prevent[ing its] intensification” and prohibiting “spruikers”—persons located on the public way who seek to entice passers-by to enter a sex industry premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011417019">SSCC, 2000</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>In addition to these public commons, the remaining sexualised commons outlined in the council policy are what we refer to as privatised commons, which have either restricted access or entry via a fee, or both. One type of privatised sex industry commons identified within the policy is the ‘restricted premises’, set aside for public to access restricted sexual material. These commons have restricted access (it being clearly indicated that these premises are for adults only) or require an entry payment. A second type of privatised sex industry commons identified in the policy is the ‘brothel’, a category including both ‘commercial brothels’ and ‘local business brothels’. These privatised sexual commons provide access for clients to a closed market of sex workers who are either employed in-house or contracted to provide a service for a fee. Access to this type of sexual commons is restricted by the owner and/or staff. A third type of privatised sex industry commons identified by policy in Sydney is the ‘sex-on-premises venue’. These provide a sexual commons that has restricted access or requires an entry payment, and provides an opportunity for consensual sexual encounters with others (often strangers). To the extent that they provide a social space, they are a type of commons; however, the measure of their commonality is inversely related to the charge for access. There is a distinct difference between the consensual, unpaid nature of the sexual acts within these commons and the etiquette surrounding the commercial sexual transactions characteristic of a brothel. Sex-on-premises venues are privately leased or owned, and privately operated. These commons include gay saunas, backrooms, BDSM clubs and swingers’ clubs, which all provide privatised commons for consensual sexual acts between strangers.</p>
<p>A fourth type of privatised sex industry commons created by council policy is the ‘Safety House Brothel’. Safety House Brothels are premises that provide short-term room rental to the clients of sex workers for the provision of sexual services negotiated in the designated street spaces discussed in the previous section of this paper. These privatised commons operate with a manager and/or receptionist on duty to improve safety and security for both the sex workers and their clients. Safety House Brothels are located within close walking distance of the designated areas on William Street and Darlinghurst Road in inner Sydney (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011417019">Figure 1</xref>) and are recognised as the only commons of their type in the world that have been legally recognised by a Consent authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011417019">Carrick, 2002a</xref>). Safety House Brothels can be understood as the privatisation of part of the ‘tacit’ street-based sex worker commons that previously operated within inner Sydney. They are designed to displace the provision of sexual activity from the streets and cars where it impacted on the amenity of local residents, whilst offering a safer location for sex workers to provide their services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011417019">Carrick, 2002a</xref>). Safety House Brothels appear to be supported by the majority of local residents, although some groups such as the Eastern Sydney Neighbourhood Association contest their location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011417019">ESNA, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The combination of the Safety House Brothels and the designated areas on Darlinghurst Road and William Street make up what could be described as a local ecosystem of public and privatised sexualised commons, recognised and supported by local government. They evolved in response to both the rights of residents as well as the safety and rights of sex workers and their clients. These differ significantly from the <italic>tipplezones</italic> located in Dutch cities or the <italic>verrichtungsbox</italic> (performance boxes) established in Cologne, Germany, as a means of managing street-based sex work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011417019">Campbell and van Doorninck, 2006</xref>). This is because the sexualised commons of inner Sydney are an integral part of the existing commons of the city, and are not excluded to an isolated location as is the case with the <italic>tipplezones</italic> and <italic>verrichtungsbox</italic> mechanisms which locate sex work away from the city centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011417019">Brants, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098011417019">Street-based Sex Work Strategy Working Party, 2006</xref>, pp. 14–15).</p>
<p>With the amalgamation of SSCC and COS in 2004, the SSCC <italic>Sex industry policy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098011417019">2000</xref>) was absorbed into the COS’s <italic>Adult entertainment and sex industry premises development control plan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011417019">COS, 2006a</xref>). Yet the privatised commons identified within the new COS policy were not significantly different from those identified in the previous SSCC policy. The most noteworthy adaptation was to incorporate all adult entertainment and sex industry typologies into one policy. In this sense, the privatised commons identified in the previous policy as ‘restricted premises’ was expanded to include venues providing striptease and adult entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011417019">Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011417019">COS, 2006a</xref>). This is in line with policy shifts in other Western nations, where striptease and lap dancing premises are now rarely subject to use of police powers relating to obscenity or public decency, but are typically subject to planning and licensing powers which seek to control the location and visibility of ‘adult entertainment’ so that those who wish to avoid it can do so, but those who wish to access it can (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011417019">Hubbard <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Property rights are human constructs that provide structure to contemporary society, including matters of sexuality that, at first glance, appear to have little to do with questions of property. This paper shows that a complex constellation of property rights surrounds sex, the outcome of ideological shifts within Western cities concerning the nature of both sexuality and property as refracted through the intricacies of territorial conflicts between residents and sex businesses in particular neighbourhoods. Indeed, community protests against, and in opposition to, sex work premises remain widespread, triggered by perceived fears about the negative externalities associated with sexual commons, be they spaces of street sex work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011417019">O’Neill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), spaces of recreational sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011417019">Prior, 2008</xref>) or spaces of ‘adult entertainment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011417019">Hubbard <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Given that commercial sex is seldom identified as the ‘best’ possible use of land, such opposition is also associated with fears about declining property prices, which may be of major concern to those who have invested in given locales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011417019">Lindemann, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, we have used the example of Sydney to show how the state seeks to mediate such conflicts by guaranteeing the property rights of all parties via the legislative framework, so creating differential ‘rights to the city’ in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011417019">Mitchell, 2003</xref>). The connections between rights to the city and sexual rights are not merely imaginary, therefore, but concretised through legal and planning instruments. Hence, changing laws that decriminalise particular forms of sex allow for the emergence of new regimes of property rights. Drawing on the Sydney example, we have suggested that decriminalisation (or, equally, criminalisation) is never total, but is actually about defining where certain practices might be legal. For example, the effective decriminalisation of sex work in Sydney has not allowed for the sale of sex in all spaces, but has created specific sexual commons that are visible and accessible in a manner that is subject to formal legal institutional arrangements, rather than merely moral stricture.</p>
<p>Considering how the constellation of property rights enables or represses particular forms of commercial sex within the city is both important and timely given the widely noted shift from the use of criminal laws and police power to control sex in the city to the more diffuse use of environmental, planning and health law (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011417019">Hubbard <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Far from being decided in the realms of legislation, the legalities of specific sex venues are determined by ‘street-level bureaucrats’ who exercise discretion in deciding if sex venues have a right to exist in given locales. The imprecision of many of the concepts at the heart of property law—for example, what it means to be ‘near’ or ‘in view of’—results in inconsistent interpretation that is often not open to appeal or challenge. Property rights are thus fundamental in structuring the nocturnal city, a fact scarcely acknowledged in most critical analyses of the social repression of commercial sex (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098011417019">Sanders <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The case study of Sydney has bought such issues into clearer focus, showing that the notion of property itself is always sexed and sexualised, in the sense that the divide between public and private space (and different types of commons) is defined through questions of what behaviours and comportment are appropriate in what types of space. When encountered outside the domestic, intimate sphere, sex remains problematic, albeit that there is increasing acceptance of the recreational nature of sex and some recognition that the sex industry can make an economic contribution to the life of cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098011417019">Ryder, 2004</xref>). This means that notions of property rights are burdened with changing ideas of what constitutes ‘quiet enjoyment’ of property, with commercial sex always testing the limits of what belongs in the commons.</p>
