<p>Identifying the types of mathematics content knowledge that are most predictive of students’ long-term learning is essential for improving both theories of mathematical development and mathematics education. To identify these types of knowledge, we examined long-term predictors of high school students’ knowledge of algebra and overall mathematics achievement. Analyses of large, nationally representative, longitudinal data sets from the United States and the United Kingdom revealed that elementary school students’ knowledge of fractions and of division uniquely predicts those students’ knowledge of algebra and overall mathematics achievement in high school, 5 or 6 years later, even after statistically controlling for other types of mathematical knowledge, general intellectual ability, working memory, and family income and education. Implications of these findings for understanding and improving mathematics learning are discussed.</p>

<p>Knowledge of mathematics is crucial to educational and financial success in contemporary society and is becoming ever more so. High school students’ mathematics achievement predicts college matriculation and graduation, early-career earnings, and earnings growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612440101">Murnane, Willett, &amp; Levy, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612440101">National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008</xref>). The strength of these relations appears to have increased in recent decades, probably because of a growing percentage of well-paying jobs requiring mathematical proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612440101">Murnane et al., 1995</xref>). However, many students lack even the basic mathematics competence needed to succeed in typical jobs in a modern economy. Children from low-income and minority backgrounds are particularly at risk for poor mathematics achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612440101">Hanushek &amp; Rivkin, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Marked individual and social-class differences in mathematical knowledge are present even in preschool and kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612440101">Case &amp; Okamoto, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612440101">Starkey, Klein, &amp; Wakeley, 2004</xref>). These differences are stable at least from kindergarten through fifth grade; children who start ahead in mathematics generally stay ahead, and children who start behind generally stay behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612440101">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612440101">Stevenson &amp; Newman, 1986</xref>). There are substantial correlations between early and later knowledge in other academic subjects as well, but differences in children’s mathematics knowledge are even more stable than differences in their reading and other capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612440101">Case, Griffin, &amp; Kelly, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612440101">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings suggest a new type of research that can contribute both to theoretical understanding of mathematical development and to improving mathematics education. If researchers can identify specific areas of mathematics that consistently predict later mathematics proficiency, after controlling for other types of mathematical knowledge, general intellectual ability, and family background variables, they can then determine why those types of knowledge are uniquely predictive, and society can increase efforts to improve instruction and learning in those areas. The educational payoff is likely to be strongest for areas that are strongly predictive of later achievement and in which many children’s understanding is poor.</p>
<p>In the present study, we examined sources of continuity in mathematical knowledge from fifth grade through high school. We were particularly interested in testing the hypothesis that early knowledge of fractions is uniquely predictive of later knowledge of algebra and overall mathematics achievement.</p>
<p>One source of this hypothesis was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612440101">Siegler, Thompson, and Schneider’s (2011)</xref> integrated theory of numerical development. This theory proposes that numerical development is a process of progressively broadening the class of numbers that are understood to possess magnitudes and of learning the functions that connect those numbers to their magnitudes. In other words, numerical development involves coming to understand that all real numbers have magnitudes that can be assigned specific locations on number lines. This idea resembles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612440101">Case and Okamoto’s (1996)</xref> proposal that during mathematics learning, the central conceptual structure for whole numbers, a mental number line, is eventually extended to rational numbers. The integrated theory of numerical development also proposes that a complementary, and equally crucial, part of numerical development is learning that many properties of whole numbers (e.g., having unique successors, being countable, including a finite number of entities within any given interval, never decreasing with addition and multiplication) are not true of numbers in general.</p>
<p>One implication of this theory is that acquisition of fractions knowledge is crucial to numerical development. For most children, fractions provide the first opportunity to learn that several salient and invariant properties of whole numbers are not true of all numbers (e.g., that multiplication does not necessarily produce answers greater than the multiplicands). This understanding does not come easily; although children receive repeated instruction on fractions starting in third or fourth grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612440101">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2006</xref>), even high school and community-college students often confuse properties of fractions and whole numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612440101">Schneider &amp; Siegler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612440101">Vosniadou, Vamvakoussi, &amp; Skopeliti, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This view of fractions as occupying a central position within mathematical development differs substantially from other theories in the area, which focus on whole numbers and relegate fractions to secondary status. To the extent that such theories address development of understanding of fractions at all, it is usually to document ways in which learning about them is hindered by whole-number knowledge (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612440101">Gelman &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612440101">Wynn, 1995</xref>). Nothing in these theories suggests that early knowledge of fractions would uniquely predict later mathematics proficiency.</p>
<p>Consider some reasons, however, why elementary school students’ knowledge of fractions might be crucial for later mathematics—for example, algebra. If students do not understand fractions, they cannot estimate answers even to simple algebraic equations. For example, students who do not understand fractions will not know that in the equation 1/3<italic>X</italic> = 2/3<italic>Y, X</italic> must be twice as large as <italic>Y</italic>, or that for the equation 3/4<italic>X</italic> = 6, the value of <italic>X</italic> must be somewhat, but not greatly, larger than 6. Students who do not understand fraction magnitudes also would not be able to reject flawed equations by reasoning that the answers they yield are impossible. Consistent with this analysis, studies have shown that accurate estimation of fraction magnitudes is closely related to correct use of fractions arithmetic procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612440101">Hecht &amp; Vagi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612440101">Siegler et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that 10-year-olds’ knowledge of fractions would predict their algebra knowledge and overall mathematics achievement at age 16, even after we statistically controlled for other mathematical knowledge, information-processing skills, general intellectual ability, and family income and education.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To identify predictors of high school mathematics proficiency, we examined two nationally representative, longitudinal data sets: the British Cohort Study (BCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612440101">Butler &amp; Bynner, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612440101">1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612440101">Bynner, Ferri, &amp; Shepherd, 1997</xref>) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement (PSID-CDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612440101">Hofferth, Davis-Kean, Davis, &amp; Finkelstein, 1998</xref>). Detailed descriptions of the samples and measures used in these studies and of the statistical analyses that we applied are included in the Supplemental Material available online; here, we provide a brief overview.</p>
<p>The BCS sample included 3,677 children born in the United Kingdom in a single week of 1970. The tests of interest in the present study were administered in 1980, when the children were 10-year-olds, and in 1986, when the children were 16-year-olds. Mathematics proficiency at age 10 was assessed by performance on the Friendly Maths Test, which examined knowledge of whole-number arithmetic and fractions. Mathematics proficiency at age 16 was assessed by the APU (Applied Psychology Unit) Arithmetic Test, which examined knowledge of whole-number arithmetic, fractions, algebra, and probability. General intelligence was assessed at age 10 by performance on the British Ability Scale, which included measures of verbal and nonverbal intellectual ability, vocabulary, and spelling. Parents provided information about their education and income and their children’s gender, age, and number of siblings.</p>
<p>The PSID-CDS included a nationally representative sample of 599 U.S. children who were tested in 1997 as 10- to 12- year-olds and in 2002 as 15- to 17-year-olds. At both ages, they completed parts of the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho- Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R), a widely used achievement test. The 10- to 12-year-olds performed the Calculation Subtest, which included 28 whole-number arithmetic items (8 addition, 8 subtraction, 7 multiplication, and 5 division items) and 9 fractions items. The 15- to 17-year-olds completed the test’s Applied Problems Subtest, which included 60 items on whole-number arithmetic, fractions, algebra, geometry, measurement, and probability. Applied Problems items 29, 42, 43, 45, and 46 were used to construct the measure of fractions knowledge, and items 34, 49, 52, and 59 were used to construct the measure of algebra knowledge. Also obtained at ages 10 to 12 were measures of working memory (as indexed by backward digit span), demographic characteristics (gender, age, and number of siblings), and family background (parental education in years and log mean income averaged over 3 years). Two measures of literacy from the WJ-R, passage comprehension and letter-word identification (a vocabulary test), were obtained both at age 10 to 12 and at age 15 to 17.</p>

<p>Note: This table presents results from regression models predicting algebra and total math scores at age 15 to 17 from math skills, cognitive abilities, and child and family characteristics at age 10 to 12. All predictors and dependent variables were standardized; therefore, although the coefficients reported are unstandardized, they can be interpreted much like standardized coefficients. Parameter estimates and standard errors (in parentheses) are based on 20 multiply imputed data sets.

<p>Our main hypothesis was that knowledge of fractions at age 10 would predict algebra knowledge and overall mathematics achievement in high school, above and beyond the effects of general intellectual ability, other mathematical knowledge, and family background. The data supported this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom (U.K.) data, after effects of all other variables were statistically controlled, fractions knowledge at age 10 was the strongest of the five mathematics predictors of age-16 algebra knowledge and mathematics achievement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440101">Table 1</xref>, Models 2 and 4). A 1-<italic>SD</italic> increase in early fractions knowledge was uniquely associated with a 0.15-<italic>SD</italic> increase in subsequent algebra knowledge and a 0.16-<italic>SD</italic> increase in total math achievement (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for both coefficients). In the U.S. data, after effects of other variables were statistically controlled, the relations between fractions knowledge at ages 10 to 12 and high school algebra and overall mathematics achievement at ages 15 to 17 were of approximately the same strength as the corresponding relations in the U.K. data (Models 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440101">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797612440101">2</xref>). As documented in the Supplemental Material (see Tables S5 and S6), in both data sets, the predictive power of increments to fractions knowledge was equally strong for children lower and higher in fractions knowledge.</p>
<p>If fractions knowledge continues to be a direct contributor to mathematics achievement in high school, as opposed to having influenced earlier learning but no longer being directly influential, we would expect strong concurrent relations between high school students’ knowledge of fractions and their overall mathematical knowledge. High school students’ knowledge of fractions did correlate very strongly with their overall mathematics achievement, in both the United Kingdom, <italic>r</italic>(3675) = .81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the United States, <italic>r</italic>(597) = .87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Their fractions knowledge also was closely related to their knowledge of algebra in both the United Kingdom, <italic>r</italic>(3675) = .68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the United States, <italic>r</italic>(597) = .65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Although algebra is a major part of high school mathematics and fractions constitute a smaller part, the correlation between high school students’ knowledge of fractions and their overall mathematics achievement was stronger than the correlation between their algebra knowledge and their overall mathematics achievement in both the U.K. data, <italic>r</italic>(3675) = .81 versus .73, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 3,677) = 66.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and the U.S. data, <italic>r</italic>(597) = .87 versus .80, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 599) = 15.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Early knowledge of whole-number division also was consistently related to later mathematics proficiency. Among the five mathematics variables derived from the elementary school tests, early division had the second-strongest correlation with later mathematics outcomes in the U.K. data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440101">Table 1</xref>) and the strongest correlation with later mathematics outcomes in the U.S. data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797612440101">Table 2</xref>). Concurrent correlations between high school students’ knowledge of division and their overall mathematics achievement were also substantial both in the United Kingdom, <italic>r</italic>(3675) = .59, and in the United States, <italic>r</italic>(597) = .69, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .001. To the best of our knowledge, relations between elementary school children’s division knowledge and their mathematics proficiency in high school have not been documented previously.</p>
<p>Regressions like those in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440101">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797612440101">2</xref> place no constraints on the estimated coefficients. Therefore, we reestimated our regression models, first imposing an equality constraint on the coefficients for fractions and division, and then imposing an equality constraint on the coefficients for addition, subtraction, and multiplication (see Table S4 in the Supplemental Material). Finally, we tested whether the pooled coefficients for these two sets of skills differed from each other. The predictive relation was stronger for fractions and division than for the other mathematical skills in both the U.K. and the U.S. data—U.K.: <italic>F</italic>(1, 3664) = 36.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for algebra and <italic>F</italic>(1, 3664) = 28.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for overall mathematics; U.S.: <italic>F</italic>(1, 558) = 7.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, for algebra and <italic>F</italic>(1, 558) = 9.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, for overall mathematics (see Table S4).</p>
<p>The greater predictive power of knowledge of fractions and knowledge of division was not due to their generally predicting intellectual outcomes more accurately. When Models 2 and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440101">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797612440101">2</xref> were applied to predicting high school students’ literacy (spelling and vocabulary from the British Ability Scale in the BCS; passage comprehension and letter-word identification from the WJ-R in the PSID-CDS), only two of the eight predictive relations between fractions and division knowledge, on the one hand, and literacy, on the other, were significant: Fractions knowledge predicted vocabulary in the U.K. data, and division knowledge predicted letter-word identification in the U.S. data (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797612440101">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0956797612440101">4</xref>). Moreover, in all cases but one, the pooled predictive effect of fractions and division knowledge on literacy was no greater than the pooled predictive effect of addition, subtraction, and multiplication knowledge on literacy (see Table S4 in the Supplemental Material). The one exception was that fractions and division knowledge more accurately predicted vocabulary in the U.K. data, <italic>F</italic>(1, 3664) = 5.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797612440101">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0956797612440101">4</xref> for a summary of predictors of literacy in the two data sets.)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These findings demonstrate that elementary school students’ knowledge of fractions and whole-number division predicts their mathematics achievement in high school, above and beyond the contributions of their knowledge of whole-number addition, subtraction, and multiplication; verbal and nonverbal IQ; working memory; family education; and family income. Knowledge of fractions and whole-number division also had a stronger relation to math achievement than did knowledge of whole-number addition, subtraction, and multiplication; verbal IQ; working memory; and parental income. These results were consistent across data sets from the United Kingdom and the United States. The fact that the relations of the predictor variables to algebra knowledge and overall mathematics achievement were similar in strength in the two samples, despite differences in the samples, the tests, and the times at which the data were obtained, is reason for confidence in the generality of the findings.</p>
<p>The correlation between knowledge of fractions in elementary school and achievement in algebra and mathematics overall in high school was expected, but the relation between early division knowledge and later mathematical knowledge was not. Fractions and division are inherently related (<italic>N</italic>/<italic>M</italic> means <italic>N</italic> divided by <italic>M</italic>), but the finding that early knowledge of fractions and early knowledge of division accounted for independent variance in later algebra knowledge and overall mathematics achievement indicated that neither relation explained the other.</p>
<p>There are several likely reasons why knowledge of division uniquely predicted later mathematics achievement. Mastery of whole-number division, like mastery of fractions, is required to solve many algebra problems (e.g., to apply the quadratic equation). Also, as is the case with fractions, high percentages of students fail to master division; thus, when high school students in the PSID-CDS were presented with a seemingly easy problem in which a boy wants to fly on a plane that travels 400 miles per hour in order to visit his grandmother who lives 1,400 air miles away, only 56% of the students correctly indicated how long the flight would take. More speculatively, poor knowledge of both division and fractions might lead students to give up trying to make sense of mathematics, and instead to rely on rote memorization in subsequent mathematics learning.</p>
<p>An alternative interpretation is that the unique predictive value of knowledge of fractions and knowledge of division stems from those operations being more difficult than addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and thus measuring more advanced thinking. Some of our results are inconsistent with this interpretation, however. First, knowledge of fractions and knowledge of division were not uniquely predictive of most subsequent literacy skills (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797612440101">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0956797612440101">4</xref>), as should have been the case if their predictive value was due solely to their greater difficulty. Second, spline tests (see Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplemental Material) showed that the predictive strength of early knowledge of fractions and division did not differ between students with greater and lesser mathematics achievement in high school. Thus, the unique predictive value of early fractions and division knowledge seems to be due to many students not mastering fractions and division and to those operations being essential for more advanced mathematics, rather than simply to fractions and division being relatively difficult to master.</p>
<p>Over 30 years of nationwide standardized testing, mathematics scores of U.S. high school students have barely budged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612440101">National Mathematics Advisory Panel, 2008</xref>). The present findings imply that mastery of fractions and division is needed if substantial improvements in understanding of algebra and other aspects of high school mathematics are to be achieved. One likely reason for students’ limited mastery of fractions and division is that many U.S. teachers lack a firm conceptual understanding of fractions and division. In several studies, the majority of elementary and middle school teachers in the United States were unable to generate even a single explanation for why the invert-and-multiply algorithm (i.e., <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> ÷ <italic>c</italic>/<italic>d</italic> = <italic>ad</italic> × <italic>bc</italic>) is a legitimate way to solve division problems with fractions. In contrast, most teachers in Japan and China generated two or three explanations in response to the same question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612440101">Ma, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612440101">Moseley, Okamoto, &amp; Ishida, 2007</xref>). These and the present results suggest that improved teaching of fractions and division could yield substantial improvements in students’ learning, not only of fractions and division but of more advanced mathematics as well.</p>
