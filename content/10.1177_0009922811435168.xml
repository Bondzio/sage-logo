<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 7-year-old Caucasian female was referred to our pediatric rheumatology service at Children’s Hospital clinic for evaluation of limp of 7-month duration. There was no history of trauma or fever. Her past medical history and family history were noncontributory. Physical examination was significant for pain on internal and external rotation of the right hip. The rest of the physical exam was found to be normal.</p>
<p>Laboratory evaluation, including hemogram, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and urinalysis were normal. Rheumatoid factor was positive with a titer of 1:40. Plain radiographs showed no abnormalities. A 99m technetium bone scan showed a focal abnormality of the proximal part of the right femur in the region of the lesser trochanter. A diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) was made and the patient was put on naprosyn (15 mg/kg/d). However, on follow-up visits, she continued to have irritability on movement of her right hip with rotation. Further evaluation with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis revealed an area of anterior cortical thickening in the anterior aspect of the femoral neck associated with an intracortical radiolucency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811435168">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811435168">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>KW, a 10-year-old African American girl, was presented to our pediatric rheumatology clinic for persistent left leg pain and limp of 5-month duration. Radiographs of the left leg and hips ordered by her pediatrician were normal and she was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with mild relief. On further questioning, she admitted that the left leg pain was more pronounced at nighttimes, initially intermittent occurring 3 to 4 nights a week, now became persistent occurring every night, pain also occurred during stretching at physical education. Otherwise, there was only minimal to no pain during the day. There was no history of trauma or pain and swelling of the other joints. She denied any rash, fever, visual changes, headaches, diarrhea, weight loss, or change in appetite. Her past medical history and family history were noncontributory.</p>
<p>She was initially seen by an orthopedic specialist who repeated the hip X-rays, which showed no fracture, dislocation, or osseous lesions. Computed tomography–guided left hip aspiration revealed no malignant cells, but showed a white blood cell count of 723 cells/µL, predominately lymphocytes and had negative cultures.</p>
<p>On examination at our rheumatology clinic she was afebrile and her other vital signs were normal. Her height and weight were in the 50th percentile for her age. She had no lymphadenopathy. Examination of the joints showed pain on internal rotation of the left hip with some decreased range of motion and had very mild antalgic gait with slight limp favoring left hip. The rest of the musculoskeletal and entire physical exam was benign.</p>
<p>Laboratory evaluations revealed normal complete blood counts and comprehensive metabolic panel. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 9 mm/h and C-reactive protein was also within normal limits. She had normal immunoglobulin levels. The antinuclear antibody, human leukocyte antigen B27, and rheumatoid factor were negative. She was diagnosed with possible pauci-articular JRA and was treated with NSAIDs for the next 5 months; however, she continued with her complaints without change in her physical findings. At this point, an MRI of the left hip revealed rounded intracortical lesion in the anterior aspect of the left femur at the head and neck junction immediately adjacent to a small intracortical cyst (4 mm). Within the intracortical lesion, there was a focus of hypointense signal creating an appearance more suggestive of a nidus as typical for osteoid osteoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811435168">Figure 2B</xref>). CT of the pelvis confirmed the above findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811435168">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Osteoid Osteoma</title>
<p>Osteoid osteoma was first described by H. L. Jaffe in 1935.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811435168">1</xref></sup> It is one of the most common benign bone tumors and accounts for 11% of all benign bone tumors, and 2% to 3% of all primary bone neoplasms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811435168">1</xref></sup> The tumor occurs predominantly in children and young adults, with ages ranging from 5 to 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811435168">2</xref></sup> Male patients are seen more often than female patients. The lesion can occur in almost any bone; however, the femoral neck, proximal tibia, and the humerus are the most common sites of involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811435168">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811435168">3</xref></sup> When they occur within the synovial reflection, they are termed intra-articular osteoid osteomas, a form that occurs most frequently in the hip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811435168">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811435168">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Classic clinical features of osteoid osteoma are the presence of a well-localized throbbing pain at night, relieved by analgesics and a limp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811435168">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435168">6</xref></sup> Also, osteoid osteoma can cause leg length discrepancy or bowing of the extremity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435168">6</xref></sup> Juxta-articular osteoid osteoma is difficult to identify and can lead to misdiagnosis and delay in diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811435168">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811435168">7</xref></sup> Differential diagnoses for hip pain and limp in a child include more serious conditions such as septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, Legg–Calve–Perthes disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis/JRA, and other less serious conditions such as toxic synovitis and stress fracture, which present similarly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435168">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radiological localization of the nidus is important for surgical excision. The classic radiographic feature is a small radiolucent lesion in the cortex of long bones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811435168">8</xref></sup> CT scans are very useful in delineating the nidus from the surrounding sclerosis and periosteal reaction. Localization is best done by bone scintigraphy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811435168">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811435168">8</xref></sup> Classic double density appearance in scintigraphy is highly specific for osteoid osteoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811435168">8</xref></sup> Additional imaging such as MRI may be useful in localization of the tumor nidus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435168">6</xref></sup> However, MRI is not often the modality of choice for osteoid osteoma as the soft tissue and bone marrow edema caused by this tumor may be misleading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435168">6</xref></sup> Histologically, osteoid osteoma consists of a tumor nidus with immature, woven, trabecular bone, and osteoblasts with a highly vascular stroma surrounded by dense sclerotic bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811435168">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Management includes both medical and surgical approaches. In selected patients prolonged use of aspirin or other NSAIDS can be considered, especially when the lesion is inaccessible. Surgical techniques include wide surgical excision; intralesional excision with minimal removal of bone; less invasive techniques such as arthroscopic, CT- or MRI-guided core drill excision; or radiofrequency ablation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811435168">9</xref></sup> Accurate intraoperative localization of the nidus is crucial for success of the surgical intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811435168">10</xref></sup> Minimally invasive techniques are particularly useful in deep-seated lesions such as in the neck of the femur and in the pelvis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811435168">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding our patients, case 1 underwent CT-guided percutaneous excision of the lesion, and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma. At discharge, 4 days after the excision, the patient was completely pain free and she started full weight-bearing at 6 weeks. She has continued to do well on follow-up visits. Case 2 is being scheduled in 1 week for surgical excision. In both of these cases the course of the illness and duration of symptoms were falsely warranted the diagnosis of JRA. In cases with prolonged isolated hip pain in children, in addition to plain films, further imaging, including CT, MRI, or both should be considered to rule out or in the possibility of osteoid osteoma.</p>
