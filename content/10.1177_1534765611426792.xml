<abstract>
<p>This article presents processes of coping and posttraumatic growth (PTG) as elicited both from an open-ended questionnaire administrated to 52 Jewish Israeli mothers as well as in-depth interviews conducted with 16 of them, following exposure to either long-term or a short period of threat in the form of rocket attacks on their homes. This comparison revealed that all mothers described the same coping mechanisms and perceived themselves as coping well with the threat of terror. However, with regard to PTG, only those who were exposed to rocket attacks for a long duration disclosed a manifest potential for PTG both in relation to self and in relation to others. Concurrently, because of the parental decision to live in an area exposed to missile attacks, the mothers expressed guilt feelings toward their children, fearing for their mental well-being. The differences between the two groups of mothers and possible applications for mental health professionals working with such populations are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of civilians to cope with terror and war is an area that has been widely researched over the last decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765611426792">Maguen, Papa, &amp; Litz, 2008</xref>). Such studies focus on the negative outcomes of exposure to terror and war. Recently, an increasing amount of attention has being directed to the potential positive outcomes of such exposure, particularly among researchers looking at posttraumatic growth (PTG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765611426792">Calhoun, Cann, &amp; Tedeschi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765611426792">Hobfoll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765611426792">Weiss &amp; Berger, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Israel is a country that is continually exposed to ongoing terror and wars. It was the ongoing rocket attacks experienced over the last 8 years by the inhabitants of the Western Negev that led to the current inquiry, focusing on the coping mechanisms and PTG among mothers of small children, using their personal narratives as the source of information. In the following sections, the situation in the Western Negev is briefly discussed, followed by a literature review dealing with coping and PTG among women and mothers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1534765611426792">
<title>Living in the Western Negev of Israel</title>
<p>The Western Negev in Israel with a population of approximately 80,000 inhabitants is concentrated mainly in 3 small cities (Sderot, Netivot, and Ofakim), the remainder being residents of small agriculture communities of Kibbutzim and Moshavim, which border the Gaza strip.</p>
<p>Since 2001, Sderot has been regularly bombarded by mortar and rocket fire, during the years 2001 to 2005, attacks occurred only periodically and the weapons used were relatively inaccurate and of low grade, since August 2005, the frequency and precision of attacks increased considerably.</p>
<p>The Israeli government activated an early warning system called <italic>Code Red</italic>, aimed at alerting residents of potential incoming missile strikes within a 15 s time lapse and thus to seek cover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426792">Diamond, Lipsitz, Fajerman, &amp; Rozenblat, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2008 alone, more than 4,000 rockets hit the Negev, reaching areas previously unharmed, such as the larger cities of Beer Sheba and Ashkelon and most of the small agricultural communities in the southern parts of the Western Negev, killing civilians and causing damage to many houses. These attacks finally led to operation “Cast Iron” which took place between late December 2008 and January 2009. As a result of the Israeli military operation, and over the following year, the number of rockets decreased considerably, although a considerable number of missiles were still fired and continued to threaten the lives of those living in this area.</p>
<p>Estimates are that 10% to 25% of Sderot’s residents have left the city to live elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765611426792">Hadad, 2009</xref>). Those who remained may have done so for a variety of reasons including economic considerations, such as the inability to sell their homes or find employment elsewhere, the desire to stay close to extended family and friends, and ideological and nationalistic reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426792">Diamond et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>The Effects of War on Women and Mothers</title>
<p>Findings of studies on ongoing terror and war indicate that war related stressors are consistently associated with increased levels of psychological distress in civilian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765611426792">Michultka, Blanchard, &amp; Kalous, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765611426792">Morina &amp; Ford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765611426792">Qouta, Punamäki, &amp; El Sarraj, 2005</xref>) and were found to be more severe among women than among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765611426792">Adams &amp; Boscarino, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765611426792">Brewin, Andrews, &amp; Valentine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765611426792">Zeidner, 2006</xref>). However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765611426792">Shalev and Toval Mashiach (2005)</xref>, it was the disruption to their lives during war that women perceived as more threatening than the actual war itself.</p>
<p>Exploring clinical symptoms of exposure to threat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426792">Diamond et al. (2010)</xref> suggested that in the case of civilians who are constantly exposed to terror and war, as in the west Negev of Israel, different characteristics of stress related symptoms than those attributed to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be addressed. In many cases, anxiety symptoms seem to evolve gradually and tend to be associated with ongoing daily stress about imminent attacks, rather than as a discrete past traumatic event. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611426792">Diamond et al. (2010)</xref> reported hyperarousal, severe distress, and loss of control during and immediately following actual missile attacks and suggested that in contrast to the typical presentation of PTSD, symptoms tended to diminish dramatically or be completely resolved when people are no longer within harm’s way.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765611426792">Duvall and Miller (1985)</xref> the “developmental tasks of motherhood, that is, caring for children with a sense of competence and providing for safety and security for children, become extremely challenging to accomplish during war” (p. 171), and mothers who experience war together with their young children are at a greater risk for stress reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765611426792">Qouta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534765611426792">White-Traut, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers have found that the mother’s level of anxiety and depression during and after conflict is the most important predictor of her children’s mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765611426792">Foster, Davies, &amp; Steele, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765611426792">Laor, Wolmer, &amp; Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765611426792">Qouta et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765611426792">Robertson and Duckett (2007)</xref> identified four common themes of mothering among Bosnian mothers during and after the war. These were “on the move,” “I have to feed them,” “living somewhere in between,” and “still living the war inside.” These themes reflect the mother’s coping difficulties during war and it’s after effects. However, despite the difficulties, all the mothers interviewed reported that they coped well and managed to arrange a relatively safe place to feed and care for their children during and after the war.</p>

<sec id="section4-1534765611426792">
<title>Coping</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765611426792">Lazarus and Folkman (1991)</xref>, who explored the concept of coping, “Coping consists of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person” (p. 210). They suggested that in the process of coping there are two forms of cognitive appraisals: primary and secondary. In the primary appraisal, the person asks, “What do I have at stake in this encounter?” This recognition arouses feelings, for example, of fear, worry, anger, and shame. In the secondary appraisal, the concern of the person is “What can I do or what are my options for coping?” They identified two sets of coping resources, namely, problem focused coping and emotion focused coping. The former predominates when people believe that something constructive can be done about the situation and the latter when people believe that the stress must be endured, attempt to control distressing emotions and alter the meaning of the situation.</p>
<p>In the context of war and terror, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534765611426792">Zeidner and Saklofske (1996)</xref> problem-focused coping does not remove the threat itself and is essentially a “safety measure” at best. In comparison, emotion-focused and avoidance coping (e.g., denial, behavioral disengagement) might prove adaptive under such conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765611426792">Zeidner (2006)</xref> suggested that appraisal of personal threat and perceived control may be the main mediating factors that ultimately determine what coping responses will be most helpful to individuals.</p>
<p>The meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534765611426792">Tamres, Janicki, and Helgeson (2002)</xref> suggests that women, more than men, plan and engage in general problem-focused coping, use active coping, and seek social support for instrumental reasons. For emotion-focused coping, they seek social support for emotional reasons, engage in positive reappraisal and wishful thinking, ruminate, use positive self-talk, and use avoidance. In the Israeli context, findings indicate that, in comparison with men, a greater number of Israeli women used both problem-focused as well as emotional-focused coping methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534765611426792">Zeidner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534765611426792">Zeidner &amp; Hammer, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies conducted among Israelis following the second Intifada indicated that high resilience and commitment to the state of Israel characterized Israeli society as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765611426792">Shalev &amp; Toval Mashiach, 2005</xref>). Despite a low sense of safety for self and family and self-reported depressed moods, Israelis attested to an enhanced sense of hope, optimism, and low pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765611426792">Bleich, Gelkopf, &amp; Solomon, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765611426792">Billig (2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611426792">Billig &amp; Zorkraut, 2006</xref>) found that religious settlers in the former Gaza settlements and the West Bank, whose homes were under terrorist attacks, showed a resilient tendency to cope their perception of risk attached to their living conditions was low and continued living in their homes. These findings were interpreted as stemming from the respondents’ strong ideological and religious convictions.</p>

<title>Conceptual and Empirical Aspects of PTG Processes</title>
<p>PTG is defined as “positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly challenging life circumstances that represent significant challenges to the adaptive resources of the individual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765611426792">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>, p. 1) challenges to the individual’s assumptive world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765611426792">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>) and is related to achieving an enhanced level of functioning, a sense of meaning or spirituality, and closer relationships that were not present prior to the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765611426792">Linley &amp; Joseph, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765611426792">Tedeschi and Calhoun (1995)</xref> proposed a model which suggested that the experience of PTG has three potential domains. <italic>Changed perception of self</italic> is related to the feeling that the person is stronger and less vulnerable than one assumed and will be able to deal with future threats. <italic>Relation to others</italic> points to a heightened sense of closeness to meaningful others, more freedom to be oneself and the tendency to increased sensitivity and compassion for the suffering of others. <italic>Change in philosophy of life</italic> points to change in one’s priorities, enjoying small things, and for some people an increase in involvement with spiritual or religious matters. Later on, a scale was developed covering five domains of PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534765611426792">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765611426792">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The first, a <italic>greater appreciation of life and a changed sense of priorities</italic>, points to a major change shift in the ways the individual engages his or her daily life and what is now (as compared with before the traumatic experience) considered important to him or her. The second, a <italic>warmer and intimate relationship with others</italic>, represents a change in the importance attached to relationships with others as well as an increased sense of compassion, particularly for others who are in a similar position. The third, a <italic>sense of increased personal strength</italic>, points to the recognition that one is able to deal with any actual and potential hardship, yet, at the same time, recognizing that one is vulnerable. The fourth, <italic>recognition of new possibilities</italic>, suggests the identification of new avenues of action and personal development. The fifth, <italic>spiritual and existential development</italic>, points to greater engagement with fundamental existential questions. The application of the PTG measure in various cultural settings and among different groups revealed that PTG domains vary considerably and two-, three-, and five-factor structures are manifested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765611426792">Weiss &amp; Berger, 2010</xref>, for a review). This led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765611426792">Calhoun et al. (2010)</xref> to elaborate the model, stressing the cultural and social influences on the process of PTG as determinants of the emergence of the cultural and group-specific factors. According to the revised model, the two cognitive processes of (a) rumination and (b) self-disclosure, encourage growth are influenced by gender, cultural, and societal differences.</p>
<p>Rumination in the context of PTG involves the cognitive work precipitated by the need to revise or reestablish beliefs that constitute the individual’s assumptive world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765611426792">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>) and was found to have positive outcomes and enhance PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426792">Calhoun &amp; Tedeschi, 2006</xref>). With regard to gender, it was found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534765611426792">Treynor, Gonzalez, and Nolen-Hoeksema (2003)</xref> that women engaged in significantly more deliberate (productive and contemplative) and brooding (negative) rumination. The tendency to ruminate on constructive issues, such as an increased awareness of personal strengths or an appreciation of the importance of social connections, has been suggested as a mechanism leading to greater reports of posttraumatic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765611426792">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534765611426792">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-disclosure and social response to it were found to be important in enhancing the possibility for new schemas that can aid in coping and perhaps facilitate PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765611426792">Calhoun et al., 2010</xref>) with findings suggesting that positive emotions (hope, trust and solidarity) which can enhance the possibility of PTG are common in community oriented cultures, such as Spain and Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534765611426792">Weiss &amp; Berger, 2010</xref>). A recent meta-analysis on gender differences in self-reported PTG revealed a small to moderate gender difference with women reporting more PTG than men. Women reported incrementally more PTG than men as the mean age of the sample increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534765611426792">Vishnevsky, Cann, Calhoun et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research suggests that there is a high correlation between symptoms of PTS and PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765611426792">Linley &amp; Joseph, 2004</xref>). According to the PTG model, greater perceived threat may lead to greater upheaval of an individual’s assumptive world, and this pattern sets the stage for greater reports of PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426792">Calhoun &amp; Tedeschi, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>PTG studies in Israel are relatively scarce as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765611426792">Laufer and Solomon (2010)</xref>. Among Israeli youth, two PTG factors were identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765611426792">Laufer and Solomon (2010)</xref>, “outward bound growth” which related to interpersonal relationships and greater social cohesion and “intrapersonal growth” which related to self-perception and philosophy of life. The results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765611426792">Dekel and Nuttman-Shwartz (2009)</xref> indicate that, regardless of gender, those exposed to 6 years of rockets attacks targeting the Western Negev, exhibited higher levels of growth coexisting with higher levels of threat or stress associated with the situation. In comparison, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765611426792">Hall et al. (2010)</xref> who examined the effect of the war following the 2006 Israeli–Hezbollah war suggested that PTG was more characteristic of women than men.</p>
<p>In accordance with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426792">Calhoun and Tedeschi (2006)</xref> model, the process of PTG can be described as a three-step process: Apprehending or “comprehensibility” of the situation points to the attempt to make sense out of what has happened. With emerging comprehensibility comes a better chance for “manageability” that is, figuring out ways to cope. These two steps are akin to the primary and secondary appraisals described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765611426792">Lazarus and Folkman (1991)</xref>.</p>
<p>The final process of PTG is that of “meaningfulness,” which occurs after the person has coped successfully or at least has attained a moderate degree of coping and can progress from mere survival to recognizing other possibilities that become PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426792">Calhoun &amp; Tedeschi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534765611426792">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>There is paucity of qualitative research in the PTG literature and of research that could help uncover the coping and PTG processes and experiences of mothers who experienced war and terror.</p>
<p>This paucity as well as the comparison of potential maternal differences in coping and PTG as a result of the length of exposure to terror attacks prompted the current research which aimed to trace mother’s own experiences, thoughts, and feelings.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1534765611426792">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participating in the study were 52 mothers aged 27 to 50 years, who had children under the age of 18 living at home and who during the research period had resided in the Western Negev for at least 8 years. Of these, 22 lived in the city of Sderot or in its neighboring Moshavim and Kibutzim, all in the distance of a few kilometers from the Gaza strip, and thus, since 2001, had been continuously exposed to rocket attacks.</p>
<p>The remaining 30 women lived in Kibbutzim and Moshavim, about 20 to 30 kilometers south of the Gaza strip, and had been exposed directly to terror attacks only during the second half of 2008 until January 2009, that is, before and during operation “Cast Iron.” Participants were enlisted through the snowball and convenience method of sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765611426792">Marshall &amp; Rossman, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534765611426792">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The study included two phases. Initially, all participants completed an open-ended questionnaire which included a question dealing with their ways of coping with the terror attacks plus other questions not discussed here. At the second phase, 16 of the mothers were interviewed by the first author for 1 to 1.5 hr and were asked to describe their experiences, thoughts, and feelings before, during and after the war, their ways of coping during the war, and their thoughts and insights following the war. They were also asked about the way their children coped with the rocket attacks. Finally, they were asked about their thoughts and feelings in relation to their Palestinian neighbors who live in Gaza.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted to broaden the data, by creating the space for longer and more in-depth answers in a face-to-face interview situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765611426792">Auerbach &amp; Silverstein, 2003</xref>). Data collection took place between July and November 2009, 6 to 10 months after the completion of operation “Cast Iron.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534765611426792">
<title>Method of Analysis</title>
<p>The answers of the participants in the open-ended questionnaires were analyzed using the content analysis method recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765611426792">Mayring (2000)</xref>. Mayring has noted that qualitative content analysis enables the quantification of reappearing codes and themes in interviews or open-ended questions, whereas maintaining the qualitative approach of developing the “to-be-applied” categories from out of the collected data at the same time. In their analysis, therefore, the researchers looked for the main categories of coping and then compared their analyses. The main categories that were accepted and elaborated on by the researchers are presented below.</p>
<p>In the case of the interviews, the thematic approach, advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765611426792">Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach, and Zilber (1998)</xref> was applied. This approach suggests looking at each interview as a holistic unit and then tracing the main themes that emerge out of the material.</p>
<p>Initially, the two authors began separately reading the transcripts. After reading four interviews (two of each group of mothers), the authors then met to discuss ideas concerning each interview (i.e., what were the major issues being discussed, how did the participants relate to the different themes put forth in the questionnaires, and what were the strategies of coping and processes of PTG). After that each author separately analyzed all the remaining interviews, albeit conferring with each other regarding questions about the thematic analysis. Finally, those categories that were accepted by both authors are discussed here.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are presented in the following order. First, we present the main themes emerging out of the questionnaires and which aimed to detect the coping mechanisms used by the mothers. Second, we present PTG processes among mothers exposed at length to terror, and third, we present the psychological processes among their counterparts who were only briefly exposed to terror attacks.</p>
<p>Results of the main themes emerging from the open-ended questionnaires are presented first (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765611426792">Table 1</xref> below). The mothers had been requested to describe how they coped with the experience of terror and war. Results are shown for the entire sample and also for each group of mothers according to their length of exposure to terror attacks. To demonstrate the ways, each coping mechanism was used and examples are given from the interviews.</p>

<p>Three main coping mechanisms were identified. The first, optimism and humor, was discussed by 39.1% of all the mothers with no apparent differences between mothers who experienced a prolonged exposure to terror attacks and those who experienced them more briefly (36.1% and 41.4%, respectively).</p>
<p>Ilana,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1534765611426792">1</xref></sup> a resident of Sderot, related her tendency to try and keep optimistic in difficult times as an important component of her coping process: “It was important for me to keep optimistic. Even in times of chaos here, I continued to tell myself to be optimistic, and most of the time it worked for me, but not always.” Hadasa, another resident of Sderot, discussed humor in the following manner: “My role was to be the funny one. I made people laugh and this was my way of coping with this terrible situation, with fear and uncertainty.” In some cases, humor mixed with irony was described as a coping mechanism that helped the whole family in the most difficult of times. For example, Dina, from Sderot, described the significance of humor for her and her family in coping during the war:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>During the war it was a crazy situation, very frightening, it was not possible to concentrate on anything. It was an extreme situation and we laughed all the time. We had this joke at home that if someone likes extreme situations, we can show him how “extreme” can feel. We joked about opening an “extreme hotel,” so we sat in the shelter, listening to the sounds of rockets falling around us, and laughed about our “new extreme hotel.” And you know what, it helped us!</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the case of mothers who experienced a shorter period of terror, optimism was described in a more rational and less emotional manner.</p>
<p>Sarit, living in a small Moshav, said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>What was most helpful for me in coping with the situation was to be optimistic and look at the “full half of the glass,” I kept telling myself that the Qassam is a primitive rocket and its accuracy is low, so I have to stay optimistic because the chances that it will hit my house are small, and it helped me to think in this way.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>More than a third of all the respondents (35.3%), mentioned ideology as a mode of coping. This meant perceiving Israel as the only state for the Jewish people, and the thought that there is no other option but to be strong and cope with the danger.</p>
<p>A clear contrast emerged between mothers who were exposed to terror for a long time and relied less on ideology (13.6%) and those exposed briefly (51.7%).</p>
<p>Ilana, a resident of Sderot, pointed,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It is some kind of Zionistic ideology that helps me cope. I say to myself : we will not run away, we will stay here . . . I think to myself that if people run away every time Israel faces danger, no one would be left in this country. But we have no other place, so we have to cope.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Tamara, who lives in a Moshav and experienced short exposure to rockets attacks, said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>This war made me feel more Zionistic than before, and my love for the country and the understanding that we have no other country but Israel helped me cope, and this time in contrast to the last war in the north in 2006 when I felt that the army was ready and acted well.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Denial of the threat was found among a quarter of the respondents (25.2%) with only small differences between the mothers who were exposed to rocket and missile attacks for a long time and mothers who experienced relatively short exposure to the attacks (27.3% and 24.1%, respectively).</p>
<p>For example, Sharona who lives in a Kibbutz near Sderot, recalled,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I was not afraid most of the time. I thought that the chance of a direct hit from a Qassam is so low that I am not going to change my routine of life. I continued with my life, my work in the Kibbutz and shopping in Sderot, which is the nearest town to us.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Maintaining a routine as far as possible under the circumstances was perceived by the mothers as important both for themselves as well as for their children. As Lihi, who lives in a Moshav about 30 km from Sderot, recalled,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I continued with my life. Most of the time, I was not afraid. I did not believe that a rocket could hit my home. I took my children aged 4 and 2 for walks to the playground in the afternoons. I felt that maintaining a routine is best for us, and when I heard the “Code Red” alarm, I simply looked for the nearest Shelter.</p></disp-quote>

<title>Results of PTG Processes Among Mothers Exposed to Terror</title>
<p>The analysis of the interviews conducted with the mothers revealed a complex picture, one which suggests that these mothers, depending on their period of exposure to terror, experienced various and at times, different processes and changes along several dimensions that are discussed in the distinct stages in the development of PTG. Therefore, the themes emerging from these interviews are presented for each group of mothers separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1534765611426792">
<title>PTG Processes and Negative Outcomes Among Mothers Exposed to Long-Term Terror</title>
<p>As stated above, there are three stages in the process of PTG: “comprehensibility,” “manageability” of the dangerous situation, followed by the stage of “meaningfulness.” The first two stages and lengthy exposure are discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534765611426792">
<title>Comprehensibility and Manageability Among Mothers Exposed to Long-Term Terror</title>
<p>Mothers, long exposed to terror, related at length to the process of comprehending the dangerous situation in which they lived in. However, each of them understood this situation at a different point of time. For example, Limor, who has been living in Sderot for the last 13 years said, “It took me so long to understand and admit that we were living in dangerous situation; announcing that your life and home are no longer safe as rockets are falling all around is an understatement.” For Dina, the turning point of understanding the new reality occurred the first time when a resident of the area was killed by a Qassam Rocket. Dina explained,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>At the beginning, we saw it as some kind of funny or strange episode, not grasping the threat on our lives. Real understanding only started to sink in when the first people were injured or killed from the Qassam attacks. For me it was a very rude awakening that created a lot of anxiety. I realized that a Qassam could hurt or kill me and my dear ones, my family, and my children. I became robotic in my responses to the “red code” alarm, with no time for reflecting. I had to find shelter! A survival response!</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For Yael this realization emerged after she and her five-year-old child witnessed the death of two people due to a direct Qassam hit. She stated,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>At the beginning, it was “as if” it was far removed from us. The rockets were falling, but not many, and in the beginning the “Code Red” alarm was not in use and I did not feel the danger, until one day, and I remember the day very well because it was on my birthday. I was driving with my five-year-old son and we first heard a loud “Boom” and then before our eyes the rocket fell in the middle of the street, two blocks from us and killed two people whom we knew, an elderly man and a child. My son became most anxious and for the first time I fully understood the real danger that we were in.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Subsequently, the stage of manageability arose. As the following quotes illustrate, the mothers experienced difficult moments when attempting to handle the situation and protect themselves and their children, expressing fear and anxiety but still coping well or at least moderately well. Lior, a mother of four children, said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>First of all I was in the role of a mother, so I had to protect my children. I put the fear away and I became very practical. When the code alarm went on we all ran to the shelter, we took the cell phone with us in case something happened.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Hagit, a mother of three, said,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>When the family was together it was easier, because I could control the situation and make sure that the children were protected in the shelter, more or less, but during the day it was much more difficult, the children went to school most of the time, because they could not stay at home for months, so when the code alarm went on, I wanted to make sure that they were in a safe place. It was a very scary feeling, I coped well, but sometimes those minutes of fear were terrible.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Inbal, a mother of two, talked about her every day experiences, when she had to manage with the dangerous situation but still continue with normal life:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We went to the supermarket to buy food, even during war you have to eat, and suddenly we would hear a terrible boom, what to do? I had all the food with me and the children . . . so I shouted: “run” and we all ran to the car, trying to hold all our food, we got into the car and I started driving home, very fast, just to get to the shelter, I was so afraid, but I managed to stay calm, for myself and for my children.</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="section14-1534765611426792">
<title>Third Stage of PTG and Lengthy Exposure: Meaningfulness Among Mothers Exposed to Long-Term Terror: Positive Outcomes</title>
<p>The stage of meaningfulness is the most crucial for the occurrence of PTG. The mothers’ discourses revealed that the exposure to the ongoing threat led to various growth processes, including becoming stronger, less vulnerable, more able to take responsibility, and more prepared to manage future adversarial situations. These mothers also reported changes in their philosophy of life as well as developing warmer and intimate relationships with meaningful others.</p>
<p>For example, Dana from Sderot, recalled, “I feel that I became much stronger as a result of the situation here in the last few years. I am more sure of myself, I know how to cope with difficult times and it makes me feel good.” And Rachel, from a Moshav near Sderot, said, “Today, I know that I can manage any danger much better than before the exposure to the rocket attacks.” The enhanced ability to act with more flexibly toward others, enjoying the proximity of family members and life in general, is reflected in the words of Shoshana from Sderot.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I learned that I am strong, that I can live and cope with this crazy reality, that I have the courage and strength to cope in any future situation. No matter what happens I will manage by myself. I have much more trust in myself now and this is a result of living here and coping with everything. I also learned to be more flexible, to enjoy my children, not to “drive them to the wall,” because I am aware that we have to live and enjoy the present. No one knows what will happen tomorrow.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Changes in philosophy of life are apparent in the words of Zehava from Sderot:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I learned to enjoy the little things, a picnic with my family, a quite evening at home, after you go through such a period of fear and stress you learn to appreciate more your life and your relationship with your dear ones.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Changes that reflect growing importance attached to relationships with others as well as an increased sense of compassion, particularly for others who are in a similar position, are apparent in the empathy and unity with others who suffer, for example, with Palestinians living in the Gaza strip. Rinat pointed,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The ongoing exposure to the Qassam attacks raised new insights and enriched my soul. There are two sides to this coin: one is the fear and the anxiety that I experienced, but simultaneously my soul was strengthened. I saw beyond the here and now, the immediate fear . . . This encounter created a new growth in me, the awareness of other’s suffering and pain. I work with Palestinian Israelis whose extended families were in Gaza during the war when communication between them was very difficult. I recognized that beyond my own sense of victimization, we have a common destiny, and this awareness made me stronger in a spiritual and emotional way.</p></disp-quote>

<sec id="section15-1534765611426792">
<title>Negative Outcomes: Guilt and Worries in Relation to Children’s Future Psychological Outcomes</title>
<p>Together with these positive PTG processes, the mothers also pointed to the considerable psychological costs incurred as a result of living in an area constantly under the threat of attack. Although some of them claimed that their children coped well with the threatening situation, others described their children’s current PTS symptoms and almost all expressed concerns about future psychological outcomes. This concern about the children elicited guilt feelings among the mothers because of their own decision to live in a dangerous place which exposed their children for many years to constant threat.</p>
<p>For example, Pnina said, “I know that my children were psychologically hurt by the situation, both received professional help, but I am afraid that it will affect their future, and I feel responsible for it.” Limor described the state of affairs from a more optimistic view:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It is not easy to live with the awareness that you chose to live in a place that is harmful to your children, and there is no doubt about it, years of living under threat are harmful for children, no matter how strong they are. I feel guilty about my choice, but I have learned to live with this feeling, knowing that there is no insurance for life, and there could be problems and dangers in other places too. I also know that in life there is no black or white, there are assets and liabilities in every situation, no matter how terrible they are . . . there is a beautiful song by Rachel Shapiro about the “distresses that turn into beauty.” This song strengthens me during hard times for there is no bad without good. This is my perception of life.</p></disp-quote>

<title>Psychological Processes Among Mothers Exposed to Short-Term Terror</title>
<p>These interviews indicated the occurrence of the stages of comprehensibility and manageability but not of the stage of meaningfulness. For this group of mothers, the process of becoming aware of the severity of the situation was quick, as a result of being exposed suddenly and harshly to the new state of terror. Sarit, who lives in a Moshav, described her understanding of the dangerous situation in the following manner:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>As soon as the first Qassam fell here in the fields around the Moshav, I understood that I live in a problematic area and that my life could suddenly become endangered. A few weeks later the war started and I was very aware of the danger.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Lihi, another mother living in a Moshav, recalled,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We knew about the Qassam that, for many years had been falling in the Sderot area. It is not very far from here, about 30 kilometers but it seemed sufficiently far removed not to cause concern, but when the first Qassam fell in this area I was momentarily surprised. Qassam? Here? I immediately hooked into the media which reported in full all that was happening and I followed the army instructions.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Among these mothers the insights and lessons from the war were much more practically oriented, for example, the need to build an indoor shelter in the home. Sarit said, “After the war I understood that we should build an indoor shelter in the house in case rockets fall again in this area, so we are planning to do it soon.” These mothers perceived the state of war as a fleeting situation and continued to view the area as a quiet and secure one. This was reflected in the words of Noa who lives in a Kibbutz: “This area is usually so peaceful and quiet, so there were a few months of instability, but it is over, or at least I hope it is over now. Anyway it is not a reason to leave your home.” At least among some of the mothers a change in relation to others, both close and more distant, was detected. The words of Sigal, a Moshav resident, reflect a deeper appreciation of community support and heightened sense of unity. “I understood how important the community is for me, during the war we got organized, we arranged activities for the children, and we supported each other, especially the women.” A change in relation to others, this time towards the Palestinian neighbors, is apparent in the words of Hadasa, a Moshav resident: “I am very sorry for them, they live in such poor conditions and under occupation for so many years. I would wish them improved lives and maybe one day I will be able to visit Gaza’s market.” Others, like Tamara, were less empathic, claiming that their thoughts were with Israeli soldiers involved in the war: “To be honest, I did not think about the Palestinians at all, but as a woman who was involved in the last war in Lebanon, I was very concerned about our soldiers’ safety.” Most of the mothers believed that their children coped well with the war, and thus no expressions of guilt feelings were detected. Nira, from a Moshav said, “My children were afraid by the ‘boom’ voices of the rockets, but I explained to them what we should do when we hear the ‘Red Code’ alarm and they adjusted very well.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The focus of this research was on processes of coping and PTG as reflected in the narratives of mothers of young children who had been exposed to rocket attacks in the southern part of Israel for long- and short-term periods. Comparison of the two groups of mothers reveals similarities as well as differences in their coping and their PTG processes. In the case of coping, both groups relied on attitudes of optimism, humor, and denial.</p>
<p>These are three emotion-focused coping mechanisms, which according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765611426792">Lazarus and Folkman (1991)</xref> are dominant in situations in which a threat is felt as uncontrollable. The mechanisms help to control distressing emotions and alter the meaning of the situation. The mothers differed considerably in their reliance on ideology as a coping mechanism. War tends to strengthen nationalistic perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611426792">Arndt, Greenberg, Schimel, Pyszcynski, &amp; Solomon, 2002</xref>) and ideology becomes a buffer against fear and insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765611426792">Billig, 2006</xref>). This notion was prevalent among mothers exposed to short-term terror but not for their counterparts exposed to long-term terror. One explanation could be found in the political and geographical situation of living in proximity to the Gaza strip until operation “Cast Iron.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611426792">Azulai (2004)</xref> residents of the area felt neglected by the Israeli government that made no noticeable attempt to enforce a cessation of the rocket attacks and by not helping to overcome the financial damage incurred as result of these attacks.</p>
<p>Coping well or at least moderately well is a necessary step in attaining growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426792">Calhoun &amp; Tedeschi, 2006</xref>), and the mothers exhibited both similarities and differences in terms of PTG stages, processes, and dimensions.</p>
<p>Looking at rumination, this process is triggered by a cognitive work aimed at revising or reestablishing beliefs that constitute the individual assumptive world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765611426792">Janoff-Bulman, 1992</xref>) and is considered to have positive outcomes and to enhance PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611426792">Calhoun &amp; Tedeschi, 2006</xref>). In that respect, both groups of mothers went through rumination, yet to a different qualitative degree. All the mothers were found to exhibit comprehensibility and manageability of the traumatic situation; however, only those exposed for a long-time terror reached the stage of meaningfulness and gained new understandings and insights following their experiences.</p>
<p>These results are in accord with previous suggestions that only after reaching a certain point of PTS without reaching a syndrome level is PTG possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611426792">Butler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765611426792">Linley &amp; Joseph, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>These qualitative differences might serve also to explain the scope of the changes experienced in terms of the various PTG dimensions. Both groups of mothers reported a change in their relationships with others, one that was manifested in several ways. There were mothers who reported more positive relationships with family members as well as tighter bonding with their community. Others also reported feeling more empathic toward the Palestinian civilians, especially women and children living in Gaza.</p>
<p>This mode of empathy contrasts with findings which suggest that victims of terror attacks tend to promote aggression against those who violate their worldview of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765611426792">Hobfoll, Canetti-Nisim, &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>). It is suggested that this aspect of change in relation with others could be attributed to the mothers’ ability to differentiate between the terrorists launching the rockets and the Palestinian civilians who also suffer as a result of these launchings. The current results accord with the suggestion that even during and after wars and terror attacks, at least some of those influenced by such acts could exhibit the ability to overcome the sense of victimization and hold to a more complex perception of empathy and understanding of the other side involved in such acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765611426792">Litvak-Hirsch, Bar-On, &amp; Chaitin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Only mothers exposed to long periods of terror were found to report changes in appreciating themselves as stronger and as exhibiting changes in philosophy of life. It is possible that these changes, in comparison with change in relation with others, follow a more profound change in the individual’s world assumptions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765611426792">Janoff-Bulman (2006)</xref> the sense of “preparedness” is an important component of a growth process which also makes the person more resilient to future threat. Thus three underlying factors of PTG domains are apparent only among mothers exposed to prolonged periods of terror: the social domain (relating to others), individual domain (personal strength), and spiritual domain (appreciation of life). Here a similarity in domains is apparent to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534765611426792">Salo, Qouta, and Punamaki (2005)</xref> who examined PTG among Palestinian political prisoners and found them to exhibit social (relating to others and feeling of belonging), individual (personal strength and new opportunities), and spiritual and philosophical (religiosity and appreciation of life) domains of growth.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current findings testify to the importance of both the social and individual PTG domains in Israeli culture, as these were also apparent among Israeli youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765611426792">Laufer &amp; Solomon, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, we suggest that the unique experiences the individual underwent, the discrete time exposed to terror, led to differing experiences and components of PTG.</p>
<p>Another distinction among the mothers is apparent in terms of guilt feelings and fear for the children’s mental health, reported only among those experiencing prolonged periods of terror. Research suggests that in many cases parents tend to hide or repress their children’s PTS symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765611426792">Cohen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534765611426792">Terr, 1990</xref>). This could suggest that while experiencing personal growth, these mothers felt that the personal gain had or potentially could be accompanied by harm to their children, as children are known to be more vulnerable to stressful situations than adults and exhibit stress symptoms mainly after the dire threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765611426792">Rosenthal &amp; Levy-Shiff, 1993</xref>). A second possibility as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534765611426792">Taylor and Armor (1996)</xref> is that these mothers’ descriptions of growth are actually nothing more than a positive illusion which justifies their decision to live in a dangerous area.</p>
<p>The overall findings indicate that despite the harsh conditions experienced, especially among mothers exposed to long-term terror, processes of coping and PTG are apparent. To professionals working with such populations with such findings may suggest the value of probing clientele perceptions of coping and growth to assist them in their daily lives during and after the threatening situation. At the same time, mental health professionals should be aware that not all is rosy, as these mothers grapple with guilt feelings in relation to the emotional well-being of their children.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations of this study, namely, the small number of participants which potentially is not fully representative, the findings add to the existing knowledge on threat and PTG, by presenting the voices and experiences of the mothers who live under threat, as well as pointing to several future directions of research. From a clinical point of view in situations of ongoing exposure to threat, examining the issue of guilt feelings toward children and other family members more carefully as well as their effects on the mothers’ well-being is needed. A second avenue of research would be to examine the perspectives of fathers living in such conditions, to discern potential similarities and differences in coping and PTG processes between the parents. It would also be interesting to apply the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) on a larger population in the Western Negev that was exposed to both long and short durations of terror and integrate the current research with a more empirical approach.</p>
