<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813i"><title>André Gerrits, <italic>The Myth of Jewish Communism: A Historical Interpretation</italic>, Peter Lang: Bern, 2009; 220 pp.; 9789052014654, £32.00 (pbk)</title>
<p>The notion of communism’s supposedly ‘Jewish’ nature was (and still is) a particularly virulent variety of anti-Semitic stereotype. It has shaped the face of reactionary politics and thought throughout the twentieth century. There is no doubt, then, that this myth calls for a thorough analysis. André Gerrits, however, aims for more. Aligning himself to a ‘revisionist’ school of Jewish studies, he considers it insufficient to give a mere genealogy of ‘Jewish Communism’ as a product of anti-Semitic delusion. Referring to Allport Gordon’s definition of a stereotype as an ‘exaggerated belief’ Gerrits concludes that ‘it should contain at least a … core of reality’ (6). His monograph covers three major topics: (a) the myth of Jewish communism as created by anti-Semites; (b) the factual involvement of Jews in radical and specifically Communist politics; and (c) the interrelations between communist rule and the ‘Jewish question’ in post-war East Central Europe (particularly Poland, Hungary and Romania).</p>
<p>The first part of the book presents a meticulous reconstruction of the origins of the myth of ‘Jewish Communism’, based on an extensive corpus of anti-Semitic literature. ‘Jewish Communism’ is shown as an anti-modern myth, rooted in the image of a ‘Jewish conspiracy’, and being a core aspect of the imagined ‘Jewish international’, consisting of the trinity of ‘Free Masonry, high finance, and Bolshevism’ (64). Gerrits particularly focuses on the construction of links between Jews and Communism in Nazi-sponsored science and propaganda.</p>
<p>In Gerrits’ opinion, to ‘uncouple Jewish behaviour and anti-Jewish thinking is an ahistorical generalisation’ (29). He points out important factors of Jewish agency, such as the perceived mass entry of Jews into non-Jewish politics after the First World War coinciding with the rise of left-wing politics (79). Gerrits also highlights that due to the horrors of past anti-Semitic repression, Jews had every reason to welcome the communist regimes in East Central Europe after the Second World War. What Gerrits deems particularly important is the ‘conspicuousness’ of Jewish activists in the higher echelons of the Communist party and state apparatuses (119), especially with regards to anti-Semitism in some of the Warsaw Pact states in the 1950s and the 1960s. For the latter, the author gives a twofold explanation. Firstly, while in Hungary and Romania the CP had a mass influx of low-ranking ex-Fascists (159), ‘the conspicuous role of Jewish activists was an embarrassment’ (155) for many non-Jewish party leaders. Secondly, in regards to the anti-Semitic purges in the course of de-Stalinization, ‘[d]isassociation from Jews became the primary concern of almost all post-Stalinist leaderships’ because Jewish cadres’ heyday of activity in East Central European party and state apparatuses happened to be during post-war Stalinism (160). While the latter may seem plausible, it is questionable whether the explanation of late-Stalinist anti-Semitism can be drawn solely from rank-and-file pressure without referring to the anti-Semitic features inherent to Stalinism itself.</p>
<p>One can certainly not accuse Gerrits of sharing the myth of ‘Jewish Communism’ with its anti-Semitic adherents. He makes clear the slanderous nature of this notion throughout the book. At some points, though, the author gets caught in dubious reasoning. Considering the relatively small number of Jews among the Bolshevik leadership, for example, he mentions ‘a half-Jew (Kamenev)’ (120). He is on shaky grounds here for two reasons. First, for contemporary anti-Semites, a ‘half-Jew’ was not any better than a ‘full’ Jew, and Lev Kamenev was a target for them just for being born Rosenfeld. Secondly, this identifies him as a Jew without taking his personal identity into account. Kamenev was brought up in a Christian household by a non-Jewish mother and a converted father. Here as elsewhere a central flaw becomes apparent: the book lacks a stringent definition of Jewishness. Gerrits talks about ‘different identities Jewish radicals combined’ (195), but in the end he implicitly adheres to the genealogical definition of Jewishness, which simply characterizes them as ‘activists of Jewish descent’ (118). Yet for anti-Semites this very genealogical notion stood as justification for the myth of ‘Jewish Communism’.</p>
<p>Gerrits’ merit lies in having tackled the myth of ‘Jewish Communism’ in a multifaceted perspective. The qualities of the monograph are to be found particularly in its broad geographical focus, as well as in the vast body of consulted literature. However, the book’s methodical ambiguities, and the fact that, as Gerrits admits, the analysis ‘floats relatively freely throughout the book’ (11), tends to rather confuse the reader. It remains unclear why the ‘kernel of truth’ approach to anti-Semitism, despite its recent deconstruction by Lars Fischer (<italic>The Socialist Response to Antisemitism in Imperial Germany</italic>, 2007), should remain fruitful. The preoccupation with ‘facts’ and statistics as a means to analyse the myth of ‘Jewish Communism’ seems much less convincing than the discourse analysis employed by Ulrich Herbeck in his recent monograph (<italic>Das Feindbild vom ‘jüdischen Bolschewiken’, </italic>2009).</p>
