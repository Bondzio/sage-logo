<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813ab"><title>Annemarie Steidl, Josef Ehmer, Stan Nadel and Hermann Zeitlhofer, eds, <italic>European Mobility: Internal, International, and Transatlantic Moves in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries</italic>, V &amp; R Unipress: Göttingen, 2009; 251 pp.; 9783899715118, €31.90 (pbk)</title>
<p>This book contains 13 essays originally presented at an international conference in Salzburg, in 2003. Two essays focus on international migration within Europe, five on transatlantic migration, and six on the interaction between internal and international migration.</p>
<p>Annemarie Steidl’s ‘Introduction’ opens with a quotation from Peter Marschalck: ‘The history of migration research has mainly been the history of transatlantic or continental migration, of emigration from one country and immigration to another one’. While Steidl emphasizes the connections between internal and international migration, and how these have not been sufficiently studied, the essays in the book tend to fall back into observing individual types of migration rather than the totality of movements.</p>
<p>Angiolina Arru writes about credit circulation among immigrants in nineteenth-century Italy, in order to observe the social networks that migrants established. Her focus on networks of credit is thought-provoking and original, but the significance of her two individual cases remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Lars Olsson describes in detail another of the seemingly countless streams of seasonal migration in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe: the yearly movements of Poles from Galicia to a kaolin factory in a Swedish village. Olsson shows the methods of exploitation of the poor Galicians by labour recruiters and factory management. Because the decades before World War I probably represent the peak of seasonal mobility across Europe, these individual cases should be analysed collectively as final attempts by peasant families to preserve their rural way of life against the pressures of industrialization.</p>
<p>The five essays on migration from Europe to North America offer useful insights into the structures of migration which were created by the interaction between the needs of millions of individual migrants on one hand, and the changing economies in which they worked on the other hand.</p>
<p>Dirk Hoerder, one of the most thoughtful and prolific migration scholars of our time, links the broadly theoretical discussion on worldwide migration systems, with the mainly illustrative stories of some Scandinavians who moved to Canada. He demonstrates how migrants’ agency influenced the larger structures within which they moved.</p>
<p>Jochen Krebber concentrates on the concept of chain migration and focuses on emigration from Württemberg to North America; he shows that informed choices could lead migrants to follow or break established chains. Krebber identifies differences in religion, class and work skills, as obstacles to the flow which perpetuates migration chains. His identification of three separate streams of North American immigrants from one German village, divided especially by rural class differences, demonstrates again the value of intensive source analysis.</p>
<p>Adam Walaszek brings to English readers the little-known 1938 work by Krystyna Duda-Dziewierz on migration from the Polish village of Babica to the US. Duda-Dziewierz used her detailed social analysis to show how class affected the mobility of rural families. Poorer families from the periphery of Babica were more likely to migrate than the more prosperous farmers who lived in the centre of the village.</p>
<p>Stan Nadel, an American labour historian teaching in Salzburg, notes that ‘historians have failed to look for’ patterns of internal migration which followed a transatlantic move. To show how common was this extensive and continuous mobility of immigrants, Nadel follows the careers of some well-known labour activists and radicals, such as the Haymarket martyrs, and Sacco and Vanzetti.</p>
<p>Tibor Frank’s article discusses Franz Boas’ work on immigrants to New York in the early twentieth century, and shows how anthropometric measurements could be used to combat the racism of American eugenics and immigration restrictions.</p>
<p>The essays in the final section focus on interactions between internal and international migration, presenting what seems to be almost cutting-edge research on the topic. Both Andreina De Clementi for Italy, and Marie-Pierre Arrizabalaga for the Basque region, show that cities were less important as destinations than people have assumed from census results. Hermann Zeitlhofer’s essay is a model demonstration of the diversity of destinations, internal and overseas, seasonal and more permanent, which were available to Bohemian migrants. Dorota Praszałowicz’s work appears to be at an early stage, but she adds religion to the social factors which influenced choice of destinations for Polish migrants from the German Empire. Steidl’s essay on the late Austrian Empire shows that the paths of overseas migrants depended on the rural or urban nature of their birthplaces.</p>
<p>Brian McCook’s excellent essay shows the similarities of prejudice and discrimination that Polish migrants in the Ruhr and in Pennsylvania suffered from, as well as the locally determined reactions of the migrants, who displayed behaviour which he terms ‘transnational’.</p>
<p>Although collections of conference papers often appear thematically scattered, the authors who contributed to this book all seem to reject the modernization thesis about migration in favour of careful studies of how socioeconomic differences resulted in alternative paths and destinations for migrants. They thus demonstrate the importance of detailed local studies for understanding the choices migrants made within a world of alternative destinations.</p>
