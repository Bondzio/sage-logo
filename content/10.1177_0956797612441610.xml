<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612441610">Ullrich and Schlüter (2012)</xref> plotted the Time 1 sexism and Time 2 Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) residuals from the aggregate-level data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612441610">Brandt (2011)</xref> and found that sexism had significantly reduced power as a predictor of prospective gender inequality when they excluded several previously unidentified influential cases. Influential outliers are clearly problematic in statistical analyses, but one should not remove outliers simply because they are outliers. One justification for removing an outlier is that the particular data point represents a subject that is not actually part of the population that is being sampled. However, it is difficult to argue that Switzerland, Italy, or any other country for that matter is not part of the population of “countries,” regardless of how extreme its data point may be in a distribution. When an observation is clearly a part of the underlying population, one alternative to deleting the observation is to recode the data to reduce the deviance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612441610">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>, p. 77). Rather than removing scores wholesale, one can temper data points to be commensurate with other nonoutlying data points at the high end of the distribution.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612441610">Figure 1</xref> presents the scatter plot of the Time 1 sexism and Time 2 GEM residuals after removal of the variance shared with the Time 1 Human Development Index and Time 1 GEM; the figure shows data points for Egypt both before and after recoding its outlying score on the sexism residual and for Switzerland, Italy, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States both before and after recoding their scores on the GEM residual (see the Supplemental Material available online for more information about the recoding of outliers). This recoding significantly reduced the disproportionate impact of these previously influential data points, but still allowed them to be a part of the sample. In both the original model and the recoded residuals model, the regression coefficient was negative and significant. Researchers using multilevel data should diligently search for outliers, but outliers should not be removed indiscriminately when they are clearly a part of the population under study. In the current case, when the influential data points are tempered, rather than eliminated, the originally reported effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612441610">Brandt, 2011</xref>) still holds.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612441610">Ullrich and Schlüter (2012)</xref> were able to reanalyze the data from my study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612441610">Brandt, 2011</xref>) because the data were easily available. Open data allow independent researchers to judge and test the veracity of an author’s conclusions under differing circumstances and assumptions. The transparency of the data I used is unique; however, it is not clear that these data should be the exception. Science is a collaborative process that extends from the initial spark of an idea to its debate in a journal’s pages, around the water cooler, and at coffee breaks during the next conference. Open data encourage this productive back-and-forth.</p>
