<p>When faced with vexing problems in hospitality management, we may see evidence in front of us that suggests an obvious solution, or a solution that is consistent with conventional wisdom. But what we see on the surface may not reveal the actual situation—and conventional wisdom is often fraught with inaccuracies. Management by conventional wisdom often means institutionalizing and repeating mistakes. Research is one powerful way to test our assumptions and conventional wisdom—to begin to determine whether what we think we know is so.</p>
<p>In this issue of <italic>Cornell Hospitality Quarterly</italic>, you see articles that test conventional wisdom on several topics. Likewise, the research reports and other publications issued by the Cornell Center for Hospitality Research (CHR) present studies that provide new windows into hospitality-related topics. Our motivation, of course, is to help the hospitality industry improve its operations, serve customers better, and boost revenues and profits. But beyond that, we hope to create a repository of knowledge that will reshape conventional wisdom and be the basis for even more effective hospitality-management thought in the future.</p>
<p>At the CHR, we seek to develop streams of research on diverse topics because we know that a single study—no matter how strong its methodology and conclusions—cannot be the final word. If nothing more, we need to repeat studies or, better still, come at a problem from different angles. That is why we consult with our excellent advisory board members for their input on management problems that need new solutions and also invite proposals from academic researchers. One group might spot an issue that the other has overlooked. Beyond that, of course, we at CHR want to provide a mechanism to connect industry and academe. The recently concluded Cornell Hospitality Research Summit, which brought together a balanced group of top-level university researchers and industry practitioners, is an example of that effort.</p>
<p>Going forward, we support research on new markets, new media, and new management metrics. For example, it is increasingly important to study how the hospitality industry can make the most appropriate use of social media—how to manage it and how to measure it. We are currently investigating the effects of Internet connectivity on the meetings business and the leisure cruise industry, so expect to see new CHR reports on these topics soon. And we continue our exploration of how to define and measure sustainability for the hospitality industry. At the same time, our research fellows are working on more traditional topics, such as how to make service procedures even more effective and how to get the most out of a hospitality brand.</p>
<p>We welcome researchers in all areas to participate in this knowledge-building effort, both by submitting articles to the <italic>Cornell Hospitality Quarterly</italic> and by proposing topics for CHR research projects. We also encourage industry practitioners to suggest areas for research. My goal as the still relatively new academic director of the CHR is to keep the established research dialogue going, but to direct the conversation into new hospitality topics, so that we can strive to determine at least if part of what we know actually is so.</p>
