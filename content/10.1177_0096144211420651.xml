<p>The two books under examination here are both important studies of urban culture in the Low Countries. Robert Stein and Judith Pollmann’s <italic>Networks, Regions, and Nations</italic> sheds light on the urban elites and rulers who propagated a sense of regional and supraregional identification during the late medieval and early modern period. Derek Phillips’s <italic>Well-being in Amsterdam’s Golden Age</italic> focuses more narrowly on the preeminent city of the Dutch Republic in the second half of the seventeenth century. These two books display divergent approaches to identity and subject formation. On one hand, the contributors to Stein and Pollmann’s edited volume focus on socially constructed elements of collective identity. Its premise is that although the people of the Low Countries had neither a kingdom as the basis for a nation (as did France), nor a single ethnocultural definition around which they could rally (as did the subjects of the Holy Roman Empire), members of the ruling elite staked many, occasionally contradictory, claims to “natural” identity through chronicles, patriotic histories, plays, songs, legislation, exemplary punishments of treachery, processions, and state ritual.</p>
<p>Phillips, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Amsterdam, on the other hand, examines elements of personal identity that people had little or no control over, namely, social status, economic standing, and gender, to assess the quality of life of the inhabitants of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. He claims that because humans are largely “the same across time and space” (p. 11), we can use our experiences, empathy, and contemporary research on emotions to learn more about the people of the past. His book is primarily a study of a wide range of secondary sources—histories of the Dutch golden age, as well as the scholarship of public health officials, biologists, economists, demographers, psychologists, and sociologists—to ascertain what life was like.</p>
<p>This is a very descriptive account of life in Amsterdam—Phillips explores the inhabitants’ origins, the work they did, and where they lived within Amsterdam; he vividly sketches the squalor of life for the poor—the experience of disease, open sewers, chamber pots, foul smells, limited water supply for washing, and the constant possibility of death—and what was it like to be a servant, a single man or woman, what it was like to lose family members, what it was like to be raised an orphan. The book’s greatest strength lies in uncovering the ways men, women, and children experienced inequalities. Phillips is incredibly sensitive to the differences between citizen and immigrant, male and female, and wealthy and poor. Throughout the book, Phillips describes the lived experience of subordination and its impact on every aspect of life.</p>
<p>Particularly fascinating is his portrayal of the very different fates of orphans of different socioeconomic classes. While relatives raised the orphaned children of the very wealthy, the rest were directed to two distinct orphanages according to their socioeconomic status. The <italic>burgerweeshuis</italic> was for young children of parents who had been citizens for more than seven years; orphans at this institution could expect good food, clothing, and training commensurate with that of their parents (for boys, this meant an apprenticeship, and for girls, this meant learning to sew, knit, clean, and cook). The <italic>aalmoezeniersweehuis</italic> was for the children of parents who did not meet the citizenship requirement, whether because they had recently moved to Amsterdam or were too poor to purchase citizenship. These children could expect lower quality food, less colorful uniforms, and a life of unskilled work. This example demonstrates that even when personal tragedy struck, local officials were ready to stabilize the social hierarchy that subordinated poor, noncitizens to better off citizens; no one would be allowed to rise above or fall below their station in life.</p>
<p>Phillips’s account is also particularly mindful of the plight of women. He highlights the fact that women earned less and were thus under enormous pressure to marry, but the smaller number of available husbands undercut their likelihood of doing so. If one succeeded in finding a husband, she found herself subordinate to him and in danger of death during childbirth. Phillips even attempts to assess women’s emotional reaction to subordination by weighing the likelihood that a husband “had a benevolent concern for his wife’s well-being” against the danger that “excessive concern for the reactions of the more powerful person always undercuts or threatens self-respect and integrity” (p. 117).</p>
<p>Although Phillips makes a valid point about the limitations of accessing “truth” about seventeenth-century experiences through the surviving primary source material, and his alternative methodology allows for a greater sensitivity to the lived experience of subordination, this book would benefit from a more rigorous theoretical examination of his position. His assessment that all humans share a similar motivation to attain physical, economic, and social well-being, self-esteem, and autonomy ignores the fact that some people, such as the devoutly religious, pride themselves on eschewing most, if not all, of these. While Phillips agrees with Lyndal Roper’s assessment that sexual difference is an essential element of human history and that sexual difference is based on essential physiological difference, he could benefit from her understandings of the complex interplay between the physical, the psychological, and the cultural.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211420651">1</xref></sup> A more serious limitation of this book is the frequent failure of the notes to provide adequate evidence, leaving the reader who attempts to verify his claims frustrated.</p>
<p>Focusing on the opportunities for self-identification open to more powerful men in the Low Countries, Stein and Pollmann, both faculty members at Leiden University, have produced a volume that is both a brilliant analysis of the current state of the field and an advance into new territory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211420651">2</xref></sup> The organization of and introduction to this volume are excellent. Stein discusses briefly the specific moments of, and limits to, the unification of the Low Countries, he engages the historiography by challenging Eric Hobsbawm and other so-called modernists’ understanding of the terms “nation” and “nationalism,” and he emphasizes the lessons that the following chapters teach about identity formation. Stein draws readers’ attention to the consensus that identities are volatile, dynamic, and “continually reinvented and manipulated in order to legitimize the existing situation or to mobilize forces to attain new goals” (p. 13). He also explains that when the people of the Low Countries asserted their identities, they frequently used mythical stories of origin and diverse forms of media, freedom or liberty are frequent themes, warfare played a major role in distinguishing peoples, and the figure of the prince could serve as either the symbol of the community or as the enemy of the <italic>patria</italic>.</p>
<p>Continuing to place questions of identification into a broader theoretical context, Peter Hoppenbrouwers, professor of medieval history at Leiden University, presents scholars with a new model for studying premodern national identity. Offering a bold challenge to those who claim that the nation is a modern invention, he argues that there is no single moment when premodern ethnies, or ethnic communities, disappeared and modern nations appeared, but rather that “nations and nationalisms took a long time to develop. Their evolution must be seen as a complex, non-linear process, rather than as a simple, linear succession of stages” (p. 29). What distinguishes modern and premodern national identification is the fact that premodern feelings lack the “comprehensiveness of ‘total’ social support, that characterizes modern nationalism” (p. 27). Hoppenbrouwers also highlights the problems inherent in studying identification but asserts that boundary situations are among the most insightful, since these “enable ethnic or national feelings to override social inequalities” (p. 37).</p>
<p>Hoppenbrouwers also raises the compelling question of how feelings of identification are commuted “between the local, the (truly) national, and eventually the supra-national levels” (p. 41), an issue touched on in the regional studies of three University of Leiden doctoral students, Justine Smithuis, Sjoerd Bijker, and Aart Noordzij (now a postdoctoral fellow at Leiden). Smithuis explains that the coexistence of contrasting discourses of identity, one asserting loyalty to Friesland and one to the town of Sneek, is a result of the precarious political situation of fifteenth-century Friesland, threatened by Burgundy and the Habsburg empire. Bijker demonstrates that urban authors fostered a Brabantine identity on the basis of the leadership of their prestigious ducal dynasty, an identification that survived Brabant’s incorporation into the Burgundian state. Noordzij also explores an expression of regional and supraregional identity in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Guelders. He proposes that a Guelders identity was hostility to everything Burgundian and attachment to the Holy Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The bulk of the essays illuminate the fact that identity formation was a contested terrain that frequently pitted rulers against urban elites, as each attempted to attain the power to define the community and control its members’ loyalties. From roughly 1384 (to 1567 in the northern provinces), the Habsburg-Burgundian rulers were successful in negotiating and sometimes coercively imposing identity in many parts of the Low Countries. Peter Arnade, professor of history at California State University, San Marcos, discusses numerous cases in which rulers, such as Philip the Good (1419-1467), Charles the Bold (1467-1477), and Charles V (1519-1556), violently squelched civic opposition through acts of princely triumphalism that included dismantling city walls, raiding houses, and assaulting citizens. In the long run, however, this princely repression sowed the seeds of a heightened civic consciousness that flourished after the arrival of the Duke of Alba in 1567. Steve Gunn, lecturer in modern history at Merton College, Oxford, focuses on the Habsburgs’ use of both repression and propaganda in wartime between 1477 and 1559 to impose supraprovincial identities on their subjects. These activities ranged from the exemplary punishment of traitors to the intensive reporting of wartime activities, polemical songs, poems, and chronicles favorable to the Habsburgs and unflattering to the Valois kings and processions to invoke divine aid for victory.</p>
<p>Arguing for a less repressive and more broadly generated identity, Anne-Laure van Bruaene, professor of history at Ghent University, explores how both the courtly and civic elites negotiated identity in the public realm, through the devotion of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary and through the chambers of rhetoric and the shooting guilds. She posits that while Habsburg rulers at both ends of the sixteenth century were keenly aware of their need to affirm their authority through dynastic and civic public ritual and propaganda, their carefully scripted performances “also responded to, or were even initiated by, citizens, in particular urban elites who had as much to gain from these theatrical dialogue as their rulers” (p. 136). David Potter, lecturer in history at the University of Kent, finds a similar interplay of urban public opinion and royal propaganda in France particularly during the Italian and Habsburg wars (1490-1560). He concludes that the need to find support for their wars motivated French monarchs to engage the educated elite by explaining their actions and keeping the people informed; in return, historians and pamphleteers supported the French kings and their war efforts.</p>
<p>Several authors focus on the contributions the urban elites made to supraregional identification. Stein argues that cloth merchants’ networks and many other forms of interurban exchange form the basis for group identification. This essay is the most radical in its effort to uncover an identity that is not coterminous with modern political boundaries and for finding supraprovincial identity as early as the twelfth century in the southern Low Countries and extending into the north in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Alastair Duke, formerly reader in history at the University of Southampton, clearly outlines the contours of a common Netherlandish identity that was fostered initially by the state’s limited political unification of the Low Countries in the 1540s. He explains that by the 1550s, urban elites asserted their own ideas of unity by staging pageants and printing maps that “contained coy expressions of . . . national awareness” (p. 230). By the 1570s, these urban elites took this drive for unity yet further by fanning the flames of Hispanophobia and frequently deployed the term “patriot” as a rallying cry. Pollmann, professor of the history and culture of the Dutch Republic, focuses on the later period, 1585 to 1621, exploring why an appeal to a “Netherlandish” identity (so new in the 1560s) became widespread by the beginning of the seventeenth century, both within the republic and in the Habsburg Netherlands. Her essay explains that Reformed exiles from Flanders and Brabant were in fact the most vocal in demonizing Netherlanders who remained loyal to Spain as <italic>gespanioliseerden</italic>, a denunciation that focused the Dutch people on what united them, namely, their hatred of all things Spanish. Robert von Friedeburg, chair of history at the Erasmus School of History, Culture, and Communication, demonstrates how intellectual and administrative elites of the Holy Roman Empire used the notion of a common fatherland in opposition to the emperor.</p>
<p>This volume has two minor flaws: it lacks brief author biographies, and Potter’s essay focused on French identity seems to stand aloof from the rest of the volume. There is no question about the value of comparatively studying identity formation and that Stein has dutifully worked to incorporate Potter’s submission in his introduction. However, Potter missed many opportunities to relate his findings to those of other contributors, for example, Gunn’s analysis of the impact of warfare and princely persuasion on identity. This criticism does not apply to Von Friedburg’s work focused on German identity, because he ties it more closely to the rest of the volume through his concern with the terms “nation” and “fatherland”—concepts Netherlandish authors also used—and his examination of lands that become part of the inheritance of Philip II and later fell under the Union of Utrecht.</p>
<p>A question that both of these books engender concerns the connection of identity and language. For the early period, Stein reports that during the Middle Ages, people intermingled easily across the linguistic divide of the Low Countries, attending plays in French and Dutch without distinction. Noordzij and Phillips, on the other hand, see language as a means to distinguish one group from another. In late fifteenth-century Guelders, Noordzij explains, “The word ‘Burgundy’ suggested centralization, loss of independence, and violence. But it also had the connotation of ‘French-speaking strangers’” (p. 117). Phillips highlights that elites used Latin and French as a means of social distinction and that “language served to ‘place’ the city’s inhabitants, both in terms of where they came from and where they belonged in the civic hierarchy” (p. 85). Hoppenbrouwers warns that while the proliferation of a single language does not signal a surge of nationalism, the triumph of the king’s French in the late Middle Ages “did contribute to the formation of a French national identity” (p. 36). It thus seems true that although cultures and polities can transcend the challenges of a multilingual community, elites can also use language as a tool for distinction and alienation if need be. It also seems likely that language became a much more important tool of distinction in the seventeenth century, both as a means to unify the inhabitants of the republic against outsiders and as a way for the elites to distinguish themselves from the common folk.</p>
<p>These books balance each other out very nicely. Stein and Pollmann’s volume focuses our attention on the façades powerful men constructed to project the appearance of unity. Philips’s book highlights the differences between individuals living behind those façades; it serves as a useful reminder that when we focus on the cultural and political sources of identity formation, we must not forget that the communities they imagine are just that: imagined.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211420651">3</xref></sup> The differences between rich and poor, citizen and immigrant, man and woman remained obvious to the people of the Low Countries even when they expressed feelings of unity.</p>
