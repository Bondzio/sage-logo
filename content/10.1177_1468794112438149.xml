<abstract>
<p>This article shows how artefacts – and more specifically documents and visualizations such as images, maps and plans – can be analysed in detail within an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic perspective focusing on the way in which they are manipulated within social activities. The aim is double. On the one hand, the article deals with the way in which the temporal and interactional feature of inscriptions in interaction can be preserved and analysed on the basis of video data, highlighting some of the challenges of producing adequate video recordings and video transcriptions of these phenomena. On the other hand, the article offers an empirical study of a professional activity in which participants manipulate texts, plans and other visualizations. Thus, it analyses in detail a meeting video recorded in an architectural office, in which three architects read, discuss, and draw plans, as well as explore and discover ideas by formulating, gesticulating, and sketching them.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article discusses the way in which the praxeological and temporal character of inscriptions in interaction can be preserved and analysed on the basis of video data. It makes explicit some challenges for the practices of video recording, video transcription and video analysis represented by activities manipulating artefacts such as texts, maps, and plans. These challenges are developed through an empirical analysis of activities involving visualizations and inscriptions, video recorded in an architectural office.</p>
<p>In this introduction, I present some issues related to the analytical mentality of Ethnomethodology (EM) and Conversation Analysis (CA), their requirements regarding video data, and the preservation of the time of action within these recordings. I then focus on the issues raised by the analysis of documents in interaction and the way in which the collection, transcription and analysis of video data can preserve their temporality. These issues are discussed in the analysis of a meeting, in which three architects read, discuss, and draw plans in the course of their ordinary work. Three fragments are analysed in detail: in the first, various inscriptions are read, instructing the future work of the architects; in the second, a drawing is inscribed during the interaction; in the third, a solution is collectively discovered, first by gesticulating over the plan, then by formulating it, and finally by drawing it. The discussion section highlights issues concerning the temporality of inscriptions-in-interaction.</p>
<p>Aiming at researching social interaction as it is locally achieved and organized by the participants in the emergent course of their actions, CA is characterized, from its very beginnings, by a careful attention to the way in which social interaction is documented and made observable. The use of audio and video recordings of naturally occurring activities results from an analytical interest for the details of action as they are temporally and sequentially arranged, moment-by-moment, by the participants.</p>
<p>CA is interested in the endogenous organization of social activities in their ordinary settings: it considers social interaction as collectively organized by the co-participants, in a locally situated way, achieved incrementally through the mobilization of a range of vocal, verbal, visual and embodied resources, which are publicly displayed and monitored in situ.</p>
<p>This has consequences for the way in which data are collected. The importance of audio and video recordings within CA emerges from these analytical demands: CA insists on the study of ‘naturally occurring activities’ as they ordinarily happen in social settings and, consequently, on the necessity of recordings of situated activities for a detailed analysis of their relevant endogenous order (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794112438149">Goodwin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794112438149">Heath et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468794112438149">Knoblauch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468794112438149">Lomax and Casey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468794112438149">Mondada, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468794112438149">2008c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468794112438149">in press</xref>).</p>
<p>One crucial feature of this endogenous order is its temporality: action and interaction unfold in real time, within the emergent, incremental achievement of action, moment by moment, as it is contingently and interactively managed by participants. They orient to the temporal dimension of action in a dynamic way, both prospectively projecting the imminent and next actions, and retrospectively examining the sequential relations between one action and the next. Time structures human action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468794112438149">Rawls, 2005</xref>): it organizes language in talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794112438149">Auer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794112438149">Auer et al., 1999</xref>), as well as gesture and other embodied conducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794112438149">Goodwin, 2002</xref>), but also objects as they are actively used within action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468794112438149">Streeck, 1996</xref>), and space as it is actively arranged through and for action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468794112438149">Goodwin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794112438149">Kendon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468794112438149">Mondada, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of temporality for the study of action implies strong requirements as far as the empirical data on which its analysis is based are concerned. Audio and video recordings aim at preserving interaction as it unfolds in time, from the opening to the closing, in continuous records of the ongoing activity. Video allows us to document time in a complex fashion: action presents different simultaneous layers of temporal conducts – such as talk, gestures, gaze, body movements, postures of all of the participants – which are timely coordinated and mutually adjusted in a finely tuned way. One of the challenges of video recording social action is precisely the continuous documentation of all of these layers of timed action – which is often impossible to achieve with one camera and difficult to solve with several. Another challenge is the documentation of these actions at different levels of granularity: the temporality of a speaker’s gesture is not visible at the same level as her writing on a sheet of paper. Both are impossible to document within a unique view; they generally need one camera for each level of granularity (e.g. one camera focused on participants’ action and another one on the surface where writing, drawing, and other inscriptions are done).</p>
<p>Video recording is itself a temporal practice: documenting the continuous unfolding time of an activity is not always straightforward, especially if the action starts in unexpected ways, and if participants move and engage in unexpected actions. Panning, tilting, zooming camera movements require an anticipation of the trajectory they follow and are often late – displaying the proto-analytical interpretation of the current action by the cameraman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794112438149">Buscher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468794112438149">Macbeth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468794112438149">Mondada, 2006</xref>). Video transcription and analysis are a practice manipulating time too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794112438149">Buscher, 2005</xref>: 2.3), implying frame per frame views, slow motion views, repeated views, rewinding, playing the tape back and forth. Even if the aim is to reconstruct a perspective on action ‘for another next first time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794112438149">Garfinkel, 2002</xref>: 98, 216), the practices through which this reconstruction is done imply complex temporal alternations. Moreover, the practice of transcribing talk and other embodied conducts can be seen as a way of reducing time to the fixation of the written text: this reduction is alleviated by aligning the original signal with the transcript’s text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468794112438149">Mondada, 2007</xref>), but remains a characteristic of published work on paper. Transcription conventions aim at representing time, such as in pauses, overlaps and the notation of other concomitant simultaneous conducts, such as in multimodal multilayered transcripts. Every one of these practices raises consequential issues about the preservation and re-presentation of time. They are even more crucial for actions using artefacts and inscriptions: in this case, the challenge is to preserve the temporality of objects-in-action instead of erasing it, as in many approaches reducing inscriptions to a-temporal and inert objects.</p>

<title>Inscriptions-in-action</title>
<p>This article focuses on the temporal features of a particular kind of object – inscriptions – as they are mobilized and achieved within social interaction.</p>
<p>The role of inscriptions in social life has attracted a renewed interest in the social sciences – from anthropology focusing on the power of the internal structure of texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794112438149">Goody, 1977</xref>) and literacy studies advocating the study of literacy practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794112438149">Barton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1468794112438149">Street, 1984</xref>), to semiotic studies emphasizing the composite materiality of texts and images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794112438149">Kress and Leuwen, 2001</xref>) to computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) studies on the uses of various artefacts in the technologized workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468794112438149">Sellen and Harper, 2001</xref>). In particular, the field of science and technology studies (STS) has highlighted the importance of scientific representations as they are used by scientists in their routine work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794112438149">Latour 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468794112438149">Lynch and Woolgar, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468794112438149">Vinck, 1999</xref>) and of their powerful structuring effects on the production of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468794112438149">Latour, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468794112438149">Lynch, 1988</xref>). Despite this growing interest in the role of inscriptions in social life, there remains a paucity of research concerned with the detailed practices by which they are used and produced in and through the details of social interaction.</p>
<p>Within EM and CA, the emphasis on actual practices observed in a naturalistic perspective has produced a renewed vision of the way in which texts work, and are read and written (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794112438149">Drew, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794112438149">Livingston, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468794112438149">Watson, 2010</xref>). Video recordings of actual practices allow researchers to document the situated, sequential and temporal use of inscriptions. For example, in medical settings, the way doctors turn to them during the medical encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794112438149">DiMatteo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794112438149">Heath, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468794112438149">Robinson, 1998</xref>) or produce them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794112438149">Heath, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468794112438149">Heath and Luff, 1996</xref>) has been documented. Likewise, the reflexive constitution of artefacts and inscriptions by the way in which they are locally mobilized within service encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468794112438149">Moore et al., 2010</xref>), work activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468794112438149">Jenkings and Barber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794112438149">Luff et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468794112438149">Suchman, 2000</xref>) and scientific practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468794112438149">Mondada, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468794112438149">Ochs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468794112438149">Roth and Lawless, 2002</xref>) has been studied.</p>
<p>These analyses rely in a crucial way on details made available on video recordings: the embodied conduct of the participants, the spatial environment in which their bodies are disposed, the material objects they manipulate in their activities. Goodwin’s study of the use of the Munsell chart by archeologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794112438149">1999</xref>) details this complex web of multimodal resources in an exemplary way. He describes the work of archeologists excavating the dirt and examining its colour, holding a coding form to be filled with soil description and the Munsell chart allowing the comparison between different nuances of colour. The mobilization of the chart is done in an ordered way, aligned with other movements, such as the arrangement of the bodies, the participants’ gaze, their pointing gesture, the holding of the trowel, and their talk, which together make it possible to compare the colours of the Munsell chart with the colour of the dirt sample, agreeing, disagreeing, negotiating the final category to inscribe in the form. ‘Seeing’ colour with the Munsell chart is not the automatic result of a procedure; it is a situated achievement needing the previous alignment of the local action space and, thus, requiring time. In turn, the analysis of the use of the Munsell chart is based on various video views of the archeologists’ action, some of them being quite narrowly framed close-ups, and the reproduction of various materials (an example of soil description form, various pictures of the Munsell chart, the Munsell book).</p>
<p>The challenge of this kind of analysis is the reconstruction of the moment-by-moment temporality of the emergent reading of the chart. In the next section, we further discuss the requirements making this kind of analysis possible.</p>

<title>Dealing with inscriptions within architecture work</title>
<p>Among many professional practices, architecture is a perspicuous setting for the study of the activities mobilizing, reading, transforming, and creating inscriptions. Architecture is a work setting characterized by an abundance of artefacts: sketches, different types of plans, scale models, 3D visualizations, photographs, and documents are mobilized within a large variety of activities, for experimenting ideas and imagining possible worlds, for designing details and increasing precise objectivations of future buildings, for communicating with clients and public audiences, etc. What characterizes these artefacts is that they do not represent any pre-existing building, but are engaged in the emergent making of building ‘in-the-process-of-becoming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468794112438149">Schmidt and Wagner, 2004</xref>: 363).</p>
<p>Despite being a fascinating field for the analysis of artefacts in the making, architectural practices have been scarcely studied: the majority of studies are based on final products of architectural design, such as master plans or finally built edifices. Some ethnographic studies, however, have emphasized the uses of inscriptions and technologies within the work of the architect (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794112438149">Cuff, 1991</xref> for a participatory ethnography; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468794112438149">Söderström, 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1468794112438149">Yaneva, 2009</xref> from a STS perspective inspired by Latour; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468794112438149">Iedema, 2001</xref>, from a semiotic perspective; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468794112438149">Schmidt and Wagner, 2004</xref> in a CSCW perspective) – although most ethnographic studies of design have been concentrating on engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794112438149">Bucciarelli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468794112438149">Henderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468794112438149">Vinck, 2003</xref>). Most of these studies are based on interviews and participant observation, as well as collection of inscriptions on the field. Even if photography is used, video is almost absent.</p>
<p>By contrast, video has been largely used in the few EMCA studies on architecture focusing on the multimodal embodied conducts of the architects and on their use of inscriptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468794112438149">LeBaron (1998)</xref> studies architects’ gestures as they travel from one meeting to another, becoming increasingly symbolic through their repeated performance and becoming an essential element in the construction of a sharing understanding. Also focusing on gesture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468794112438149">Murphy (2005)</xref> concentrates on the mimicking of possible movements, uses, and experiences within the planned environment as they are ‘perceived in the hypothetical mode’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794112438149">Buscher (2006)</xref> studies landscape architects as they are engaged in seeing, imagining, observing, assessing landscapes and the effects of future buildings on them, and as they use a rich array of technologies for achieving an ‘augmented imagination’. Technologies make possible different forms of ‘professional vision’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794112438149">Goodwin, 1994</xref>), as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794112438149">Buscher (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794112438149">Ivarsson (2010)</xref>. The latter focuses on the transformations of the architects’ practices when they shift from the two-dimensional section plan to software producing three-dimensional visualizations. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468794112438149">Lymer (2009)</xref> describes a critical review of architectural projects done by students, as a locus of socialization of their professional vision.</p>
<p>In these studies, video is crucial for capturing the living practices of the architects. Its representation in the form of transcripts shows a variety of adaptations of the Jeffersonian conventions used in CA to transcribe talk: transcripts become composite images, integrating not only talk, but also video frame grabs and reproductions of plans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468794112438149">Murphy, 2005</xref>); the juxtaposition of various views creates sequences of complex images (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794112438149">Buscher, 2006</xref>), in which talk eventually becomes marginal, occupying the interstices left, adopting conventions inspired by comic strips (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794112438149">Buscher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794112438149">Ivarsson, 2010</xref>). The solutions invented by the analysts to solve representational problems within transcripts increasingly resemble the composite inscriptions they study.</p>
<p>Some of these solutions, as well as others, are experimented in the analysis offered in the remainder of this article, focusing on the video recording of a meeting in an architectural firm in Paris. The main focus of this empirical study is the temporality of inscriptional practices as it can be reconstructed and represented within the analysis.</p>
<p>In the data analysed, three architects – Charles, the chief architect; Luc, the junior designer; and Marie, the consultant in interior architecture – are sitting around a table in a meeting room of the firm, and work on the plans of a castle to be transformed into a luxurious hotel. They have received a fax from the owner of the castle, giving instructions; this fax has previously been discussed with their director, who has also given his ideas about the development of the project and about the last negotiations with the client. In the meeting, which lasts about 70 minutes, they first update the information about the project for Marie, showing her the last general plans of the hotel; then, they discuss the points raised by the client’s fax, sketching various solutions on tracing paper.</p>
<p>The meeting has been recorded by four cameras – the first providing for a general view, the second focused on Charles (partially integrating an observer too, who remains silent during the meeting), the third on Luc and Marie, and the fourth offering a vertical view on the table covered by documents and on the hands of the participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468794112438149">Figure 1</xref>) – adopting a camera disposition already experimented in previous projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468794112438149">Mondada, 2008a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>This view takes into consideration various requirements for a multimodal praxeological and interactional analysis of an activity strongly focused on inscriptions. The first global view documents the participation framework, integrating all of the participants. But this view is not detailed enough, neither for the analysis of the embodied conduct nor for the manipulations of the inscriptions. Consequently, a second, vertical, view has been realized, by hanging a camera on the light, above the table. This view shows the documents manipulated by the participants, with enough detail so that it allows the reconstruction of their gesticulations, inscriptions and mobilizations of various plans. Third and fourth views have been added in order to document the facial expressions, gazes, and gestures of each participant. All views have been edited in a split screen multi-scope.</p>
<p>The transcripts reveal both the possibilities and the limitations of video recordings, as well as of other objects constituting the corpus. On the one hand, they are realized on the basis of the video data, mainly of the vertical view. Even if this view works at a more detailed level of granularity than the global view, where the specific structure of the plans is not visible, this is not enough for some of the details of the plans actively exploited by the participants when they point at them or draw them – although this aspect can vary with the compression rate of the video and the quality of the frame grabs. The final versions of the plans and the documents were used while transcribing in order to understand the precise objects participants were drawing and pointing at; some of these visualizations have been inserted in the transcript presented here, in order to offer a more detailed view. In this way, the transcript becomes a composite hybrid: the video is complemented by objects belonging to another temporality, which can be anterior (for pre-existing objects, such as the fax) or posterior (for created or transformed objects, as the paper tracings). The use of the final, completed version of the inscription in the transcript reveals its inescapable reconstructive character – as transcripts are always produced <italic>post hoc, after</italic> the event, <italic>after</italic> its recording, even if the recording aims at seeing it ‘for another each next first time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794112438149">Garfinkel, 2002</xref>: 98). An alternative mode of representation is explored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468794112438149">Mondada (2008a</xref>: 243–5; 2008b) consisting of recreating on transparent paper different temporal layers of the life of the document, as the action unfolds.</p>
<p>Transcripts have been made in order to provide the necessary details for documenting the synchronized and coordinated temporality of talk, of gesture and gaze, and of inscribing action. By choosing a representation of multiple courses of action on different but interrelated lines, the transcript makes possible a continuous analysis of actions in time. This allows an analysis of inscriptions-in-interaction, and of plans-in-action, which does not reduce the processes of their production, use and transformation to their final product or result, and which considers together talk, gesture, gaze, manipulations of objects, inscriptional actions and their environment.</p>
<p>The fragments analysed in this article concern a portion of the meeting in which the spatial disposition of a fitness center is discussed, located at the level -1 of the plan, in a corner between a restaurant and a range of rooms.</p>
<p>In the first fragment, I show how pre-existing documents are read and commented on by the participants. The focus is on how texts and visualizations are actually and situatedly used, in a contingent and selective way depending on the relevancies of the current activity. In the second fragment, I focus on the production of a new document by a participant, who draws a sketch while he interacts with the others. The focus is on how a drawing is produced, step by step, in an emergent way – within a process not reducible to and not visible on the final result. In the third fragment, I focus on the process of discovery of a solution, and on its multimodal expression, prior to its drawing. The focus is not on the drawing itself, but on its genesis, on the embodied imagining process leading to the discovery of a solution.</p>
<p>These three episodes are representative of multimodal practices fundamental not only within architecture: reading, drawing and writing, imagining and rendering. These actions are always achieved within time, and often, as here, within interaction: temporality and sequentiality are pervasive and structuring aspects of their organization. On the one hand, the aim of the analysis is to show their temporal and interactional relevance; on the other hand, it is to reflect about the kind of data that make these analyses possible.</p>

<title>Reading the instructions and referring to past discussions</title>
<p>An architectural project articulates a network of social actors, who sometimes meet together but not always, to discuss and take decisions. Artefacts mediate their present or distant interactions in a crucial way. Moreover, collective work is progressively done in series of meetings, alternating with other events and individual work. The continuity between meetings is achieved through documents, travelling from one context to the other.</p>
<p>In the meeting studied here, the fax sent by the client, represented by the future manager of the hotel, containing a list of problems to solve, is used by Charles as a resource for structuring his working session with Luc and Marie. Charles holds the fax and reads it, point by point. Each point is discussed and solutions are proposed and drawn. The client has also met the director of the architectural firm, who has taken notes and made sketches during their encounter, and has passed them to Luc and Charles. His sketch is in Luc’s hands, and Luc introduces it in punctual and occasioned ways, depending on the topics treated during the session. In the fragment analysed below, these two artefacts are mobilized, together with the floor plan of the hotel. The analysis focuses on the contingent, selective and relevant way in which these artefacts are multimodally referred to during the interaction.</p>
<p>We join the action as Charles, holding the fax in front of him, begins to read the next point, just after having closed the discussion about the previous item:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 1-1</bold> (fitness, cal12, 11.40.52-)</p>
<fig id="fig2-1468794112438149" position="float">
<label>Figure 2b</label>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The paragraph of the fax read by Charles is used to introduce the next item in the meeting’s agenda: a fitness center, recently decided by the client. In this way, although the client is absent, his ‘voice’ is made present at the meeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468794112438149">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468794112438149">2b</xref>).</p>
<p>The reading of the fax is mingled with its reception – manifested through Charles’ and Luc’s change-of-state tokens ‘ah’ (1, 2) combined with ‘voilà’ (1, 2), and Marie’s laughter (4), showing that they were expecting a paragraph about the fitness center. Charles also inserts a comment in its reading, about the perspective of the backer (the owner of the castle, who is the final client, represented by the hotel manager) (5). So, within the reading, a form of virtual dialogue is built with the client.</p>
<p>As the next step, once the client’s demands about the fitness center have been voiced, Charles introduces the voice of another absent participant, their boss, Jean-Marc:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 1-2</bold></p>
<fig id="fig3-1468794112438149" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Charles invites Luc to tell about their boss’ first ideas. He invites him to voice the boss through reported speech (‘raconter’ 9). Simultaneously, he leafs through various plans, searching for the relevant plan for Luc’s report, projecting an activity which uses both talk and artefacts. Luc’s response does not report the boss’ talk; instead, he uses another way of voicing him, by grasping his sketch, drawn on tracing paper (12). In this way, Luc announces that he will make the sketch speak, and as a prerequisite for this action, he juxtaposes it to the floor plan made available by Charles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468794112438149">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>This takes a bit of time (14–18), as the sketch contains some notes and drawings that are not oriented in the same way. The sketch is a composite object on which various layers of annotations have been accumulated; Luc’s action consists of turning it to select the relevant portion useful for the current topic. Moreover, the sketch makes sense only if juxtaposed to the floor plan, which has been arranged by Charles in the middle of the table: the meaningful visualization, constituted by the correct juxtaposition of the plan and the sketch is collaboratively achieved by Charles and Luc. They accomplish the intelligibility of the visualization through the skillful alignment of various objects – in a way very similar to the manipulations of the Munsell chart juxtaposed on the archeologists’ dirt, as studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794112438149">Goodwin (1999)</xref>.</p>
<p>Once Luc has arranged the visual artefacts in the correct way, he finally begins to ‘voice’ the sketch:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 1-3</bold></p>
<fig id="fig4-1468794112438149" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Luc’s description begins with ‘on conservait’ (18), using a past tense (<italic>imparfait</italic>, also used line 28), referring to the temporality of the last discussion with the boss, Jean-Marc. In this way, Luc displays that he voices another’s perspective, which is situated in time, and which also places the actual meeting in the continuation of past discussions, within the work-in-progress.</p>
<p>Jean-Marc has sketched three spaces: the bathrooms, the changing rooms, and the area with two pools (called ‘health’ on the sketch). In his talk, Luc focuses on the first one, the bathrooms. By saying that they are ‘finally conserved’ (19) but also ‘finally served as a changing room’ (28–29), he alludes to past discussions and choices about this detail, which is both maintained and changed (it was attached to the restaurant in the previous version and it is now attached to the fitness center). His description also ends on a problem they have to solve, regarding the restaurant’s bathrooms (30–31).</p>
<p>In his gesture, accompanying his talk, Luc shows various volumes with his open hand and his fist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468794112438149">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468794112438149">5</xref>): this way of pointing, compared with other possible gestures (e.g. pointing with the pen, cf. infra), is very rough, and treats the sketch as referring to big masses and not to details. Thus, the sketch is voiced in an embodied way making clear that its contribution concerns a rather general level – leaving more detailed contributions to the work to be achieved by the co-participants. Through his gesture on the plan, Luc achieves a particular form of ‘instructed seeing’: Luc’s explanation is presented as a gloss of the instructions contained in the sketch; at the same time, he reflexively shapes them through the way they are gesturally enacted. Instructions are both followed and constituted through the very way of following them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794112438149">Garfinkel, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Luc refers to the fitness center as ‘this famous: this famous zone of fitness’ (20) – the adjective ‘famous’ alluding to the known-in-common character of this item. Moreover, while uttering this description he looks at Marie (20), who actually responds (21) (cf. also 23–24). With this gaze, Luc orients to her as the main addressee of the information he is giving about the fitness center (i.e. as a not-yet-fully-knowledgeable person) – distinguishing her epistemic status from Charles’ one, who has asked Luc to deliver the report and so has presented himself as already knowing the boss’ ideas. By responding with continuers (21, 24), Marie aligns with her status as a recipient. Thus, the description is presented as an update of Marie’s knowledge.</p>
<p>After some inserted comments by Charles about the bathrooms, Marie responds to Luc’s description by pointing to a portion of the plan:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 1-4</bold></p>
<fig id="fig5-1468794112438149" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig5.tif"/>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig6.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Marie’s question (40, 43) focuses on a detail that is visible on the plan but that is not considered in Jean-Marc’s sketch: on the plan, the portion now occupied by the fitness center is explicitly dedicated to a meeting room. She points on the tracing paper with her pen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468794112438149">Figure 6</xref>), but actually refers to the next layer, visible across it: her pointing uses the transparency of two juxtaposed visualizations in order to reveal a contradiction.</p>
<p>Her noticing is introduced as a consequence (‘donc’ 40) of what Luc has reported about Jean-Marc’s positions; she also uses the past tense (‘que vous aviez là’ 40) referring with the second person pronoun to the past version as owned by Luc and Jean-Marc (and not by her). Her noticing finishes with the first part of the formulation of the reason (‘that’s why’ 43), which is collaboratively completed by Luc (‘he wants to find them somewhere else’ 44). Luc uses the third person pronoun, referring to the decisions as being to the client’s (and not to his) responsibility. Thus, the references to the plan allude to various epistemic authorities and responsibilities; the co-participants position themselves, affiliating or disaffiliating with them, in a complex web of intertextual relations, which are enacted through talk and gesture.</p>
<p>Moreover, Marie further explicates the grounds and coherence of the changes she is pointing at on the plan by linking her observation with another paragraph of the fax, to which she points (43) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468794112438149">Figure 7a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468794112438149">b</xref>). Her alternate gesture between the fax (43) and the plan (40–43, 50) make sense of what disappeared on the sketch and what is insisted upon in the fax. Luc formulates this relation by concluding that the client (the fax’s author) and Jean-Marc (the sketch’s author) met and agreed about the fitness center. This completes the sketch’s description by a description of its status as a negotiated solution shared by the client and the architect – thus, as a solution which is mandatory for their future work.</p>
<p>This first fragment reveals the complexity of the way in which various inscriptions are concurrently mobilized, even within a ‘simple’ reading activity. Actually different reading activities are concomitant: Charles reads the fax, Luc the sketch, Marie the sketch and the plan under the sketch. They display the current knowledge each participant has of the project, as well as their understandings of the client’s and boss’ requirements, and their consequences for the future work. Moreover, only a small part of the inscriptions is considered (a paragraph of the fax, a detail of the sketch, an area on the plan), resulting from a selection motivated by their current work and discussion. These artefacts represent different versions of the project: present and past, modified or not, authorized or not. Their epistemic and normative value, as well as their meaning, is produced in an embodied way by the participants displacing them, putting them at the center of their common focus of attention, pointing at them, enacting them and voicing their author(s).</p>
<p>These documents can be collected as part of the ‘corpus’ of the architectural project (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468794112438149">Figure 8</xref>):</p>

</fig>
<p>But as such they are silent and inert. They don’t tell anything about their use: the embodied and verbal use of pre-existing documents does not leave any trace; it is a labile and immaterial process. They are silent about their internal structure, as it has been shaped by the selective activities of consulting them: the fax is not entirely read, only a portion of the sketch is worked out, and only the left inferior corner of the plan is looked at across the sketch.</p>
<p>Artefacts become meaningful in the embodied practices of reading, unfolding, leafing, and showing them. In a meeting, these practices are deeply embedded in the time of the interaction: they select, highlight, point, emphasize, and make visual details intelligible.</p>
<p>The video caption of these practices is not straightforward: it makes the activity accessible, but its details have to be reconstructed while transcribing and analysing. Although indispensible, video remains limited, for example, as far as gaze and the exact location to which it is pointed at are concerned. Careful video transcription-representation attempts at reconstructing some of these details; for example, the association of video frame grabs with details of the photographic reproduction of the artefacts (see supra) allows to precisely understand the value of a pointing gesture, the details pointed at, and the meaning making process they contribute to.</p>

<title>Tracing inscriptions</title>
<p>The work of architects is materialized in their active drawing of sketches, tracings, and plans. Again, this activity cannot be reduced to its final results. Whereas in the last fragment I focused on the enactment of documents through their situated and embodied reading, in the next one, I focus on the progressive production of a tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468794112438149">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig8-1468794112438149" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig8.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Although some characteristics of the drawing can permit guesses about the way in which it has been produced – such as lines drawn several times, suggesting that the author came back on them; more global and encompassing lines, suggesting that he did them at the end of the drawing; hatched portions of the drawing, suggesting a way of grouping together some portions of it; etc. – it is impossible to reconstruct its emergence from the final drawing itself, and difficult to know if it has been drawn by one or more authors.</p>
<p>The analysis below is focused on the act of drawing, as it is done in situ and in interaction. We join the action after some discussions about the fitness center. At this point, Charles begins to draw a first sketch of this area:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 2-1</bold> (cal13 11.45.17-)</p>
<fig id="fig9-1468794112438149" position="float">

<p>Charles’ drawing, lines 1-7</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig9.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Charles draws and talks at the same time, making what he is doing visible and public. He begins with two areas; the bathrooms of the restaurant (‘San Resto’) and the changing room of the fitness center (‘Vestiaire’), which is related to the pools with a big arrow. He also writes the function of each rectangular area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468794112438149">Figure 10</xref>). His talk is finely synchronized with his drawing; for example, he manages to expand his sentence in such a way that the words he writes coincide with the words he utters (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468794112438149">Streeck and Kallmeyer, 2001</xref>: 484 for similar examples).</p>
<p>At the end of his description (3), he pauses, but nobody responds (4). After a gap, letting surface a possible dispreferred response, Marie self-selects, recycling Charles’ last word, lengthening the last syllable and using a prosody strongly projecting something more, but leaving it unfinished (5). Charles repeats the word, merely confirming it, and moves to the next part of the drawing (7). Whereas Marie displays, by using a continuing intonation, that the item ‘vestiaire’ needs some more development, Charles, by repeating it as a stand-alone word, treats it as complete. Through different prosodies, two different actions are implemented, manifesting an emerging divergence between the two participants about the ‘vestiaire’.</p>
<p>But Charles goes on: he begins to draw the ‘fitness zone’, tracing two lines, a horizontal and a vertical one, referred to by two deictics (‘là:,’ and ‘ça:,’ 7) uttered with a continuing intonation, projecting more to come. By using these deictics, and not full nominal descriptions, Charles can be considered as attempting to keep the attention of the co-participants on his emergent drawing.</p>
<p>Instead, in overlap, Marie asks a question going back to the previous zone (8–9), an item just treated as complete by Charles:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 2-2</bold></p>
<fig id="fig10-1468794112438149" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig10.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Marie’s question goes back to the previous zone, and reminds the others of the requirements of the client (‘he’ 8). While Charles does not answer, Luc immediately aligns with her and answers positively (10): both the question and the answer let transpire a critique of this zone as not big enough and as not integrating the fitness bathrooms. Charles seems now to orient to it, by looking at Luc and suspending his drawing, without saying anything. While answering, Luc grasps Jean-Marc’s sketch, clearly displaying that it legitimates his answer.</p>
<p>Marie confirms Luc’s answer, by upgrading it, adding a new element, the ‘showers’ (11), and evoking possible, anticipated and typical uses of the fitness center (what ‘the people’ ‘normally’ ‘often’ do 11). While she engages in this list of activities, Charles focuses back on his drawing and goes on, sketching the fitness area, with two pools (11–13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468794112438149">Figure 11</xref>). He completes this part (displaying its completion with ‘voilà’ (14), as Marie is uttering the last TCU of her list (15).</p>
<p>In overlap with her turn completion, Charles talks again, continuing his sketch aloud:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 2-3</bold></p>
<fig id="fig11-1468794112438149" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig11.tif"/>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig12.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Although Charles formally aligns with Marie (‘oui j’pense qu’effectivement’ 16–17), he pursues his own agenda, picking up her movement verb (‘ils repartent’ 15) as an occasion to introduce the ‘grand couloir de circulation’ (17). While he continues to draw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468794112438149">Figure 12</xref>), he reconstructs the path of possible users, also recycling the reference to ‘the people’ Marie introduced (‘ils’ 18). His turn completion (19) is acknowledged by Marie after a short gap (21), which prompts Charles to go on and to describe the spa area, listing two elements (‘pools, jacuzzi’ 22), and projecting a third one (a general reference to ‘other items to be studied’ 24). While listing the first two elements, Charles draws two circles in the squares previously mapped out.</p>
<p>At the same time, Luc continues to look at Jean-Marc’s sketch and overlaps Charles’ second element, projecting an addition or even a possible critique: indeed, he adds another item, ‘a sauna’ (25), and some details about the pool (28). Luc’s gestures refer again to his source and the epistemic authority being voiced within his turn: by double pointing on the sketch, he clearly indicates that these elements are attributed to Jean-Marc, the boss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468794112438149">Figure 13</xref>).</p>
<p>To sum up, in this fragment, Charles draws a solution for the arrangement of the fitness center, drawing publicly in front of his two collaborators and describing aloud what he is doing. His colleagues adopt specific forms of recipiency and resistance, by looking critically at the emergent drawing, by asking questions about possible missing elements (Marie) and by reiterating the suggestions of the boss (Luc). Here, the sequential organization of the description as well as of the drawing, both projecting more to come, item by item, is carefully monitored by Marie and Luc, taking advantage of their free hands for mobilizing other artefacts, and producing some alternative talk, independent from the drawing, for resisting and raising back issues taken for granted by Charles. For instance, Luc’s precise mention of a sauna and a big pool, uttered by quoting Jean-Marc and pointing at his sketch, contrasts with Charles’ generic list of ‘pools, jacuzzis, and other things we are gonna study’ (22, 24), which is attributed to their team and projected in the future. Charles on the one hand, and Luc and Marie on the other hand, orient to different granularities of the emerging drawing: the former treats it as a first general sketch of which he is the author, the latter treat it as the inscription of more detailed solutions and constraints imposed from outside authorities. Thus, the same artefact can be regarded in different ways; it can be the object of controversies, disagreements, and resistances. A drawing can be done in a more unilateral or in a more consensual way. The organization of the action producing the drawing confers it a specific status, as a shared view, as a first general sketch, as a more detailed representation of suggestions and requirements, and so on.</p>
<p>The video offering a vertical view on the meeting’s table allows an analysis focusing on the detailed progression, moment by moment, of the drawing, as a result of continuous or suspended actions, as registering or ignoring resistances, counter-suggestions, and critiques. The multimodal transcription, reconstructing step by step the temporality of the inscribing actions, allows an analysis taking into consideration the coordination and synchronization of the drawing and the talk, as well as their reflexive, mutually configuring, articulations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1468794112438149">
<title>Collaborating for the discovery of a gestured, described and inscribed solution</title>
<p>In the previous section, I have described the situated production of a drawing. But the inscription of a solution is not equivalent to its genesis: the process leading to the inscription begins much earlier on, often in other contexts, and mobilizes other semiotic and multimodal resources. In this section I will focus on the reconstitution of the genesis of a drawing, and describe the embodied practices of imagining a solution.</p>
<p>Whereas in the previous fragment the inscription was done publicly but rather unilaterally by one participant, and critically assisted by the other, in the next fragment the participants cooperate multimodally for constructing the solution, through talk, gesture and inscriptions. The fragment documents how they collectively ‘discover’ a solution, first by doing some gesture over the plans, then by formulating it, and finally by inscribing it on the tracing paper.</p>
<p>We join the action as Marie and Charles are rejecting Luc’s suggestion to relate some hotel rooms with the restaurant through a passageway along the fitness center – since this solution would reduce the size of the changing room:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 3-1</bold> (deux hommes deux femmes)</p>
<fig id="fig13-1468794112438149" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig13.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In this fragment, Charles and Marie collaboratively elaborate on difficulty, concerning the changing room: this topic is progressively focused as a problem, through the recycling of ‘ça coupe/ (.) les vestiaires’ (1) into an expanded sentence, ‘ça coupe les vestiaires de: de ça\’ (4), refocusing the attention from the rooms to the fitness area – which is hatched in Charles’ drawing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468794112438149">Figure 14</xref>).</p>
<p>Marie contributes further to this expansion, by adding a relative clause (5), which introduces a (negative) assessment (‘small’) of the object coming into focus. After a pause, Charles aligns with her and upgrades it (‘too small’) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468794112438149">Pomerantz, 1984</xref>). Marie further expands the sentence (9–10), by adding a subordinate clause, which constitutes another upgrade, referring to the fact that they not only need a changing room but also showers (in this way, she picks up again her older argument, previously not taken into consideration; see fragment 2-2, line 11). Her upgrade is highlighted by the counting gesture she makes at this point (9–10). As Charles relativizes this addition a little bit (13–14), she upgrades it again (transforming ‘at least two showers’ 14, into ‘two per person-’ 15, which makes four in total, 17). As Charles finally aligns (16, 18), she even adds an extra ‘space’ (19), expressed in the form of a list, which further expands the initial topic, both syntactically and referentially.</p>
<p>In this way, through the production of collaborative utterances and of repeated alignments and upgradings, they jointly contribute to the progressive focus and expansion of the changing room, transforming it into the next problem to solve.</p>
<p>The consequences of this new description of the changing room are formulated by Luc, who has remained silent until then:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 3-2</bold></p>
<graphic id="img1-1468794112438149" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-img1.tif"/>
<p>Contrasting with the previous discussion, which was done almost without any gesture on the plan, Luc’s contribution (22) focuses back on the plan, pointing at the ‘vestiaires’ area previously hatched by Charles, and using a double deictic (‘ces vestiaires là’ 22). Luc’s turn is formatted in an emergent way, the topic being hesitantly qualified, first in a negative way (‘maybe they aren’t::, they are misplaced’ 24), and second in an unfinished sentence, which syntactically projects an alternative location, without naming it (‘we could maybe find for them instead’ 25). Here, Luc is literally picking up the topic of the previous discussion – ‘vestiaires’ – but both Marie and Charles recognize that he means another item – ‘sanitaires’ – as manifested in their other-repairs (23, 26). While his turn is left unfinished, the gesture he does simultaneously is more precise: he gesticulates towards a place on the plan (where the ‘vestiaires’ are) and metaphorically grasps and drags it into another location, towards the entry of the restaurant.</p>
<p>Mimicking the displacement of the bathroom from one place to another, this gesture <italic>prefigures</italic> the solution, although Luc does not yet utter it verbally (see his unfinished sentence, 25). But the solution is <italic>seen</italic> by Marie and Charles, as displayed not only by their other-repairs but also by their agreements (‘right’ 23, ‘yes’ 26 and Charles’ final ‘yes’ 28). In this case, the solution is not yet formulated in the talk (which is even referentially incorrect), but it is clearly <italic>prefigured</italic> in one participant’s gesture – and shared by the other co-participants looking at the plans as they are modified in an enacted way by the gesture.</p>
<p>In this fragment we can observe how ‘professional vision’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794112438149">Goodwin, 1994</xref>) works in the embodied practice of the architects, who are not only able to read actual sketches and plans, but also to see what is missing, and what is misplaced, as well as possible other alternatives not yet materialized in the drawing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468794112438149">Yaneva, 2005</xref> for other examples of the way in which these alternative sights are technologically and bodily performed). In this sense, the architectural professional vision resembles the potter’s vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794112438149">Garfinkel et al., 1981</xref>); able to see the emergent form he is shaping in the process of its transformation, when it is not yet a recognizable, palpable, materialized object.</p>
<p>Building on Luc’s suggestion, Charles points to the new location he indicates, and strengthens its relevance (cf. the initial ‘it’s true’ 30) by offering extra information (‘another notion’ 31), not available on the plan:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 3-3</bold></p>

</fig>
<p>Charles initiates a ‘because’-clause, still focusing on the problem at hand, but self-repairs it into another clause, introducing a new piece of information (31); that the client changed his mind about the location of the bar, initially planned at the entrance of the restaurant (32). Charles’ gestures are adjusted to his self-repair: on the first ‘because’, he points to the tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468794112438149">Figure 15</xref>); on the second one, he takes away the tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468794112438149">Figure 16</xref>) and points directly to the floor plan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468794112438149">Figure 17(a)</xref>, where the bar had been originally drawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468794112438149">Figure 17(b)</xref>. In this way, the past temporality referred to in the talk – by the negation (32), the adverb ‘finally’ (32) and by Luc’s ‘not any more’ (33) – is demonstrated by pointing to an older version of the project, materialized by the plan.</p>
<p>This new information is both announced by Charles and, in overlap, by Luc (33), both displaying their knowledgeability to Marie, who displays her surprise (34).</p>
<p>After an insertion about the future location of the bar, Charles comes back to his initial thought (‘that’s true’ 44, cf. line 30; moreover, ‘°dans°’ 44 can be an aborted recycling of ‘dans ce cas là’ 30): he circles the bathrooms, referred to by a left dislocated deictic (‘ça’ 45), and immediately, even before naming it, he points to the alternative location previously indicated by Luc, on the top of the tracing. This location is formulated by another deictic (‘là-bas’ 47), at the very end of his turn, after Luc (48) and Marie (49) have already agreed. While agreeing, Marie points in the same direction; then, she formulates the new location more precisely, near the stairs where the old bar was (49–50).</p>
<p>Therefore, an agreement about the solution is demonstrated at this stage, manifesting a shared vision of the plan, realized through the timed sequential placement of the acknowledgments and the pointing gesture towards the same location.</p>
<p>In the next step, the solution is finally inscribed on the tracing paper by Charles – after some digressions about other topics and a pre-closing of the discussion:</p>
<p><bold>Fragment 3-4</bold></p>
<fig id="fig15-1468794112438149" position="float">
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468794112438149-fig15.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>This time, Charles draws a long arrow while pointing at the bathrooms (‘ça’ 66) and directs it upwards, towards the top of the tracing paper. He writes ‘possibilité’ on the left of the arrow (as visible in the final drawing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1468794112438149">Figure 18</xref>). As Marie acknowledges it (67), after the completion of his writing, Charles goes on, with a reformulation (70), stating the conditions at which this possibility can be realized. During this ‘if then’ construction, he follows with his pen the contour of the rectangle representing the ‘vestiaire’ while uttering the ‘if’ part; and he outlines the entire area of the bathrooms and the changing rooms while uttering the ‘then’ part. Interestingly, he adds a second ‘then’ part, corresponding to the movement he sketches towards the new location of the restaurant’s restrooms (74). Thus, his syntactic construction is built step by step, being based on his graphic sketch. As Marie and Luc do not respond, he goes on (76) and interrogatively transforms the conditional solution into a solution to be adopted in any case; in absence of responses, he repeats affirmatively his last sentence (78): what was a possibility is transformed into a decision, taken by Charles and silently adopted by Marie and Luc.</p>
<p>At the end of this excerpt, the solution is inscribed on the tracing paper by Charles. But its genesis has gone through various steps, expressed by different multimodal resources: the reconstruction of a trajectory in which a solution is ‘discovered’ collectively by the participants cannot be reduced to the actual actions done on the tracing paper. Discovery is an emergent process, in which gesticulation often precedes verbal formulation, and inscription comes only at the latest stage, confirming and fixing the shared vision assembled through a variety of resources.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The empirical analyses developed in this article have dealt with inscriptions-in-interaction, showing in detail how inscriptions are actively interpreted, drawn, and collectively searched for, prefigured and finally put on paper.</p>
<p>Inscription-in-interaction and plans-in-action show that participants not only dialogue <italic>with</italic> material objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468794112438149">Yaneva, 2005</xref>) and <italic>through</italic> objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468794112438149">Schmidt and Wagner, 2004</xref>), but they also reflexively constitute them, their capacity of voicing absent parties, their validity, and their visibility, as they manipulate them. Objects are not supposed to be already out there, but are emergent entities <italic>in fieri</italic>.</p>
<p>Artefacts are important mediations within complex networks of social actors, including colleagues, professionals, consultants, and contractors, but also clients, local authorities, and legal institutions: they voice their concerns, demands, constraints and requirements, as they are mobilized in specific ways during a course of action, i.e. as they are made locally relevant at a particular moment of the ongoing work. Artefacts’ mediation is enacted, enabled, and voiced through their situated use for all practical purposes. The multimodal embodied organization of action achieves their status as representing the wishes of the client, the mandatory instructions of the boss, the assessed and approved solution on which to work, and the present <italic>vs.</italic> past version. Action reflexively elaborates this status of the inscription and at the same time adjusts and adapts to it.</p>
<p>Inscriptions are complex, composite objects: often, action focuses only on a portion of them; on a detail that is made relevant for the ongoing task. The focus on the final product erases the practices that have produced it; it also ignores the interpretive, selective, partial way in which inscriptions are used, read, transformed, and created. Observing the timed actions through which inscriptions are manipulated reveals the embodied practices that highlight, zoom, delimitate, and abstract them in the course of the activity, contributing to the intelligibility of the object for and within that particular moment and action. This shows how misleading it would be to consider the director’s sketch used in the meeting studied here as a document making sense as a whole – since it has probably be produced in different steps, and it has been exploited bit by bit at different moments of the meeting, within different situated actions.</p>
<p>Video analysis reveals that artefacts are not stand-alone objects. As soon as they are mobilized, for example when being read, they are enacted by the way in which they are manipulated, the way in which they are located – for example aligned with other documents, such as the sketch juxtaposed on the plan, making sense only within this particular arrangement; the way in which they are made speak through the gesture achieving their visibility (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468794112438149">Mondada, 2005</xref>) and through the words formulating them. Their intelligibility, visibility, and accountability is not given by their internal structure, but by the way in which it is made relevant within a situated course of action and in a recipient-designed way for actual co-participants. The challenge of video analysis is to account for these crucial features of inscriptions as objects-in-action.</p>

<title>Biographical note</title>
<p><bold>Lorenza Mondada</bold> is Professor for linguistics at University of Basel, after having worked at the University of Lyon. Her research deals with social interaction in ordinary, professional and institutional settings, within an ethnomethodological and conversation analytic perspective. She is interested in how linguistic resources are not only used but also configured and transformed in interaction, as well as in how the situated and endogenous organization of social interaction draws on multimodal resources such as, beside language, gesture, gaze, body posture, body movements and objets manipulations. Her work has explored a diversity of settings (surgical theatres, architectural practices, meetings in multinational companies, family interactions, encounters in public spaces, call centres, etc.) and a range of sequential and praxeological phenomena, studied on the basis of video recordings of naturally occurring activities. She has published several papers in <italic>Journal of Pragmatics, Discourse Studies, Language in Society, Research on Language and Social Interaction</italic> and co-edited various collective books (among others <italic>Knowledge in Interaction</italic>, with T. Stivers and J. Steensig, CUP, 2011; <italic>Mobility in Interaction</italic>, with P. Haddington and M. Nevile, De Gruyter, 2012) and special editions (among others <italic>Assessments in Social Interaction</italic>, a special issue of <italic>Research on Language and Social Interaction</italic>, 42 : 4, 2009, with A. Lindström).</p>
