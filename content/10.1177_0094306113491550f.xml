<p>It is not often one encounters the terms “whore,” “hooch,” or “interchangeable f***bots” in an academic text; in fact one would be hard pressed to find these in most traditional forms of media. However, <italic>Gender, Branding, and the Modern Music Industry</italic> is a work that has its ear pressed firmly to the ground; for the language found within its pages reflects the language of an industry, current cultural perceptions, and the increasing objectification of women as a driver for profits. These terms reflect, not the author, but more importantly, the uncomfortable truth of what she uncovers. Kristin Lieb utilizes a well-known industry to shed light on the intersection of gender studies, sociology, mass communication, and marketing.</p>
<p>To gain insight into how female pop stars are created and managed, Lieb interviewed 21 industry professionals who worked directly in the industry or with music industry companies, and had worked with gold or platinum selling female artists. The knowledge she gained is then analyzed through Wendy Griswold’s <italic>Cultural Diamond</italic> (2008), which is an overarching sociological framework that incorporates feedback between the social world, creators, receivers, and a cultural object (in this context, the female artist). This model is also informed by additional theories in sociology, communications, brand scholarship, and consumer culture.</p>
<p>In Chapter Two, Lieb evaluates female pop stars as short, term brands, meant to generate as much revenue as possible before fading or burning out. In Chapter Three, she delves into changes in the music industry, noting a homogenization of music and brands as producers attempt to guarantee hits based on past successes; and remarking that a de-emphasis on music as technology has changed and reduced music profitability, driving female artists to expand into other forms of revenue like perfumes and clothing.</p>
<p>In Chapters Four and Five, she presents her lifecycle model for female pop stars, a diagram which illustrates the general trajectory of artists. Based on the numerous interviews she conducted in conjunction with relevant examples from popular culture, she shows how, start to finish, women are largely packaged based upon their–calculated–sexual appeal. Typically female pop stars begin as good girls, who must adhere to tightly controlled albeit ever-changing cultural expectations of femininity. They then transition into temptresses, a phase in which attention is increasingly placed on looks; unfortunately this is also where a large number of careers end. The phases beyond the temptress include the hot mess, the diva, the whore, the exotic, the provocateur, and later, possibly the legend and the comeback. Overall, the chapter demonstrates that this model is a fairly regimented path with very little room for deviation. It again reinforces the industry’s increasing emphasis placed on women’s bodies.</p>
<p>Finally Lieb places her lifecycle model in an academic context, drawing upon theoretical foundations to explain how and why the model originated and persists, looking to the creators and cultural objects, as well as to those who consume them. She concludes that the heavy value placed on women’s bodies and resulting presentation has resulted in numerous problems including “hyper-sexualization, eating disorders, depression, violence against women, and a lack of strong positive female figures for young women to aspire to be” (p.164).</p>
<p>While there is a great deal of territory to cover with such an interdisciplinary and novel topic, Lieb does a fantastic job in keeping her work concise and clear. The reader might wish for a longer chapter on theoretical foundations, but this is really no fault, for the length is fitting for an audience unfamiliar with the scholars she draws upon. This book comes highly recommended not only as an introductory text for undergraduate courses, but as an informative read for anyone interested in the branding of female artists in the music industry.</p>
