<p>To determine the amount of 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP)-calcium (MDP-Ca) salt produced through the demineralization of enamel or dentin by MDP, we designed experimental MDP-based one-step adhesives with different amounts of MDP. The null hypotheses were that (1) the amount of MDP-Ca salt produced through the demineralization of enamel was the same as that for dentin, and (2) the amounts of MDP-Ca salt have no effect on bonding performance. Increases in the amount of MDP resulted in increased amounts of MDP-Ca salt. The production amount of MDP-Ca salt of the dentin was 1.3 times higher than that of the enamel. The predominant species of the MDP and enamel reactants was a calcium hydrogen phosphate of MDP. In contrast, the dentin yielded both calcium phosphate and calcium hydrogen phosphate of MDP. Increases in the amount of MDP-Ca salt decreased both enamel and dentin bond strengths. An optimal concentration of MDP exists in one-step self-etch adhesives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One- and two-step self-etch adhesives have been developed to simplify application procedures and reduce technique sensitivity, and their bonding performances and long-term bond durabilities have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512458925">Hiraishi <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512458925">Van Landuyt <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512458925">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512458925">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Investigators have performed studies to understand the adhesion mechanisms of one- and two-step self-etch adhesives to the tooth through acidic monomers, such as 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP), 4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitic acid (4-MET), or 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phenyl hydrogen phosphate (Phenyl-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512458925">Van Meerbeek <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512458925">Nishiyama <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512458925">Fu <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512458925">Fujita and Nishiyama, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512458925">Fujita <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512458925">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>. (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512458925">2004</xref>) established the “adhesion–decalcification” concept, because the MDP, 4-MET, or Phenyl-P bonds electrostatically to synthesized hydroxyapatite and produces calcium salt.</p>
<p>However, no data have been reported about how much of the MDP used in the adhesive affects the yield of MDP-Ca salt through the demineralization of enamel and dentin. This quantitative information is of importance, since we do not know whether the MDP-Ca salt is able to co-polymerize with other monomers in the adhesive.</p>
<p>In this study, we designed experimental MDP-based one-step adhesives with different amounts of MDP to determine the amount of MDP-Ca salt produced through the demineralization of enamel and dentin. The effects of amounts of MDP-Ca salt produced on enamel and dentin bonding performances were then discussed. The null hypotheses were that (1) the amount of MDP-Ca salt produced through the demineralization of enamel was the same as that for dentin, and (2) the amounts of MDP-Ca salt have no effect on bonding performance.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034512458925">
<title>Preparation of Experimental Adhesives</title>
<p>We prepared the base monomer for the experimental adhesive by mixing 10.0 g of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA, Negamikogyo, Ishikawa, Japan), 10.0 g of triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA, Shin-Nakamura Chemical Co., Wakayama, Japan), and 9.4 g of 4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitic anhydride (4-META, Sun Medical, Shiga, Japan). We prepared a series of 5 types of mixed monomers with different amounts of MDP (0, 3.0, 6.0, 10.0, or 15.0 g; Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc., Tokyo, Japan) in the base monomer. One mass% of camphorquinone (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) and dimethylamino benzoic acid ethyl ester (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and 2,000 ppm of hydroquinone monomethyl ether (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) were then dissolved in each mixed monomer as a photo-initiator, accelerator, and inhibitor, respectively. Further, a 4.26-g quantity of colloidal silica (R-972, Nihon Aerosil, Tokyo, Japan) was added to each mixed monomer. Monomers were then diluted with an aqueous acetone solution, consisting of 11.2 g of distilled and de-ionized water and 69.3 g of acetone. A series of 5 types of MDP-based self-etch adhesives was expressed as EX-0, EX-3, EX-6, EX-10, and EX-15. The pH values of these adhesives were 1.96, 1.75, 1.59, 1.44, and 1.38, respectively. The 4-META represents 4-MET in the experimental adhesives, since the water used induces hydrolysis of the carboxylic acid anhydride group in 4-META.</p>

<title>Preparation of Enamel and Dentin Particles</title>
<p>After removal of pulp, the bovine crown enamel was cut by an air-turbine with a diamond bur under a stream of cooling water. The cut enamel particles were obtained by decantation of the collected cooling water. The enamel particles were then rinsed 3 times with distilled and de-ionized water, and then air-dried at 20°C.</p>
<p>The crown dentin particles were also prepared according to the procedures as mentioned above. The primary particle sizes of enamel or dentin were 5 to 20 µm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512458925">
<title>Preparation of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Samples for Liquid-state and Solid-state 13C-NMR Analyses</title>
<p>Bovine enamel or dentin particles (0.200 g) were suspended in each adhesive (1.000 g). The suspensions were vibrated for 10 min, then centrifuged. The obtained supernatants of each adhesive and enamel or dentin suspension were used for liquid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the reactant residues of each adhesive and enamel or dentin were repeatedly rinsed with ethanol until no <sup>13</sup>C-NMR peaks attributed to the adhesive components were detected in the liquid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum for the supernatant ethanol solution. The obtained reactant residues were then dried at 20<sup>°</sup>C for solid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512458925">
<title>Determination of Amounts of MDP-Ca Salt Produced through Demineralization of Enamel or Dentin</title>
<p>Liquid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of each supernatant were observed with an EX-270 spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The accumulation and repetition times were 3,000 times and 9 sec, respectively. NMR samples were prepared after supernatant (0.300 g) was diluted with dimethyl-sulfoxide-<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>6</italic></sub> (0.200 g). Further, NMR spectra of each unreacted adhesive were also observed. Preparations of reacted and unreacted adhesives and NMR observations were performed 3 times.</p>
<p>The relative intensity ratios of the NMR peak of the vinyl methylene carbon of MDP to that of UDMA were determined before and after the reaction. We determined the reduction in the MDP concentration in each adhesive by dividing the difference between the relative intensity ratios obtained before and after the reaction by the relative intensity ratio obtained before the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512458925">Fujita and Nishiyama, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512458925">Fujita <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). We then calculated the amount of MDP-Ca salt produced through the demineralization of enamel or dentin by multiplying the reduction in the MDP concentration obtained for each adhesive by the amount of MDP utilized in 1.000 g of the adhesive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512458925">
<title>NMR Analysis of Reactant Residues of Each Adhesive and Enamel or Dentin</title>
<p>Solid-state <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of each reactant residue were observed with an EX-270 spectrometer. The contact, accumulation, and repetition times were 5,000 µsec, 5,000 to 15,000 times, and 4.0 sec, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022034512458925">
<title>Preparation of Specimens for the Adhesion Test</title>
<p>The facial enamel surface of the bovine crown was ground with a sequence of 100-, 600-, and 1,000-grit silicon carbide papers under water irrigation. We placed 80-µm double-faced tape with a circular hole (internal diameter = 3.2 mm; Nichiban, Tokyo, Japan) onto the ground enamel or dentin surface. The enamel or dentin surface inside the circular hole was conditioned with each adhesive for 20 sec and then air-dried with a high-pressure airflow for 5 sec. Light-irradiation was applied to the adhesive for 10 sec by means of a Light Curing Unit (XL3000, 3M ESPE, Grafenau, Germany). A 1-mm-thick silicone ring mold with a circular hole (internal diameter = 3.2 mm) was mounted onto the double-faced tape. The hole was then immediately filled with resin composite (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray Noritake Dental Inc.) and then light-irradiated for 20 sec. After the mold and tape were removed, the bonded specimens were immersed in water at 37ºC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022034512458925">
<title>Measurement of Shear Bond Strength</title>
<p>After 1 day, the bonded specimens were set on a conventional testing machine (TG-5KN, Minebea, Nagano, Japan). The shear bond strength of each adhesive to the enamel or dentin was measured under a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/min. There were 15 specimens in each experimental group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022034512458925">
<title>Adhesive Remnant Index</title>
<p>After the adhesion test, 15 enamel and dentin samples were dehydrated by 50-, 60-, 70-, 80-, 90-, and 100-vol% ethanol aqueous solutions, immersed in tertiary-butyl alcohol, and then freeze-dried under vacuum (FDU-1200, EYELA, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were then mounted onto aluminum stubs, and sputter-coated with a platinum-palladium alloy. To classify the fracture mode into the 4 categories of the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512458925">Årtun and Bergland, 1984</xref>), we performed scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-2150, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) observations of each specimen at numerous magnifications at 15 kV. The 4 categories of the ARI were as follows: ARI = 0, no adhesive remained on the enamel or dentin surface; ARI = 1, less than half of the adhesive remained on the enamel or dentin surface; ARI = 2, more than half of the adhesive remained on the enamel or dentin surface; and ARI = 3, all of the adhesive remained on the enamel or dentin surface. Enamel cracks or enamel fracture in ARI score 2 are shown in parentheses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512458925">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022034512458925">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To understand the demineralization aspect of enamel and dentin, we determined the regression line between the amount of MDP utilized and the amount of MDP-Ca salt produced using a least-squares method. The regression slopes were compared between enamel and dentin by <italic>t</italic> test. Further, the bond strengths obtained from each adhesive were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey multiple-comparison tests. The level of statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p>

<title>Determination of Amounts of MDP-Ca Salt Produced through the Demineralization Process</title>
<p>Increases in the amount of MDP in the adhesive (1.000 g) resulted in increased amounts of MDP-Ca salt through the demineralization of enamel and dentin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022034512458925">Table</xref>). A significant difference was observed in the regression slopes between enamel and dentin (p = 0.022). Dentin was demineralized 1.3 times compared with enamel (regression slope ratio = 0.869/0.669; Appendix Fig.).</p>

<title>Effect of Amount of MDP-Ca Salt Produced on Bonding Performance</title>
<p>Addition of MDP to the EX-0 adhesive increased the enamel and dentin bond strengths from 14.0 to 19.2 MPa (p &lt; 0.05) and 9.5 to 15.7 MPa (p &lt; 0.05), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512458925">Fig. 2</xref>). Increases in the amount of MDP-Ca salt increased the enamel and dentin bond strengths until the amount of MDP-Ca salt reached 35.4 and 37.2 mg, respectively. However, further increases in the amounts of MDP-Ca salt decreased both bond strengths. The dentin exhibited greater deterioration in the bond strength than did the enamel.</p>

Both SEM views in the first upper column show the ground enamel or dentin surface, both views in the second upper column show the fractured enamel or dentin surface bonded with EX-0 adhesive (MDP: 0 mg/g), both views in the third upper column show the fractured enamel or dentin surface bonded with EX-3 adhesive (MDP: 25.6 mg/g), both views in the fourth column show the fractured enamel or dentin surface bonded with EX-6 adhesive (MDP: 49.9 mg/g), both views in the first lower column show the fractured enamel or dentin surface bonded with EX-10 adhesive (MDP: 80.5 mg/g), and both views of the second lower column show the fractured enamel or dentin surface bonded with EX-15 adhesive (MDP: 116.1 mg/g). As shown in (A), the application of experimental adhesives allows for a broadening of scratches compared with the ground enamel surface, since the hardened adhesive remains on the surface. When the amount of MDP was increased to above 49.9 mg/g, the scratches could not be seen on the enamel surface, because the fracture occurred within the adhesive layer. Furthermore, the change in the ARI score from 1 to 2 caused the development of an enamel crack or enamel fracture. The number of specimens exhibiting the enamel crack or enamel fracture increased with increases in the amount of MDP utilized. Similar to the ground enamel surface, remarkable scratches are observed on the ground dentin surface (B), and most dentinal tubules are filled with the smear plug. However, the addition of MDP in the EX-0 adhesive allowed for changes in the ARI score from 1 to 2. However, when the amount of additional MDP became 116.1 mg/g, approximately half of the dentinal tubules opened, indicating that the resin tags are pulled from the dentinal tubules.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we focused on the concentration change of MDP in experimental adhesives to investigate the adhesion mechanisms of adhesives through MDP, since the MDP demineralized the tooth apatite more effectively and yielded greater amounts of calcium salt than the 4-MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512458925">Fujita and Nishiyama, 2006</xref>). Increases in the amount of MDP decreased the pH value of the experimental adhesive and increased the amount of MDP-Ca salt. The amount of MDP-Ca salt produced in the dentin was 1.3 times higher than that produced in the enamel. Therefore, the hypothesis that the production rate of MDP-Ca salt through the demineralization of enamel was the same as that of dentin was rejected. This may be due to the lower crystallinity of the dentin apatite compared with that of the enamel apatite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512458925">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The solid-state <sup>13</sup>C NMR analysis results of MDP-enamel reactants demonstrated that the predominant species was a calcium hydrogen phosphate of MDP. In contrast, the dentin yielded both calcium hydrogen phosphate and calcium phosphate of MDP. These assignments are possible since the chemical shift of the NMR peak assigned to the methylene carbon, bonded to the phosphoric acid, is very sensitive to the environment in which the phosphoric acid exists: [-CH<sub>2</sub>-O-P(O)(OH)<sub>2</sub>], [-CH<sub>2</sub>-O-P(O)(OH)(O<sup>−</sup>)] and [-CH<sub>2</sub>-O-P(O)(O<sup>−</sup>)<sub>2</sub>], which is the same as that of N-methacryloyl aminoalkyl phosphonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512458925">Nishiyama <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512458925">2007</xref>). The difference in the molecular species between the MDP-enamel and MDP-dentin reactants was attributed to the fact that dentin eluted greater amounts of calcium ion through the demineralization process than did enamel. This was probably due to the greater MDP solubilization rate of hydroxyapatite in the dentin compared with that in the enamel. However, the intensity ratio of NMR peak “g1” to NMR peak “g2” increased with increases in the amount of MDP in the experimental adhesive. Consequently, the dentin yielded predominantly calcium phosphate of MDP below 49.9 mg/g and calcium hydrogen phosphate of MDP above 80.5 mg/g. The observed structural change of MDP-Ca salt may be due to the fact that most of the calcium ions solubilized from the dentin were consumed, to yield dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) as a by-product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512458925">Fukegawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The addition of MDP to the EX-0 adhesive resulted in significant increases in both enamel and dentin bond strengths. This was due to the MDP demineralization, which roughened the enamel and dentin surfaces and allowed for the creation of a micro-mechanical inter-locking with the enamel surface, and also hybridization of exposed dentin collagen fibers during the hardening process of the adhesive. The deteriorations in enamel and dentin bond strengths for the amount of MDP-Ca salt were above 45.6 mg and 57.9 mg, respectively. The deterioration in both bond strengths observed in this study was probably related to changes in the type of fracture mode, and thus to decreases in the number of specimens where the ARI score was 2. Therefore, the hypothesis that the amount of MDP-Ca salt would have no effect on the bonding performance of the experimental adhesive was rejected.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512458925">Yoshihara <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref> observed a lower deterioration in the dentin bond strength compared with our results. This was probably due to differences in the adhesion system. The observed deteriorations were due to a weakening of the adhesive layer, caused by a decrease in the polymerization reactivity of the methacryloyloxy group of MDP-Ca salt. Another possibility was due to the dissolution of DCPD at the resin-enamel and-dentin interfaces. The observed greater deterioration in dentin bond strength was due to the resin tags being pulled off from the dentinal tubules, probably due to the MDP-Ca salt and DCPD being localized at the peritubular dentin surrounding dentin tubules. This was because the peritubular dentin was demineralized more effectively than the intertubular dentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512458925">Weiner <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the observed deterioration in both bond strengths may have occurred when the amounts of MDP-Ca salt were less than in our results. This was due to differences in the experimental conditions: (1) the contact time of adhesive to enamel and dentin, and (2) the surface area of enamel and dentin exposed by adhesive.</p>
<p>It is concluded that bond strength strongly depends on the amount of MDP-Ca through the demineralization process, and an optimal concentration of MDP exists in a one-step self-etch adhesive.</p>
