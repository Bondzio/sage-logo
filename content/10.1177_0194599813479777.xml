<body>
<p>Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and its prevalence has been steadily rising over the past 50 years. It is estimated that nearly 45,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479777">1</xref></sup> Radioactive iodine (RAI) is standard treatment in cases of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas where there is residual thyroid tissue following thyroidectomy or in cases of suspected or known metastases. Papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas, together known as differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs), represent approximately 80% and 11% of thyroid carcinomas, respectively, and as a result, a large number of patients are considered for RAI treatment each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479777">1</xref></sup> Mazzaferri<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813479777">2</xref></sup> studied more than 1000 patients treated with RAI for thyroid remnants following thyroidectomy for DTC and found a decrease in cancer-related deaths and recurrences in patients who were older than 40 years or who had isolated tumors larger than 1.5 cm compared with those patients who did not receive RAI. However, when patients do not fit into these criteria, the decision to use RAI becomes more difficult, and side effects may become a deciding factor in the risk-vs-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>Salivary morbidity is one of the most commonly discussed side effects of RAI. To properly counsel patients with DTC, it is necessary to discuss the risk of salivary morbidity, its potential impact on quality of life, and the possible need for further medical treatment. It is well known from studies in other cancers of the head and neck that sialadenitis following salivary gland radiation can place a significant burden on quality of life and necessitate costly interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813479777">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479777"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813479777">5</xref></sup> Although the presence of salivary side effects following RAI is recognized, the overall impact on quality of life and the prevalence of chronic sialadenitis have not been well described with validated questionnaires or with similarly designed studies. Therefore, it is difficult to objectively quantify the burden of salivary morbidity with RAI.</p>
<p>The present study is a cross-sectional survey of a large cohort of patients with DTC treated at an academic, tertiary cancer referral center. The goal of the study is to determine the prevalence of chronic sialadenitis symptoms in patients treated with RAI and to determine whether these symptoms affect global and swallowing-related quality of life. If it is determined that chronic sialadenitis or reductions in quality of life are indeed an issue in RAI-treated patients, this knowledge may lead to improved assessment of patient symptoms so that intervention can be offered to those most severely affected.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0194599813479777">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The present study is a cross-sectional survey of surviving patients seen at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Hollings Cancer Center, Charleston, for well-differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, and similar histologies) between 2000 and 2011. Eligible subjects included all adult patients (18 years or older) diagnosed with well-differentiated thyroid cancer who were listed as currently alive in the Hollings Cancer Center data registry. The MUSC Investigational Review Board approved the study. Informed consent was waived due to minimal risk to the study subjects and the fact that no patient-identifiable information was included in the study database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599813479777">
<title>Study Materials</title>
<p>A study packet was mailed to each patient that included an introductory letter, a stamped return envelope, a baseline questionnaire, and 3 validated surveys, including the M. D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI), the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL), and the Xerostomia-Related Quality of Life Scale (XeQOLS). Phone calls were made to patients who did not return the surveys within 1 month of mailing. Patients who did not return surveys or who only returned partially completed surveys were excluded from the study. Although RAI status of the patients was unknown at the time of mailing, medical records of patients who returned surveys were reviewed to determine RAI treatment history. Data were not collected on why patients did or did not receive RAI.</p>
<p>The baseline questionnaire used in this study is a 14-item salivary screening survey aimed at capturing general information regarding each patient’s salivary gland functioning. The survey questioned patients about self-perceptions of swallowing dysfunction, history of sialadenitis, treatments received for xerostomia, and factors that could contribute to xerostomia, including caffeine intake, smoking, and use of anticholinergic medications.</p>
<p>The MDADI, created by Chen and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813479777">6</xref></sup> is a validated, self-administered questionnaire that is used to determine the effects of dysphagia on quality of life (QOL) in patients with head and neck cancer. The questionnaire contains 20 questions, which are subcategorized into 1 general QOL question, 6 emotional subscales, 5 functional subscales, and 5 physical subscales. The emotional subscales capture the patient’s affective thoughts and feelings related to dysphagia, whereas the functional subscales reflect how dysphagia affects activities of daily living. The physical subscales quantify the level of difficulty of swallowing, as perceived by the patient. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores on the MDADI reflecting a better QOL and higher functioning.</p>
<p>The UW-QOL is a validated survey that consists of 12 domains, which score patients’ perceptions of pain, appearance, activity, swallowing function, shoulder function, taste, level of recreation, speech, chewing, mood, and anxiety. Scores for each domain range from 0 to 100, and the composite score is the mean of all scores within each of the 12 domains; higher scores reflect a better QOL and higher functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813479777">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The XeQOLS is a validated, self-administered questionnaire that is used to determine the effects of salivary gland dysfunction and xerostomia on patient QOL. This 15-item survey specifically targets 4 domains of QOL: physical, pain, personal/psychological, and social functioning. Each question is answered using a 1 to 5 scale, with higher scores reflecting a lower QOL and a greater degree of symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813479777">8</xref></sup>
</p>

<sec id="section10-0194599813479777">
<title>Study Variables</title>
<p>A database was created that included information from each patient who returned the surveys. The dependent variables were the survey responses, and independent variables included age, sex, race, tumor type, T stage, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, neck dissection status, cumulative RAI dose, and time since first RAI treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599813479777">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data analyses were performed with Sigma Stat 3.5, SPSS 20.0, Sample Power 3.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). Categorical variables were presented as percentages, and continuous variables were presented as mean ± SD. All continuous variables were assessed for normality by use of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Comparisons of outcomes were performed using the χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact test (categorical variables). An independent <italic>t</italic> test or a Mann-Whitney rank-sum test (continuous variables) was used to compare between the 2 groups. Pearson product moment correlation was used to determine the relationship between RAI exposure and sialadenitis. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference for all tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Surveys were mailed to 379 patients who met our eligibility criteria, and 145 patients (38%) returned their surveys. These included 121 women and 24 men, with a mean age of 52 years (range, 18-84 years). Three patients were excluded from the final analysis because RAI history was unobtainable. Ninety-nine patients (68%) had a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma, and 34 (23%) had a diagnosis of follicular variant of papillary carcinoma. Other diagnoses included follicular (n = 9), oxyphilic (n = 2), and H<italic>ü</italic>rthle cell carcinomas (n = 1). Seventy-one percent (n = 103) of patients were AJCC stage 1, followed by 11.7% in stages 3 and 4 (n = 17 for both) and 4.8% in stage 2 (n=7); 1 patient was stage 4B. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813479777"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> summarizes the demographics of our patient population.</p>

<title>Background Questionnaire</title>
<p>One hundred forty-five background questionnaires were returned (38%). Forty-six patients reported having a swallowing problem (31.7%), and 12 patients (8.3%) reported having received treatment from a speech pathologist for swallowing-related issues. Sialadenitis occurred in 29 patients (20%), with multiple occurrences reported by 24 patients. Antibiotics were the most commonly reported treatment for sialadenitis (4.8%), followed by dilation (4.1%) and steroids (2.8%).</p>
<p>Patients were also questioned about treatments for xerostomia and additional factors attributing to xerostomia, such as smoking, caffeine intake, and the use of medications carrying anticholinergic side effects. The most commonly used method of treating xerostomia was water (41.4%), followed by gums or candies (35.9%). Caffeine intake was reported by 118 patients (81.4%), while smoking was reported by only 11 patients (7.6%). Sixty-seven patients (46.2%) used medications that can cause or worsen xerostomia; these included diuretics (32.4%), antidiabetics (9.0%), antihistamines (15.9%), and antipsychotics (2.1%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813479777"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref> summarizes the results from the background questionnaire.</p>

<title>RAI Exposure</title>
<p>Of the 142 patients whose RAI history could be obtained, 116 (82%) had previously received RAI treatment. Total therapeutic dose of RAI, defined as the summation of all doses greater than 30 mCi, ranged from 0 to 828 mCi, with a mean of 149.81 mCi. The average cumulative RAI dose was 154.66 mCi (range, 0-836 mCi). Patients were divided into low-dose (&lt;150 mCi, n = 84) and high-dose (&gt;150 mCi, n = 58) groups to examine the prevalence of sialadenitis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813479777"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref> summarizes the key demographic variables by dose group. Across these groups, the prevalence of self-reported salivary gland problems was 11.9% and 23.8%, respectively. There were zero instances of sialadenitis in the 43 patients who received a cumulative dose of 100 mCi or less of cumulative RAI. The relationship between cumulative RAI exposure and the presence of sialadenitis was examined using the Pearson product moment correlation, and this was determined to be a positive, dose-dependent correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.335, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The number of self-reported gland problems was also positively correlated with RAI exposure (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.217, <italic>P</italic> = .00965). Although patients reported salivary gland problems, self-reported swallowing problems were not found to be significantly positively correlated with RAI exposure (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.0923, <italic>P</italic> = .276). However, when comparing patients who received 150 mCi or less with those receiving greater than 150 mCi, patients in the higher exposure group were significantly more likely to experience sialadenitis (odds ratio [OR], 2.4737; <italic>P</italic> = .0416).

<title>QOL Data</title>
<p>Quality-of-life scores were assessed in the patients via the XeQOLS, MDADI, and UW-QOL surveys. To examine the impact of RAI dose on QOL scores, patients were divided into 2 dosing groups: greater than 150 mCi of RAI exposure (n = 58) and less than 150 mCi or no RAI exposure (n = 84). Radioactive iodine exposure greater than 150 mCi was associated with a significant reduction in quality of life in the recreation domain of the UW-QOL (74.07 vs 83.73, <italic>P</italic> = .02) and the general swallowing QOL domain of the MDADI (79.65 vs 97.90, <italic>P</italic> = .02). In addition, this dosing group showed a significant decline in QOL in the pain (6.88 vs 5.73, P = .03), personal/psychological (6.86 vs 5.71, P = .04), and social functioning (4.19 vs 3.5, <italic>P</italic> = .03) QOL domains of the XeQOLS.

<p>As a secondary analysis, we omitted the patients who received no RAI and compared only those with at least some RAI exposure less than 150 mCi (n = 58) with those with greater than 150 mCi of exposure (n = 58). In this analysis, there was a similar decline in QOL in the high-dose group when compared with the low-dose group. On the UW-QOL, the recreation domain was again significantly different (74.07 vs 83.19, <italic>P</italic> = .04). On the MDADI, the daily activities domain showed a similar decline (79.65 vs 89.64, <italic>P</italic> = .01). However, on the XeQOLS, although there was a trend toward lower quality of life in the high-dose group, none of the domains were significantly different.

<p>When stratified by presence of sialadenitis, there were significant differences between groups in all 4 domains of the XeQOLS survey (physical functioning, personal/psychological functioning, pain/discomfort, and social functioning), with the presence of sialadenitis being associated with a greater degree of symptoms, which was depicted as a higher score.

<p>The prevalence of sialadenitis following RAI for DTC is variable throughout the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813479777">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813479777"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813479777"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813479777">12</xref></sup> Alexander and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813479777">9</xref></sup> found that 33% of patients reported sialadenitis within 3 months of RAI and that 43% of patients reported xerostomia greater than 3 months post-RAI. In addition, Allweiss and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813479777">10</xref></sup> found that 11.5% of patients developed sialadenitis within 6 months of RAI for thyroid carcinoma, with the parotid glands and submandibular glands being affected at nearly the same rate. Almeida et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813479777">11</xref></sup> found that 43.4% of patients treated with RAI for thyroid carcinoma reported use of xerostomic medications, but only 9.5% of patients reported dry mouth and/or dysphagia. They also found that higher doses of RAI were associated with significantly more symptoms. Hyer and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813479777">12</xref></sup> conducted a prospective study of patients receiving RAI for thyroid cancer and found that 21% had evidence of salivary gland toxicity greater than 12 months following therapy, based on patient-reported symptoms assessed during hospital admission or clinic visits.</p>
<p>Van Norstrand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813479777">13</xref></sup> suggested that the variability of sialadenitis is due to numerous factors, including dosage, intervals between treatments, gland uptake factors, comorbid disease, xerostomic medications, and preventive measures. In the present study’s population, RAI dose was the only variable found to be significant in the prevalence of sialadenitis. There was no incidence of sialadenitis in patients who received less than 100 mCi, including those patients who were not treated with RAI. However, 26% of patients receiving 100 to 200 mCi experienced sialadenitis, and the prevalence was 43% in patients who were cumulatively treated with over 200 mCi of RAI. Furthermore, when patients were divided into high-dose and low-dose groups, those patients receiving greater than 150 mCi of RAI were almost 2.5 times more likely to experience sialadenitis than patients receiving 150 mCi or less (OR, 2.47; <italic>P</italic> = .04). Additional studies examining the impact of cumulative RAI dose on the prevalence of sialadenitis would help support this finding.</p>
<p>Cumulative RAI exposure of over 150 mCi was determined to be a predictor of several QOL scores. The impact of RAI on quality of life in thyroid cancer patients has been examined once before by Almeida and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813479777">14</xref></sup> They divided patients into low-dose (150 mCi or less) and high-dose (more than 150 mCi) groups and found that the high-dose group reported significantly worse pain, swallowing, chewing, speech, taste, anxiety, and composite scores on the UW-QOL. In this study’s population, only the recreation domain of the UW-QOL was significant. However, all but one of the UW-QOL domain scores declined in the high-dose group, and scores also declined in all domains of both the MDADI and XeQOLS questionnaires. In comparing the demographics and QOL scores between this population with those studied by Almeida et al, it is possible that fewer of the UW-QOL domains achieved significance as a result of differences between the 2 studies’ population demographics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813479777">14</xref></sup> This study’s population was older (67.6% vs 52.6% older than 45 years), had more advanced thyroid cancer (28.2% vs 14.9% stage 2 or greater), and included a higher percentage of patients who underwent neck dissection (49.7% vs 24.6%). These factors likely led to the overall lower QOL scores (median composite UW-QOL 86.83 vs 93.05) and, therefore, made the QOL scores less responsive to differences in RAI dose. Perhaps with a larger sample size or with demographics more similar to the population in Almeida et al, findings would be both significant and more closely related to those findings seen in other QOL studies.</p>
<p>This study is the first to examine the impact of RAI-induced sialadenitis on QOL. In previous studies, there was a correlation between escalating RAI dose and salivary morbidity. In addition, in this study, only the patients who received greater than 100 mCi of RAI reported sialadenitis. Because of these findings, patients who receive greater than 100 mCi of RAI should be followed more closely for sialadenitis. Furthermore, given that sialadenitis is associated with a reduction in QOL and an elevated risk of experiencing recurrent sialadenitis, immediate treatment is warranted when sialadenitis first occurs in patients treated with RAI. In our study, 24 of the 29 patients who reported sialadenitis had multiple incidents, including 18 with 3 or more instances of sialadenitis.</p>
<p>Recently, salivary endoscopy has shown to be a safe and effective treatment for RAI-induced sialadenitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813479777">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813479777">16</xref></sup> Bomeli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813479777">15</xref></sup> noted improvement in 9 of 12 patients (75%), and Prendes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813479777">16</xref></sup> saw initial improvement in 10 of 11 patients (91%), with 6 of 11 (54%) having sustained benefit after 2 years of follow-up. Although this treatment appears promising, it is unclear at this time whether thyroid cancer clinicians are aware of this treatment alternative for patients with ongoing symptoms of chronic sialadenitis.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study include the limited sample size, the inability to adequately assess comorbid conditions, and the fact that the baseline questionnaire used is not validated. In addition, there is a potential for recruitment bias since patients with previous or ongoing salivary symptoms may be more motivated to return a survey that investigates their symptoms, and as a result, the sample may overestimate the prevalence of chronic sialadenitis in the RAI-treated population. It is hypothesized that the trend in reduced quality of life observed in increasing RAI dose groups would become significant by enrolling more patients and by controlling for comorbid conditions in the regression model. In addition, because we were unable to accurately measure the timing of patients’ salivary symptoms or QOL reductions in relation to their RAI treatments, conclusions regarding the causation cannot be made. The ability to track these measures over time would help guide treatment planning and provide additional data for further study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Salivary morbidity is a common side effect of RAI treatment and has been shown to lead to both sialadenitis and a decreased QOL. In the present study, we found that RAI exposure was correlated with a reduction in swallowing-related and global head and neck quality of life and that patients treated with RAI exhibited an increased risk of sialadenitis. In addition, the presence of sialadenitis was associated with a decrease in swallowing-related quality of life, especially in the context of xerostomia. Ultimately, our findings suggest that patients should be screened for salivary morbidity and that they may benefit from not only prophylactic treatments aimed at protecting the salivary glands prior to RAI exposure but also techniques following RAI-induced sialadenitis, such as salivary endoscopy.</p>
