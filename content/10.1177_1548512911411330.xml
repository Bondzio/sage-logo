<abstract>
<p>In this work, the resistance and deformation characteristics of a brittle material against rain erosion are examined by using the non-linear, explicit software LS-DYNA. The water jet with varying speeds impinges at 90° on silica float glass plates with different thicknesses. In the simulations, the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method is used for modelling of the water. In order to analyse the deformations on the brittle material Johnson–Holmquist–Ceramics (JH-2) is used as the material model. Minimum plate thickness (for constant water jet speed) and maximum water speed (for constant plate thickness), which do not cause any damage to the target, are determined depending on the geometry, boundary conditions and assumed failure strain value for erosion. The results are compared with the water-hammer pressure.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Optical windows or lenses are required for EO (electro-optical) devices, such as goggles or cameras, that are employed in the defence industry and/or professional applications. Being interface components of the EO devices between inside and outside, these windows can be seriously damaged in harsh working conditions by impingement of rain, sand or any other small particles at relative high velocities. In a study in 1994,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911411330">1</xref></sup> it is mentioned that windows of the EO devices are seriously damaged as a result of particle impact in high-velocity aircrafts. Occurred damages on the windows or lenses result in transmission degradation and cause the EO devices not to work properly. It is also mentioned in the same study that 200 windows are condemned and discarded as useless out of the 1100 windows examined.</p>
<p>Among all the reasons that are responsible for the failure of the windows, only rain erosion is selected within the scope of this study and deformation caused by the high-velocity water jet impact is examined by using numerical simulation techniques. In a related study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548512911411330">2</xref></sup> water drop impact to a layered window construction (substrate, bond layer and protective layer) is examined by using DYNA-2D and DYNA-3D. An important point mentioned in the literature regarding liquid impact theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512911411330">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911411330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548512911411330"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548512911411330">6</xref></sup> is the occurrence of the water-hammer pressure that is formed when the liquid impacts a rigid surface. At the first stages of the impact the initiation pressure can be higher than the water-hammer pressure for a short period of time. Water-hammer pressure depends on the liquid density (ρ), wave speed (<italic>c</italic>) and impact velocity (ν), and can be calculated with the formula below:</p>

<title>2. Construction of the simulation</title>
<sec id="section3-1548512911411330">
<title>2.1. Solution technique: finite element analysis method</title>
<p>There are two materials used in the simulation at different phases, one of which is solid (window) and the other is fluid (water). Window can be modelled with Lagrangian mesh, which is generally preferred for solids that do not experience too much shape change. In Lagrangian meshes, material points and nodes of the elements are coincident. Consequently, as the material is distorted during the simulation, the mesh is also distorted, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512911411330">Figure 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548512911411330">7</xref></sup> At the end of the simulation, each Lagrangian element (mesh) attached to the geometry should deform to some extent. If the deformation limit of a specific element is exceeded, the simulation may have errors or give wrong results due to the excessive deformation. Therefore, the Lagrangian technique is insufficient to simulate the behaviour of the water or any other fluid that is exposed to large deformations. Because of this, Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) or Eulerian techniques are better than Lagrangian ones for the modelling of fluids.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1548512911411330" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>Behaviour of the Lagrangian (top) and Eulerian (bottom) meshes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548512911411330">7</xref></sup></p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548512911411330-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In ALE or Eulerian mesh, material points and nodes do not remain coincident throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512911411330">Figure 1</xref>) and elements do not deform with the material as they do in the Lagrangian mesh. Initially the mesh is distorted slightly, and then it is recovered, advected or remapped to its original shape in each time step repeatedly. Thus, there are always undistorted meshes provided for the deformation of the fluid to simulate its behaviour. In order to establish this technique, a background mesh in which material moves should be defined formerly in the simulation. This background mesh is called void in the ALE technique in LS-DYNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548512911411330">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The difference between the ALE and Eulerian techniques is that the Eulerian mesh is fixed in the space and dimensions of the elements remain constant throughout the simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512911411330">Figure 1</xref>). However, ALE mesh can move in the space and the user can control this movement according to the simulation. Moreover, dimensions of the elements can be changed by changing the expansion parameter for each dimension in LS-DYNA.</p>
<p>In the current study, the ALE method is used and the void (background mesh) follows the water in the path of motion. Prepared models with this technique are run with Ansys LS-DYNA.</p>

<sec id="section4-1548512911411330">
<title>2.2. Geometry, initial and boundary conditions</title>
<p>The model consists of three geometries with the required void definition for the solution technique, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548512911411330">Figure 2</xref>. Dimensions of the model are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548512911411330">Table 1</xref>. Initial velocity is defined in the –<italic>z</italic> direction as the initial condition.

<p>The size of void (A) is defined in accordance with the size of the water. The size of the void should be big enough that water does not move out of the boundary (before the process is almost over) and small enough for minimum computational time. The size of the silica is chosen to be large enough not to be influenced by the end effects. By doing this, side surfaces of the silica would simulate the infinitely large plate.</p>

<sec id="section5-1548512911411330">
<title>2.3. Material models</title>
<p>Non-linear, explicit finite element software needs material models in order to define the behaviour of the materials. These material models consist of mathematical formulations and sometimes require very complex parameters for description. Material model selection and proper determination of its parameters play a very important role in simulations, since they affect the results significantly.</p>
<p>There are two different material models needed for the simulation. The water jet and the void use the same material model by definition in the ALE method in LS-DYNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548512911411330">9</xref></sup> Among the material models available in LS-DYNA is ‘MAT-NULL + EOS-GRUNEISEN’, which is the most common material model for modelling the water, and is used for the water jet and the void.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548512911411330">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The other material model is required for silica float glass, which is a brittle material and represents the window for the present study. Mechanical properties of brittle materials are different from ductile materials and expressing brittle materials in terms of a material model for an explicit, non-linear software is not as common as expressing the ductile materials. Since the ceramics is the general name of the window and dome materials of EO devices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548512911411330">11</xref></sup> both definitions of glass and/or ceramics are well suited to silica float glass. Among the limited material models for silica float glass, the reference table in the user’s manual<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548512911411330">9</xref></sup> recommends MAT17, MAT33 and MAT59 for ceramic applications and MAT32 and MAT60 for glass applications. In addition to the mentioned material models, MAT110 (MAT-Johnson–Holmquist–Ceramics (JH-2)) is recommended for both ceramics and glass applications in the reference table. Furthermore, MAT110 is a complete material model that contains damage effects, failure criteria (these two features are useful tools in post processing) and Equation of State (EOS) constants all together. However, MAT32, MAT33, MAT59 and MAT60 have no damage effects; moreover, MAT33 and MAT60 have no failure criteria either. MAT17 needs an EOS definition separately for the pressure constants in order to work and has no damage effect. Consideration of all these suggestions together makes MAT110 the most appropriate choice for silica float glass in the current study.</p>
<p>Because of the mentioned factors above, JH-2 is preferred for silica float glass. The values of the parameters for silica float glass are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548512911411330">Table 2</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548512911411330">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>The JH-2 material model is improved for brittle materials subjected to large strains, high strain rates and high pressures by Johnson and Holmquist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548512911411330">13</xref></sup> and is compatible with both Lagrangian and Eulerian codes.

<title>3. Results of the simulation</title>
<p>The velocity of the water jet and thickness of the silica float glass are defined as parameters in simulations. Obtained results are evaluated according to the failed elements (deleted or eroded) that reach a specified strain value defined in the material model. In addition to that, pressure distribution with the time for different velocities of the water jet is examined on a selected element on the silica float glass.</p>
<sec id="section7-1548512911411330">
<title>3.1. Plate thickness</title>
<p>In order to correlate plate thickness and the damage, a constant 150 m/s velocity is given to the water jet and the plate thickness is changed between 0.4 and 5 mm. Damage is located at the top, depending on the thickness, and at the back face of the plate as a result of high stress and/or strain during the collision. Breakdown begins when the current effective plastic strain on an element is higher than the FS (failure strain), which is assumed as 10% in the material model for the silica float glass. Erosion (deletion) of the elements that reach the FS is provided so that visualization of the damage becomes possible.</p>
<p>The plate with 0.4 mm thickness is perforated by the impact of water jet at 150 m/s, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911411330">Figure 4</xref>, and particle rupture (breakage) at the bottom of the plate is observed depending on the brittle properties of the material. There is no perforation at the plates with 1, 2 and 3 mm thicknesses. Nevertheless, reflected tensile waves from the bottom side of the plate caused the particle to rupture again. These tensile waves are formed as soon as the compressive waves, occurred at the initiation of impact, reflect from the bottom side, since the nodes at the bottom of the plate are not fixed. Particle rupture at the bottom side of the plate can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1548512911411330">Figure 5</xref> for the 1 mm thickness plate. When the plate thickness is increased to 4 mm, there are only 36 elements eroded on the top of the plate. For 5 mm and higher thicknesses there is no damage observed. However, the damage conditions mentioned above are related only with the 150 m/s velocity of water jet. Higher or lower impact velocities may change the characteristics of the damage.</p>

<p>The relationship between the number of deleted elements and the thickness of the plate for the 150 m/s velocity of water jet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1548512911411330">Figure 6</xref>. Although variable element sizes are used in the simulation, the number of eroded elements gives an idea about the amount of the damage. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1548512911411330">Figure 6</xref>, with the decrease of the plate thickness the damage (amount of deleted elements) on the brittle material is increasing rapidly. When the plate thickness is one fifth of the water jet diameter, the deformation reaches the maximum value and perforation occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911411330">Figure 4</xref>). Decaying of the slope of the curve for the low plate thicknesses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1548512911411330">Figure 6</xref> is caused by the decrease of the plate thickness, not the decrease of the damage quantity.</p>

FS is again assumed as 10% in this section.

There is no damage observed under the 150 m/s as it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1548512911411330">Figure 7</xref>. However, with the increased velocities of the water jet, damage also increases rapidly. The maximum velocity that does not cause any damage on the silica float glass is found to be 150 m/s, depending on the analysis parameters, geometries and defined FS value.</p>

<p>Simulations are repeated for water jet velocities of 250 and 150 m/s in order to determine the pressure distribution on the material during the impact. Erosion is not defined in this section, so deletion of elements is not allowed. The plate with 1 mm thickness is used for the simulations and the time interval is one nanosecond between two saved pressure data. Pressure distribution on a selected element from the centre region of the impact is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1548512911411330">Figure 9</xref> for two different velocities. From the results, it is observed that for both velocities of water jet, pressures reach a peak value for a short period of time interval and they begin to fluctuate afterwards. The maximum pressure value obtained for 250 m/s (A) is 580 MPa, which is 1.56 times the water-hammer pressure value (371 MPa) calculated from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1548512911411330">Equation (1)</xref>. Similarly, for the 150 m/s the peak pressure is 350 MPa, which is 1.57 times the water-hammer pressure (222 MPa). As mentioned in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512911411330">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911411330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548512911411330"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548512911411330">6</xref></sup> obtained peak values are higher than the calculated water-hammer pressure. Pressures reduce to water-hammer pressure after a maximum value and last longer than the peak value for both velocities.</p>

<p>The pressure for 250 m/s starts earlier than that for 150 m/s. The reason for this is a constant gap that should be given initially for the simulation between water and the target. Since the gap (0.5 mm) is equal for both velocities, the water jet at 250 m/s can reach the target earlier and therefore the pressure starts earlier than that of 150m/s.</p>

<title>4. Conclusion</title>
<p>Behaviour of a specific brittle material silica float glass is investigated within the scope of rain erosion. Damage caused by the water jet impacts is examined by changing the plate thickness and the water jet velocity in order to see the effects of different parameters. Three different types of damages are observed on the brittle material. The first type of damage occurs when the plate is very thin and results in maximum deformation, which causes perforation of the plate. When the plate thickness is increased up to a value that perforation does not exist, high deformations, such as particle rupture, take place particularly at the bottom of the plate, which is the second type of damage. As long as the thickness of the plate is increased, particle rupture at the bottom of the plate disappears and the deformation moves to the top surface of the material, with circular damage patterns for the last deformation type.</p>
<p>Simulation studies can be used in the design of the lenses, windows or similar brittle materials, which are utilized in military applications by considering the effect of the impact of the water jet or similar particles at high velocities. However, it is clear that there is a need to verify these assumptions and corresponding results with experimental studies.</p>
