<abstract>
<p>The article examines the emerging welfare state in China through an analysis of the poverty-relief program of <italic>song wennuan</italic>, which sends the ‘warmth’ of the party in the form of gift to unemployed workers. In addition to material support, <italic>song wennuan</italic> which is imbued with psychologically infused ideologies and practice prescribes particular emotions and thought processes to and for the poor. Unlike the Western therapeutic (welfare) state which normalizes the marginalized, <italic>song wennuan</italic> nurtures the poor to highlight the benevolence of an affective state. This program thus transforms the poor from subjects with rights to objects of care, translating the exercise of power into an affective and therapeutic activity. Such affective measures patch up political and economic ‘wounds’ caused by economic restructuring and legitimate the ruling party’s continued existence in the market economy.</p>

<p>I compare the party to my mother, who brought me up … The sunshine of the party sheds light on my heart. (<italic>The Red Sun,</italic> a popular Chinese song)</p>
<p>Pseudo-leaders [of state enterprises] fake caring and are awash in a sea of insincerity. They pretend to empathize and care, but they are mainly selfish office holders working to buttress their own power and amass even more. They are like actors mimicking concern, playing a high-stakes game of deception as they work to make their audience believe their illusions: the pancake make-up face of warmth, the prose of compassion and the slogans of care.

<p>The above contradictory images of the ruling party in China are both represented in the recent poverty-relief program of <italic>song wennuan</italic> (sending warmth).<sup>1</sup> Since 1997, <italic>song wennuan</italic> has been established by the All China Federation of Trade Unions (hereafter ACFTU) to relieve ‘the new urban poverty’, the poverty of those who have been laid off from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1466138111435043">Wu and Huang, 2007</xref>). Up to the mid-1990s, China’s urban economic restructuring (downscaling and privatizing the state sector and expanding the private sector and service industry) had displaced over 35 million workers from SOEs and transformed 12–15 million of them into ‘the new urban poor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111435043">Kernan and Rocca, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1466138111435043">Wang and Zheng, 2008</xref>). Unlike the ‘equally’ distributed absolute poverty of Mao’s era (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1466138111435043">Warnecke, 2011</xref>), this recent poverty is relative – the result of yawning income gaps and wealth disparity between workers and the expanding middle class – and has led to widespread social unrest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1466138111435043">2</xref></sup> In evaluating the seriousness of working-class threats to governance in China, Marc Blecher points out:<disp-quote>
<p>[w]hen such a massive, geographically concentrated class with a definite history of radicalism suffers so precipitous an absolute and relative decline in its material conditions, social status, and political and ideological position, the state has a governance problem. (2004: 194)</p></disp-quote>Blecher further argues that workers pose a particular structural challenge in governance, because having lost their affiliations with SOEs they have more free time and private space to think about and organize protests. China has therefore prioritized the management of instability resulting from worker layoffs, undertaking ad hoc measures to create jobs and relieve poverty. These measures include the establishment of a minimum guaranteed income,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1466138111435043">3</xref></sup> a donation-based poverty-relief program to ease the plight of the poor across the country,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1466138111435043">4</xref></sup> and the urban poverty-relief program of <italic>song wennuan</italic> run by ACFTU.</p>
<p>This article focuses on the <italic>song wennuan</italic> program in particular in order to examine the politics of welfare provision and the emerging welfare state in China. <italic>Song wennuan</italic> was implemented in 1997. By the end of that year, the ACFTU had set up funds, branch offices, and communication systems for <italic>song wennuan</italic> all over the country. Twenty-seven provincial-level, 576 city-level, 2800 district- and county-level and 17,000 grassroots-level branch offices were established with funds amounting to 2 billion RMB; and more than 180,000 ACFTU cadres had established communications with 35,000 enterprises. More than four million households had reportedly received support (<italic>People’s Daily</italic>, 17 December <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138111435043">1997</xref>). In this article, I examine both cash and daily necessities (e.g. 200–300 RMB, a bottle of cooking oil, and a bag of rice or flour in Changping, Beijing) were provided in the form of a ‘gift’ to those ‘households in particular difficulty’ (<italic>tekunhu</italic>), typically before important Chinese festivals.</p>
<p>Although poverty-relief measures as a form of charity are nothing new in Chinese history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1466138111435043">Smith, 2009</xref>), <italic>song wennuan</italic> has taken on a new political and ideological significance – re-inserting the social after dismantling the socialist system of job security and public welfare and thus re-inserting the state into the life of impoverished workers after the breakdown of the socialist work-unit system as the institutional basis for political control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1466138111435043">Lu and Perry, 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1466138111435043">5</xref></sup> By sending ‘gifts’ to the urban poor, the party shows ‘<italic>renqing</italic>’ (human feelings) or ‘compassion’ to the very people its economic policies have impoverished. Such compassion and <italic>renqing</italic> together with counseling constitute the party’s affective and therapeutic strategies, which, in the name of care and healing, attempt to make the suffering more tolerable. Although <italic>renqing</italic> and compassion appear to bridge inequality, they are emotions shown towards a person in distress by one who is free from it, engaging a social relation between spectators and sufferers that may be subject to corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111435043">Berlant, 2004</xref>: 67). Such compassion may reinforce the very patterns of economic and political subordination responsible for the suffering it purports to alleviate. Presenting gifts as a form of <italic>renqing</italic> enables the party not only to elicit gratitude from the impoverished and absorb their criticism and discontent, but also exercises social control in the guise of affection and therapy. However, unlike the Western notion of the therapeutic state which normalizes the marginalized to minimize state responsibility for the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111435043">Fraser, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1466138111435043">Polsky, 1991</xref>; see below), <italic>song wennuan</italic>, by highlighting the affective involvement of the party in the livelihood of the poor, nurtures the ‘victims’ in order to redress the eroded state-society relation by privatization.</p>
<p>This article examines the <italic>song wennuan</italic> program at a state-owned watch factory in Beijing, which between 2002 and 2003 was engaged in privatization through a joint venture with a Swiss company.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1466138111435043">6</xref></sup> In this factory, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111435043">Blecher’s (2004)</xref> view that workers’ capacity to pose structural challenges is increased by losing their affiliation with SOEs, the alienation and demoralization that result from being laid off make it difficult for unemployed workers to radically challenge inequalities perpetuated by the powerful. More likely are instances of desperate resistance that are enacted in isolation of each other rather than as part of a programmatic collective attempt, such as individual suicides or threats of violence against SOE managers (see below). Through the affective and therapeutic measures of <italic>song wennuan</italic>, the party upholds a caring image to reinforce the stability of its regime. Further demonstrating its agenda of managing instability caused by layoffs, the government has prioritized unemployed urban male workers as recipients of <italic>song wennuan</italic> over other types of urban poor such as women, migrant workers, and those who have never entered the socialist work-unit system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111435043">Cho, 2006</xref>); laid-off men are perceived as more destabilizing, posing a greater threat to government than women. Such relief rationale thus entrenches new forms of inequality among the urban poor.</p>
<p>The article begins by describing worker unrest since the mid-1990s and the discourse of instability that singles out laid-off men as more destabilizing, thus as the main recipients of <italic>song wennuan</italic>. The article then engages in discussions on affect and the therapeutic state; it suggests that <italic>renqing</italic> practiced in <italic>song wennuan</italic> constitutes an affective and therapeutic strategy. This section also situates the party’s engagement with the unemployed within the clashes between class and status in the post-Mao era. The article goes on to demonstrate how <italic>song wennuan</italic> acts not only as a nexus of affects and therapeutic devices to absorb workers’ criticism and disarm potential resistance, but also as a site of contestation through the politics of ‘crying poverty’ (<italic>kuqiong</italic>). The final section of the article suggests that <italic>song wennuan</italic> as a stratifying mechanism forms a powerful obstacle for the poor to articulate common interests vis-a-vis the state. It is in fact rural migrants or poor women who have borne the brunt of privatization and disproportionately shoulder the burden of the reduction of funding and public welfare (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435043">also Afshaar and Dennis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111435043">Clarke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435043">Kingfisher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1466138111435043">Song, 2006</xref>). However, <italic>song wennuan</italic> prioritizes the poverty of male laid-off workers and problematizes them as requiring affective or therapeutic care in order to sustain stability.</p>
<p>The emerging welfare state in China is part of its postsocialist transition and uniquely emphasizes its continuities with ‘egalitarian,’ and collective socialist ethics, which, in the case of <italic>song wennuan</italic>, has meant prioritizing affective and therapeutic forms of power over coercive measures. I examine <italic>song wennuan</italic> not only as inherently cultural—based on historically specific discourses of gender, class, employment and <italic>renqing</italic>—but also as politically motivated and deployed, that is, care for the urban poor is designed to smooth out political and economic ‘wounds’ and construct an image of a benevolent, responsible government. This article thus offers a critique of the Western notion of the therapeutic state which minimizes the state’s responsibility for the individual’s life through an ethnographic study of an affective state emerging from a postsocialist context, contributing to literature on the anthropology of welfare (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111435043">Clarke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435043">Kingfisher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435043">Kingfisher and Goldsmith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1466138111435043">Russell and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111435043">Schneider, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec1-1466138111435043"><title>Labor unrest and the discourse of instability</title>
<p>When China’s new state leadership took power in 2002, it ushered in new governing styles to strengthen its affinity with the masses. Invoking Mencius’s doctrine of benevolence (<italic>ren</italic>), the government has claimed that the people and people’s livelihood are the basis of its rule (<italic>yi min wen ben</italic>; <italic>minsheng wei ben</italic>). Mencius (371–289 BCE), endorsed as Confucius’s authentic interpreter, emphasized benevolent rule and moralizing politics in empire building. He believed that if the ruler of a state loves benevolence, he will have no enemy in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1466138111435043">2004</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1466138111435043">7</xref></sup> China’s emphasis on benevolence in governing is part of the political project of constructing ‘a harmonious society’, which is putatively people-centered and socially and economically sustainable. In the first press conference after his election, Premier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1466138111435043">Wen Jiabao (2003)</xref> credited economic achievements to a stable society and emphasized the importance of relying on the people to sustain stability. In this context, <italic>song wennuan</italic> has been implemented by ACFTU to meld the party, government, and the people closely together. Such pacifying measures become a ‘band-aid’ to cover the ‘holes’ or ‘splits’ in the social fabric caused by socioeconomic dislocation.</p>
<p>In the Beijing factory where I have conducted research since 2002, two-thirds of the workforce have been given ‘an extended holiday’ (a euphemism for layoff) since 1997. In the absence of a well-financed welfare system or efficient re-employment program, most of the unemployed had to re-employ themselves as pedicab drivers or fruit/food-stand ‘entrepreneurs’. Unable to make a living through such small, competitive businesses, (male) workers often returned to the factory to ‘make a fuss’ (<italic>naoshi)</italic>. Violence against management became much more frequent than before. The following events since 1997 exemplify workers’ anger and resistance against privatization. In February 2002, a factory warehouse was broken into and raw materials worth 200,000 RMB stolen, despite four gate guards on duty that night. The police were certain that this involved insider assistance. In another instance, an agitated laid-off worker had sought revenge by reporting the ‘death’ of the factory party secretary to the local crematory and asking for a corpse-collection van to be sent to this party secretary’s home. Since 1998, two workers committed suicide, each with a note blaming job loss. One of them was only 26 years old. He was survived by his wife, then six months pregnant, and his sick father in hospital. These suicides shocked the community and aroused popular resentment against privatization. The factory director received numerous phone calls with threats to kill him. In response, the director spread the word that he would place a rubber effigy of himself with a stick at the factory gate, so that workers could beat it to vent their anger. This diversionary strategy was intended to show his ‘helplessness’ toward the ongoing privatization and his understanding of the price workers had paid.</p>
<p>In the context of such labor unrest, <italic>song wennuan</italic> has become the chosen method of relieving tension between management and (male) workers. Since the mid-1990s, unemployed males have come to be seen as the embodiment of social instability in China; associated as it is with full-time employment, losing these jobs is perceived as the erosion of manhood. Thus, implicit in the principle of maintaining stability is a strategy of governing men and masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1466138111435043">Yang, 2010</xref>). As a consequence, poverty relief (or re-employment) policies and practices often direct their efforts toward pacifying men and bolstering their sense of masculinity rather than addressing broader needs. This means that although within a culturally, discursively, and politically unique context in China (see below), <italic>song wennuan –</italic> not unlike Western welfare state restructuring, which has been read as a restructuring around gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435043">Kingfisher, 2002</xref>; O’Connor, 1996) – positions men and women differently as subjects, providing gendered incentives and services. For example, although women often directly received home visit teams for song wennuan, it was their men—sons or husbands—that legitimated their households for song wennuan. In other words, the type of family qualified for <italic>song wennuan</italic> in the factory was implicitly a household composed of a man, a disgruntled man, who had often been laid off, and was perceived by management as posing potential threats to social stability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1466138111435043">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1466138111435043"><title>Affect, <italic>renqing</italic> and the affective state</title>
<p>Although women often for <italic>Song wennuan</italic> to the urban poor resembles both the practice of <italic>renqing</italic> and the working of the therapeutic state, but differs from both. According to Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111435043">Kipnis (1997: 29)</xref>, the <italic>renqing</italic> (Kipnis uses a similar term, <italic>ganqing</italic>) created through illness visits by fellow villagers in rural north China was considered as actively contributing to curing the sick, making an otherwise depressing situation somewhat positive. In <italic>song wennuan</italic> – not that different from such illness home visits because of the recent pathologization of poverty and unemployment in Chinese media by labeling the unemployed or the poor who committed crimes or public vandalism as ‘mentally ill’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1466138111435043">Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1466138111435043">Zhao, 2018</xref>) – the practice of <italic>renqing</italic> and home visits thus perform a (superficial) therapeutic function to ‘heal’ the poor. In such a therapeutic framework, the party staff problematized the urban poor and their difficulties and distress, constituting them as issues which must be addressed, modified, or cured. The party thus intervenes in unemployment and poverty through affective measures such as <italic>song wennuan</italic>. The default rhetoric of <italic>song wennuan</italic> is that ‘we understand your suffering but at least you still have the party to take care of you’. In this sense, <italic>song wennuan</italic> transforms the unemployed from the subject with rights to an object of care. The gift and <italic>renqing</italic> practice have the power to obligate the poor, promoting certain feelings and attitudes (i.e. gratitude toward the giver in order for the poor to reciprocate with non-resistance). The exercise of power is thus translated into an activity of care and therapy.</p>
<p><italic>Song wennuan</italic> is also embedded with psychologically infused ideologies and practices (i.e. precepts loosely identified with positive psychology, counseling techniques, etc., see below). The enmeshing of such expertise or knowledge in the networks of welfare to prescribe feelings and thought processes is a function of the therapeutic state. However, unlike the Western notion of the therapeutic welfare state which normalizes the marginalized to minimize the role of the state in the individual’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1466138111435043">Chriss, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111435043">Furedi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138111435043">Miller and Rose, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138111435043">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1466138111435043">Polsky, 1991</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1466138111435043">9</xref></sup> <italic>song wennuan</italic> acknowledges the state’s responsibility (however superficially and tactically) for the people and highlights the benevolence of the party-state in order to redress the eroded state-society relationship and legitimate the continued existence of the party in the market economy. <italic>Song wennuan</italic> thus presents China as an affective state. The affection and warmth of the party have been emphasized by both factory management and media discourse as a key feature of Chinese socialism. Such socialist ethics putatively distinguish the management of unemployment in China from that of a capitalist country. However, the affective feature of <italic>renqing</italic> renders the party’s authoritarian rule more hegemonic. <italic>Renqing</italic> serves to warm the hearts of laid-off workers and make them more open to the ideological orientation of the state, in the case of <italic>song wennuan</italic>, orienting the poor to be grateful to the care of the party and deflecting their criticism for creating crippling effects of economic restructuring from the party-state. Indeed, as Mayfair Yang suggests, the exercise of power in contemporary China is often not through force or repression but through providing for the needs and welfare of the population, because needs are defined, promoted, or rejected, and suffused with normative and political content (1988: 412).</p>
<p>The practice of <italic>renqing</italic> in <italic>song wennuan</italic> invokes <italic>renqing</italic> in everyday life but is part of the affective and therapeutic mechanism targeting the most ‘visibly’ impoverished households by privatization. If the performance of <italic>renqing</italic> amongst ordinary people in everyday life tightens social bonds by constructing a sense that one does not experience the world alone and that one’s condition can be shared (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111435043">Kipnis, 1997</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1466138111435043">10</xref></sup> <italic>song wennuan</italic> enables the state to assert its continuing presence for the people even in the context of the market economy. By evoking <italic>renqing</italic> as a benevolent and sympathetic response to another’s hardship, <italic>song wennuan</italic> obscures the instrumentalization of ‘human feelings’ in establishing state control over those deemed likely to react to the negative impacts of privatization with social disruption, namely laid-off male workers. The way that <italic>renqing</italic> is distributed also affirms the ‘trueness’ of male workers’ loss when they are laid off and reinscribes the legitimacy of male entitlement to material <italic>and</italic> emotional support from the state. <italic>Song wennuan</italic> thus constructs and reinforces normative worker masculinity as an affective and therapeutic technique.</p>
<p>The <italic>renqing</italic> performed by the party staff or manifested through the gifts is not real personal feelings, but signifies a potential transition or passage of feelings from the party to the impoverished, affecting the impoverished in ways that identify with the party’s interests. Such passage of feelings resembles a transition from affect to emotion or the triggering of an actualization of affect into emotions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1466138111435043">11</xref></sup> The recent literature often defines emotion as a subjective feeling, which can be captured by narration; it defines affect as the power to act, intensity, or potentiality, decoupled from meaningful sequencing or narration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111435043">Grossberg, 1992</xref>: 81; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1466138111435043">Massumi, 2002</xref>: 28). The way that compassion and <italic>renqing</italic> work seems to be a kind of transduction – the transmission of a force of potential from one actualization to another that can be felt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1466138111435043">Massumi, 2002</xref>: 42). It is a process in which ideologies or social forces tap into personal feelings with the possible consequence that those ideologies or forces grip or interpellate subjects more effectively. As <italic>renqing</italic> delineates a possible passage of feeling in <italic>song wennuan</italic>, I see affect and emotion as two points on a sliding scale and their differences as a matter of degree. It resonates with Sianne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1466138111435043">Ngai’s (2005)</xref> discussion on the intertwined relationship between affect and emotion.<disp-quote>
<p>[A]ffects are less formed and structured than emotions, but not lacking form or structure altogether; less ‘sociolinguistically fixed,’ but by no means code-free or meaningless; less ‘organized in response to our interpretations of situations,’ but by no means entirely devoid of organization or diagnostic powers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1466138111435043">Ngai, 2005</xref>: 27)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The performance of <italic>renqing</italic> potentially allows the party to open the hearts of the poor and ‘move’ them to feel the party’s care and warmth. Although workers in Changping understood <italic>song wennuan</italic> as part of the political game – a disguised form of thought work or psychological counseling (see below) – many of my informants considered the practice of <italic>renqing</italic> or home visits as a good gesture from the party, who at least recognized workers’ pain and suffering caused by its policies. In this sense, the movement of <italic>renqing</italic> performs a (superficial) healing function that partially soaks up the anger and frustration of the poor about privatization.</p>
<p>The affective interactions between the party and impoverished workers in <italic>song wennuan</italic> are also shaped by changing dynamics of class and status in the post-Mao era. The working class as the ideological representative of Maoist socialism was a prestigious status group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111435043">Kraus, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1466138111435043">Walder, 1984</xref>), but it has been marginalized in the post-Mao era with the formation of a new class structure based on the market – entrepreneurs and the managerial class are now the privileged groups. According to Weber, status is social stratification based on prestige and social honor while class is economic stratification based on market relations (1978: 938). Given the clashes between market and social honor, and between class and status, status groups with their traditional outlook are often perceived as likely to hinder market development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1466138111435043">Weber, 1978</xref>: 937). It is this presumption that renders the working class as stagnant, unfit for the market economy, and (thus, ‘rightfully’) marginalized in the post-Mao era. Such class-status clashes also determine the interaction between management and workers across both affective and coercive measures – management treats workers not only in formal, political terms but also through compassion and <italic>renqing</italic>; workers react not merely in the form of rational association and organized protest but also in the form of affective actions and internal bargaining (more on this later). The following will show how <italic>renqing</italic> is played out in <italic>song wennuan</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1466138111435043"><title>Performing compassion and <italic>renqing</italic></title>
<p>Before the 2003 Chinese New Year, I joined a home visit team composed of the deputy party secretary Liu Ji, the chairman of the Trade Union, and the director of the Residents’ Committee to <italic>song wennuan</italic> to two families. Both families suffered unemployment and serious health problems: one family consisted of an elderly female retiree with diabetes and her youngest son, San’er, who had been disgruntled about an unresolved labor dispute with management; the other was a laid-off worker and his wife who had twice been diagnosed with breast cancer. These families were well known in the community for both their poverty and their confrontational behavior. As mentioned, although both home visits of <italic>song wennuan</italic> unfolded around the women – a mother and a wife – what motivated such home visits was the men at each household: one a disgruntled son and the other a confrontational husband.</p>
<p>On each occasion of <italic>song wennuan</italic>, the director of the Residents’ Committee carried with a tricycle a gift set including one bottle of cooking oil, one bag of flour, and one bag of rice, and helped identify the location of the household. Meanwhile, he familiarized other leaders with information about the household, not unlike briefing a politician before a public appearance. The more the leaders knew about the household, the more they could diagnose the situation and show compassion. Indeed, family issues are major topics in home visits. Similar to welfare programs in industrialized countries, in which family is a key site for the implementation of neoliberal welfare policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435043">Kingfisher, 2002</xref>) and a source of social support for the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111435043">Schneider, 2001</xref>), through <italic>song wennuan</italic> party organizations encourage families to take care of themselves but simultaneously remind them of the state as their ultimate provider. Indeed, <italic>song wennuan</italic> not only individualized but also familialized its recipients. And such individualization or familialization is premised on dependence on the panoptic control <italic>and</italic> the assistance of the state (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111435043">Clarke, 2004</xref> on familialization in Western welfare states). Also, bringing the performance of <italic>song wennuan</italic> into people’s homes, often being delivered just as they return home from work, ensures that the party’s compassion is made as visible, sensational, and affective as possible. <italic>Song wennuan</italic> seems to surround the poor and symbolize their outsiderness (or marginality), suggesting that, since this group lacks the ability to survive in the market, the party distributes commodities.</p>
<p>Both the deputy party secretary and the trade union chairman were preliminarily trained in job counseling or psychological counseling, part of the movement of ‘Psychology Enters Community’ (<italic>xinlixue jin shequ</italic>). The downscaling of the state sector and the restructuring of the urban workforce were mediated by setting up labor (talent) exchange centers which provided counseling, job training, and job information to all those who had become redundant and laid off from state enterprises, and had to change to a wide range of other occupations. In China, formal counseling training was only initiated in 2002, and there has been a shortage of counselors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435043">Higgins et al., 2008</xref>: 102; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1466138111435043">Chang et al., 2005</xref>). One of the solutions to such a shortage is to transform the party staff to counselors through encouraging former or current party staff to pursue training in counseling or social work. In this sense, with the gradual breakdown of the socialist work unit system (i.e. a state enterprise) as the institutional basis for ideological orientation because of privatization and marketization, the entrenched communist ‘thought work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111435043">Brady, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1466138111435043">Rofel, 1999</xref>) seems to take on a new form: psychological counseling, in the context of the recent ‘psycho-boom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138111435043">Kleinman, 2010</xref>). With its gradual commercialization, counseling in China is largely seen as a middle-class phenomenon, targeting relatively well-to-do men and women. However, due to mass unemployment and new urban poverty, counseling has also been introduced in state-led re-employment and poverty-relief programs, targeting the underprivileged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1466138111435043">12</xref></sup> Once integrated into government programs, counseling is perceived by many counselors in China as ‘psychological work’ (Ha Si, personal communication) – a combination of thought work with counseling. Such counseling could be anything but what is claimed as objective or scientific. Often imposed from above, it carries the authority of the party-state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1466138111435043">13</xref></sup> In this context, it is not difficult to understand the deployment of counseling techniques in <italic>song wennuan</italic> by the party staff in the factory.</p>
<p>According to the trade union leader, counseling constructs a self-reflective and self-cultivating subject; the self-image within one’s heart is the core of one’s self. To discover that self-image, one needs the ‘right’ mirror to reflect oneself. Self-reflexivity is believed to be the key to establish the ‘right’ self-image. Such self-reflexivity is therapeutic, in the sense that it is designed to make people feel better by bringing them relief to get through life more easily. Such self-reflexivity orients people to turn away from the socio-political structure and toward their inner selves for happiness. In one of the home visits to <italic>song wennuan</italic> in January 2003, the trade union leader implicitly used this mode of reflexivity to pacify a laid-off male worker who was made desperate by his lack of money.<disp-quote>
<p>When I started to work at the factory, we only made 41.10 <italic>yuan</italic>. We didn’t have much to eat but were content then. See what we eat now, but we’re not happy. Don’t compare yourself with other people, and compare yourself with yourself, with your own past – what you ate twenty years ago, where you lived twenty years ago. Look at what we eat and where we live now! Then you feel grateful.</p></disp-quote>In other words, the ‘correct’ mirror is one’s past rather than one’s current position relative to the rest of society. This re-formulation of what is relevant to know about oneself has a distinct therapeutic bent in that it prescribes a normative feeling about the present (gratefulness) and implies optimism about the future. It <italic>rehabilitates</italic> the subject by transitioning him from a place of despair into a terrain of hope and possibility. For workers, comparing themselves with the newly rich becomes a source of discontent. To restrain such critical, horizontal comparisons and minimize discontent, party secretaries encouraged workers to turn inward and engage a historical, personal comparison.</p>
<p>To achieve similar therapeutic and stabilizing purposes, the party staff also made historical comparison to demonstrate the continuity of the care of the party. After our home visit to San’er and his mother, Liu Ji said to the mother, who walked us to the door:<disp-quote>
<p>If you have any problem, just say it. Even though the factory is not good, the economic situation has been much better than before. In the past, you had something to eat; now, we won’t let you go hungry. We still have the rent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1466138111435043">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>This latter example, however, also reflects an acceptance by the party secretary that socialist ethics can coexist with so-called capitalist rationality. Indeed, while highlighting <italic>renqing</italic> as one of the advantages of socialism, Liu did not deny the role of market reform in improving quality of life (i.e. renting out the factory space for profit) and seemed to embrace the contradictory logic in China’s national narrative – nominally socialist but increasingly dominated by market ideology. To further pacify this particular woman, poor and elderly, the party secretary adopted a discourse of inclusion (i.e. the use of ‘we’), which is not only a way to manage the increasing social unrest among the poor, but also to propagandize ‘sharing in the wealth’.</p>
<p>Since years of communist propaganda have demonized capitalism as cold, rational, and inhuman, workers perceive <italic>renqing-</italic>based socialist ethics as being gradually replaced by cold capitalism in the process of privatization. Workers (and even some party members) often invoke the putative absence of <italic>renqing</italic> in capitalism to challenge state policies that prioritize profit-seeking market practices over social development. The deputy party secretary insisted that one purpose of <italic>song wennuan</italic> was to revive <italic>renqing</italic> toward workers. But since the mid-1990s, the privatization of SOEs has gradually diminished the role of the party in ideological orientation (and as mentioned, more in psychotherapy). Party secretaries were ambivalent about privatization because they deduced that in a joint venture driven by profit rather than ideological work or <italic>renqing</italic> practices, they would either be marginalized or lose their jobs. On the way back from our home visit to the woman with breast cancer, Liu Ji said:<disp-quote>
<p>Like her situation, if in a joint venture, who has time to care for her? Those capitalists only know how to make money. Who fusses about these ‘old womanish’ (<italic>popo mama</italic>) things? Are they concerned about <italic>renqing</italic>? But emotional investment is work too. Not everyone can do it well.</p></disp-quote>Party secretaries are believed to be expert at combining the practice of <italic>renqing</italic> with ideological orientation and balancing between affective practices and rational decisions. Liu, for instance, believed that she was good at performing <italic>renqing</italic> as she knew how to empathize and sympathize in her ideological work. When Liu Ji said to San’er’s mother, ‘If you have any difficulty, just say it’, her manner constructed a sense of <italic>enqing –</italic> the important favors that save or change the recipient’s life in economic, political or social terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1466138111435043">Yan, 1996</xref>). <italic>Enqing</italic> originally refers to children’s gratitude toward parents for giving them life and raising them, and then to Chairman Mao or the Chinese Communist Party for establishing socialism and saving the Chinese people from the three bondages of feudalism, imperialism, and warlords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1466138111435043">Yan, 1996</xref>). <italic>Enqing</italic> can never be completely repaid, but should be remembered forever. In choosing those most visibly impoverished by privatization as the recipients of the gift and warmth from the party, management attempted to intensify people’s feeling of gratitude towards the party.</p>
<p>The gifts sent in <italic>song wennuan</italic> invert the normative upward gift-giving but draw upon traditional understandings of gift-giving – receiving rather than giving is regarded as a symbol of prestige (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1466138111435043">Yan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1466138111435043">Yang, 1988</xref>). Based on the local ethics of <italic>renqing</italic>, a gift from higher up indicates that givers acknowledge that they were in the wrong and need to make amends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138111435043">Anagnost, 1997</xref>: 143). The gifting acts to restore any pre-existing ‘imbalance’ or ‘injustice’ between the giver and the receiver. In contrast to normative gift-giving practices that minimize the value of gifts, <italic>song wennuan</italic> highlights the value of the ‘gift’, promoting it to an ideological level as the ‘token regards of the party’. In this sense, the healing function of <italic>song wennuan</italic>, which emphasizes the care of the party, is complemented by the reassertion of material hierarchy already implicit in the notion of therapy itself: just as the therapist is in the position to offer expertise, the party is in the position to give. In both contexts in-kind reciprocity is impossible and the appropriate response for those positioned to receive is thus to surrender gratitude. However, gratitude involves not only feelings of appreciation, warmth, and a desire to return the favor, but also the structured position of indebtedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1466138111435043">Hochschild, 2003</xref>: 104–118). Due to the devastation created by privatization, such ‘gratitude’ is easily solicited from low-income families and poor pensioners who receive <italic>song wennuan</italic>.</p>
<p>However, the poor’s gratitude toward the party was fleeting and ended immediately after the discourse of <italic>kuqiong</italic> (crying poverty) was activated. The revival of the local discursive genre of crying poverty signals the party’s recognition that symbolic ‘sharing in the wealth’ is inadequate for managing instability. In this sense, the compassion and <italic>renqing</italic> performed by the party staff may appear to symbolically narrow the class gaps, but its purpose is not to establish interclass relationships. This is in line with Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111435043">Kipnis’s (1997: 1)</xref> descriptions of ‘interclass weeping’ at funerals. Such rituals may allow bad classes to honor, or show sympathy for, ‘red’ or revolutionary classes, but it discourages the formation of interclass relationships.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1466138111435043"><title>The politics of ‘crying poverty’</title>
<p>At the watch factory, ‘crying poverty’ is a discursive genre that workers use to exaggerate how hard their lives are in order to elicit sympathy from addressees and obtain resources that cannot be normally accessed. Recently, <italic>kuqiong</italic> has gained popularity, as the widening income gap polarizes this formerly ‘egalitarian’ working-class community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1466138111435043">15</xref></sup> Take as an example the retired woman who suffered from diabetes (San’er’s mother, the way she was addressed by locals). After giving her the gifts, the chairman of the trade union said, ‘This is a token regard of the party committee, and we wish you a happy Spring Festival.’ The woman bowed several times to show her gratitude. She then said with tears in her eyes, ‘Thank you. Thank you. We have no single penny left, nothing to eat at home.’ This is a typical <italic>kuqiong</italic>. By exaggerating her poverty and crying in gratitude, San’er’s mother highlights the value of the gift sent by the party, implicitly asking for more support.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the party’s warmth, the visiting party secretary usually finds topics to ‘chat’ about with the beneficiary. This informal, everyday genre of chat has the appearance of operating outside the structures of power, a symbolic expression of temporary class solidarity. But such conversations encompassing details of people’s everyday existence are the very sites where power is exercised in the post-Mao era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1466138111435043">Dai, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1466138111435043">Rofel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1466138111435043">Yang, 1988</xref>). The chat usually focuses on private and family issues to show the depth of the party’s care. The following dialogue between the party secretary Liu Ji and San’er’s mother exemplifies such a discursive strategy. When Liu asked about the mother’s illness, medication, and the filial piety of her children, San’er’s mother began to practice <italic>kuqiong</italic>, representing herself as the most unfortunate mother in the world – none of her three sons were filial: the two married sons did not come to see her, and the youngest son could not get married to end a mother’s anxiety.<disp-quote>
<p>San’er’s mother: They [her elder sons] did not give me money for several months. I didn’t see them. They should come to see me, if not giving me money. I said, ‘San’er, you go to see what happened.’</p>
<p>Liu Ji: <italic>They</italic> did not come; <italic>we</italic> come. I’ll talk to them. What’s wrong with them? [in an authoritative tone]. No matter how hard their lives are, they should come to see the old. I understand your feeling; last month when I was busy and didn’t go to see my mother she was lonely. Seeing me she even cried.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Liu Ji was notable for her skills in discourse management, and could ‘talk the dead into life’. Here Liu used two discourses to appease the woman’s complaints about her difficulties and terminate her <italic>kuqiong</italic> – one of empathy and the other one of authority. Using her own mother, Liu showed that the phenomenon that San’er’s mother complained of was a common one. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1466138111435043">Henderson (1987: 1582)</xref> identifies three basic meanings associated with empathy: feeling the emotion of another; understanding the experience of another; and feeling sympathy or compassion for another. The last can lead to action to alleviate the pain of the other. Empathy constructs intersubjectivity, which is not the same as being absorbed by the other but rather is about the relationship of self to other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111435043">Henderson, 1987</xref>: 1584). In this instance, Liu’s empathy not only demonstrates cultural or social solidarity (i.e. sharing common norms about treatment of elderly parents and common challenges in fulfilling those norms), but also symbolically and temporarily restores the eroded relationship between the party-state and workers.</p>
<p>Compassion, empathy, and sympathy can nevertheless be a form of othering when they become a way of reinforcing one’s own superiority and justifying interventions into others’ lives in welfare or humanitarian interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111435043">McElhinny, 2010</xref>). Such othering can be shown in Liu’s authoritative discourse condemning the two sons through a possible future interrogation for their moral liability in ignoring their filial responsibility. Although there is an apparent erosion of filial piety by market everydayness in this community, it is still a norm for married children to go back to their parents’ home regularly, and give parents pocket money. When Liu said, ‘They didn’t come but we come’, she affirmed that in contrast to the ‘neglectful’ sons, the party was fulfilling its responsibility (and perhaps even going beyond what is morally required) for taking care of the poor and the old. In this way, subjects are incited to ‘step up’ to their rightful duties to take care of themselves and their families. When condemning the two sons and promising a future interrogation, Liu transformed the site of responsibility for care from the government to the family. Indeed, breaches of filial responsibility are implied to warrant an interrogation by the party secretary. She thus legitimated and enforced the priority of filial piety and family responsibility over <italic>song wennuan</italic> for taking care of the old.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1466138111435043">16</xref></sup> Meanwhile, she implied that it was the government’s responsibility to make sure that families do so; if not, the government would be the ultimate provider for the old and the poor.</p>
<p>Further, the two discourses of empathy and authority construct an image of the party as a folklorist ‘parent official’ (<italic>fumu guan</italic>) acting in the interests of the masses. In this sense the party emulates the role of an enlightened parent (or therapeutic expert) guiding and supervising its child (or client) as s/he strives to gain skills to navigate the world on his/her own. Through the discursive apparatus of <italic>kuqiong</italic>, the party pacifies the newly marginalized and diffuses agitated workers’ potential threats to governance. Indeed, management practiced <italic>kuqiong</italic> as well. During the home visit, Liu Ji inquired about San’er mother’s health, which reminded the woman of her medical expenses. The discourse then shifted from <italic>kuqiong</italic> to bargaining. Liu immediately switched to a formal tone and invoked the party’s principle of ‘democratic centralism’ (<italic>minzhu jizhong zhi</italic>), a notorious bureaucratic delaying tactic: ‘We’ll discuss your case and make a collective decision at a meeting with all the party committee present.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1466138111435043">17</xref></sup> By appealing to this doctrine, Liu not only postponed what could have been an immediate decision, but also left the question open for further manipulation. She then, to justify the reduction of social provision for workers, practiced her own form of <italic>kuqiong</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>As you know, our watch movements don’t make money. All the income is from the rent [see note 10]. But for the sake of stability, the factory can’t close. I’m not <italic>kuqiong</italic>. This is the reality. If I present your request to management, it may irritate them.</p></disp-quote>Such strategic <italic>kuqiong</italic> is often performed by management to handle ‘unreasonable’ requests from retirees or laid-off workers, who face loss of status and access to a public welfare structure that has been reduced or privatized in the market economy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1466138111435043"><title>The politics of <italic>song wennuan</italic>: Determining the deserving citizens</title>
<p>As mentioned, the new urban poor, mainly consisting of laid-off workers, were prioritized in <italic>song wennuan</italic>. More specifically, those who were perceived by management as destabilizing – predominantly men – more easily accessed <italic>song wennuan</italic> than women and rural migrants. Impoverishment was apparently not the only criterion for being chosen to receive <italic>song wennuan</italic> – no matter how impoverished they were, women and rural migrants were unlikely to be prioritized in <italic>song wennuan</italic> as they were often perceived by management as less destabilizing. In this sense, what <italic>song wennuan</italic> seeks to ameliorate is the relationship between a patriarchal state and unemployed male workers.</p>
<p>Rural migrants constituted the majority of the factory workforce. They were hired to do the heaviest work but paid the lowest salary. They were excluded from the social security system, subsidized factory housing, or poverty-relief programs. To obtain any basic rights, migrants had to make desperate attempts to confront management. For example, a migrant worker who had worked for the factory for more than 10 years was assigned a separate room in which he could live with his wife. But in 2003, he was evicted from the room so that the factory could rent out that room for extra money. Unsuccessful in his negotiation with management, he broke into the boardroom where management was negotiating a potential joint venture with a foreign company. The migrant worker challenged management for their violation of basic human rights, saying ‘Peasant workers are human beings, too’. Perhaps he understood how sensitive the issue of human rights was in Western criticisms of China and thus invoked this framework in front of foreigners to criticize management’s eviction of him. He did succeed in securing his room, explaining his success this way: ‘a bare-footed person is not afraid of those who wear shoes’. As a subaltern, he could be fearless because he had nothing to lose – this is the power of the powerless.</p>
<p>Another group whose poverty is often downplayed by management is women. In general, women are more economically disadvantaged as they suffer unemployment to a greater extent than men, for example, through gendered layoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1466138111435043">Wang, 2003</xref>), and are more likely to have (sole) custody of dependent children. There is even a tendency of feminizing poverty in this community. However, laid-off men are often perceived as more destabilizing, and their families are implicitly prioritized over other types of families in <italic>song wennuan</italic>. By doing so, <italic>song wennuan</italic> creates or reinforces the tension among the urban poor and different types of families or households (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1466138111435043">Warnecke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1466138111435043">Wong, 1998</xref>). When I was conducting interviews at a residential yard of the watch factory, a woman mistook me for a journalist, asking me whether I knew of any free legal aid service for the poor. She then told me that her husband was killed in a traffic accident while running a small business. Because the police judged that her husband was conducting business at an ‘illegitimate’ location, she was only symbolically compensated by the other party to the accident. As an early retiree, she had to support her son on her own with a meager pension. When I asked her whether she received any assistance from the factory, she said:<disp-quote>
<p>He died in December (2002), just the time for <italic>song wennuan</italic>, but no one [from management] even stopped by to ask whether I was all right … Who cares for me? … If I’m that kind of person fussing around, they will definitely pay attention.</p></disp-quote>With the state’s emphasis on stability (implicitly stabilizing restive male workers), <italic>song wennuan</italic>, putatively a redistributive remedy presupposes an underlying recognition of satisfying men’s needs rather than women’s. Such gendered recognition and redistribution in <italic>song wennuan</italic> resonate with what Nancy Fraser observes about struggle against injustice in Western capitalist societies. She suggests that virtually every struggle against injustice implies demands for both redistribution and recognition; both socioeconomic and cultural injustice are rooted in processes and practices that systematically disadvantage some groups vis-a-vis others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1466138111435043">Fraser, 1995</xref>: 72).</p>
<p>A crucial element of politics is the struggle to define social reality and interpret people’s needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1466138111435043">Fraser, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1466138111435043">Yang, 1988</xref>). In my interview, Liu Ji indicated that she knew this woman and believed that she had received financial compensation from the accident; therefore she was not on the Residents’ Committee’s recommendation list for <italic>song wennuan</italic>. On another occasion, Liu implied that the factory had to distance itself from these kinds of women (single mothers) as there was a risk that they would develop dependence on the factory, revealing a gender subtext to dependence. By refusing to acknowledge this woman’s needs, and the vulnerability of others in similar situations, <italic>song wennuan</italic> implicitly constructs able-bodied, male subjects as most likely to disrupt governance, yet most able to achieve independence in a market economy and therefore most deserving of state support. Liu’s response belied the putative aim of <italic>song wennuan</italic> as sending the warmth of the party to the poor. Even though this woman had been financially compensated, losing her husband and struggling with single motherhood was devastating for her. Here, gender exposes the contradictions inherent in the politics of <italic>song wennuan</italic>. Her exclusion from party care is an example of <italic>song wennuan</italic> acting as a masculinized form of exchange that does not view women as having anything of value with which to reciprocate state care, as their subservience is presumed to be given. Poor women’s ‘dependent tendencies’ are thus effectively construed as a permanent defect that is immune to socioeconomic restructuring. Instead <italic>song wennuan</italic> prioritizes the use of gifts to quell resistance among restive male workers and sustain stability, which can be shown in the following.</p>
<p>A 2003 news report titled ‘Local Government Sent Chinese New Year Gifts: Jobs’ describes how the Yantai municipal government of Shandong Province gave jobs or low-rent housing to the unemployed through <italic>song wennuan</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>The Party Chief <italic>Yan Longzhu</italic> said, ‘Every year, we send those in financial difficulty one bag of flour and 200 <italic>yuan</italic> as New Year gifts, and then followed by a crowd of journalists. I feel so ashamed! Can we send those in need jobs rather than performing those rituals?’ Then the government echoed this call and started to prepare ‘new year gifts’ by <italic>re-adjusting</italic> [emphasis added] posts and arranging low-rent housing. On Jan. 3, 2003, a laid-off worker, Wang Zhifang, received a special New Year gift – a job as a cleaning staff at the Labor and Employment Office in Yantai. Another unemployed worker, Wang Shengyang, received a key to a low-rent apartment. A warm Spring Festival was waiting for his family. In total, 127 keys to low-rent housing, and more than 600 jobs were sent to unemployed workers in Yantai. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1466138111435043">Xu, 2003</xref>)</p></disp-quote>The editorial summed up by saying: ‘one bag of flour and 200 <italic>yuan</italic>’ can only temporarily solve workers’ problems, but jobs are ‘lasting warmth’ (<italic>heng wen</italic>) to relieve poverty.</p>
<p><italic>Song wennuan</italic>, when applied in this manner, resembles the welfare-to-work programs in the United States which provide assistance for the impoverished and move the unemployed into the paid labor force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111435043">Schneider, 2001</xref>: 705). But unlike the welfare-to-work program which attempts to normalize the poor into the mainstream society, <italic>song wennuan</italic> highlighted the jobs as novel gifts, a more ‘sincere’ form of the party’s lasting warmth, and a new way to promote ‘stability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111435043">Blecher, 2004</xref>). Although these jobs are often temporary, unstable, low-paid, and dead-end service jobs and created just for <italic>song wennuan</italic>, highlighting the compassion of the party serves as an affective and therapeutic mode of control. These jobs involved reciprocity – requiring the impoverished to return the mercy of the government – that is, non-resistance. The poor must acquiesce to the terms suggested by the ruling party. Such jobs are deemed to be patronizing and disempowering, creating a particular form of unfreedom.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1466138111435043"><title>Redistribution or restratification?</title>
<p>The current policies of the Chinese government increasingly reveal a dominant free-market ideology with unfettered privatization. The consequences are the loss of jobs by millions of workers in the state sector and their loss of access to public welfare, medical care, and previous pension rights. Presumably a program of redistribution, <italic>song wennuan</italic> claims to reduce poverty and inequality and ‘heal’ the victimized. By upholding the values of <italic>renqing</italic> and reviving the practice of <italic>kuqiong</italic> to recognize workers’ grievances, <italic>song wennuan</italic> highlights the party’s continued commitment to socialist ethics and its obligation to ameliorating urban poverty, thus (symbolically) extending the life of the socialist system.</p>
<p>However, as a state-orchestrated ritual, <italic>song wennuan</italic> is a key arena for identity and power struggles. By defining who participates, who benefits, and who is excluded, <italic>song wennuan</italic> creates new forms of inequality among the impoverished and intensifies social stratification. It is deeply plagued by its tokenistic policy of placating unemployed male workers to stabilize society instead of taking care of all those in need (i.e. women and rural migrants). Thus, the affective dimension of <italic>renqing</italic> is drawn upon as therapeutic resources and mobilized in the form of a gift to dampen the hostility of the poor and sustain stability. But the giving of gifts in <italic>song wennuan</italic> is a method of surveillance to bring home to the poor that their official well-wishers keep track of them and their mindset. Given therapy and its guise as an instrument of social control, Chinese politicians have increasingly found that the rhetoric of therapy not only increases their popularity but also provides them with a powerful legitimizing rubric to enhance their power and control over the population with little opposition.</p>
<p>By combining propaganda and alms-giving and weaving together narratives of suffering, <italic>renqing</italic> and a broader discourse of stability, <italic>song wennuan</italic> also serves a political purpose that supports the new market economy. It exemplifies China’s transitional politics where capitalism is cloaked in socialist forms. In this sense, the Chinese version of neoliberalism does not so much appeal to Western liberal doctrines than it tinkers with the pre-existing social, cultural, and discursive categories for market development. The resulting new class relations based on neoliberal market logic and the rising political and legal status of the newly rich will intensify an already sharpened social polarization to a degree unprecedented in China’s socialist history. No matter how rapidly China’s economy develops, it will be difficult to narrow income gaps and solve the problems caused by (relative) poverty.</p>
