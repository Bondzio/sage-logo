<abstract>
<p>There are growing arguments for linking strategic spatial planning to infrastructure development, particularly within developing countries. This article assesses potentials and challenges of these approaches, focusing particularly on an emerging approach in Johannesburg, South Africa. In Johannesburg, this approach provides more powerful sets of mechanisms than planning has had in the past but is demanding and confronts significant challenges. While linking strategic spatial planning and infrastructure has commonsense appeal, the potential for these approaches is likely to vary contextually, and their role and impact may be more partial than anticipated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After years in which planning was seen by international development agencies as an irrelevant diversion to the challenges facing cities in developing countries, it is being “reinvented” as a way of managing these burgeoning cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X12455665">Farmer et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X12455665">UN-Habitat 2009</xref>). Traditional forms of spatial planning, particularly master planning, have been roundly critiqued in these contexts, although they continue in practice. There is an exploration of alternatives, which are largely based on more flexible strategic spatial planning approaches, providing broad directional guidelines and policies, rather than detailed comprehensive plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0739456X12455665">Watson 2009</xref>). One important thrust attempts to link strategic spatial planning and infrastructure development on the argument that infrastructure plays key roles in shaping the spatial form of cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12455665">Mattingly 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12455665">Angel 2008</xref>) and is critical in terms of creating more inclusive cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739456X12455665">Brown and Lloyd-Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X12455665">UN-Habitat 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguments for seeing infrastructure development as core to city planning are not unique to developing countries, nor are they new. Early approaches to planning involved the design of infrastructure—particularly roads, parks, rail, and other public transport systems, as ways of shaping the spatial organization of growing cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X12455665">Neuman and Smith 2010</xref>). While planning–infrastructure links have often been lost in the evolution of planning in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X12455665">Neuman and Smith 2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739456X12455665">Neuman (2009)</xref> argues that planners should play a leadership role in directing and integrating infrastructural development in cities. In Australia, infrastructure planning has become core to metropolitan planning in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12455665">Dodson 2009</xref>). Infrastructure is also central to several of the dominant contemporary approaches to shaping urban form such as transit-oriented development and smart growth.</p>
<p>Thus there are growing arguments for bringing infrastructure to the center of planning. Questions, however, rise as to the potential of these approaches and the challenges facing them in developing countries. Although there are some well-known initiatives to ground spatial planning in these linkages, there are relatively few assessments of these experiences. The article reviews some noted case studies and also discusses in more detail a very recent initiative to link strategic spatial planning and infrastructure in Johannesburg, South Africa. While the article focuses on the usefulness of the infrastructure-spatial planning link for developing countries, experience in developed countries highlights what has been required to make this linkage possible in these contexts.</p>
<p>The article is based largely on existing literature, and in the South African context on reports and a selection of interviews with some twenty councillors, planners (within and outside the municipality), engineers, housing officials, developers, and academics who have been involved in initiatives to draw together spatial planning and infrastructure development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739456X12455665">1</xref></sup> The appendix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739456X12455665">Table A1</xref>) provides an indication of those interviewed and the focus of interviews.</p>
<p>The article begins with an overview of critiques of traditional forms of planning, contemporary trends and their drivers, and the search for new approaches. It locates initiatives to link spatial planning and infrastructure development in this context. The next section examines several international examples of these initiatives. This is followed by a discussion of contemporary South African approaches in Johannesburg. The article concludes by drawing together lessons from the various examples discussed.</p>

<title>Limits of Traditional Spatial Planning and Contemporary Spatial Trends</title>
<p>The idea of linking spatial planning and infrastructure development is not new. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X12455665">Neuman and Smith (2010)</xref> show that earlier forms of planning that attempted to shape the spatial form of cities drew heavily on links to infrastructure. Examples include the work of planners such as Olmstead, Moses, and those in the City Beautiful movement who used roads, parkways, open spaces, and the like to shape urban form. In later years, master planning, which became a predominant style of planning in many countries, including developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0739456X12455665">Watson 2009</xref>), showed the desired long-term spatial organization of the city, and the density and intensity of land uses that were expected to provide the basis for “predicting and providing” the extent and location of infrastructure.</p>
<p>Critics, however, have cast doubt on the ability of master planning to shape urban growth in developing countries in particular. Key critiques of master planning are that it did not understand the dynamics of economic and social change and thus produced plans that bore little relationship to actual spatial patterns. Master planning in developing countries often incorporated modernist approaches and an antiurban perspective, resulting in an underestimation of urban growth and a failure to accommodate informality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0739456X12455665">Watson 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X12455665">Devas 1993</xref>). In the postcolonial period, many cities planned for elites have rapidly outgrown their boundaries and the infrastructure provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739456X12455665">Gandy 2006</xref>). Further, in some countries, powerful infrastructural departments working in silos produced and rolled out plans for infrastructure that shaped the spatial form of cities in very different ways to those intended by the master plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739456X12455665">Sivaramakrishan and Green 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The poor links between spatial planning and infrastructure development were further exacerbated by trends toward the “unbundling” of land and infrastructural development since the late 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X12455665">Graham and Marvin 2001</xref>). The recession of the 1970s and a fiscal crisis of local governments, coupled with the rise of neoliberal policies and discourses emphasizing market-led approaches to development, underpinned the growth of privatization and corporatization of urban infrastructure development in both developed and developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X12455665">Graham and Marvin 2001</xref>). The resulting fragmented development has overlaid already unequal and partial provision of infrastructure in many cities in developing countries (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739456X12455665">Kooy and Bakker 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0739456X12455665">Zerah 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>These trends—coupled with rising social inequalities and economic restructuring—have been associated with increasing sociospatial polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739456X12455665">UN-Habitat 2001</xref>). The private sector has tended to focus on more profitable aspects of development, such as gated residential enclaves for the middle and upper classes, shopping centers, office parks, and mega-projects, some of which are in contradiction to spatial plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739456X12455665">Shatkin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12455665">Ansari 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0739456X12455665">Swyngedouw, Moulaert, and Rodriguez 2002</xref>). Other important spatial trends include the lateral spread of cities, through both formal and informal development on the periphery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X12455665">Angel, Sheppard, and Civco’s (2005)</xref> study has documented the huge physical expansion of cities in the 1980s and 1990s, and the trends toward declining densities in most cases. Periurban areas around many cities are growing beyond urban infrastructure, and concerns have been raised about the resulting fragmented patterns of development, and the difficulties of servicing these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X12455665">Singh and Steinberg 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12455665">Angel 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X12455665">Archer 1996</xref>). In some Asian cities, growth is occurring along transport corridors, creating a form of “regional urbanization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X12455665">UN-Habitat 2004</xref>). Similarly, the growth of small and medium towns along transport routes within commutable areas is occurring in Latin America and the Caribbean. In many cities, these patterns of growth are associated with long commuting distances to work and difficult access to employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X12455665">Irazabel et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditional forms of planning thus have not been very effective in managing growth in ways that move toward sustainability and inclusion. The weakness of planning, however, has exacerbated trends toward fragmented and unequal urban development. New approaches to planning, it is hoped, could help to enable more sustainable patterns of urbanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X12455665">UN-Habitat 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739456X12455665">Farmer et al. 2006</xref>). Linking strategic spatial planning and infrastructure development is one approach being promoted in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X12455665">UN-Habitat 2009</xref>). The following section considers some initiatives to do so.</p>

<title>Linking Spatial Planning and Infrastructure Development: International Examples</title>
<p>Arguments for linking strategic spatial planning and infrastructure development rest on the premise that infrastructure plays important roles in shaping the spatial organization of cities, their sustainability, and inclusiveness. These relationships are explored in detail in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739456X12455665">UN-Habitat (2009)</xref> report and by various authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X12455665">Thomson 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12455665">Cervero 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739456X12455665">Newman and Kenworthy 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739456X12455665">Boarnet and Haughwout 2000</xref>). The most important relationships center on transportation–land use links: on the roles road, highway, rail, and other public transport systems have in structuring patterns of accessibility and land value, and thus in attracting particular types of development and in shaping urban growth. The direct impacts of water, sewerage, and electricity are less obvious, but most of these require large bulk elements that provide the capacity for growth in certain areas. Stand-alone infrastructural systems (such as sewerage package plants) allow more diverse spatial outcomes because they are not tied to larger systems. Despite initial expectations, telecommunications have largely followed other forms of infrastructure and have not resulted in the “death of distance”—at least to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0739456X12455665">Odendaal and Duminy 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739456X12455665">Rutherford 2005</xref>), but they are enabling the growth of new high-tech areas and “smart corridors,” particularly in Asian cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0739456X12455665">Yuan 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X12455665">Ansari 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The significance of roads in shaping urban spatial form is the basis for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12455665">Angel’s (2008)</xref> argument that governments should lay out a grid of arterial roads (or at least purchase rights of way) to facilitate growth in ways that enable the provision of public transport and bulk infrastructural services over time in the face of an expected tripling of the spatial extent of cities in some regions. The importance of transport–land use links in shaping urban form is central to the emphasis on transit-oriented development and the use of bus rapid transit (BRT) systems within planning in many contexts.</p>
<p>Transport–land use links are also core to the new forms of infrastructure planning that are becoming a key part of strategic planning in several Australian cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X12455665">SGS Economics and Planning 2006</xref>). This kind of planning has emerged in response to both the problems associated with master planning and the limits of a market-driven approach. Early findings from the Australian approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X12455665">SGS 2006</xref>) suggest the importance of a well-supported long-term strategic plan based on credible analysis and understanding of trends and forces, and the involvement and support of a wide range of stakeholders. In contrast to old-fashioned master plans, strategic plans are reviewed regularly, and attention is paid to institutional aspects, financing and sequencing of development. While this kind of approach would seem desirable in developing countries, in many contexts, the level of data, stakeholder participation, and coordination required is likely to prove challenging. There are also dangers that infrastructure planning may displace strategic spatial planning and its broader social, political, and environmental concerns, which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739456X12455665">Dodson (2009)</xref> argues, tends to occur in Australia.</p>
<p>The importance of a consistent development strategy and exceptional planning capacity is emphasized by studies of successful land use–transit integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739456X12455665">Cervero 1998</xref>). Research on transit-oriented development within the North American context, where it is often linked to the broader “smart growth” movement, similarly suggests that it requires high levels of coordination and integration, as well as consistent programs and policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739456X12455665">Godschalk 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X12455665">Belzer and Autler 2002</xref>). These conditions may be difficult to achieve in developing countries, where capacity and resource constraints are prevalent.</p>
<p>Shaping urban growth is inevitably a very long term process, and paths toward closer land use–transit links are not necessarily straightforward, even in countries such as the Netherlands, where there is a strong commitment to planning. For example, in Amsterdam, a combination of evolving policies to link land use and transportation from the 1960s have helped to create a city highly accessible to those without motor cars. However, policies have not remained the same over time. They have shifted from “concentrated decentralization” in the 1960s, which enabled the development of a polycentric city well linked by different modes of transport, to a compact city policy in the 1980s, which promoted public and nonmotorized transport and encouraged mixed use development. Policies have at times been contested and have been reshaped by these processes, and outcomes are sometimes different from those intended. For instance, people do not live and work locally as expected, but commute across the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X12455665">Bertolini 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739456X12455665">Le Clercq and Bertolini 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There are relatively few well-documented cases of spatial planning–infrastructure links in developing countries. Curitiba’s successful planning around land use–transport links through a BRT system is perhaps the most celebrated. In this case, it has depended on decades of consistent implementation made possible by a stable local political regime. However, this is relatively unusual internationally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0739456X12455665">Steinberg (2005)</xref> notes that strategic spatial plans often do not outlast the mayors under which they were developed in Latin American cities. Yet even in the case of Curitiba, “success” was more partial when examined within the context of the broader metropolitan region, where the poor live on the periphery with limited services and amenities and inadequate access to public transport. Even within the city, rising property prices along the transport axes have pushed the poor out of these well-serviced areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739456X12455665">Irazabel et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguments by international agencies in favor of putting infrastructure development at the core of alternatives to master planning in developing countries have been made for some time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X12455665">Devas 1993</xref>). One of the most explicit initiatives to do so developed from an action planning base for Asian countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X12455665">Singh and Steinberg 1996</xref>). This approach proposed the development of strategic structure plans to guide urban infrastructure development in combination with multisectoral investment planning. In contrast to a project-by-project infrastructural investment program, multisectoral investment planning involves an integrated multisector and multiyear program of investment, based on a set of prioritized interventions derived through strategic planning and community consultation. It moves from planning to implementation through identifying “bankable project packages” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X12455665">Singh and Steinberg 1996</xref>, 19) and designing how they would be rolled out. Considerable attention was also paid to institutional and capacity issues, and to community consultation, in contrast to master planning. A separate Physical and Environmental Development Plan provided an analysis of key spatial and environmental profiles, problems, and trends and developed scenarios, a strategy, and a broad spatial framework for urban development. A short five-year action plan, linking to the multisectoral investment plan, was couched within the longer term spatial framework. The Physical and Environmental Development Plan provided a phased program for expansion of the city, to which infrastructure planning was linked. Spatial planning in this context was thus intended to assist in the management of urban growth, particularly by helping to coordinate the supply of infrastructure and facilities in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X12455665">Singh and Steinberg 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This approach was supported by several international agencies, including the UN-Habitat and the German agency Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit and was applied in Indonesia, Nepal, and India in the 1990s. In Indonesia and Nepal, where evaluations were conducted in the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739456X12455665">Mattingly and Winarso 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12455665">Mattingly 2001</xref>), the impact of this type of planning was disappointing. In Nepal, investment plans were not updated annually as required. In Indonesia, these plans were not integrated into municipal planning as they were seen as a central government responsibility. But central government agencies did not participate sufficiently in planning, nor follow the recommendations of the plan. Planned projects were impeded by problems with land acquisition. Decisions on priorities were made on a political basis, and in favor of elites, despite the participatory process and the plan. In practice, most expenditure was toward addressing backlogs rather than anticipating future development, negating the importance of the plan.</p>
<p>Although this approach has been disappointing in practice, proponents argue that the methodology is robust and provides a useful alternative to master planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12455665">Mattingly 2001</xref>). Instead of seeing the plan as something that can be rolled out and as a technocratic alternative to political decision making, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739456X12455665">Mattingly (2001)</xref> argues that it provides information and approaches that can be brought into decision making at various stages of the development process.</p>
<p>Thus, there have been several initiatives to link spatial planning and infrastructure development, but the cases discussed above suggest that this is not a simple process of laying out future spatial organization and its associated infrastructure. Early initiatives to link spatial planning and infrastructure development in Johannesburg, South Africa, provide further evidence of both the appeal of this kind of linkage and also of the challenges that it faces.</p>

<title>Linking Strategic Spatial Planning and Infrastructure Development: The Case of Johannesburg, South Africa</title>
<p>Johannesburg is South Africa’s largest metropolitan municipality<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0739456X12455665">2</xref></sup>—with around 3.9 million people and a US$4.2 billion annual budget<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0739456X12455665">3</xref></sup>—and its most important and rapidly growing economic center, accounting for 13.7 percent of national output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739456X12455665">Quantec 2009</xref>). It is one of the three metropolitan municipalities within the Gauteng Province, a city region with some 10.5 million people that produces 35.1 percent of national output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739456X12455665">Quantec 2009</xref>). It is the dominant destination for both international and South African migrants, with annual population growth rates of 3.2 percent between 2001 and 2007<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0739456X12455665">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739456X12455665">Statistics South Africa 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Johannesburg is also a highly unequal city, with a Gini coefficient of 0.78 in 2001<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0739456X12455665">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X12455665">SACN 2006</xref>), some 25 percent of people living in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X12455665">Presidency 2006</xref>), and an unemployment rate of 24.5 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739456X12455665">Quantec 2009</xref>). These inequalities also have a strong racial dimension and are manifest spatially. Under policies of segregation and later apartheid (from 1948 to 1994), Johannesburg became divided and fragmented along racial lines. Separate townships for African,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0739456X12455665">6</xref></sup> colored, and Asian people were created in the south of the city, while residential areas for whites were developed in the north. Black people were removed from central and northern residential areas, but a few areas such as Alexandra managed to resist removals. These racial divisions are still evident, and most postapartheid low-income housing projects and the majority of the city’s 180 informal settlements<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0739456X12455665">7</xref></sup> are located in the south. Nevertheless, the growing upper/middle class suburbs in the north are increasingly mixed racially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739456X12455665">Kracker Selzer and Heller 2010</xref>), and some informal settlements and mixed-income public/private housing projects, such as Cosmo City, have developed in the north. In addition, the central business district and some of the higher-density inner-city suburbs have become occupied by low-income, largely black people, sometimes at very high densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739456X12455665">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Planning Regimes and Development Patterns in the 1990s</title>
<p>Under apartheid, the local government was fragmented and divided on racial grounds. These divisions, coupled with apartheid policies to limit economic activity in African townships and to prevent African land ownership, resulted in poor revenue sources and services in African townships. Policies in the late apartheid era to promote economic development and a land-owning African middle class did little to change these conditions. The subsequent struggle for a “one city”—a key element of the broader antiapartheid movement—was crucial in redefining the local government, and several of its goals in the postapartheid era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X12455665">Beall, Crankshaw, and Parnell 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber, a negotiating forum established in the transitional period in the early 1990s, which drew together stakeholders from political parties, civic organizations, business, unions, and other interest groups, argued for restructuring the city toward greater racial, social, and land-use integration, higher densities, better public transport, and improved levels of services and conditions in former black townships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X12455665">Harrison, Todes, and Watson 2008</xref>). These ideas were carried through into national planning policies such as the 1995 Development Facilitation Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0739456X12455665">Todes 2006</xref>). The local government was reorganized in two rounds postapartheid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739456X12455665">Table A2</xref>): a first round (1995-2000) created a two-tier structure comprising four local municipalities and a metropolitan authority, cross-cutting racial areas. In 2000, these authorities were consolidated into a single metropolitan municipality covering 1644 km<sup>2</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0739456X12455665">8</xref></sup> The broad ideas of the Metropolitan Chamber were also carried through into the policies of postapartheid local government in Johannesburg. While a consistent emphasis on the redistribution of public sector investment into former townships, particularly in Soweto, has significantly improved service delivery in these areas,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0739456X12455665">9</xref></sup> ideas around urban restructuring have been far more difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, major private-led property development has occurred in the north of the city. New business nodes have emerged in Rosebank, Sandton, and Midrand as offices decentralized from what was perceived as a declining CBD, but some large corporate offices remained there. Medium density upper- and middle-income residential developments, often taking the form of gated “townhouse” complexes, have grown rapidly in the north. These are at higher density than the old suburban areas, and are contributing to densities in Johannesburg rising from 1918 persons/km<sup>2</sup> in 2001 to 2362.2 persons/km<sup>2</sup> in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X12455665">GCRO 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, they are oriented to the car, and are adding to rising congestion in the city. This growth continued rapidly in the late 1990s despite the acceptance in policy documents of ideas of urban compaction, greater land-use and social integration, and a shift toward public transport. In the first round of postapartheid municipalities, councillors were new and inexperienced (respondent 10), and there were no well-developed policies through which to respond to planning applications (respondents 3 and 10). As noted by Councillor Mathang, “Developments there really galloped and they galloped in the midst of this confusion. . . . They galloped . . . when there was no single policy that guided how the City should evolve.”</p>

<title>The Planning Regime and Initiatives in a Unitary Municipality from 2000</title>
<p>The development of a systematic and explicit set of policies only began to come about with the creation of a unitary local government for Johannesburg, and it has taken some years for these to emerge. Since 2000, all of South Africa’s 284 municipalities have been required to produce an Integrated Development Plan, which spells out the municipality’s vision, strategic directions, and its programs and policies. This is reviewed annually, and in Johannesburg, this process involves public consultation at a city level, and within each administrative subregion (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739456X12455665">Table A2</xref>). In terms of strategic direction, the most important metropolis-wide policy is the Growth and Development Strategy. The 2006 policy emphasizes “balanced and shared growth,” “settlement restructuring,” “proactive absorption of the poor,” and “environmental and social justice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X12455665">COJ 2006</xref>, 14). This policy moved away from a much stronger focus on growth, privatization, and cost recovery that had emerged in the context of a fiscal crisis in the late 1990s (respondents 8 and 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739456X12455665">Robinson 2008</xref>) and had resulted in the creation of semiautonomous municipal-owned enterprises for services such as water, power, and roads, which also undermined integrated planning. At the end of 2011, a new Growth and Development Strategy, building on the 2006 ideas, but placing greater emphasis on the concept of resilience, was accepted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739456X12455665">Table A2</xref>). At the time of writing, its implications for planning remained to be fully developed (respondent 2).</p>
<p>Spatial planning in Johannesburg has moved away from master planning toward strategic spatial planning, emphasizing broad directional guidelines and policies and the formulation of an indicative spatial development framework (SDF), although an inherited town planning scheme based on land-use zoning remains. The SDF is cascaded into seven Regional SDFs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739456X12455665">Table A2</xref>), which provide more specific guidance to respond to applications for land-use change. Both the SDF and Regional SDFs are subject to public consultation processes. Successive SDFs since 2003 attempt to promote “sustainable urban environments,” “urban efficiency,” and “accessibility to the city opportunities.” The SDF is centered on densification around public transport–focused corridors and nodes; containing urban sprawl through the use of an urban edge; sustainable environmental management; and creating sustainable housing environments with a range of housing types, facilities, and economic opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X12455665">COJ 2003</xref>). Read together with the 2006 Growth and Development Strategy, there is an emphasis also on promoting greater spatial equity both through improving conditions in townships formerly reserved for black people and enabling the poor to access well-located housing closer to areas of employment.</p>
<p>Postapartheid Johannesburg has always been an African National Congress stronghold, but the grouping that came to power at the local level also had a strong commitment to clean government in which councillors focus on policy and exercise only an oversight function in relation to detailed implementation (respondents 7 and 12). As explained by the current mayor, “We made a conscious governance decision, through the leadership of the mayor, to define roles and responsibilities in the organisation, with the understanding that council and political and public representatives are . . . there to make the policy decisions. . . . But you cannot be executing because then it undermines the oversight function. It is not a popular argument, with councillors across the board” (respondent 12). This position however has given greater power to planning officials (respondent 7), and has enabled the development over time of a more systematic set of policies that have strengthened the SDF. Yet this was not guaranteed. Political contestation within the African National Congress almost threatened to disrupt the hold of this grouping in 2010, and had it done so, might have ushered in a political grouping with less sympathy for policy-led decision making (respondents 7 and 8).</p>

<title>Linking Spatial Planning and Infrastructure: The Growth Management Strategy</title>
<p>By 2008, it was apparent that the spatial framework was insufficient in shaping growth. Chronic underinvestment in infrastructure for many years coupled with rapid incremental growth resulted in an infrastructural crisis in parts of the city (respondents 1 and 6). Some areas experiencing severe capacity limitations include places prioritized by the spatial development framework, while others are in areas where growth has occurred contrary to planning. In response, a Growth Management Strategy (GMS) was put in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12455665">COJ 2008</xref>) that built on the spatial framework.</p>
<p>The GMS defined areas in terms of their levels of priority for infrastructural investment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0739456X12455665">Figure 2</xref>). Consistent with the orientation of the SDF, areas for immediate priority investment were in “public transport management areas” (1 km around existing and proposed major public transport routes), where intensified development would be supported, and marginalized areas in the south, where efforts would be made to promote economic development. A series of incentives were to be offered to support desired patterns of development in these places. “Inclusionary” housing for lower- and middle-income groups within private property developments close to public transport routes would receive particular support. Areas of “consolidation” and “expansion” were seen as a medium-term priority, while no growth would be allowed prior to 2020 in low-priority areas. Areas of “consolidation” would only be allowed to develop if infrastructural capacity were available or if developers made up the deficits, while developers were expected to provide infrastructural services in selected areas of “expansion” (largely private-led developments close to the urban edge) as well as to make provision for inclusionary housing in their developments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739456X12455665">COJ 2008</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The development of the GMS involved considerable engagement with stakeholders within and outside of the municipality. There is a regular forum five or six times a year, as well as separate sessions on specific policy issues with the SA Property Owners Association<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0739456X12455665">10</xref></sup> and the South African Association for Consulting Professional Planners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0739456X12455665">11</xref></sup> The GMS was workshopped in this context, and was largely accepted, albeit somewhat reluctantly, as representatives and members of these organizations did not necessarily agree that it was the right approach (respondents 1, 7, 14, and 15). The policy was also workshopped with line departments and the municipal-owned enterprises. Although there is mayoral approval, it has required extensive work with individual departments to gain practical acceptance of the idea and its implementation (respondent 2). A common database showing service capacities, needs, and problem areas was developed on GIS, drawing on engagement with departments and spatial planning teams working in the seven subregions. By replacing the databases held by individual departments, it has enabled the planning department to identify where real needs exist and to adopt a more strategic approach (respondent 7).</p>
<p>The policy has been tied to the budget, and all requests for capital funding are assessed through the Capital Investment Management System, a GIS-based system linked to the GMS, held by the planning department. The Capital Investment Management System includes a prioritization model, which scores projects, based particularly on their consistency with the GMS. Although the Capital Investment Management System was put in place in 2003 before the GMS, its introduction has sharpened the spatial focus of this instrument, and of the budget (respondent 7). The budget process occurs through a series of “budget lekgotlas” (meetings of political heads of departments) and a budget steering committee (a panel chaired by the political head of the finance department, but including the planning department). Departments initially motivate for funds consistent with policies, and in later phases, project proposals are closely interrogated against municipal priorities and a draft budget is formulated for public comment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12455665">Magni 2011</xref>; respondent 7). Although the final budgets and the projects supported are intensely negotiated in a highly political process between departments, councillors, and the budget panel (respondent 7), the Capital Investment Management System with its link to the GMS is a key informant in the budget process.</p>
<p>A small team within the strategic planning section holds four or five meetings a year with every department—about seventeen entities—initially to develop accurate data mapping conditions in the sector, and later to engage on priorities. Departmental priorities are assessed against those expressed in the GMS, and this forms the basis for a “tough discussion” (respondent 2) on whether particular projects are really needed. Planners demand evidence, and can report on their findings to the budget steering committee, giving them some leverage. This engagement has enabled a good understanding of the concerns and issues of the various departments, with 70 to 80 percent agreement between planners and other departments on key priorities. Planners involved in this process argue that they are “the only unit that speaks to everyone” (respondent 2), and that a more integrated approach is emerging in this way (respondents 2 and 4). In the latest round of budgeting, the process has been pushed further as departments have been clustered in terms of the programs of the new 2011 Growth and Development Strategy, and are asked how they contribute to program emphases. The Capital Investment Management System allows planners to assess this contribution and to put pressure on departments to shift their focus (respondent 2). Thus the Capital Investment Management System, in combination with the GMS, has shifted power toward planners, although decisions are ultimately made by politicians on the basis of the funding assessment (respondent 7).</p>
<p>While the use of a GIS-based decision support system has been helpful, the head of the strategic planning section argued that “discussion is the important part” (respondent 2). This approach however is demanding in terms of staff capacity. The Capital Investment Management System is run by three staff members, who are supported by two additional senior staff in negotiations with large, powerful departments who “need a high level of interaction” (respondent 2). As a consequence of recession and overspending in previous years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12455665">Magni 2011</xref>), there have been budget cuts, which have affected staffing. The Capital Investment Management System has only 50 percent of the staff it needs. “This is the bare minimum to keep the process running. . . . It takes two or three years to get people up to speed. . . . If I lose any of them, if anyone is sick at this time of the year, its a crisis” (respondent 2).</p>
<p>A monitoring system has been put in place within the planning department to report on the extent to which planning and building applications, property market trends, and capital expenditure are consistent with the GMS, and an annual assessment has been produced by officials since July 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12455665">COJ 2009</xref>). This research showed that the city of Johannesburg’s expenditure on capital projects for the 2008-2009 year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0739456X12455665">Figure 2</xref>) was largely consistent with the GMS, with some 60 to 65 percent of investments in the public transport management areas around the designated public transport routes and in the marginalized areas in the South. Subsequent reports have shown a similar order of consistency with the plans, with the remainder of capital expenditure largely being on refurbishment of major infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739456X12455665">COJ 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This linkage of public expenditure to the GMS and the underlying spatial framework is a powerful way of redirecting development. Still, there are some tensions around the approach, with concerns on the part of infrastructural departments that it reduces flexibility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739456X12455665">Magni (2011)</xref> shows that a few departments (such as parks) have moved parts of their agreed capital expenditure away from projects located in strategic areas in terms of the GMS. This is made possible since changes to the budget are allowed halfway through the financial year by the Budget Office, which is less concerned about strategic spatial planning. There are also challenges to the position of the planning department, and over the longer term, the central role of spatial planning in shaping the location of infrastructural investment may not be maintained: “Every time there is restructuring, we are challenged—why is planning doing this? One day I will lose that fight” (respondent 2).</p>
<p>The GMS links to two new public transport systems. The first is the Gautrain, a light rail system aimed at higher-income groups running between the airport and a few stations in Johannesburg and neighboring Tshwane (Pretoria), which was initiated by the provincial government in 2002. The second is the BRT, which is intended to develop a more extensive and inclusive system over the long term with 122 km of dedicated busways, enabling 85 percent of the city’s population access within 500 m to one of 500 stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739456X12455665">Nemai Consulting 2008</xref>). Dense mixed-use environments around stations, along the lines suggested by transit-oriented development advocates, are anticipated. The Gautrain has recently been completed, and a first phase of the BRT has been built from the city center to Soweto in the south (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739456X12455665">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0739456X12455665">
<title>The Bus Rapid Transit System</title>
<p>The BRT system is key to the GMS, and to the idea of linking spatial planning to infrastructure. The municipality has moved ahead with this idea since 2006, but the process has been slowed by contestation by property owners and ratepayer associations in some of the upmarket areas on one hand and by some taxi associations on the other. In the South African context, minibus taxis carrying around sixteen to twenty passengers have emerged as a predominant form of transit for those without private vehicles, used by 72 percent of Johannesburg’s commuters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739456X12455665">GCRO 2010</xref>). Taxis are well adapted to sprawling South African cities, but there have long been concerns about their safety and efficiency. The industry has emerged as a powerful set of players, who have been resistant to change. The case of Bogota, where similar conditions prevail and where taxis were persuaded to become part of the BRT system, was an important influence on the development of Johannesburg’s BRT system (respondent 11).</p>
<p>Planning for the BRT has included intensive negotiations with various parts of the taxi industry. This has been a long, often conflictual, process. The municipality has attempted to incorporate taxi operators as partners in running the BRT buses and as shareholders in the company. Feasibility studies showed that involvement in the BRT in these ways would replace jobs and incomes lost through the displacement of taxis on key routes. While some taxi associations came on board early on, others were resistant, claiming that the BRT would undermine their livelihoods. Resistance to the BRT led to delays in construction. But propelled by the need to have in place an operational system to support the 2009 Soccer Confederation Cup games, and especially the FIFA World Cup in June 2010, the municipality moved ahead with its plans. Some BRT buses experienced violent attacks, and intervention was required by South Africa’s president Zuma to move negotiations forward. Agreement on the first phase (beyond the limited development for the World Cup) was finally reached in late 2010, but other phases have still to be negotiated (respondent 11).</p>
<p>The BRT system has also confronted resistance by some ratepayer and environmental organizations in wealthy suburbs who have objected to it on the grounds that the routes chosen will require the destruction of trees or will negatively affect the character of the area. These objections were taken through the environmental impact assessment process (respondent 11) and have resulted in an agreement to develop an alternative route between the city center and Sandton. Hence, the process of setting in place the BRT is a long and contested one. As Rehana Moosajee, the councillor responsible for transport, put it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Rea Vaya’s [BRT] middle name has been complex. Everything from you know, the bus procurement and the export credit agency loan which is still an issue through to the taxi industry negotiations through to the building of infrastructure. We have these Steering Committee Meetings where different parts of the Project report back and everyone says, you know I thought my problems were bad till I listened to you and everyone feels the same way, so you know the Project has really, I think been incredibly complex. Very challenging for those who have had to deliver. (respondent 11)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While public expenditure has largely followed the GMS, private investment has been more mixed. The municipality’s own assessment of applications by the private sector since 2008 shows that offices (the main form of nonresidential development) are concentrating in public transport management areas, but mainly in the north and west. Residential developments, which are also more focused on northern areas, are more concentrated in consolidation areas, and to a lesser extent in public transport management areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12455665">COJ 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739456X12455665">2010</xref>). The Gautrain stations of Rosebank and Sandton are attracting major office and higher-density residential development, but these developments include a significant supply of parking space, and thus remain oriented to the motor car (respondent 11). So far, the BRT has been less attractive to developers, but some properties are being marketed in terms of their access to the BRT (respondent 20). Development is occurring around some BRT stations in Soweto in the south, but at relatively low densities, preserving old patterns of detached housing (respondent 1). Furthermore, some sectors of the property industry oriented to the lower-middle income residential market are focusing on housing close to public transport routes in the northern areas (respondent 16). Thus there is some responsiveness by the private property industry to the new public transport systems, although not necessarily in the ways anticipated by planners, and largely in the northern areas of the city.</p>
<p>The municipality is having some success in limiting development on the urban edge and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739456X12455665">COJ 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739456X12455665">2010</xref>). Slow processing of environmental impact assessments is reportedly a contributor, and the reality of infrastructure constraints is recognized by the property industry (respondents 9 and 15). Nevertheless, Johannesburg is part of a larger city region where there are sometimes countervailing trends and agendas. Municipalities to the west and south of Johannesburg have encouraged formal private property developments—usually residential—resulting in increased commuter flows into Johannesburg (respondent 1). A major private mixed-use development project cross-cutting three municipalities around the northwest of Johannesburg was allowed in 2006 after some pressure from the provincial government and on the argument that the area needs to be seen in a city-region context. This development in an “expansion area” is expected to provide its own infrastructure, but there are concerns that Johannesburg will eventually be pressured to supply water, undermining the current fragile balance (respondent 6). Some smaller projects have also been allowed after legal appeals against municipal decisions (respondent 1).</p>
<p>Sociospatial polarization has also been difficult to address. It is apparent that property developers have largely focused on the north. The inclusionary housing policy is intended to bring more affordable housing into these areas, but the policy has hardly been implemented, inter alia, due to resistance by neighbors and private developers, who argue that South Africa’s levels of income inequality make it unworkable. The absence of national policy—which has stalled for similar reasons—has also been a constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739456X12455665">Klug, Rubin, and Todes, forthcoming</xref>). The housing department’s own projects are trying to provide a range of housing types (including housing containing income mixes such as Cosmo City), and it is attempting to work with the locations supported by the GMS (respondents 4 and 5), but many of the existing projects—particularly those mounted by the provincial government—are not consistent with the plan.</p>
<p>Initiatives are thus in place to constitute a more coherent and integrated approach to spatial planning linked to infrastructure development in Johannesburg, and to link from spatial frameworks to decisions on land-use change and budgets. These links provide a far more powerful set of mechanisms than planning has had in the past in postapartheid South Africa. They are enabling improved coordination within the municipality around the spatial framework and the GMS, and there is greater understanding and acceptance of this approach among developers. However, it has depended on significant political support and a relatively stable policy environment and may be vulnerable to shifts. The approach adopted has required a combination of technical tools together with extensive negotiation with stakeholders within and outside the municipality. This has been demanding on the small team dedicated to this work. There is a frustration with planning’s inability to direct development to marginalized areas (respondent 7), which may undermine planning’s key position within the municipality. The introduction of the BRT, as a key element of the infrastructure–planning link, has been highly contested, requiring considerable conflict resolution, but also resulting in changing plans. Plans continue to evolve in this context, and in relation to shifting political and policy imperatives. Most recently, emphasis has shifted to promoting development in the south, and the priority areas of GMS are being revised to focus on a limited number of transit-oriented nodes within the public transport management areas and on poverty areas within marginalized areas (respondent 2).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has explored several contemporary initiatives to link spatial planning and infrastructure development, which some see as key to more effective planning practice, particularly in developing countries. While one approach focuses on using planning to roll out roads to shape the spatial form of urban growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X12455665">Angel 2008</xref>), an assessment of initiatives to put infrastructure planning at the center of strategic spatial planning to guide these developments suggests that these planning processes are far more demanding and complex, and that outcomes may be less determinate than expected.</p>
<p>Planning of this sort requires an understanding of development trends and directions, and the forces shaping urban spatial organization. Linking spatial planning, infrastructure, and budgets is critical, as the Johannesburg case shows. The importance of good data, and the usefulness of tools such as GIS-based decision-support systems, is also evident from the Johannesburg case study. Linking spatial planning and infrastructure however requires more than deepening the technocratic basis of planning: it requires considerable engagement with stakeholders within and outside of governing institutions and an understanding of the politics associated with these processes. Building a common spatial vision and storyline about development is important, although both the discourses and their practical implications are likely to be contested, as the Johannesburg example shows. Planning of this sort is closer to the discursive, communicative, and political forms of planning proposed by contemporary planning theorists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739456X12455665">Healey 2007</xref>), and may involve dealing with “deep” social divisions and conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0739456X12455665">Watson 2006</xref>), as has been the case in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>This kind of planning is demanding in terms of capacity and political commitment. In Johannesburg, planners could manage these demands, but only just. And Johannesburg is far better resourced than many other municipalities in developing countries, even in South Africa. There are questions as to whether these processes can be supported in other contexts where capacities are more limited. Johannesburg planners have also had considerable political support. But this may be difficult to achieve, as shown in the Asian examples, where political decision making was dominant, and contrary to the plan, or may not be sustained over the long term, as the Latin American experience suggests. However, even in Amsterdam, where planning is well established, policy has shifted over time and outcomes are different from those expected. The Johannesburg case also shows the way policy and implementation are reshaped by a variety of forces, and the limits of policy in directing private sector investment, even where planning and infrastructure development are linked. Thus, while linking strategic spatial planning and infrastructure has commonsense appeal and may give planners useful levers to influence urban spatial change in growing cities in developing countries, the potential for these approaches is likely to vary contextually, and both their role and impact may be more partial than anticipated.</p>

<p>Key respondents were selected on the basis of their knowledge and experience of specific issues of importance for the study, except for property developers where a small number of developers in the growing north were interviewed to get a sense of dynamics in the area, and perspectives within the industry.

<p>In South Africa after 1994, the local government outside of metropolitan areas has been consolidated into a two-tier system of district and local municipalities. In metropolitan areas, a two-tier system of local and metropolitan municipalities was initially established in 1996, but these were further consolidated into unitary metropolitan municipalities from 2000. While administrative substructures might exist within unitary metropolitan municipalities, there is only one set of councillors, and political decision making occurs at the metropolitan level.</p></fn>

<p>The use of racial categories in this article reflects a predominant reality in South Africa. The term “African” refers to the indigenous black African population, while “colored” refers to people of mixed race, and “Asian” indicates people whose ancestors came from Asia. “Black” refers inclusively to all these groups. “Whites” are people of European descent. Currently some 75.5 percent of Johannesburg’s population is African, 14.5 percent are white, while 5.6 percent are colored and 4.4 percent are Asian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739456X12455665">COJ 2011a</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>For instance, access to piped water within the house has increased from 49.6 percent of households in 2001 to 70.8 percent in 2007 (with 98.3 percent having some access to piped water). Over the same period, access to electricity has increased from 84.9 to 89.4 percent, and flush toilets from 84.8 to 89.5 percent (with only 1.2 percent having no sanitation in 2007) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739456X12455665">Statistics South Africa 2007</xref>)</p></fn>
