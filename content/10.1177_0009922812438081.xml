<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social and environmental conditions greatly affect child health and well-being, and are known as social determinants of health (SDH) in the literature. The impact of SDH on child health is emerging as a new morbidity because of the recognition that poor socioeconomic and health status lead to adverse health outcomes in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812438081">1</xref></sup> Various studies have shown that children who live in poverty and encounter social stressors often have worse health, behavior, and learning compared with children in higher economic classes with fewer stressors. Direct linkages between conditions more commonly associated with poverty, such as food insecurity, housing instability, limited parental education, and substance abuse, and high rates of behavioral, developmental, and learning problems in children have been made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812438081">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, substandard housing conditions and homelessness have been linked to higher rates of otitis media, diarrheal illness, asthma, and health service utilization for children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812438081">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812438081">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of the effects of various social and environmental factors on child health, physicians should be screening patients and families from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds about stressors such as poverty, domestic violence, parental depression, food insecurity, and safe housing during routine patient encounters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812438081">5</xref></sup> Resident physicians regularly encounter families with varying socioeconomic backgrounds, yet traditional medical training lacks sufficient education about SDH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812438081">6</xref></sup> Effective child advocacy training is now an important aspect of resident education and a requirement of the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education for all pediatric residents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812438081">7</xref></sup> Addressing this requirement, advocacy curricula have been shown to improve knowledge about community heath, competency in identifying community resources, and self-reported confidence of advocacy skills in residents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812438081">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812438081"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812438081">10</xref></sup> Expansion of the health care team to include lawyers, known as a medical legal partnership (MLP), is now used by a number of practices across the country to advocate for the nonmedical needs of patients that directly affect their ability to manage their health conditions and seek care. When an MLP was established in a resident clinic, it was found to greatly affect the residents’ abilities to advocate for their patients and realized the effects that SDH have on health outcomes, thus preparing them to practice in socially complex environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812438081">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>All categorical pediatric and combined internal medicine–pediatric (Med-Peds) residents at our institution participate in a required advocacy rotation. However, residents have continuity clinics at different locations with varying levels of social and legal support. Although innovative curricula, such as the advocacy rotation at our institution, are critical to increasing resident knowledge on the topic of the SDH, we theorize that readily available social and legal support is needed to transfer this knowledge into practice. We hypothesized that residents from continuity clinic settings with more social and legal support would be more likely to ask about SDH, but this information has not been previously reported in the literature. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of on-site social and legal support on residents’ confidence and practice patterns inquiring about SDH during routine well child care (WCC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922812438081" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was a cross-sectional comparative survey of pediatric residents’ confidence and practice patterns addressing SDH in continuity clinics at 3 different sites that have varying levels of social service and legal support. It was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The study was conducted from October 2010 to February 2011.</p>
<sec id="section8-0009922812438081">
<title>Study Setting and Subjects</title>
<p>The study was performed at CCHMC, which has a large pediatric residency training program, with more than 180 residents. Our residency program attracts residents from across the United States, which in addition to our overall size, we feel is a representative sample of pediatric trainees from this country. Clinic A is a large, urban, academic pediatric primary care clinic that serves as the continuity site for approximately 75 pediatric residents with 35 000 visits per year. It is staffed by 3 full-time social workers and an on-site MLP, with 2 lawyers and a paralegal. Clinic B is an off-site community health center that has 19 continuity clinic residents with approximately 10 000 visits annually and is staffed by an on-site full-time social worker with direct access to the MLP at clinic A. All of the 28 Med-Peds residents have their continuity clinics at clinic C, which is a large, urban, academic outpatient clinic that serves children and adults of all ages. Clinic C has approximately 12 000 adult and pediatric patient visits per year and has limited access to a social worker and no legal support.</p>
<p>All 3 clinics care for patients from predominantly economically disadvantaged populations. Clinics A and B are led by the same management team. All 3 clinic locations have an electronic health record (EHR), WCC questionnaire forms completed by families at the beginning of the visit, and templates that are built into the EHR that act as triggers for physician screening. Although the EHR templates and questionnaires families complete differ slightly between the clinics, they all provide screening for the major SDH, including food security, housing conditions, public benefits, maternal depression, and domestic violence. The social workers at all 3 sites are funded by the institution that houses the clinic. The lawyers and paralegal personnel are mainly funded by private donations and foundation support. Staff from the MLP are available on-site during all resident clinic sessions for both consultation and teaching. Most of the faculty that staff the 3 clinics received their training from and are currently on the medical staff of CCHMC. All 3 clinics follow the same precepting and supervision guidelines.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0009922812438081">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>All second-year categorical pediatric residents (PL2) who have continuity clinic at clinic A (25) or clinic B (7) and all second- and third-year (PL3) Med-Peds residents who have continuity experience in clinic C (14) were invited to participate in the study. This group was a convenience sample selected based on their continuity clinic location. Additionally, convenience samples of residents at each of the 3 sites were selected for direct observation during a WCC visit, based on availability of residents and faculty observers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0009922812438081">
<title>Survey Development</title>
<p>The resident survey and faculty social history observation tool were developed de novo for this study by experts from the General Pediatrics Education Section at CCHMC, an educational psychologist, and members of the MLP. The surveys and observation tools were reviewed by the CCHMC Medical Education Research Group and the Division of Education and Learning for content validity and amended according to their recommendations. The Pediatric Chief Residents reviewed the surveys for content, clarity, and test reliability. The resident surveys used a 5-point Likert-type scale to obtain information concerning residents’ comfort assessing social determinants and reflections of their practice in the continuity clinic setting.</p>
<p>The survey was developed on an Internet survey platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>) and distributed via an e-mail containing a link to the survey. The faculty social history observation tool used a checklist on various SDH that should be part of a social history in high-risk patient populations, as well as a time measurement to record the length of time residents spent obtaining a social history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812438081">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-0009922812438081">
<title>Data Sources, Measures, and Collection Procedures</title>
<p>After reading a verbal consent study information sheet, residents were given the opportunity to consent and participate in the study. The residents who opted to participate completed the surveys described above, which also contained several demographic questions. Data were collected via an Internet survey platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.surveymonkey.com">www.surveymonkey.com</ext-link>) and residents were e-mailed links to enter and complete the surveys. After all residents who chose to participate in the study had completed the survey, the information was downloaded from the Internet survey platform for statistical analysis. Next, a small number of faculty members from the research team conducted standardized direct observations of a sample of resident WCC visits from each clinic site (10/25 clinic A, 3/7 clinic B, and 4/14 clinic C) using the structured observation checklist. Prior to the direct observations, faculty members collaborated to determine how to score the checklist to limit interobserver variability. The survey completion and direct observations were done in different settings. The surveys were completed from 2 to 12 weeks prior to the observation component.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0009922812438081">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic data. Data from the surveys were analyzed via the SAS statistical platform. Survey data were compared using a nonparametric test, the Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of ranks, to detect differences between the 3 groups regarding comfort with addressing SDH and their individual practice patterns of screening for SDH. Resident observation data obtained by faculty members were compared using Fisher’s exact test, and the time resident’s spent obtaining a social history was analyzed via the Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of ranks.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0009922812438081" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Preobservation surveys were completed by 40 of the 46 residents (87%) who were invited to participate in the study (24/25 clinic A, 5/7 clinic B, and 11/14 clinic C). Resident demographic data in regards to their level of residency training, age distribution, race, and number of social hardships they personally faced during childhood are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812438081">Table 1</xref>. The surveys revealed that 72.5% of residents who responded were raised in households with zero social hardships, 20% were raised in a household with 1 or 2 hardships, and 7.5% in households with 4 or more social hardships. Because of smaller sample sizes in the 3 continuity clinics, these individual clinic percentages were variable. The individual clinic breakdown of hardships experienced during childhood of residents by continuity clinic site is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812438081">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inquiring about SDH, such as food security, adequate housing, screening for domestic violence, and access to public benefits, during WCC is critical to ensuring a child’s health and well-being. Given the large proportion of pediatric residents who care for underserved children in continuity clinics during their training, it is critical to ensure that residents have education on SDH, and the necessary social and legal supports to assist in caring for these children and their families.</p>
<p>As reflected in the resident demographic data from this study, the majority of our residents were raised in households with very few social hardships. Given this lack of personal experience with social hardships during their formative years, most residents have limited personal experience to rely on when treating an underserved patient population. Malcolm Knowles’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812438081">12</xref></sup> theory of adult learning (andragogy) suggests that adults rely heavily on personal experience to base future learning endeavors. Given a lack of personal experience, we suggest that pediatric residents need to receive both education and guided social and legal support to ensure that they are adequately able to care for underserved patients.</p>
<p>Large, pediatric, academic medical centers that house continuity clinics and provide care for patients from predominantly underserved populations may have social support services available, but there are no reports in the literature to document the number of continuity clinics with on-site social workers. Many families living in poverty have multiple unmet basic and legal needs that affect their health, leading to the integration of MLPs into the medical home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812438081">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812438081">14</xref></sup> As of May 2011, in the United States, there were MLPs affiliated with 235 health institutions, including 55 pediatric residency programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812438081">15</xref></sup> When lawyers are incorporated into the medical home, they can provide legal services and advice to vulnerable populations to help meet their basic needs and hold agencies, landlords, and schools accountable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812438081">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our survey results indicated that residents who practiced in continuity clinic sites that have on-site social work and MLP resources were more confident in their knowledge of various SDH and self-reported that they screened for them more frequently during WCC. Our data showed that residents who practiced in clinics with robust social and legal support reported screening more frequently for housing insecurity, public benefit support, and food insecurity as compared with their peers who did not practice in clinics with the same resources, even with the same advocacy training and screening tools. Although there were limited observations at sites B and C, the observations revealed a trend that residents who practiced in continuity clinics with greater social and legal support tended to inquire more frequently about certain SDH (WIC usage and a child’s living situation) than those who trained in clinics with less social and legal support services. Additional observations are needed to determine if this trend in practice patterns is statistically significant. In addition, although not yet statistically significant, there was a trend during observation that residents from clinics with strong social and legal support inquired more often about food stamps, food insecurity, and housing conditions.</p>
<p>There were a number of limitations to this study. This was a cross-sectional survey of a group of pediatric and Med-Ped residents from a single residency program that was completed over 1 year’s time, and the number of observations was limited. Although all of the residents receive the same advocacy curriculum at our institution, Med-Ped residents are likely to have additional training experiences on their internal medicine rotations, which may affect their comfort in addressing various SDH. This additional training in the care of adults may reflect why residents from clinic C reported greater comfort screening for maternal depression. Furthermore, our faculty observers were not blinded to the clinic location during the observations. This may have led to bias, as they may have preconceived notions regarding the clinic or individual residents. Lastly, the results may not be generalizable to other settings given the clinic structures and resources that are available at our program.</p>
<p>However, steps were taken in the study to limit the amount of bias that occurred. Only a small group of faculty members were selected to perform the observations of the residents, and these individuals received detailed training on the tool to ensure that interrater reliability was reached. In addition, the observation tool was dichotomously scored (yes or no responses) to allow for clear response reporting. Lastly, although residents were aware that they were participating in a study, they were informed that they were being observed to evaluate their skills in providing anticipatory guidance to families (not SDH specifically). This was to eliminate the Hawthorne effect as a confounding variable in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812438081">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although an initial pilot study, this survey and observation data highlights the differences in comfort and screening practices between residents from underserved continuity clinics with different social and legal resources. This initial data should be used to develop a larger, multisite study that allows for an increased sample size with more observations over a longer period of time. Comparing results of resident surveys and observations from other programs that serve different patient populations, contain different levels of social and legal support services, and do not provide a standardized advocacy curriculum would be valuable.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Empathetic and culturally competent physician assessment of SDH is a key component to addressing health disparities and improving overall child health. Although all of the residents in our study had received exposure to similar advocacy training containing information on SDH and legal remedies, those with on-site social and legal resources expressed increased confidence and self-reported that they assessed SDH more frequently. Our preliminary evidence suggests that in addition to education on SDH, physicians also need adequate social and legal support when caring for underserved patients. Further study on this topic with a larger group of resident physicians across a number of sites is warranted.</p>
