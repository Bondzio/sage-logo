<abstract>
<p>This article examines some of the discourse practices of contemporary television news reporting. Basing their analysis on BBC and ITV reports of the G20 summit meeting in London, April 2009, the authors investigate aspects of contemporary television news coverage. Drawing on Goffman’s work on backstage and frontstage regions and on footing, the authors focus specifically on the role of small talk, media self-referentiality and artfulness in visual and verbal synchrony as resources for personalisation and recontextualisation of private activities as public discourse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last two decades there has been a considerable shift in the boundaries between what are theorised as two distinct social domains: the public and the private. Much of the scholarly discussion addressing the convergence of the two domains has taken as its starting point the seminal work of Habermas on the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267323112459529">1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267323112459529">1989</xref>), and one of the central issues in this discussion has been the crucial role of the media in contributing to the transformation of the public sphere in late modernity and the function of television in particular in reconfiguring the public domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323112459529">Dahlgren, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267323112459529">Thompson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of the media more broadly, these shifts have been evident not only in the emergence of new genres like reality television and social makeover programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323112459529">Corner, 2002</xref>), but also in more established media genres such as broadcast news. Dahlgren, specifically in relation to television journalism, has considered the influence and consequences of the economic, social and cultural forces which have led to the new, more personalised, interactive and ‘popular’ formats and modes of representation which have been instrumental in this reconfiguration. The increased tensions between information and entertainment in public affairs media have also been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112459529">Fairclough (1995)</xref>, who discusses the ways in which science programming and broadcast news reporting have become more ‘conversationalised’, drawing on language styles and forms of talk more usually associated with informal, private contexts for interaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267323112459529">Scannell (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112459529">Corner (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323112459529">Montgomery (2007)</xref>, among others, have amply documented the evolution in the discursive practices of news reporting, some of which stem from technological affordances which permit a more privileged access to verbal and visual messages (e.g. adaptations in studio design and management, including the use of giant screens and video links facilitating the development of live ‘two-way’ interviews); others are more obviously indicative of an intentional focus on personalisation and the increased attention to the private sphere, where discourses of the personal are colonising what has traditionally been regarded as the more institutional, public domain of news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267323112459529">Thornborrow and Montgomery, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article offers a contribution to ongoing debates around contemporary media discourse practices, and more specifically, to accounts of the ways in which self-referentiality and reflexivity (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323112459529">Chisholm, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267323112459529">Loshitzky, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267323112459529">Olson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267323112459529">Peterson, 2005</xref>) are increasingly evident in the discourse of broadcast news. Through an analysis of reports of a political summit meeting, we show how the discursive practices of conversationalisation and recontextualisation contribute centrally to the blurring of boundaries between public and private domains of action in television news, and significantly reconfigure the traditional hierarchy of relationships between its key participants (television journalists, the politicians and the audience). Recontextualisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323112459529">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>) is based on the premise that all texts, visual and verbal, are constructed from representations of social practices, and in the process of transporting representations of social actors and activities from one context of meaning to another, these practices are resituated, evaluated, legitimised, justified or critiqued. Moreover, the representation and foregrounding of the processes of reporting in the news report itself, i.e. ‘an acknowledgement of, and commentary in the media about, the media’s status as constructed artifice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323112459529">Dahlgren, 1995</xref>: 36) are pervasive discursive practices in our data. These practices produce a shift away from the more conventional, serious key of news reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267323112459529">Montgomery, 2007</xref>) towards a style of reporting where irony, reflexivity and a level of artfulness more generally associated with other media genres, such as political satire, are increasingly becoming the norm in television news.</p>
<p>Our analysis addresses these tendencies towards reflexivity and personalisation as they emerge in the context of UK television coverage of the G20 summit held in London in April 2009. We take as our point of departure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323112459529">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> work on impression management and the performance of self, and specifically his observations on the nature of backstage and frontstage performance as characteristic of private and public domains of discourse. Goffman compared contexts for private and public behaviours to a stage show with actors and an audience, claiming that: ‘it is natural to expect that the passage from the front region to the back region will be kept closed to members of the audience or that the entire back region will be kept hidden from them’ and that ‘in general, of course, the back region will be the place where the performer can reliably expect that no member of the audience will intrude’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267323112459529">Goffman, 1959</xref>: 113). However, the informalisation of institutional discourse, and the ‘conversationalisation’ of the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323112459529">Fairclough, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323112459529">1995</xref>), have resulted in a less clear demarcation between ‘back and front regions’ and in the legitimation of media access to the backstage domain. Goffman’s subsequent work on the concept of footing – a participant’s ‘alignment, or set, or stance, or posture, or projected self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267323112459529">1981 [1979]</xref>: 128) vis-a-vis other participants in an interactive encounter – has also provided a useful tool to investigate participation frameworks evidenced in media representation of the backstage domain in the production of broadcast news.</p>
<p>The analysis we present here integrates both visual image and verbal text, since they are together constitutive of televisual representation, and are crucially implicated in, and indexical of, footing shifts from public to private domains of discourse. As we will show, while the ‘news actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267323112459529">Van Leeuwen, 1996</xref>) shift their footing from official, public discourse to personal interaction, the camera shifts its focus/role from ratified observer of official business to a position closer to that of eavesdropper or unratified observer of private exchanges. These private interactions are thus transformed from backstage moments into newsworthy events. Moreover, it is not only the news actors whose backstage performances become frontstage news; the processes of reporting themselves become foregrounded in a self-referential, meta-discursive representation of news gathering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267323112459529">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Diplomatic summit meetings are not usually intrinsically newsworthy because of their very character. The complex private discussions and negotiations, and the non-public, behind-the-scenes activities where conventionally the media are not admitted, are not high in the key values of recency, negativity, superlativeness, unambiguity, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267323112459529">Galtung and Ruge, 1965</xref>). It is generally only at the end of proceedings that the media are officially invited for the final announcements and questions in press conferences. For this reason, most diplomatic summits often have very perfunctory coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323112459529">de Vreese, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267323112459529">Semetko and Valkenburg, 2000</xref>). The G20<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267323112459529">1</xref></sup> in London in 2009 was rather different because of its high news value on at least two counts: the state of the world economy (the early months of 2009 were marked by the most significant global economic crisis the world had known since 1929), and US president Barack Obama’s first visit to Europe after his election in autumn 2008. This summit meeting therefore contained strong values of ‘relevance’ and ‘power elite’, categories of news proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267323112459529">Harcup and O’Neill (2001)</xref>. The preparations for the G20 in themselves constituted a newsworthy event because of their enormous cost and the considerable organisational effort which was being put into the management of such a well-attended, highly elite gathering, and because of the high security risks involved. The media covered the planning for the event by focusing at length on the process of preparation and especially on concerns for security, lending a quality reminiscent of cinematic or television fiction to their reports, building up tension and suspense through dramatic scenes suggesting the imminent threat of terrorist attacks and civil disorder. This pre-event coverage also had a framing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323112459529">Entman, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323112459529">2003</xref>) for coverage of the summit itself, creating expectations of danger and violence, as well as of potential conflicts between summit participants (particularly the apparent split between most European delegates and the US–UK alliance<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267323112459529">2</xref></sup>). The pre-event coverage thus constructed a link to upcoming events, providing ‘hooks’ on which the broadcaster could set up the next day’s news reports, and spin. All these factors explained the exceptional newsworthiness of the London G20. However, as with most summit meetings, while the world’s media were clearly present in great numbers at the event, they were excluded from the ongoing private talks and negotiations. As we shall see, this may account for the attention to personal interaction and backstage behaviours in order to compensate for the lack of ‘hard facts’ available to journalists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0267323112459529">
<title>Data and analysis</title>
<p>The news broadcasts we recorded contained some noticeable features which distinguished the items on the summit meeting itself from the political and economic commentary which accompanied them. In particular, we found many instances of coverage of backstage activities and encounters which lent a more personal perspective to the event (for instance, the Queen making an angry comment about Berlusconi shouting, and Michelle Obama putting her arm around the Queen, both of which quickly made their way onto YouTube). These were unofficial, unscripted moments, private conversations and other social interactions taking place between participants, not the official public summit speeches or press conferences. This led us to investigate how these moments of backstage, unscripted talk and behaviour are made available to us by the cameras and built into television reports on the summit meeting itself.</p>
<p>Our corpus consists of all relevant news items on ITV and BBC early evening news broadcasts on the three days of the summit meeting: 31 March, 1 and 2 April 2009. First we identified the reports that focused on instances of backstage moments, in the sense that each exhibited some form of private interaction and/or a degree of unscriptedness. As an example, the two images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267323112459529">Figure 1</xref>, showing Brown and Sarkozy taking up an official, smiling pose as they shake hands for the photographers, then immediately moving away, turning their gaze away from the camera and back towards each other to continue their conversation, illustrate how the camera makes this transition from a clearly frontstage behaviour and public activity to a more private, backstage behaviour available to the viewing audience.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0267323112459529-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>We then grouped these items into three main contextual categories for our analysis: (1) reports containing ‘small talk’ overheard, (2) reports containing ‘meta-moments’ foregrounding organisation and process and (3) reports containing ‘artfulness’ in visual/verbal synchrony. These three categories are not mutually exclusive and features of more than one category can of course appear in the same report. We discuss examples from each of these in turn below.</p>
<sec id="section4-0267323112459529">
<title>Small talk overheard</title>
<p>The news segments in this category all focused on ‘small talk’. We identified these as private, interactional exchanges, relational rather than transactional, which took place between participants within the public setting of the event. In the tables which follow, the column on the right contains the verbal text of the news report; the column on the left contains, generally, a brief description of the visual text and/or, in italics, the talk overheard. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323112459529">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323112459529">2</xref> the reporter’s voiceover (henceforth VO) topicalises the small talk in an artfully edited sequence. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323112459529">Table 3</xref>, on the other hand, although the phatic remarks of prime minister Brown to the other delegates are overheard, they are not topicalised by the reporter in the accompanying VO. We can thus differentiate between the reporter’s occasional deliberate selection of such small talk activities as newsworthy, foregrounding the relational and the personal rather than the frontstage, public discourse of the event, and those activities which are used as a backdrop to the report’s commentary on the event. However, in both cases, in recording these instances of personal interactions between summit delegates or other associated elite news actors (e.g. Queen Elizabeth, Michelle Obama), the camera seems to reposition the audience as eavesdroppers on an encounter more than as ratified observers of a public event.</p>

</fig>
<p>This footing shift is clearly evident in the first two extracts, where the reporter’s VO topicalises the small talk activity itself. In the first extract, after Brown’s call to order, we see a shot of a small group of delegates including Obama, and overhear a snatch of the conversation. The reporter deliberately pauses to allow the audience to hear Obama’s words, which are then foregrounded in the VO text to produce a comparison between the triviality of the small talk and the weightiness of the issues facing delegates at the summit. Similarly, in the second extract, although the setting is the more formal occasion of the Obama/Windsor meeting at Buckingham Palace, we watch the group from a distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267323112459529">Figure 2</xref>), hear faintly the exchanges between the participants, and are directed by the reporter’s VO to ‘watch the queen’s face here’ (although it is not altogether clear what we the audience are supposed to infer from her expression). The final VO comment: ‘Honestly. You couldn’t make it up’ is also ambiguous; nevertheless both comments draw our attention to the backstage, private domain of interaction between these public figures which is made available to us by the media. The BBC report on this encounter contained similar footage although the personal exchanges were not foregrounded, but referred to in the VO as a reported speech act: ‘Tonight President Obama and his wife Michelle had tea at the Palace with Her Majesty and Prince Philip, who wondered how they were managing to stay awake.’ The last extract, as we have already pointed out, is different: here the VO report is a commentary on the Europeans’ negative view of the Brown–Obama plan, and gives a sceptical evaluation of the successful outcome of the summit. The choice of this particular shot arguably provides a visual link to the (negative) split referred to in the report, with Brown filmed as he arrives late for a meeting, greeting and apologising to delegates. A caveat here: we are not claiming that this is a necessary reading of this item, but television news discourse invites us to make a meaningful link between the visual and verbal texts. We return to this point later.</p>
<p>Of particular note in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323112459529">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323112459529">2</xref> is the shift in register and footing of the reporter’s accompanying VO. The conversational and colloquial use of phrases like ‘popped along’, ‘just watch’, ‘Honestly. You couldn’t make it up’ produces a corresponding shift from the usual more formal, institutional footing of news reports (as evident in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267323112459529">Table 3</xref>) to a more personalised footing, which positions reporter and viewing audience within the same deictic space, as observers of an exchange which is not ‘for’ them. In addition, the reporter’s VO assumes a shared cultural space which would make the irony of his evaluations (e.g. ‘all those important conversations’, ‘you couldn’t make it up’) accessible to the audience.</p>
<p>The principal actors in these summit reports are well aware that not only their public announcements but also their private interactions are continuously being filmed by the television cameras. In the latter case, the cameras are generally ignored and the actors’ behaviour, as we saw in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267323112459529">Figure 1</xref> in the example of Brown and Sarkozy, is kinetically completely different from their official frontstage demeanour. The attention to these kinds of scenes and their integration into news reports appears congruent with shifts in the representation of private domains of interaction within media discourse practices more broadly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267323112459529">
<title>Meta-moments: Foregrounding of backstage organisation and process</title>
<p>As well as integrating backstage activities of the delegates at the event in their reports, the television media also foreground the processes of news reporting as behind-the-scenes backstage activity. In this section we discuss examples where specific attention to the organisation of the event, particularly for television, is salient. The next two extracts focus on housekeeping and getting things in order for elite guests, where both BBC and ITV reports foreground ‘red carpets’ – icons of eliteness, indexing preparations for summit events. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267323112459529">Table 4</xref>, the BBC reporter’s extended live two-way with the news presenter begins with a reference to the carpet which we see being fitted by workers behind him (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267323112459529">Figure 3</xref>). In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0267323112459529">Table 5</xref>, the ITV reporter signs off the VO of the edited report with a shot of a red carpet outside 10 Downing Street being cleaned. Both reporters are standing in front of 10 Downing Street and speaking to camera.</p>

<p>The extract in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267323112459529">Table 4</xref> is an example of how backstage activities become incorporated into a frontstage report, as workers go about their task of fitting, measuring, cutting and moving the carpet. Standard shots from Downing Street are routinely filmed with the reporter standing outside the door of Number 10, and the camera work can include, or not (and the reporter can refer to, or not) whatever other activity is taking place there. In this case, they clearly chose to do so. In contrast, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0267323112459529">Table 5</xref> we see that the shot has been added to the final VO segment of the report. This would suggest a deliberate decision to include reference to the carpet cleaning, and to select this shot as a representation of preparations for the elite event, in the editing process.</p>
<p>The next two extracts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0267323112459529">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0267323112459529">7</xref>) illustrate how backstage preparations for a frontstage moment – the posed group photograph of all the delegates – are selected as newsworthy activities. Both reports focus on getting ready for the photograph, using very similar footage but with different topical themes. While the BBC topicalises the significance of the close proximity of Brown and Hu in the photo, ITV topicalises organisational problems and the logistics of getting everyone into the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0267323112459529">Table 6</xref>, the transition from backstage to frontstage is explicitly represented in the camera shot of delegates entering through curtains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267323112459529">Figure 4</xref>) (Goffman’s metaphor of the traditionally hidden passage from back to front region is called to mind here), and then positioning themselves on the stage for the photograph. The production processes of the event are also made salient at the very end of this sequence by the inclusion of a shot of a television camera with a small viewer screen for the cameraman, reproducing an image of Brown at the podium delivering his speech (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0267323112459529">Figure 5</xref>). The main image comes into focus as it blurs on the small viewer screen. This shot thus brings the audience into the same deictic space as the observer/camera. Just as we saw the reporter in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267323112459529">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267323112459529">2</xref> shifting the footing of the audience into one of eavesdropper on a backstage interaction, the camera here positions the audience backstage in the process of representing a public event.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0267323112459529">Table 7</xref>, the same scene is given a different, more extended treatment by ITV to topicalise certain details of delegates’ behaviour, in particular, Merkel’s impatience at the absence of Harper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0267323112459529">Figure 6</xref>), the euphemistic explanation for his absence and the subsequent disintegration of the formal pose. As we already noted above in the discussion of ITV’s report of the Obamas’ visit to Buckingham Palace, the reporter also shifts here into a colloquial, conversational register (e.g. ‘missing, yes, missing’ and ‘honestly with all those advisers you’d think they could get something right’) which contributes to the shift in footing from a more institutional voice into the personalised, complicit and knowing position of co-observer, with the audience, of this backstage disarray, witness to the unscripted activities in contrast to the official, formal poses. On another level, the topicalised backstage disarray functions metaphorically as a comment on the lack of coordination and agreement in the very business of the summit. Interestingly, both reporters borrow from the lexicon of theatre and cinema, explicitly foregrounding the staging of the event with intertextual references such as: ‘enter the trillion dollar man’, ‘cue the so-called family photo’, ‘take two’, ‘no show’ in the VO tracks of these reports.</p>

<p>Finally in this category we include two examples which illustrate the extent to which the active workings of the broadcast media are represented in the reports in a highly self-referential way. These extracts contain a considerable degree of backstage activity which is topicalised by the reporters.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0267323112459529">Table 8</xref> the camera zooms in slowly to a close-up shot of a woman sleeping with her head on a desk among computers and other journalists. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0267323112459529">Table 9</xref>, we see the teleprompter showing an extract of a news report followed by shots of the catwalk where correspondents are transmitting reports to their national networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0267323112459529">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0267323112459529">8</xref>). A close-up shot foregrounds a reporter, immobile and poised as he waits to speak to camera. Such camera work gives us images of people posing for other cameras, not for us, thereby not just documenting television’s role as observer of events in real time, but making explicit the staging of that process of documentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267323112459529">3</xref></sup> This high degree of reflexivity can also be found in the many images where the television camera records the flash of press photographers’ cameras taking pictures of the delegates.</p>

<p>We argue that in these summit meeting reports, the recurrent presence of such self-referentiality is further evidence of how television news is increasingly implicated in producing and performing itself as part of the broadcast spectacle. The foregrounding of organisation and process, as well as the many transitions between frontstage and backstage behaviours present in our data, are further evidence of significant shifts in the representational discourses of television news. John Caldwell, in his discussion of the aesthetic economy of televisuality and state of the art strategies of pictorialisation, observed that ‘Television is not just a succession of images or shots. It is a machine that consumes images within its own images’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112459529">Caldwell, 1995</xref>: 148). In the news coverage we discuss here, the ‘machine’ is working to deconstruct the boundaries between the public and private activities of the summit, including the mediatisation of the event. The newsworthy is thus found equally as much in the images of backstage activities of reporting and production as in the frontstage performance of the event itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267323112459529">
<title>Backstage moments, commentary and ‘artfulness’</title>
<p>UK television news reporting tends towards the artful and the stylised in some of its discursive practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267323112459529">4</xref></sup> In this final section, we show how the interpersonal and backstage activities discussed so far also provide a resource for comment and evaluation in VO reports through the artful exploitation of verbal and visual synchrony. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267323112459529">Montgomery (2005)</xref> has suggested that our understanding of news crucially depends upon the interpretation of the relationship between the verbal text and the visual image. Thus, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0267323112459529">Table 8</xref>, the visual image of a woman asleep on the desk is synchronous with the verbal ‘we all waited’ and so we infer that the woman is a journalist waiting for news. This inferencing process is fundamental to the construction of coherent meanings in a televisual text. In the reporting of the G20 summit, we found the synchrony between relational backstage moments and the VO report was often a vehicle for commentary or evaluation, motivated by inferences which emerge from a metonymic reading of the behaviours seen in the visual footage. We describe this practice as ‘artful’ precisely because it often relies on wordplay, or on a non-literal meaning produced by an implied relationship between the VO text and the visual image on screen.</p>
<p>As an illustration of this kind of verbal play and artfulness in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0267323112459529">Table 10</xref> we return to the example of the ‘teleprompter’ discussed above, where the visual/verbal fit between what we see and what we hear produces a play on words around ‘striking a pose’ and ‘striking a bargain’. The reporter picks up the phrase seen on the teleprompter to comment on the outcome of the summit, and in this case the visual text explicitly represents the non-literal meaning implied by the VO verbal text, i.e. a show of agreement between delegates.</p>
<p>Once again, we can note the high level of reflexivity produced here, between the explicit visual reference and the process of the reporter drawing on text from another news organisation which is then integrated into the edited report.</p>

<p>In the examples which follow, however, we see how the visual/verbal synchrony is used to produce commentary which relies upon inferences emerging from the interpersonal, non-verbal behaviours on screen. These thus become metonymic representations of broader newsworthy issues and relationships being reported on during the summit event. For example in the next extract (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0267323112459529">Table 11</xref>), it is possible to read the question of who should stand next to whom for photographers on the doorstep of 10 Downing Street as a metonym for the awkward relationships and alliances being negotiated between all summit delegates, not just the Browns and Obamas. In the VO we hear ‘this was the couple everybody wanted to get close to’ while we watch the actors positioning themselves on the doorstep, and the awkwardness of the interaction is made salient.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Of course it is possible that the meanings made available to the audience by this visual/verbal synchrony are quite simply a literal comment on the interaction taking place on the doorstep. However, as is evident in the next examples, the recurrence of such edited sequences indicates a tendency to use these non-verbal, relational moments as a visual metaphor to comment on aspects of the summit in general.</p>
<p>In the following extracts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0267323112459529">Tables 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0267323112459529">13</xref>) similar footage of the same event showing Obama patting Brown on the back generates different comments by the BBC and ITV based on different interpretations of the gesture.</p>
<p>The BBC reporter uses ‘direction’ both concretely and figuratively. His commentary foregrounds Obama directing Brown towards a door inside Downing Street, but also the solidarity between them in relation to the direction of the forthcoming summit meeting in terms of policies and outcomes. A possible inference, derived from the synchrony of the verbal and visual texts, is that Obama is the dominant partner in the relationship. The ITV reporter also foregrounds the relationship between the two men, explicitly drawing attention to Obama’s gesture, but explicitly interpreting it as a display of friendship and closeness between them: ‘Hey, my mate Gordon’. In all three examples, there is an underlying theme of social awkwardness on the part of Brown. We see this in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0267323112459529">Table 11</xref> in relation to the arrangement on the doorstep for the photo; in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0267323112459529">Table 12</xref> in the suggestion that Brown is not sure which way to go; and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0267323112459529">Table 13</xref> in the phrase ‘to sprinkle a little stardust’, which clearly represents Obama as the more charismatic figure, whose style and popularity outshines that of Brown.</p>

He then contrasts this with the interpersonal ‘rhetoric’ of the summit, the ‘warm words’ and ‘the smiles’, while on screen we see Brown and Obama entering 10 Downing Street, Obama stopping to shake hands with the policeman on the way in, while Brown very obviously fails to do so. The image of this brief backstage moment showing Brown’s social gaffe thus highlighted in the VO text seems more than just a commentary on the action on screen, but can be read as an implicit evaluation of the possible negative outcome of the event itself, and an exposure of the talks as ‘staged’ cordiality and empty rhetoric. Once again we see that in all the examples presented in this section, the primary focus is on the interpersonal, non-verbal, backstage activities which function as visual resources for the reporter’s verbal comment and evaluation. This use of both talk and images as resources corresponds in many ways to Theo van Leeuwen’s concept of recontextualisation where social actors and practices are distilled into new contextual meanings through the artful manipulation of verbal/visual synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323112459529">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this article we have shown how the 21st-century turn to the personal and the self-referential in discourses of the public sphere is as apparent in TV broadcast news as it is in other media genres. The foregrounding of backstage interactions and of media reporting processes themselves was pervasive in the coverage of the G20 summit we have examined here. It may well be the case that this pervasiveness results from the lack of accessible information regarding the business of the summit negotiations, and the consequent need to produce reports based on what was available, as journalists waited for official communiqués. It may also be a result of the low newsworthiness of summit meetings more generally, and a lack of interest on the part of the general public in commentary on this kind of political event (see references in the section on Context). On the other hand, the London G20 summit presented a much more newsworthy occasion than most, in the attendance of several controversial political figures, and above all in the arrival of the newly elected US president and first lady. Personalisation was thus high on the news agenda, as was negativity. The media’s prime focus was on the political elite attending the summit, the violent protests in the capital and also on the looming conflict between the European delegates and the Anglo-American ‘axis’ in terms of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation. When the predicted clash between the Anglo-Saxon ‘villains’ perceived as responsible for the crisis, and Old Europe’s stand against them led by Sarkozy and Merkel did not occur, and there was no public walkout by the French delegates, other newsworthy storylines emerged and these were overwhelmingly relational.</p>
<p>These factors notwithstanding, we argue that the way that these backstage, relational interactions are integrated into the news reports produces a shift of footing from the participation framework for the official commentary on summit business, where the audience is addressed by reporters as ratified participants of the talk, to a framework which positions the audience with the reporter, as bystanders and eavesdroppers on talk which is neither addressed to nor for them. This shift is realised by a more colloquial register in VO verbal texts, and by the construction of a shared deictic space between reporter and viewer. The contribution of the camera in this respect is crucial and evident on several planes, both in the framing of scenes and actors, and in the foregrounding of the process of the mediation of the event.</p>
<p>This self-referentiality constructs news gathering itself as newsworthy through the overwhelming presence of images of media paraphernalia (cameras, wires, microphones, journalists, laptops). At the same time, the very ubiquity of the media at the event tends to diminish its visibility and obtrusiveness, so that the protagonists – as in reality shows – seem to ignore its presence as they themselves move in and out of official ceremonial frontstage activities. Indeed, in the reports of the summit meetings, it is perhaps a misnomer to characterise certain shots as backstage when they are performed under the watchful eyes and ears of the world’s media. However they are not <italic>designed</italic> as official frontstage moments – they reveal the behind-the-scenes work that goes on in addition to the highly staged performances and ritual appearances (e.g. photos and speeches and handshakes).</p>
<p>The recontextualisation of such backstage moments drawn from recorded instances of small talk, private interactions and media production processes which are selected and transposed in the editing of VO reports of the summit, ‘eliminate much of the actual detail of the social practices they recontextualize, and focus, . . . mostly on legitimations or critique’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267323112459529">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>: viii). This critique can be found in the meanings either implied or made explicit in the artful synchrony between visual images and verbal text. These representational and reflexive practices produce, as Corner argued in relation to the representational referential axis of television, ‘new constituents of the image, new image combinations and new kinds of depictive significance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112459529">1999</xref>: 36) which are reconfiguring private sphere activities as discourses of the public domain.</p>
