<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are slow-flow malformations of the lymphatic channels that may be localized or may be associated with generalized abnormality of the lymphatic system. Most of them occur in the head and neck region. They are now classified as macrocystic, microcystic or mixed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-phleb.2011.011082">1</xref></sup> Macrocystic LMs are comprised of single or multiple cysts ≥2 cm<sup>3</sup> in size, whereas microcystic LMs are comprised of single or multiple cysts &lt;2 cm<sup>3</sup> in size. Mixed LMs include both macro- and microcystic components. This classification has standardized the description of LM and is of prognostic and therapeutic significance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-phleb.2011.011082">2</xref></sup> All the (extratruncular) LMs are congenital, more than 50% of them are present at birth and 90% are detected before the age of two years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-phleb.2011.011082">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-phleb.2011.011082">4</xref></sup> There is no sexual or racial predilection. Regarding the oral cavity, the tongue is most commonly affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-phleb.2011.011082">5</xref></sup> Both the dorsal and ventral surface of the tongue may be involved, with the dorsal surface of the tongue being the most common site, and sometimes macroglossia develops. LMs of the tongue tend to be microcystic, poorly defined, diffuse lesions. The mucosal surfaces are usually covered with many small, whitish and/or reddish vesicles. Recurrent upper respiratory tract infections or accidental trauma usually aggravate/stimulate the LM or worsen the swelling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-phleb.2011.011082">6</xref></sup> Histopathogically, the lesions are composed of thin-walled, cystically dilated vascular channels lined by inconspicuous endothelial cells and filled with proteinaceous lymph fluid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-phleb.2011.011082">7</xref></sup> The symptoms of LMs are related to the size, location and dimension of the lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-phleb.2011.011082">7</xref></sup> Respiratory compromise is the most significant complication of head and neck LMs and is commonly seen in patients with large masses of the neck or mediastinum. Infiltration of the floor of the mouth, base of the tongue, pharynx or laryngeal structure may also result in dysphonia, stridor, apnoea, cyanosis or even life-threatening dyspnoea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-phleb.2011.011082">8</xref></sup> Macroglossia secondary to LM of the tongue can cause airway obstruction, swallowing difficulty, malocclusion and speech problems.</p>
<p>In the literature, several treatment methods with varying success rates, including aspiration, surgical resection, laser therapy, cryotherapy, somnoplasty or temperature-controlled radio frequency volumetric tissue reduction and various sclerosing agent injections are documented. The historical treatment of choice has been surgical resection, but the procedure is often difficult because of the infiltrative nature of LMs and their proximity to vital structures; complete resection is often difficult to achieve and recurrences are common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-phleb.2011.011082">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-phleb.2011.011082">11</xref></sup> Despite the variety of possible treatment modalities, LMs of the tongue still represent a therapeutic challenge for physicians. The aim of the present study was to summarize and report our clinical experiences in the treatment of tongue LMs with intralesional injection of pingyangmycin in 18 consecutive cases.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Between January 2003 and February 2009, in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 18 patients with tongue microcystic LMs were treated primarily with intralesional injection of pingyangmycin. The treatment indications included functional problems (breathing, suction and speech) and disfigurement. For treatment safety, children under three years of age were not included in the treatment regimen. The treatment was approved by the Institute Review Board of the hospital and is in accordance with the precepts of the Helsinki Declaration. Informed consents were obtained from the patients or from the children's parents in all instances. Of the 18 patients, 10 were men and eight were women; their age ranged from three to 29 years with a median age of 13 years. Thirteen lesions were located in the dorsum of the tongue, two were located in the ventral surface of the tongue, and three involved both the dorsal and ventral surface of the tongue as well as the floor of mouth with macroglossia. The dimensions of the lesions were 1.0 cm×1.2 cm to 2.0 cm×3.5 cm.</p>
<p>All the patients were treated at the outpatient clinic. After treatment, they were asked to re-visit at a regular interval of three months.</p>
<p>Pingyangmycin was acquired from Tianjin Taihe Pharmaceutics Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China); it is bleomycin A5 made in China and is isolated from many components of bleomycin produced by <italic>Streptomyces pingyangensis</italic>, which has a chemical structure similar to that of bleomycin but different terminal amine moiety. Pingyangmycin was originally developed as an antineoplastic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis and was serendipitously found to have sclerosing effects on LMs through a non-specific inflammatory reaction.</p>
<p>Before injection, 8 mg pingyangmycin powder was dissolved in 3 mL lidocaine (2%, 5 mL), dexamethasone (5 mg, 1 mL) and 4 mL normal saline, to make up a solution with a concentration of 1 mg/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-phleb.2011.011082">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the injections were performed through a 24-gauge needle without general anaesthesia at outpatient clinics. After appropriate sterilization, pingyangmycin solution (concentration, 1 mg/mL) was injected directly and infiltrated into the microcystic LM lesions until the lesion slightly expanded or the surface mucosa turned pale with pressure. A single dose of 8 mg per session was not exceeded. For lesions less than 2 cm in length, the whole lesions were infiltrated with the agent, while for lesions larger than 2 cm in length, only part of the lesion was injected. Therefore, multiple treatments were mandatory. Tissue necrosis caused by extravasations of the agent to the surrounding tissues was not a concern due to the lower drug concentration (1 mg/mL) used.</p>
<p>After injection, gauzes were used for compression haemostasis and the patients were carefully observed for 15 minutes for any discomfort. Repeated injections were performed at an interval of 3–4 weeks. Timing of the treatment sessions was dependent on the dimension of the lesions and the individual response.</p>
<p>Clinical manifestations and therapeutic outcomes were reviewed. The final results were assessed by two other physicians from the Department of Oral Oncology depending on the clinical measurements, photographs and Doppler ultrasonography taken before and one year after the end of treatment. Lesion size was estimated by calculating the maximal length and width. Due to technical difficulties and irregularity, the thickness of the tongue was not included in the evaluation. A caliper was used to measure the maximal length (C–D) and width (A–B) of the visible lesions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-phleb.2011.011082">1</xref>a). For deep lesions, the dimension was evaluated by two-dimensional scanning of the Doppler ultrasonography scan based on the changes of the echo. The response rate was graded as follows: complete response (reduction in dimension greater than 90%), significant improvement (reduction in dimension of 50–90%) and improvement (reduction in dimension less than 50%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-phleb.2011.011082">12</xref></sup> The follow-up time was 12 months to eight years after the final treatment and the mean follow-up time was three years.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Sixteen patients received no previous treatments; two patients were treated with laser therapy previously but with recurrence. The patients received 1–8 injections (mean, 3.0 injections) for the whole course of treatment. The total dose of pingyangmycin administered was 8–64 mg (mean, 24 mg). Fifteen patients had complete response; the dimension of the lesions decreased greater than 90%. The outcome in typical cases is shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-phleb.2011.011082">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-phleb.2011.011082">2</xref>. Three patients with macroglossia had a reduction of 50–90% in the dimensions of the lesions. Although the cosmetic aspect and function of the tongue improved, further surgical intervention was carried out six months later for debulking and tongue plasty.

<p>After intralesional injection of pingyangmycin, mucosal ulcerations developed in all patients, and the superficial vesicles were exfoliated gradually within 14 days. The patients might have experienced transient swelling and pain. Three patients had a mild fever after injection. No acute or chronic allergic reactions or other complications were found during or after treatment, nor was there any indication of pulmonary fibrosis. No recurrence was noted throughout the follow-up period in patients who had complete response evaluated by clinical examination (visible re-growth) and duplex (for deep lesions).</p>

<sec id="sec4-phleb.2011.011082" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary treatment of microcystic LMs still remains controversial. Small or asymptomatic LMs may be observed without intervention. Fewer (up to 15%) macrocystic LMs (cystic hydroma) could regress spontaneously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-phleb.2011.011082">9</xref></sup> but spontaneous regression seldom occurs in microcystic LMs. Immediate or elective treatment is often mandatory due to the potential risk of acute enlargement of the lesions following infection or haemorrhage. Airway obstruction or obstructive sleep apnoea followed by recurrent tongue trauma with bleeding, pain or mucosal changes were the most common indications for tongue management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-phleb.2011.011082">10</xref></sup> Surgical excision used to be the first choice of treatment for LMs. However, studies have shown that LMs involving the tongue, floor of the mouth, cheek, pharynx or multiple anatomic sites have more recurrences, require more procedures, have higher complication rates and left the patient with persistent symptomatic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-phleb.2011.011082">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-phleb.2011.011082">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, the infiltrating nature of these lesions and the involvement of multiple tissue planes and important structures make complete excision nearly impossible in most cases. Even after visibly complete extirpation, at least 17% of lesions re-expand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-phleb.2011.011082">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wiegand <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-phleb.2011.011082">16</xref></sup> reported that for 20 patients with microcystic LM of the tongue, only in six patients could the LMs be completely removed by carbon dioxide laser surgery. The remaining 13 patients had persistent disease.</p>
<p>In this series, two patients had been treated with laser therapy previously but with recurrence. A possible explanation is that laser therapy destroyed the malformed tissues by thermocoagulation to a limited depth and width, but the residual untreated lymphatic cells continued to grow, thus resulting in recurrence.</p>
<p>Due to the inherent limitations of surgical excision and laser therapy, sclerotherapy is now becoming the first-line management for large or problematic microcystic/combined LM in most institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-phleb.2011.011082">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-phleb.2011.011082">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-phleb.2011.011082">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several sclerosants have been used to treat LM, including doxycycline, sodium tetradecyl sulphate, ethanol, bleomycin and OK-432; each has pros and cons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-phleb.2011.011082">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-phleb.2011.011082">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-phleb.2011.011082">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sung <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-phleb.2011.011082">29</xref></sup> and Zhong <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-phleb.2011.011082">30</xref></sup> reported satisfactory results in using bleomycin A5 for treatment of various types of head and neck LMs, mainly macrocystic LMs. The effectiveness of bleomycin A5 for microcystic LMs has been proved by several investigators. Bai <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-phleb.2011.011082">19</xref></sup> reported on 79 patients who received intralesional injection of pingyangmycin for the treatment of oral and facial microcystic LMs, and found that intralesional injection of pingyangmycin was effective for over two-thirds of the children. Yang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-phleb.2011.011082">12</xref></sup> used bleomycin A5 sclerotherapy to treat 30 cervicofacial microcystic LMs with acceptable success. Of these, 19 (63%) showed greater than 90% reduction; 10 (33%) had 50–90% reduction and only one (4%) had less than 50% reduction in size.</p>
<p>Compared with laser therapy and in contrast to Renton and Smith,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-phleb.2011.011082">2</xref></sup> we found that intralesional injection of pingyangmycin is effective in the treatment of microcystic LMs of the tongue. In this series, 15 patients were categorized as having complete response by pingyangmycin sclerotherapy alone, and three patients with macroglossia needed secondary surgical intervention.</p>
<p>The advantage of pingyangmycin sclerotherapy over laser therapy is that the endothelial cells of the lymphatic vessels can be destroyed with a non-specific inflammatory reaction, resulting in occlusion of the vessels, and thus recurrence is seldom encountered. Varying degrees of stromal fibrosis with hyaline appearance can be found in the surgical specimen after sclerotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-phleb.2011.011082">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with tongue microcystic LMs often had repeated inflammation following upper respiratory infection or when the patients had fatigue. The tongue became scarred and was hard in texture. In these circumstances, the injection must be at high pressure until the surface turns pale and rupture of the vesicles can be seen. Usually, lingual mucosal ulceration occurred after injection, but the lesions disappeared completely after healing of the ulceration without additional scars. The addition of dexamethasone into the solution has the effect of helping to soften scars, prevent fever and relieve symptoms. Steroids alone are ineffective for LMs.</p>
<p>The main concern of using pingyangmycin sclerotherapy in the past was pulmonary fibrosis, but no patients experienced pulmonary fibrosis as a complication when they received the treatment of LMs or vascular anomalies with intralesional injection of pingyangmycin in the literature reports. This is due to the lower dose and total amount administrated in these patients. Pulmonary fibrosis occasionally arises in patients after administration of a large dose, such as is needed for patients with malignant tumours. There is an increased incidence of pulmonary fibrosis with a single dose exceeding 30 mg or a total dose of 400 mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-phleb.2011.011082">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another rare, but potentially fatal, complication that should be kept in mind is acute allergic reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-phleb.2011.011082">32</xref></sup> Although acute hypersensitivity or hyperpyrexic reactions were not encountered in this series, one 17-year-old boy with venous malformation in the parotid gland died after the third session of pingyangmycin injection in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in our hospital last June. Since the onset of the reactions can occur with any dose of pingyangmycin and at any time, routine test dosing does not seem to predict when drug reactions may occur. Therefore, clinicians should monitor their patients for any signs and symptoms of acute hyperpyrexic reactions during pingyangmycin injection, and necessary precautions should be taken in case of an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>In this series, only three patients had a mild fever after injection. No other serious complications such as acute pulmonary hypertension, cardiovascular collapse and pulmonary embolism were encountered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-phleb.2011.011082">33</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec5-phleb.2011.011082" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that intralesional injection of pingyangmycin is a safe and effective method of treatment of tongue microcystic LMs. For extensive lesions involving multiple anatomic areas and deep tissue planes, pingyangmycin sclerotherapy combined with surgical excision is necessary.</p>
