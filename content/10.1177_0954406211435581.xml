<abstract>
<p>An ink transfer process from the printing roll to the moving web was investigated using a computational fluid dynamics technique for the roll-to-roll application in the area of printed electronics. Emphasis was made on the shape of the transferred ink pattern in a realistic configuration. The shear-thinning effect of the conductive ink was treated using a generalized non-Newtonian fluid model. That is, the coefficients of the Carreau model were determined using the fluid dynamic property information of the commercially available conductive ink used in the roll-to-roll process. Also, the web handling speed was matched with that of the typical roll-to-roll process applied in printed electronics. Computational results show that the spatial variation of the shear rate is quite significant in the present configuration; therefore, the Carreau model better predicts the shape of the measurement data than Newtonian fluid in the range of the line thickness of 100–500 µm. It is also noted that the non-uniformity of the transferred ink that is experimentally observed is better predicted by the non-Newtonian model. It is conjectured that the distortion of the shape and the non-uniform distribution of the transferred ink are the prime sources for deterioration in printing quality. However, the fact that web handling speeds of up to 30 mpm (=0.5 m/s) do not significantly aggravate the degree of distortion still supports the main advantage of a cost-effective, continuously running roll-to-roll process in this speed range.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211435581" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The roll-to-roll (R2R) printing process is attracting much attention these days for practical applications in a wide range of industries concerning printed electronics. With its attractive nature in terms of cost effectiveness, continuously running R2R printing processes are being applied in various manufacturing areas regarding flexible displays, multi-layered solar-cells, RFID tags, and other industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211435581">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211435581"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211435581"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211435581"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211435581"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211435581">6</xref></sup> A very complex R2R printing process consists of the following two important steps from a fluid-thermo dynamical point of view: (a) transfer process of the conductive ink from the printing roll to the moving web and (b) drying and subsequent curing processes. For reliable design of high-speed, continuous operation while maintaining the required printing quality, better understanding of the ink transfer process is required. One of the technical issues in the application of printed electronics is an assured minimum conductivity of the printed patterns. Several parameters affecting the printing quality include the ink properties, line thickness, and shape of the printing pattern, and web handling speed excluding mechanical problems such as tension and elasticity of the web that may lead to a non-negligible register error. Therefore, the establishment of reliable prediction methodology for the ink transfer process under various geometric configurations of the printing pattern and web handling speeds is quite crucial.</p>
<p>In several recent experimental studies on ink-transfer processes, the effects of ink properties on R2R printing processes were investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211435581">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211435581"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211435581"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211435581">10</xref></sup> Pudas et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211435581">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211435581"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211435581">9</xref></sup> overcame the problem of unwanted line dilatation by replacing an ethyl cellulose-based ink with a hydrocarbon resin-based ink. They successfully showed that a line width under 100 µm for application in electric circuits was experimentally realizable for the first time when the maximum unexpected line expansion rate was reduced from 100% to about 10%. It was conjectured that this improvement in terms of more accurate line transfer was due to the relatively larger viscosity resulting from a higher content of solid particles. A visualization and measurement study by Yin and Kumar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211435581">10</xref></sup> illustrated the effect of the gap size between the web and the cavity on the ink transfer process in a simplified configuration where the curved web moves against a stagnant cavity. For the case of a vanishing gap, the ink transfer process was found to be smooth without forming a liquid bridge and subsequent breakdown of the liquid column.</p>
<p>Most of the early numerical works dealt with a simplified coating process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211435581">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211435581">12</xref></sup> In their studies of the application of a thin viscoelastic fluid to a continuous, flexible substrate, Zevallos et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211435581">11</xref></sup> and Lécuyer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211435581">12</xref></sup> showed that non-Newtonian rheological models such as the Carreau, Gillespie, and Oldroyd-B models tuned with experimental data on extensional viscosity perform better than the Newtonian assumption. Even though these studies successfully extracted the relevant flow physics, the limitation originating from the simplified geometry restricts the direct application of the results to a more realistic system such as gravure printing.</p>
<p>A theoretical and experimental investigation by Hewson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211435581">13</xref></sup> provided very extensive data for coated film thickness, pick-out location as a function of speed ratio. Later study by Hewson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211435581">14</xref></sup> derived a two-scale model for predicting the fluid pick-out and coated film thickness characteristics of discrete cell gravure roll coater. Their model, which was able to predict the flow features on the small scale, confirmed that the most important operating parameter is the web-to-roll speed ratio.</p>
<p>In addition to the obstacle of geometry to a workable theory, varying fluid properties of conductive ink increase the difficulty of analysis. At present, a conductive ink containing typical metallic particles, such as silver or copper, is widely used in spite of its relatively high cost. Obviously, a mixed composition of the base ink and metallic particles exhibits a variation in the viscosity with the shear and thus renders more difficult analytic treatment of the ink transfer process. Furthermore, scarceness of reliable measurement data for metallic ink properties due to a lack of proper instrumentation is a major reason for the virtual intractability of analysis.</p>
<p>In their numerical study, Bhat and Bararan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211435581">15</xref></sup> investigated the effects of viscosity, surface tension, and gravitational force on liquid transfer inside departing plates with a non-Newtonian fluid model. Even though they reported a very useful result, namely that higher viscosity or lower surface tension leads to an increase in the transfer rate for large contact angles at the target plate, the effect of rotation of the printing roll was not considered. Hoda and Kumar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211435581">16</xref></sup> performed boundary integral simulations to understand the removal process of Newtonian liquids from a simplified model gravure cavity. They successfully illustrated the role of surface wettability and cavity size of their model. In more recent studies by Lee and Na<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211435581">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211435581">18</xref></sup> and Kim and Na,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211435581">19</xref></sup> the geometry of gravure printing, which is one of the most popular R2R printing methods, was considered for direct relevance to real applications. Kim and Na<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211435581">19</xref></sup> showed that the characteristics of the transferred ink strongly depend on the magnitude of the viscosity under the assumption of Newtonian fluid. Their result that the characteristics of a printed pattern depend on the magnitude of the viscosity prompts the need for considering variable viscosity since the shear rate and thus, the viscosity show considerable spatial variation in gravure printing applications.</p>
<p>In this study, a numerical study has been attempted to understand the ink transfer process in an R2R printing system with a realistic configuration. There are various ways of delivering or transferring the ink from the printing roll to a continuously running web, but the geometry of gravure printing, one of the most popular types, was considered with general purpose commercial software (ANSYS/Fluent 13) to deal with very complex numerical configurations. The main objective of the article is to analyze the shape of the transferred ink in an R2R process. The Carreau model, which captures the shear-thinning effect of the ink, was incorporated to account for the shear-dependent viscosity realized in the gravure printing system, and the coefficients of the Carreau model were adjusted using the data obtained from the commercially available conductive ink of Parelec, Inc. The dynamics of the solid metal particles contained in the ink were not directly considered, but the effect of the particles was indirectly taken into account in the values of the density and viscosity of the ink. Also, the web handling speed was matched to that of a real system to make the present analysis more realistic.</p>

<p>A schematic of the simplified gravure printing process considered in this study is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211435581">Figure 1</xref>. The printing pattern engraved on the surface of a printing roll is filled with ink in the container before ink is finally transferred to the moving web. For convenience of numerical analysis, it was assumed that the printing roll has only an isolated single pattern (represented by a single cavity), but this simplification is believed not to hinder a grasp of the basic physical nature for the ink transfer process. The shapes of several cavities considered in this study including the reference cavity are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211435581">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211435581">Table 1</xref>. The width of the web was set equal to that of the cavity to reduce the computational cost.

<p>In the typical paper printing industry, the web moving speed can go up to 300 mpm (=5 m/s), but it is severely restricted to the range of 5–10 mpm due to the subsequent drying and curing processes required in printed electronics. However, a recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211435581">20</xref></sup> reported that the time for the combined drying and curing processes could be successfully reduced by a factor of as large as 5. Therefore, higher web, handling speeds of up to 30 mpm (=0.5 m/s) compared to the speeds chosen in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211435581">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211435581"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211435581">19</xref></sup> was considered in this study. Obviously, a relatively higher speed shortens the convection time-scale, thus increasing the importance of the inertial effect relative to that of viscous action. The degree to which the increased web handling speed influences the distortion of the transferred ink pattern will be investigated.</p>
<p>At present, it is widely known that silicon-based electronics is able to materialize much finer circuit lines (down to tens of nanometers) than those in printed electronics (which are typically of the order of tens or hundreds of microns). This severe restriction in the pattern width in printed electronics has to do with the difficulty of obtaining the minimum conductivity. The required conductivity is ensured using metal particles, such as silver or copper, mixed in the base solvent, but a line thickness smaller than the critical value (typically, of the order of tens of microns) is known to be incapable of carrying the minimum level of conductivity. This loss of conductivity is partly because of inaccurate ink transfer due to the distortion of the printed shape in the presence of a possibly non-negligible effect of surface tension and convection. For a realistic comparison with experimental data, a line thickness in the range 100–500 µm was chosen here.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, three different cavity shapes were considered for this study; they are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211435581">Figure 2</xref>. The reference shape of Cavity 1 was used to establish the reference data, whereas cavities with more complex geometries (Cavities 2 and 3) were investigated for relevance to practical R2R systems.</p>
<p>Since the present configuration involved continuous distortion of the free surface of the ink, the popular volume of fluid (VOF) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211435581">21</xref></sup> incorporated in the ANSYS/Fluent package was invoked to track the interface between the ink and the surrounding air. To incorporate the VOF method, the momentum equation was rewritten to include the surface force

where <italic>F</italic><sub>b</sub> denotes body force and <italic>F</italic><sub>s</sub> the surface force, including the effect of surface tension. The surface tension model in ANSYS/Fluent 13 is the continuum surface force (CSF) model proposed by Brackbill et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211435581">22</xref></sup> With this model, the addition of surface tension to the VOF calculation results in a source term in the momentum equation. In this software package, a formulation of the CSF model is used, where the surface curvature is computed from local gradient in the surface normal at the interface. The surface tension can be written in terms of the pressure jump across the surface. The force at the surface can be expressed as a volume force using the divergence theorem. It is this volume force that is the source term which is added to the momentum equation. An option to specify a wall adhesion angle in conjunction with the surface tension model, taken from the work by Brackbill et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954406211435581">22</xref></sup> was also used in this study. Rather than imposing this boundary condition at the wall itself, the contact angle that the fluid is assumed to make with the wall was used to adjust the surface normal in cells near the wall. This so-called dynamic boundary condition results in adjustment of the curvature of the surface near the wall. If <italic>θ<sub>ω</sub></italic> is the contact angle at the wall, then the surface normal at the live cell next to the wall is calculated as follows

The combination of this contact angle with the normally calculated surface normal one cell away from the wall determines the local curvature of the surface, and this curvature is used to adjust the body force term in the surface tension calculation. In this study, a dynamic contact angle was not used but an option to specify a wall adhesion angle explained above in conjunction with the VOF method was used for the better accuracy.</p>
<p>The volume fluxes were computed by geometrically reconstructing the interface using the value of the VOF function in and around a given control volume. In the geometric reconstruction approach, the standard interpolation schemes that are used in ANSYS FLUENT were used to obtain the face fluxes whenever a cell was completely filled with one phase or another. When the cell was near the interface between two phases, the ‘geometric reconstruction scheme’ was used. The geometric reconstruction scheme represented the interface between fluids using a piecewise-linear approach.</p>
<p>Grid system was generated using a hexahedral mesh element rather than a tetrahedral type for better numerical accuracy. Computational grid with 250,000 hexahedral elements is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211435581">Figure 3</xref>. Regular configuration of the structured grid system was constructed to reduce the truncation error. The number of grids required varies with the shape of the cavity. After several preliminary computations, it was found that a total of about 110,000 grids were enough for the reference cavity, namely, Cavity 1. However, it turned out that more complex cavity shapes (Cavities 2 and 3) required at least 250,000 grids. The typical symptoms of under-resolution are a loss of symmetry in the transferred ink pattern and the presence of unrealistic satellite ink droplets following the main pattern. Thus, the number of grids was increased until those unrealistic indications of under-resolution disappeared. To check grid independence, computations with three different resolutions had been conducted for Cavity 3 with a web moving speed of 30 mpm (=0.5 m/s), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211435581">Figure 4</xref>. This figure shows the variation of volume fraction of the ink at the surface of the web with the grid resolution. It was thought that the results based on 250,000 meshes properly revealed the correct flow features of Cavity 3 for the purpose of this study. This resolution issue was further investigated by detecting the values of volume fraction, pressure, and wall shear at the center point of the Cavity 3, where both numerical and experimental results will be compared later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211435581">Figure 9</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211435581">Table 2</xref> gives the variation of those three variables with the resolution. Although small changes were detected between the results obtained with 250,000 and 420,000 meshes, it was thought that those changes were not significant enough to affect the conclusion of our numerical work. Based on this analysis, 250,000 grids were used for the study of Cavities 2 and 3.

<p>No slip boundary condition was used along the surface of the roller and the web. Since the ink transfer process under consideration is open to the atmosphere, a uniform atmospheric pressure was assumed to be exerted at the inlet and outlet of the numerical domain. For numerical convenience, it was assumed that the computation started from the initial configuration in which the right inner face of the cavity was in the vertical plane (<italic>θ</italic> = 0°). It was assumed that the web was moving at the specified, constant velocity, and the roll was initially rotating at the given rotational speed.</p>
<p>To avoid numerical difficulty along the contact line, a small gap (approximately 20 µm) was placed between the web and the upper most position of the printing roll. Then, the present computation used two cell zones (one zone inside the roll cavity and the other one outside the cavity). The cell zone outside the cavity did not change in time, but the location of the cell zone consisting of the roll cavity did due to the rotation of the roll. Fluxes across the mesh interface were computed using the faces resulting from the intersection of the two interface zones.</p>
<p>Finite volume approach with a SIMPLE algorithm was used to evaluate flow variables and a first-order implicit scheme was used for the time advancement. Convective term was discretized with a second-order upwind scheme.</p>

<p>In R2R applications in printed electronics, the amount as well as the shape of the transferred ink is important. The difficulty of measuring the amount (equivalently, the thickness) of the transferred ink experimentally is mainly due to the limitation in terms of proper instrumentation. Thus, the available but rather scarce measurement data are limited to the shape of the transferred ink. For the purpose of development and proper validation of the numerical methodology at the first stage, this study aims to establish the effects of the various roll patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211435581">Figure 2</xref> in terms of the shape of the transferred ink, which is a very important task for improving the printing quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211435581">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the Carreau model was adopted to represent the shear-thinning effect of conductive ink. It turns out that the typical ratio of the maximum to minimum viscosity can be as much as 100 in the reference numerical configuration with Cavity 1 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211435581">Figure 6</xref>. The lower part of the cavity tends to have higher viscosity where the shear rate is relatively lower. On the contrary, the interface between the web and the cavity where the ink experiences significant distortion is characterized by relatively lower viscosity.

<p>The justification for using a non-Newtonian model was examined for two different cavity shapes with the experimental data. The measurement data for the shape of the transferred ink were obtained from a real R2R gravure printing system equipped with a doctor blade. A driving tension of 2.5 kgf (=24.53 N) was exerted on the film (the PET was manufactured by SKC; the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and density were 5.6 GPa, 0.3, and 1400 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, respectively) of 300 mm width resulting in about 81 N/m loaded on the web. For non-contact measurement of the printed patterns, both an interferometer and a digital video microscope were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211435581">25</xref></sup> The first example has to do with a basic, elementary square cavity (Cavity 1) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>. Two independent computations with the assumptions of constant and variable viscosity were conducted. The contact angle of 60° was assumed hereinafter using the commercial ink data described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211435581">Table 3</xref>. For the computations with the Carreau model, three different values of the surface tension were considered to see if the dynamics of surface tension dominate in this range of dimensions. Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>(d) was obtained with the reference surface tension of 0.06 N/m, which corresponds to the value of the typical metallic ink (Paralec, Inc.) used in this study. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>(d) clearly suggests that the non-Newtonian model better predicts the shape of the measurement data. However, all the computational results produced a reduced wetted area compared with the original target cavity. The reason for this shrinkage is not clear at this moment, but probably the surface tension was involved due to the curvature of the wetted surface.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>(e) to (f) illustrates the effect of surface tension on the shape of the transferred ink. Note that the reference surface tension was set to 0.06 N/m using the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211435581">Table 3</xref>, and two more values, one lower and the other larger than the reference value, were considered. It was found that the size of the transferred ink pattern decreased with the value of the surface tension as expected but the overall shape did not change much compared with the reference result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>(d). The noticeable difference in distortion found in all the edges of the square pattern between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>(c) and (d) was likely to stem from the difference in viscosity since all other parameters remained the same. The non-negligible variation in the viscosity estimated by the Carreau model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211435581">Figure 8</xref> suggests that the adoption of the non-Newtonian fluid model is indeed crucial in the prediction of the transferred ink shape.

<p>Another validation was performed for the more complex shape shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211435581">Figure 9</xref>. This cross-sectional pattern has practical importance due to its frequent appearance in various electronic circuits. The main issue in this configuration is severe distortion in the central region where two lines intersect. Even accepting the instrumentation difficulty, it is obvious that the measurement data exhibit considerable distortion in the cross-sectional region. In addition to this distortion, the measurement data show non-negligible non-uniformity in the transferred ink distribution. Again, the numerical result obtained with the Carreau model reproduced the characteristics of the measurement data better. A part of this success of the Carreau model is believed to be linked to the fact that the spatial variation of the viscosity, which is believed to be the primary fluid property, is correctly captured. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211435581">Figure 10</xref> where the calculated viscosity distribution is shown, it is noted that the viscosity in the central region is quite reduced and thus, a significant viscosity gradient develops in the web moving direction. It is also noted that due to the effect of convection in the direction of web movement, symmetry does not exist about the center point. The presence of reduced viscosity, in turn, is thought to lead to the occurrence of a reduced line width in the calculation as well as in the observed discontinuity of the measurement data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211435581">Figure 9</xref>. In fact, the improvement obtained through the Carreau model seems to be reasonable considering our previous results under the Newtonian assumption,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211435581">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211435581"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211435581">19</xref></sup> which shows that the characteristics of the ink transfer process significantly vary with the magnitude of the viscosity. Since the simulation results with these two different cavity shapes compared favorably with the measurement data, it was assumed that the present numerical methodology with the Carreau model was reasonably able to capture important physical features of the ink transfer process.

<p>More complex but still tractable patterns, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211435581">Figure 2</xref>, in comparison with the patterns considered in earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211435581">17</xref></sup> were considered for a higher degree of realistic relevance to practical R2R processes in the area of printed electronics. One can examine how the transferred ink pattern differently evolves in time through transient simulations with the cavity shapes given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211435581">Figure 11</xref>. Since the web moving speed was set to 6 mpm (=0.1 m/s) for all the situations, the instants <italic>t</italic> = 0.01 and 0.02 s correspond to rotations 2.30° and 4.60°, respectively, of the printing roller in this figure. The result with the reference, namely, Cavity 1, is consistent with the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>(d). In other words, both distortion and shrinkage of the transferred ink pattern persist as time progresses. As the cavity moves away from the uppermost location of contact between itself and the web where ink transfer initiates, the change in shape of the transferred ink continues.
<fig id="fig11-0954406211435581" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Effect of the shape of the cavity on the transferred ink shape at three different representative times at <italic>t</italic> = 0.000, <italic>t</italic> = 0.010 and <italic>t</italic> = 0.020 s, respectively. (a) Cavity 1, (b) Cavity 2, and (c) Cavity 3.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211435581-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Qualitatively similar behaviors also could be found for both Cavities 2 and 3. The simulation with Cavity 2 shows that the overall shape of the pattern is not conserved well in that the dimension of the outer square shrinks a bit, as exhibited in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211435581">Figure 11</xref>(b). In addition to this geometric distortion, it is also noted that the ink distribution is not uniform. Another shape, namely, the pattern in Cavity 3, again yields qualitatively similar results. That is, the shape of the pattern is not conserved very well because of the noticeable reduction in the line thicknesses, which becomes more salient in the region where two lines intersect. This observed disparity between the target pattern to be engraved on the surface of the printing roll and the actual pattern transferred on the web is a direct reason for the difficulty in acquiring the minimum conductivity. At present, it is believed that there are at least several additional parameters such as the web moving speed and surface tension of the ink that directly affect the degeneration of printing quality but insufficient investigations have been done in this area. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211435581">Figure 7</xref>(d) to (f), the surface tension should be considered an important fluid property but it did not change the overall shape considerably for a width of 500 µm. Thus, the qualitative behavior shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211435581">Figure 11</xref> is not expected to change much depending on the value of the surface tension.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0954406211435581"><title>Effect of the web handling speed</title>
<p>As the web handling speed increases, the time allowed for contact between the web and the ink delivered by the cavity decreases. This reduction in the time-scale is likely to limit the time required for the action of the viscous force, which has a diffusive nature. To understand the effect of the reduced contact time, the first investigation was conducted for the reference, i.e. Cavity 1. Since the web moving speed varies, the elapsed times were adjusted for each simulation for the purpose of detecting the shape of the transferred ink at the given translational location of the web, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211435581">Figure 12</xref>. The shape of the transferred ink changed with the web moving speed even for this relatively simple cavity shape but no exaggerated distortion was noticeable with the moving speed. Obviously, the rounded shape indicates that surface tension has an effect for this geometry. To check if any unexpected problem associated with a higher web moving speed arises, more complex shapes, namely, those of Cavities 2 and 3, also were investigated.

Qualitative features such as the shape of the pattern and distribution of the ink remained unchanged.

<p>Regarding the investigation of three different cavity shapes, it is conjectured that the effect of reduced contact time between the ink and the web is not of prime importance in this range of web handling speed, namely, up to 30 mpm (=0.5 m/s). As mentioned earlier, at present the R2R process speed is limited by the time required for the subsequent drying and curing processes in the area of printed electronics; therefore, a speed higher than 30 mpm (=0.5 m/s) was not attempted here but systematic future study will be required to see if a much higher speed significantly aggravates the printing quality.</p>

<p>In the present numerical study, a non-Newtonian model that describes the shear-thinning behavior of real conductive ink more realistically was incorporated to investigate the ink transfer process for R2R applications. To make the present analysis more relevant to real operational conditions, the coefficients of the Carreau model were determined using information on commercially available conductive ink, and the web moving velocity was matched to that of typical operational conditions in the related printing industry.</p>
<p>A comparison of the simulated results with the measurement data indicates that the Newtonian assumption is likely to introduce a sizable error that may lead to an inaccurate prediction of the ink transfer process. An inherent defect of the Newtonian model is its inability to predict the viscosity variation that is associated with a varying shear rate that can be quite large in R2R printing systems with metallic ink.</p>
<p>In addition to the effect of the viscosity, the surface tension appears to play a role to some degree in the formation of the transferred ink on the web. The experimental evidence that a rounded shape formed on the web in the case of Cavity 1 indicates that the role of surface tension may be increasingly important for widths well under 100 µm, suggesting the complexity of the ink transfer process in the case of vanishingly small line width. With the intention of separating the effect of variable viscosity from that of surface tension, which is one of the important objectives of this study, the minimum size or width of the cavity was chosen in the vicinity of 100 µm. The results with more complex printing patterns than in the reference square cavity showed the problem of non-uniformity and shrinkage of the transferred pattern. These shortcomings revealed that circuit formation with the R2R process at present stage hardly competes with highly precise conventional silicon electronics; thus, many more fundamental studies are required for the reliable design of R2R process lines.</p>
<p>The need for increased web moving velocity is directly linked to the cost-effectiveness of the process. It turned out that up to 30 mpm (=0.5 m/s), which is still much lower than that in the conventional paper printing industry, significant additional distortion in the transferred ink did not develop. Thus, the convection effect apparently does not change the dynamic aspect of the situation in this range of the speed.</p>
<p>Noting our earlier results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211435581">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211435581"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211435581">19</xref></sup> which primarily showed that a larger viscosity tends to produce better quality in terms of the transferred ink shape and that the contact angle played a much less significant role than the viscosity, one of the most effective ways of improving the printing quality has to do with controlling the fluid properties at the step of ink formulation instead of modifying the pattern shape. Another obstacle for complete analysis is the complication resulting from the tension and elasticity of the web: deflection of the web may cause unexpected defects in the case of very thin lines. Thus, the present numerical methodology will be extended to include the dynamic behavior of the web through the fluid–structure interaction technique in the future.</p>
