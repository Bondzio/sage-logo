<p>Having just finished reading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0196859912445067">Thomas Streeter’s (2011a)</xref> new book, <italic>The Net Effect: Romanticism, Capitalism, and the Internet</italic>, when the news of Steve Jobs’ passing broke I couldn’t help but wonder how Streeter’s argument about the mythic American narrative of entrepreneurs could help us to understand the outpouring of media eulogies that remembered him as a visionary entrepreneur, a hero, and a genius who changed the world. To better understand the media memory and posthumous celebration of Steve Jobs as well as a host of other recent issues such as the digital labor debates and the SOPA/PIPA bills I contacted Thomas Streeter. The following interview, conducted by email, documents our conversation on those issues and other topics discussed in <italic>The Net Effect</italic>.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Hye Jin Lee (Lee):</speaker>
<p>Let me start off with a question on the title of your book, <italic>The Net Effect</italic>. Because the term <italic>effect</italic> is in the title it gives a sense that the book is going to be about the <italic>effect</italic> of the Internet on society or people (a la technological determinism). Rather, your book focuses on demonstrating how technology—the Internet—is a social construction, a product of social vision, desire, and values. What <italic>effect</italic>, then, were you trying to create with the title of your book?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Thomas Streeter (Streeter):</speaker>
<p>Causality is a tricky business. Simplistic technological determinism is still catnip to journalists, cyber-pundits, and many educational administrators, so I do make a point in the book of detailing what’s wrong with looking at the Internet as if it fell from the sky fully formed: the Internet as we know it embodies a series of social choices, not something inherent in packet-switched digital communication itself. But I try to take it beyond that basic argument. The world is different now than it was in 1990, and you can’t tell the story of all the complicated historical changes of the last thirty years without at some point talking about the Internet. The Internet has clearly made a difference, in some complex sense of that term. That’s why we get all the interesting discussion about affordances, agency theory, and so on. I’m a committed and full-throated social constructionist, but I don’t think that gets me off the hook of causality.</p>
<p>So in the title I want to signal that I <italic>am</italic> talking about effects, if not in the usual way that people imagine effects. My argument is that the “effect” of the Internet is in the making of it. I look at key stages in its development in historical context, look at the ways that folks made social choices in the context of responding to specific problems and concerns, while tackling events through values, feelings, and political visions—and then discuss ways in which all that activity shaped history, in the conjunctural sense. If we want to understand the effect of that complex set of phenomena to which we attach the word Internet, we have to grasp it as a set of historical, contingent, and social processes, measured in significance by their productivity, by the ways in which they made a difference. What I end up with is not a generalizable theory of technology for all time, but a case study of a set of technologies peculiar to our times. But I’m happy with that; I’m not sure what the former would get us, even if it could be achieved.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>In <italic>The Net Effect</italic> you stress how technology is shaped by social visions and collective activities rather than through an individual effort. This is a point you made in your previous book, <italic>Selling the Air</italic>, as well, although the focus was on the U.S. commercial broadcasting and the role corporate liberalism played in the organization of commercial media. In your new book you look into various conflicting visions that shaped the construction of computer technology, but mostly on the American cultural tendency to romanticize technology. How did you come to see the connection between romanticism and the Internet technology, especially when romanticism is largely associated with irrationality and antitechnology?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>Romanticism is just one of the threads at work in all this—I still think corporate liberalism matters, and I also talk about various kinds of utilitarianism, neoliberalism, etc. That said, the word romanticism does a lot of work in my book. Much of the reason I was drawn to it initially was because it undercuts the plague of “presentism” in discussions of the Internet, the millennial reasoning that frames everything in terms of a radical break from the past, the assertion that the Internet represents the dawning of a new age (and implies that if you don’t think so, you’re some kind of dinosaur who doesn’t get it). Romanticism, as an “-ism,” is a tradition, something learned and historical. But it’s a specific tradition that includes within it the discourse of the dramatic break with the past, the gesture of throwing off the shackles of tradition; so I find using the word romanticism helps short-circuit the seductions of presentism. But I found that when you really try to define romanticism more precisely—not an easy thing—it holds up as an explanation of what’s going on. Of course, the word is used in many different ways. In American studies, Leo Marx’s “technological sublime” is an important precedent, and like many in that field I find Ralph Waldo Emerson to be a useful distillation of a key trend in U.S. culture. But in the book I push the term in a sociological direction, where it’s not something that’s simply embodied in certain authors, certain texts, or a collection of myths and symbols, but is something more like what Raymond Williams called a structure of feeling. Friedrich Kittler’s reframing of romanticism in <italic>Discourse Networks</italic> and the Weberian notion of disenchantment that comes with modernization are also useful. From these and others, I took the idea that romanticism is best understood not for what it claims but for how it is used in practice.</p>
<p>All that said, romanticism never stands on its own. It is always a reaction to something, specifically a reaction to aspects of industrial society. So the supposedly antitechnological moments in romanticism, the celebrations of nature against the modern, for example, in both the original British romantic poets and in the 1960s counterculture, have to be understood in the larger context of modernity. Romanticism only makes sense in a technologically enveloped world. Fred Turner makes a similar point about how many of the same folks who advocated the “new communalism,” for example, going off to live in communes in the 1960s, ended up celebrating the microcomputer and the Internet in the 1980s and 1990s. The key gesture is that of creating a radically new kind of community that marks a grand, more authentic break from alienating modern institutions; whether the new community is in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas or in online digital communities, it turns out, is a detail (especially when the core logic of the discourse is so idealist it lacks any detailed understanding of material social structures).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>I wonder if we can use that argument to explain why the dystopic notion of cyberspace outlived the utopian concept of information superhighway in the popular usage in the 1990s to describe the Internet. You talk about this a bit in your book but what was it about the notion of cyberspace that made it more appealing (than information superhighway) at the time?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>The short answer is that the term <italic>cyberspace</italic> was romantic, not utopian. John Perry Barlow got the term from William Gibson, and Gibson’s <italic>Neuromancer</italic> portrays a rather dystopic world in which cyberspace offers a thrilling escape from an oppressive “meatspace,” where the hero has dramatic adventures while connected with computers, single-handedly taking on great powers in the world (while of course getting involved with a beautiful girl). The triumphs of cyberspace, like those of romanticism, are triumphs of the self, not of the social. The great trope is to construct computing as an alternate <italic>space</italic>, as entering a new world rather than as a way of dealing with the existing one, to which Barlow (and then eventually the likes of Newt Gingrich) could apply the frontier metaphor, that other great organizing cultural construct of American capitalism.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>It seems like we can’t discuss American romanticism with computers without talking about America’s fascination with entrepreneurial success stories (and romantic notion of American capitalism). Not only in this book but also in <italic>Selling the Air</italic> you talk about how American culture has a hard time acknowledging inventions as a result of structural contribution and opt to talk about them through tales of an individual entrepreneur whose hard work, ingenuity, and daring risk-taking brought success. Why is this storytelling particularly persistent in America?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>Why are Americans so consistently drawn towards framing everything in individualist terms? That’s a big question. What I contribute to the question is the observation that the entrepreneurial success story is not one thing—it is not a single coherent ideology. Individualism has different forms, which have historically shifting but significant relations to each other. I focus mostly on two: the utilitarian form, the notion of the individual as a calculating marketplace actor, and the romantic form, where the entrepreneurial individual is construed as expressive and inspired, as in a certain sense nonrational. Part of what keeps entrepreneurial individualism potent is the way that the culture, and individuals within it, can move back and forth between those variations. But I think the early days of open source software illustrate that the romantic form doesn’t always pull in a capitalist direction. That’s also why I think it is important not to simply dismiss individualism as false consciousness. Positive social movements can and have drawn effectively on romantic individualism at times. What’s important in the first instance, politically speaking, is to note the differences between one form and the other.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>I wonder if the American romantic habit of thought can be translated to other countries that have different historical, cultural contexts. I ask this because I’ve read stories about China’s obsession with searching for its own Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg or finance specialists in Korea advising capital market players to invest in companies that are influenced by countercultural ethos like Google (“Don’t be evil”) or Apple (“Think Different”).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>That’s an absolutely fascinating question to which I wish I had the answer. It was intriguing that the Internet filled up with images of Chinese young people lighting incense sticks to mourn the death of Steve Jobs. I can imagine how various romantic constructions might be appealing in societies where folks are looking for ways out of the strictures that constrain them—in China, as an alternative to the strictures of family dominated businesses, the Party hierarchy, etc. But part of why I feel confident about the arguments in <italic>The Net Effect</italic> is that I have a lot of local knowledge, which is necessarily American. I was a kid in the 1960s thumbing through the <italic>Whole Earth Catalog</italic>. Ralph Waldo Emerson walked the streets of my town (Burlington, Vermont) and you can still hear his habits of thought echoing in the words of my students, in city council meetings, and when you go to the local Unitarian Universalist Church (where the man himself may have given a sermon or two). I was acquainted with Larry Lessig just at the time that he dropped Foucault and embraced a kind of romantic discourse—I don’t know if that’s how he’d put it, but I think that characterization is sustainable—and then in so doing he emerged on the national stage as the leading scholar of “cyberlaw.” To talk intelligently about how this works outside the U.S., I’d need a lot more local knowledge, a lot more <italic>Verstehen</italic>, before I’d be willing to make any claims of the type I make in <italic>Net Effect</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>Since you brought up Steve Jobs and the public commemoration of him after his death let’s talk about that a little bit. I thought the way the mainstream media commemorated Jobs—as an innovator, a genius, an entrepreneur who changed the world—was a good indication of America’s fascination with and romantic vision of computers and entrepreneurialism. What was your take on the media commemoration of Steve Jobs and what does the way the media commemorated him say about American cultural values about entrepreneurialism and technology?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>Indeed it was interesting. It kind of confirmed my argument in <italic>The Net Effect</italic> that there has emerged, within the legitimatory apparatus of capitalism, a romantic alternative to the original utilitarian construction of the idealized capitalist individual. Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Edison would not have approved of the fact that Steve Jobs dropped out of college and took LSD to find himself. But Emerson would have. There were some specific conditions inside the media fueling it all: the easy availability to reporters of Job’s 2005 Stanford Commencement Address, ripe for providing pithy quotes; the timing of the release of Isaacson’s biography; etc. But once launched, it went well beyond that. It’s easy to poke holes in much of what was said: he didn’t actually invent much, he was more a manager and a designer, there were other important folks who actually did invent stuff like Dennis Ritchie whose passing was ignored last year, and of course Apple Inc. is not just some kind of art studio, it’s also about exploitive factories in Asia, and so forth. But it’s important to me that many ordinary people found the whole story deeply moving and inspiring in different ways. If one’s analysis of the moment is just dismissive, you miss something. I think people were particularly drawn to the story, carefully cultivated by Jobs during his lifetime and echoed in the media, of someone who rebelled and then triumphed because he followed his dreams instead of sticking with the norm; it’s a story of capitalism with integrity, a dream of a capitalism where subjective experience and objective structures fit, where hearts and minds are squared with how lives unfold. And it’s orthodox Emersonian romantic individualism. If progressive change is going to come, I think you have to take those feelings seriously, while providing a different analysis of how to address them. I’ve written a bit about this,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0196859912445067">1</xref></sup> and hope to investigate it some more.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>I’ve read that piece and it got me thinking about the role “personality” or “character” of an entrepreneur plays in shaping our understanding of technology. You talk about this in <italic>The Net Effect</italic> as well, especially in the section on the Microsoft problem and your statement about resentment against Microsoft being uniquely personalized against the company’s founder, Bill Gates, who represented everything that computer technology should not be, especially from the romantic point of view: uncreative, controlling, and traditional. On the other hand, the public adoration of Apple cannot be disconnected from the feeling of love that people have with Steve Jobs who exuded “coolness,” “youthfulness” and a sense of “rebellion” with his trademark jeans and black turtleneck rather than a suit. How much of the “personality” or “style” of Steve Jobs played a role in the public acceptance of Apple’s vision of the computer technology (and its vision for the future)? Or for that matter, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>I would rephrase your question just a bit to say that romantic individualism encourages us to <italic>narrate stories</italic> of technological development using a discourse of distinct personalities. I’m not sure Zuckerberg is really all that unique as a person, but the point is that the culture is in love with the idea that he is, with the notion that his wealth and success somehow springs from his personal uniqueness. There’s a scene in <italic>The Social Network</italic> where he goes into a meeting with venture capitalists in his pajamas and makes wildly extravagant demands. If you’ve been following the industry, you’d know that if the real Zuckerberg actually did something like that, he would be following something of a script. The grey flannel suit disappeared a few generations ago, and in certain contexts the Byronic gesture has become its own formulaic cliché. It was in the 1970s when Ted Nelson, Stewart Brand, and others first took ideas that came from the likes of Licklider and Engelbart and reframed those ideas in romantic terms. And this involved among other things putting yourself in the story, a version of yourself that was a passionate, imperfect, expressive individual, not some kind of rational calculator or idealized manager. Back in the ‘70s it was still sort of a modest cult, not picked up by the mainstream. By the 1980s, though, when the twenty-something Steve Jobs found himself a sudden multimillionaire and at the top of an exploding high tech corporation, he took all those stories that he’d heard in the wake of the 1960s counterculture—I’d heard them, too, I’m his age—and began the process of constructing himself along those lines, with a lot of help from an eager technology media (particularly in those days, the magazines). And by the 1990s, when the publicist for the newly founded Netscape corporation decided the best way to sell the company was by foregrounding the disheveled programmers, Marc Andreessen especially, the scripts were already available—Steven Levy’s <italic>Hackers</italic> was well known—but needed to be articulated with the idea of the Internet, which in 1992 was still just an experiment. With the help of <italic>Wired</italic>, the effort was wildly successful. So by the time Zuckerberg entered Harvard around 2002 as an undergraduate, it was all already a well-tested, decades-old formula.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>I think that decades-old formula or the scripts that you talk about also played a significant role in transforming “geekiness” into “coolness” (as the coinage of the term “geek-chic” indicates), which has had a huge impact in laying out the labor conditions of the Internet economy. You do briefly talk about how the “cool” factor of working in the computer communication industry has encouraged many young people to willingly work under poor working conditions (low payment, insecure employment status, and so on) but that issue wasn’t explored in-depth. Scholars such as Andrew Ross, Angela McRobbie, Nick Dyer-Witheford, and Tiziana Terranova have written extensively on this issue but I think your “technological romanticism” framework (especially on the connection between “computers” and “coolness”) could have added another layer in understanding this issue.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>You are correct that the literature involving Terranova etc., which I mention only briefly, is very important, because it foregrounds the huge issue of the definition and understanding of labor, both as it gets narrowly defined and constructed in various capitalist contexts and in the larger sense as a conceptual tool for analyzing how we as a society make our world. I do say in the book that I think there’s a danger in acting astonished about the fact that people will do work for its own satisfactions that then gets exploited by others for profit: feminists pointed out back in the 1970s that this is actually going on all the time all around us every time a homemaker changes a diaper or organizes a PTA meeting. You don’t want to define every nonwaged bit of labor as automatically exploitive; David Hesmondhalgh has written about some of this. Part of what’s striking about the context of computing is that there turns out to be a lot of nonwaged labor <italic>even</italic> in the male-dominated world of computer engineering, right at the heart of a zone that free market enthusiasts have imagined to be a kind of capitalist ideal type. As for the whole phenomenon of “cool”—Alan Liu has that interesting book about it<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0196859912445067">2</xref></sup>—it overlaps with but is probably a bit different than the romantic self- construction that I talk about. During the 1990s stock bubble, my undergraduate students would head off to Silicon Valley in full knowledge that the whole thing was built on a fantasy; they just reasonably thought they might as well get their piece of it before the bubble popped. I wonder if “cool” is perhaps a survival strategy for living in a world where your bosses are crazy, but they have the money. In any case, my hunch is that there’s much to be learned by going back to the feminist/Marxist debates about labor here. I’ve just started reading Melissa Gregg’s <italic>Work’s Intimacy</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>While we’re at the subject of labor, let’s talk about the issue of voluntary labor or free labor as Terranova would say it. I’m particularly interested in how the open source movement became a popular business model once it was shown that open source software can be profitable and compatible with proprietary software and how the vision of free and open distribution of software (nonproprietary, nonpatent) by figures such as Richard Stallman (a classic proponent of the distinction between open source and free software) has become incorporated into a corporate mechanism, especially in extracting value out of voluntary/free labor.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>First, I don’t think capitalism has ever or will ever exist without a lot of “free labor” happening somewhere. The feminist domestic labor debates, the tradition of economic sociology going back to Polanyi, and some strains of Marxism—all these have long offered what I think is an empirically well-supported picture of capitalism as something that involves a lot of “extracapitalist” effort just to get markets off the ground, whether it’s organizing and stabilizing efforts through government regulation, the legal system’s use of the coercive power of the state to create property relations, the limiting of competition through corporate oligopoly structures, child rearing through the patriarchal family, etc. (Or as economists like to joke among themselves, “Free markets are a good idea. We should try them some time.”) In a broad sense, free labor is what you and I are doing right now; neither of us will get paid a cent, even indirectly, for our efforts in this interview. It’s not the revolution, but it’s not exploitation, either. We do it just because it helps advance the discussion, the field, to which we are committed. That’s a routine feature of human social life.</p>
<p>So, what was striking about the open source moment was not that it was a new mode of production, but, at the very center of dotcom stock bubble, right at the height of the neoliberal hegemony that imagined everything through the lens of markets, there was Linux poking a hole in the whole edifice from right of the middle of the picture. At another moment in history, such arguments and practices might have seemed completely unremarkable (e.g., in the 1940s in the United States, fresh from the collective moment of the war effort). While Terranova’s point that open source software production is often exploited is an important corrective to the hype—I think her famous essay<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0196859912445067">3</xref></sup> is a tour de force—I think eventually you have to take it beyond saying, “aha! You say freedom but it’s actually exploitation!”</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>The issue of digital labor would not have been possible without the cultural understanding of computers as a “playful” tool. In your book you point out Joseph Licklider and Douglas Engelbart as two key figures who first showed the potential of computers as tools for play (“self-motivated exhilaration” of interactive computing). But this social meaning of computing came to really develop in the 1970s with Ted Nelson and his book, <italic>Computer Lib</italic>, that provided a new framework for understanding computers as tools for play and self-expression and demonstrated how the means and the ends of computing could be separated. But I wonder if the idea of the convergence between the means and an end in the “playful” computer use continues to hold today when the playful use of computers (the interactive play) has been reconceived as a means for further work/labor (especially in the new economy with the mantra, “work as play” or “playbor”)?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>Yes, I talk about Licklider and Engelbart, not necessarily because they were genius inventors, but because you can see in each of their careers a struggle to justify, from within the managerially dominated ways of thinking of their time, using computers in a way where the use was open ended rather than strictly instrumental. They wanted to interact with computers in a non-ends-directed way, and went through some interesting contortions to come up with an explanation of why that would be a good thing. Licklider cited Poincaré: “The question is not, ‘What is the answer?’ The question is, ‘What is the question?’” Engelbart came up with the elaborate theory of bootstrapping. It wasn’t until the very early 1970s that people like Ted Nelson and Stewart Brand started promoting computing explicitly as art, expression, or play. Today, as you suggest, there’s all these massive efforts to put all that play with computers back in the capitalist bottle, to harness it towards the specific ends of profits, to monetize or commodify it, whether through extending work into private times and places or by using all our online “play” to gather data for advertisers, as Facebook does. That’s a very important set of issues, about which I hope to write some more. But I think one thing I hint at in the book is that the kinds of play at stake here are pretty narrow. The enclosed, compulsive engagement with computers is more like Barthes’ <italic>plaisir</italic>, not <italic>jouissance</italic>. Nor is it like, say, the long, slow, deep satisfactions of nurturing children. There are many ways of being active in the world, of working, creating, playing, relating. A simple work/play dichotomy may get you started, but a full fledged analysis needs to get beyond it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>I wonder why despite the popular commentary that associated microcomputers with playfulness and enchantment in the 1980s microcomputers ended up being used mainly as office machines or for work by the early 1990s. What does the predominant use of microcomputers as office machines say about the American cultural values and desire?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>Well, I do hope that readers pick up my sense of irony about the romantic construction of computers. Part of why the idea that an Apple or IBM PC would set the user free got old was because it was a limited construct in the first place. Reality set in. But more to the point, I think the rise and fall of these kinds of enthusiasms that I chart through the book stand as evidence that the utilitarian idea of the self offered by orthodox economists and by capitalist management is just not enough to live by over the long term. Capitalism is not fully livable on its own terms. People at times need something more, something different, and they will seek it out. One of the primary ways our society has tried to deal with that since the 1960s is to fuse romantic and utilitarian notions of individuality: express yourself, and get rich, too. But we keep finding out, as we did in the 1990s, that that fusion is never more than temporary and incomplete.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>The tropes of the computer counterculture and the romantic entrepreneurial self-concept played a really important role in the Internet explosion of the 1990s. The way the Internet was characterized—youthful, glamorous, free and revolutionary—as well as the hope of getting rich through the technology excited many people that largely led to the Internet bubble in the 1990s. You explain that the Internet wasn’t really just about the technology but rather was the enactment of a hope—a belief in things that could happen. What was it about the Internet that excited the libertarians who believe in the workings of the free market and what role did the romanticized, heroic construction of the Internet have in reviving neoliberalism as you argue in your book?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>I do make a big causal claim: that the 1990s stock bubble is inconceivable without the specifically romantic constructions of computing, that this big global economic event cannot be understood without taking into account culture. And I do argue that all this also played a role in reviving neoliberalism. The culture is not window dressing here, or after-the-fact legitimation of economic forces; it was constitutive. The superstructure turns out to be part of the base.</p>
<p>But to take it to the level of the actual experience of computer use: romanticism constructs desire, not as a simple want to satisfy a need, but as a self-transformative, unfolding process; a desire to desire. Hence the celebration of dreaming as an end in its own right. The early web, upon which the stock bubble was built, was in fact quite slow and impractical as a way to get information, but the early experience of web surfing—clicking from site to site, the losing track of time, the endless “what’s next?”—provided a shared embodied experience that could then be articulated with a romantic thrill of anticipation of the unexpected, and further articulated with any number of social and political imaginaries. Because libertarianism is popular with computer programmers—it reduces life to a formula, and promises to eliminate ambiguity and ambivalence—it is perhaps not surprising that they were the first out of the gate in seizing the exploding Internet phenomenon as their own. And they in turn then encouraged the bizarre claims from those days that the nonprofit, nonproprietary, government-funded Internet was somehow exemplary of the wonders of the unregulated free market.</p>
<p>Around 1990, neoliberalism was on the ropes. Businesses were feeling exhausted and threatened by the effects of Reagan-era deregulation, the high tech industry itself was calling for industrial policy and cooperation with government, the first George Bush was getting beat up in the polls because of the lagging economy; it wasn’t all that clear which way things were going to go. But then, alongside U.S. leadership’s myopic and self-congratulatory misreading of the collapse of the Soviet Union—“we were right, and now they want to follow us”—all this rush of giddy energy around the Internet starting in late 1992 set the stage for the entire leadership structure to fall back on the marketplace mantras, with effects that we are still living with. There were many factors, but I think Internet romanticism was an important piece.</p>

<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>You point out that if <italic>Wired</italic>’s romantic individualist representations of computers were harnessed to the neoliberal market in the early 1990s, the link between computer romanticism and the neoliberal faith in privatization became loose in the late 1990s as evidenced by the rise of the open source movement. The foundational principle of neoliberalism—“more property protection is better”—no longer seemed to be best for capitalism. Am I reading your argument right in understanding neoliberalism as an archaic mechanism that no longer works today, especially since the 2008 financial meltdown?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>It depends on what you mean by neoliberalism. If you mean a philosophy of government that puts enormous faith in privatization and market mechanisms, then of course that set of ideas is still very much alive and powerful; witness the sudden turn to austerity strategy in Europe and to some degree in the U.S. since 2010. But when I began to use the concept of neoliberalism back in the mid-1990s (when it seemed everyone else in cultural studies was interested in resistant readings, postmodernism, and maybe postcolonialism), it wasn’t just a popular political philosophy, it was COMPLETELY taken-for-granted in the halls of power. Thatcher’s original claim that “there is no alternative” had simply become accepted as true. The more-property-is-better position wasn’t just winning the day; if you tried to argue against it you might as well have been speaking in Pictish. (That was about the same time that legislators, businessmen, Newt Gingrich, and <italic>Wired</italic> were all talking about the Internet as a triumph of the free market.) A desire to account for all that is one of the main things that got me started on this book. And so, for me, neoliberalism is a lot more than just a powerful political economic trend, and certainly a lot more than just, say, a preference for capitalism. It’s a very specific moment in the relationship of political democracies to capitalism, where a certain complex of ideas and practices became absolutely hegemonic. (And I think that sense of neoliberalism is consistent with, for example, David Harvey’s brief history.)</p>
<p>And it is in that more concrete historical sense that I think things are much more fluid and chaotic right now in terms of how people imagine the relationship of governance, culture, and markets and capitalism. Globally, the Chinese/Singapore model is gaining influence every day, and whatever it is, it’s not neoliberal, it’s much more corporatist. Quite dramatically, Keynesianism rose from the dead overnight in 2008, and while it’s contested it’s certainly not off the table. I’m afraid that in cultural studies, “neoliberalism” became everyone’s favorite totalizing construct just at the moment that it started to loose it’s coherence around 2002, and I suspect we’d do well to be much more specific in how we analyze connections between the economic, the political, and the cultural. If everywhere you look you see neoliberalism, you may not be looking hard enough.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>You talk about the issue of net neutrality in your book as it was a particularly hot topic at the moment of your writing. The SOPA (the Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (the Protect IP Act) bills that Congress drafted to enforce intellectual property and discourage copyright infringement are the most recent hottest Internet issue. This battle over SOPA/PIPA bills was widely interpreted as a fight between the entertainment industry and the web-based companies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0196859912445067">4</xref></sup> Internet companies mobilized the public to oppose the bills and when the bills were defeated some celebrated as a victory of the “people power” and a romantic triumph of the “Internet freedom.” This celebration seems to obscure the Internet companies’ self-interest in opposing the bills. What are your thoughts on the whole SOPA/PIPA battle?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>For me, one of the interesting things is that we would not even be able to have these fights without the discursive success of the open source movement in the 1990s, which was able to disarticulate popular understandings of freedom from the archetype of property relations. You’re absolutely correct that Google and friends have an economic interest driving their activities. But I think Google wouldn’t have been able to be populist about it (save the open Internet!) without the previous decade of open source romanticism. The point is that self-interest gets exercised in discourse, and the particularities of discourse have their own relatively autonomous influence on things that can’t be reduced to that self-interest. The fact that Google has an economic interest in all this does not tell you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>That said, there’s romanticism on all sides. Some of us in Vermont are racking our brains to see if we can figure out a way to change our own Senator Pat Leahy’s mind on this; he’s been on the Hollywood side of this for decades and took the lead with many of these things starting with the Copyright Term Extension Act in the ‘90s. But he’s no orthodox neoliberal. He genuinely and deeply believes that people have a right to their own artistic expression, and that he’s just trying to support their creativity. There’s also managerial logic and some low-flying technological determinism being thrown around by all sides. But in the end, while these battles are well worth fighting, I hope we can all keep an eye on the longer term, and figure out ways to articulate these immediate issues with questions of, for example, economic democracy.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>There are many claims about the future of the Internet including what the enclosure of the commons would do to the Internet. One of the interesting pieces I read recently was Michael Hirschorn’s article<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0196859912445067">5</xref></sup> on the new economic model of the app and pricing plan and what this means for the future of the Internet. Hirschorn’s argument is that the shift of the digital frontier from the web will make the online space more proprietary and threaten digital freedom. I wonder what you think about Hirschorn’s argument, especially as we see how tablet computers and smart phones are becoming more popular today.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>I just took a quick look at the piece, and he’s of course right that there are important questions of political control and power embedded in the maneuverings and policies of cell phone companies, Apple, etc. But he frames his narrative through what he calls a “radical shift” from the good old, heroic open days of the early web, compared to a present looming, closed evil world of cell phone apps and metered access bearing down on us. It’s understandably tempting to frame things in that kind of millennial way, between a heroic past of openness and a looming crackdown that’s just around the corner; it’s attention grabbing and vivid. To me, though, it all seems like an ongoing struggle. Things have been a complex and shifting mix of open and closed, to various degrees, all along. Before the smart phone took off, in the mid-2000s, the phone companies were all trying to do something much more closed, and sell us bits of video straight to our cell phones for substantial fees. The iPhone’s direct access to YouTube put the kibosh on that idea, and they had to sell us phones that gave us access directly to the Internet, rather than to whatever content they chose to put up for us.</p>
<p>I mean, yes, if you need to be melodramatic to get attention in the press or in politics, go ahead, that’s fine. Put up a website called “free the iPhone.” But as scholars, I hope we can put things in a larger context. It’s one thing to point to some phenomenon on the Internet, copyright laws or cell phone pricing policies or whatever, and say to people, “that may look like a technical issue, but actually there are some important political questions at stake.” But it’s another to say that that phenomenon is <italic>the</italic> issue, that the Internet is everything, that freedom writ large is at stake in every policy issue on the Internet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0196859912445067">6</xref></sup> In the book I quote Yochai Benkler cautioning that there’s an “extravagance of saying this is about freedom.”</p>
<p>So I’m interested in connecting these struggles about copyright, access, and so forth to long-standing political and social questions. What do we do about the tendency of capitalism to accumulate, about the problem of monopoly, about the tension between democracy and heavily concentrated wealth? How do we achieve genuine economic, cultural, and political democracy? The last 40 years of Internet development offer a rich store of object lessons that can help us pursue answers to those questions and make them vivid (largely because of the historical peculiarities of how the Internet appeared on the scene, more than anything inherent to the technology itself). You can hardly talk about pursuing democracy today without referring to the Internet. Explaining why that is the case in a nondeterminist way is in some sense what my book is about. But at some point we’ve got to put this all back into the big picture—it’s not cyberspace vs. meat space, it’s all one, human space, a place of blood sweat tears and imagination—and get on with the job of tackling those big questions, even if they’re old ones.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>One of the things that I thought about after reading your book was the relationship between the geographical shift of the computer technology industry (from East to West) and the cultural shift in the understanding of computers. Silicon Valley in California and Route 128 in Massachusetts (regions around Boston area) are considered to be two premiere sites that have brought the development of computer technology but whereas the computer business in California’s Silicon Valley continued to flourish business along Route 128 has declined significantly in the 1990s. Why did one area fail to tap into the information revolution whereas the other gathered steam and became the center of computer technology?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>That’s a very interesting question about spatial relations, culture, and industrial capitalism. I can’t say I have a complete answer. Of course, what’s happened is that the management and R&amp;D of digital high tech has gradually shifted some of its weight from east to west coast, but these have to be understood as loci within in an international system of manufacture, where the dramatic shift has been towards Asia, both in terms of factory labor, but also much of the engineering work as well. That said, the fact is that the initial frameworks for imagining digital computers—as calculating and management machines, more or less—came out of the post–World War II Fordist era, where the intellectual centers were places like MIT and Harvard. That system had its limitations—for example, an oblique understanding of the role of pleasure and desire in human thought—and the West coast’s more romantic take, for all its sloppiness, enabled a different focus that discovered some new possibilities. It’s possible to make too much of this shift, though. The venture capitalists that got Facebook off the ground—they played as much a role in distinguishing Facebook from Myspace or Friendster as anything Zuckerberg came up with on the design side—didn’t have to be in California or be taking LSD to do what they did.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>You point out how despite the flourishing experimental artistic community in New York it was the San Francisco-based counterculture community that provided a more popular understanding of computers. What was it about the culture of San Francisco or the West that had more impact on the countercultural understanding of computing and why despite the role New York’s Silicon Alley has played in building up the Internet economy didn’t you talk much about this area in your book?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>I grew up in the Midwest, and back then we could either look East or West for a sense of where things were really going on, because believe you me, the dying industrial town of Cleveland Ohio did not feel like the center of anything. The East Coast had a lot of fascinations, but it was often against a backdrop of foundation funding, Ivy League Schools, snobbish galleries, and highly exclusive publication outlets like the <italic>New Yorker</italic>. There was a strong whiff of social class in the air even when people were being critical of various dominant ideas. The <italic>Whole Earth Catalog</italic> when it first came out was so different. Deliberately nonglossy, accessible, down-market: it seemed so much more inviting than the arch artistic experiments of the east coast folks. So maybe I still have a soft spot for the populist tone of the counterculture. And I think when Ted Nelson in <italic>Computer Lib</italic> and magazines like <italic>Creative Computing</italic> turned West for their stylistic inspiration and began to put some real effort into being accessible, it made a difference. Looking back, of course, it’s not so simple; Fred Turner has been quite eloquent about the reliance of the New Communalism on charismatic male leaders who were somehow more equal than everyone else.</p>
<p>As for Silicon Alley in New York, maybe that’s a blindspot of the book. I believe Gina Neff<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0196859912445067">7</xref></sup> has a book coming out that looks at some aspects of that. My book stops for the most part around the year 2000, so I don’t talk about Facebook and social media either. Maybe that’s the next book.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lee:</speaker>
<p>Since you mentioned it, what’s your next book about? Could you tell us what project(s) you are currently working on?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Streeter:</speaker>
<p>I wish I knew. I’d like to study a community of computer users who genuinely dislike them. Studying people who love computers—cyberutopians, gamers, programmers—might be becoming too easy, and I worry that focus can reproduce a kind of liberal understanding of the individual that I think we should get beyond. One possibility I’m looking at is the introduction of digital databases to the American legal profession starting in the 1980s, the shift from West Digest to Lexis Nexis. Most lawyers flat out hated computers at the time—it subjected them to the indignities of doing their own typing—and yet it has in significant ways transformed the law. But I’m in the very early stages of that.</p>
