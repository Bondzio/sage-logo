<p>We would like to thank Dr Beardsall and colleagues for their comments on our recently published guidelines. We agree that there are methodological differences between the studies of early insulin infusion that were reviewed, the details of which we provided in Table 9. We did not specifically define <italic>early insulin infusion</italic>, and as used in our guidelines, it is applicable to the introduction of insulin regardless of whether it is used to treat or prevent hyperglycemia. The distinction between these methodologies does not change our recommendation that the risk-to-benefit ratio of continuous insulin infusion among neonates does not seem favorable based on current research.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the early termination of a large randomized controlled trial of early insulin infusion conducted by Dr Beardsall and colleagues are accurately cited in Table 9 of our guidelines as “futility and concern for safety of patients in the early insulin group.” Our additional comments that the trial was discontinued early due to safety concerns stem from the study’s results, which report a significant increase in hypoglycemia in infants with birth weight &gt;1 kg (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and higher mortality at 28 days (<italic>P</italic> = .04) in the early insulin group vs the control group. We regret any lack of clarity surrounding the documented reason for trial termination and appreciate Dr Beardsall’s contributions.</p>
