<p>This issue of <italic>Organization and Environment</italic> (<italic>OAE</italic>) ushers in change on two key dimensions: first, a new editorial team appears on the journal’s masthead, and second, SAGE is developing an agreement with GRONEN (Group of Research on Organizations and Natural Environment) to provide academic sponsorship and a new editorial orientation to the journal. Amid these changes lies a continuity of <italic>OAE</italic>’s core values and operations. Our commitment to publishing rigorous and insightful scholarly research continues, as does our aim of advancing the understanding of sustainability issues around the world.</p>
<sec id="section1-1086026613476520">
<title>The Team</title>
<p><italic>OAE</italic>’s new associate editors are Pascual Berrone (IESE Business School), Nicole Darnall (Arizona State University), Magali Delmas (University of California, Los Angeles), Andrew Griffiths (University of Queensland), Volker Hoffmann (ETH Zurich), Inmaculada Martin-Tapia (University of Granada), Gordon P. Rands (Western Illinois University), and Mike Russo (University of Oregon). All these scholars have distinguished publishing and editorial records, successfully combining rigor and relevance in their academic work. My coeditor-in-chief (Mark Starik, San Francisco State University) and I are delighted to have the opportunity to work closely with these colleagues and are grateful for their willingness to serve <italic>OAE</italic> in that operational role.</p>
<p>A strong editorial review board (ERB) lies at the heart of any scholarly journal. The current 59 members of <italic>OAE</italic>’s 2013 ERB are an excellent collection of continuing members and new appointees. Each ERB member has been selected for his or her dedication to the research field of organizations and environment, and willingness to mentor others by providing developmental and timely reviews. It is particularly gratifying that our ERB involves scholars from 15 different nations. I am very appreciative for their willingness to serve <italic>OAE</italic> in this important leadership role.</p>

<title>The Sustainability Challenges and Our Aspirations</title>
<p>Brundtland Commission released its report titled <italic>Our Common Future</italic> that popularized the term <italic>sustainable development</italic> in 1987(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1086026613476520">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>). Sustainability opportunities and challenges appear to be increasing in frequency and intensity in the 21st century. Addressing global climate disruption, increasing population, massive extinctions of biodiversity-critical species, toxification of nearly two thirds of the planet’s ecosystems, and the scourges of poverty, enslavement, and exploitation, all present sustainability scholars, practitioners, and social leaders with opportunities to analyze our challenges and advance our prospects for a better world.</p>
<p>After several decades of research on the social and environmental degradation of our planet, substantial progress has been made regarding the understanding of the many key relationships between human organizations and the natural environment. However, it is clear that there are still many issues to explore, analyze, and understand. In this context, it is important that we are open to addressing new relevant questions, to conducting more integrated analyses, and to generating more clear and relevant positive impacts of our research in the world.</p>
<p>Each individual decision can improve sustainability through simple actions like changing a light bulb, powering down electronics, using less water, or recycling. However, organizational actions may be more powerful in generating sustainable improvements all around the world. Organizations may combine sophisticated technological equipment, capital, human resources, and objectives to generate multiple activities. The possibility of managing all these resources in an appropriate manner is a crucial dimension to generate real opportunities for a more sustainable future.</p>
<p>As you are no doubt aware, organizational types exhibit great diversity, including large corporations, small and medium enterprises, governments, nongovernmental organizations, international organizations, armed forces, charities, not-for-profit corporations, cooperatives, and research organizations. All of these are collective efforts of people to address specific objectives, and all require interactions with their respective environments. The appropriate management of all these types of organizations involves many different and relevant challenges, but effective organizational management appears imperative in order to move societies to more fully realize our collective sustainable future.</p>
<p>We will need multiple theoretical foundations to understand and analyze why and how organizations are managing environmental issues. Business Management, Sociology, Economics, Psychology, Human Geography, and Biology are only some of the fields with potential to offer theoretical perspectives in order to analyze the management challenges in the sustainable arena. At the same time, it will be also important to maintain flexibility for understanding and contributing to solutions to key practical problems that practitioners, policy makers, consumers, educators, and activists are facing when they try to make sustainable progress.</p>

<title>The <italic>OAE</italic> Evolution and Future</title>
<p>SAGE published its first issue of this journal 26 years ago. The <italic>OAE</italic> first note was written by Paul Shrivastava (one of the founding editors), and its title was “Are We Ready for Another Three Mile Island, Bhopal, Tylenol!” In the first years of <italic>OAE</italic>, the journal published pioneering papers mostly focused on the management of corporate environmental crises. Later, the journal expanded its editorial interest to include multiple other topics related to the connection between organizations and the environment. Management and Sociology have been the two prominent theoretical perspectives in the journal, and in the past 10 years, the journal has emphasized a more critical perspective and published an excellent collection of papers using that approach.</p>
<p>Today, <italic>OAE</italic> is listed in the Social Sciences Citation Index, and its impact factor from the <italic>Journal Citation Reports</italic> in 2011 is 1.1234 (ranked 46 of 89 environmental studies journals). Credit for this success goes to the four past editors of <italic>OAE</italic>—Paul Shrivastava, John M. Jermier, John B. Foster, and Richard York. These editors brought many memorable articles to us. Without their persistence and skill, we would not have this journal to anchor our professional interests.</p>
<p><italic>OAE</italic> will continue to serve as an outlet for the dissemination of scholarly knowledge on organizations and environment. The new editorial team is determined to continue on the positive trajectory laid by its predecessors, and at the same time, we will also try to build and expand on their legacy. Toward this end, we will try our best to provide constructive and timely feedback to all authors who submit their work for publication consideration to <italic>OAE</italic>, regardless of the outcome of the review process. It is not our intention to micromanage the specific theoretical or epistemological perspectives that our contributors use, but it is to ensure a high level of rigor in their methodology and in the potential relevance and focus of their research questions. In fact, the journal should be ready to broaden our community of readers and contributors in order to increase our chances of making a real impact in the world.</p>
<p>We also intend to make progress on further expanding the geographical and demographic reach of <italic>OAE</italic>, while helping our authors achieve the competing (but we hope also complementary) objectives of rigor and relevance in published research. Our main intent is to encourage rigorous explorations and analyses of the connections between the management of organizations and any of the relevant dimensions of sustainability. We believe that both understanding and analysis of this relationship are crucial for a better future. How, and not only what or why, will be relevant in the future of the journal.</p>
<p>To this end, <italic>OAE</italic> encourages all sustainability business, policy, and social and related science researchers to develop and submit theoretical and empirical articles, essays, and reviews in order to focus on where we have been and where we are going and to suggest ways for us to move forward in the future. We are asking contributors to consider all of these challenges through our double-blind peer review process, and we also encourage sustainability scholars to contact either of the coeditors about their potential ideas. Finally, your suggestions for special issues are also most welcome, so please communicate with us to develop new, interesting, and impactful ideas for future <italic>OAE</italic> issues.</p>

<title>Current Issue</title>
<p>This issue of <italic>OAE</italic> provides a first collection of double-blind–reviewed, excellent articles on sustainability management. These articles highlight different perspectives to help readers better understand the complex relations between organizations and environment. The editorial team has explicitly asked the authors to include a detailed review of their topics and a final section suggesting future research questions. We are hopeful that this effort will be useful for other organization and environment scholars.</p>
<p>I want to thank all the authors in this issue for their commitment and effort to providing timely manuscripts for this “very special issue.” Their interest and efforts are especially appreciated given their exemplary record of previous publications. It is a great honor to begin this new time of <italic>OAE</italic> with these excellent authors and articles.</p>
<p>If you are curious to understand any or all of the following questions, you are likely to find this issue of <italic>OAE</italic> a worthwhile read (authors addressing each question are listed in parentheses):</p>
<list id="list1-1086026613476520" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Are new theories of sustainability management needed? What values and scope might they include? (Starik and Kanashiro)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the commitment of venture capitalists to clean energy? Why do they make those commitments and how deep they are? (Marcus, Malen, and Ellis)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How are the consideration of time and space relevant to better understanding the most appropriate ways to deal with organizations and natural environment challenges? Why does the time–space mismatch negatively influence carbon markets? (Bansal and Know-Hayes)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are the relationships between enterprises and their places important for the fostering of sustainable enterprise behaviors? How should they be? Do those enterprises that are physically, socially, and emotionally embedded in a specific place evince better sustainability performance than those that are not? (Kennelly and Shrivastava)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the themes used in the constitution of “Organizational Sustainable Development” discourses in firms? (Tregidga, Kearins, and Milne)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I hope that you will enjoy reading these articles. From a personal perspective, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the community of ONE (Organizations and the Natural Environment) and GRONEN scholars who have provided encouragement, and support in this new orientation of the journal. In particular, my sincere appreciation goes to Mark Starik and Sanjay Sharma for their energy and leadership in this transition, and to the whole editorial team (Andrew, Gordon, Inma, Magali, Mike, Nicole, Pascual, and Volker), who have shared their time and passion to lead the next steps. Different friends and excellent scholars have also offered excellent guidance and orientation about different features of this project, so I especially wish to thank Pramodita Sharma, Magali Delmas, Mike Barnett, and Alfred Marcus for their generous offer of time and advice in the process.</p>
<p>There are also many devoted individuals working hard behind the scenes to ensure the success of the journal. On behalf of all scholars who have benefited from <italic>OAE</italic> over the years, I extend our gratitude to the SAGE’S office staff and especially to Cynthia Nalevanko, Editor of the SAGE Social Sciences Journals.</p>
<p>We all will work hard to fulfill your expectations. We aspire to be the journal of choice for scholars from multiple theoretical backgrounds working on the relevant problems of organizations managing sustainability issues. We will try to do our best to select rigorous research and to disseminate it, not only to other interested scholars around the world but also to the communities of social and business organization practitioners. As such, it is my hope that you will choose to send <italic>OAE</italic> your best organizations and environment research work!</p>
