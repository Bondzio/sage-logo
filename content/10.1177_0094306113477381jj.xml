<p>In 1993, President Clinton signed into law the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), mandating up to three months of <italic>unpaid</italic> leave to care for newborns or other family members. That same year, Norway added to its already generous parental leave policy, a one month of paid leave for fathers to care for a newborn. This is but one of many interesting details in <italic>Care between Work and Welfare in European Societies</italic>, edited by Birgit Pfau-Effinger and Tine Rostgaard. With so many Americans caring for young children and aging parents, this book will resonate as the deficiencies of the American welfare system are starkly illuminated.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the inadequacies of the American welfare system, scholars and care advocates often look at European policies with envy. In doing so, the tendency is to lump these countries together and erroneously assume that the policies of different countries are practically the same, and that these policies are enacted without problems, controversies, or conflicts.</p>
<p>One of the most important contributions of this book is to dispel us of these assumptions, and to offer a more nuanced picture of the differences in policies and programs across European countries. The main theme weaving this collection together is the contradictions that are created and recreated within and between individual groups, cultural attitudes, and institutions with respect to the particular sets of policies and practices related to caring for one’s young and one’s aging members of society. Examining these multi-leveled tensions serves as a necessary caution from idealizing and assuming too much. As such, this collection would be a great addition to advanced undergraduate and graduate coursework in sociology classes on the family, life course/aging, or social policy.</p>
<p>The first five chapters center its comparative analyses of polices on child care and the last five chapters on elder care. There were several different constellations of comparisons—some chapters only compared the Nordic countries, while others compared Nordic country policies with those of Continental, Southern Europe, as well as former Communist countries. While it is important to focus on the two ends of the life cycle, a few articles on disability care would have enriched the book, since care work and its implications for family life occur across the life cycle.</p>
<p>The care deficit created over the last fifty years is the backdrop for discussions raised in this collection. How countries have responded to the mismatch between the care needs of family members and those available to provide the care are highlighted. Throughout the collection the underlying theoretical frame is historical institutionalism, emphasizing <italic>tensions</italic>—how policies that respond to deficits between individuals and institutions, ultimately create new tensions. The authors successfully expose these and the many levels in which they occur: the institutional, professional, and individual.</p>
<p>One interesting example at the institutional level is the cash-for-care scheme, whereby individuals can purchase care services in the home or institutions, a neo-liberal reform reflecting the rhetoric of greater “choice.” Depending upon the specific country context, this is creating more divisions between social classes, and/or reinforcing traditional gendered norms in the family, and/or further contributing to the exploitation of transnational labor. At the professional level, different policies create tensions between home-based workers and those working in care facilities, as well as formal employees and those hired informally through the “grey market.” Differences in working conditions, pay, social status, and overall vulnerability create more tensions, complicated by the increased use of migrant care workers. One key issue unfortunately not explored anywhere in the collection, is the role of labor unions in their efforts to integrate and professionalize care workers. Finally tensions arise out of contrasting cultural attitudes toward what is best for parents in terms of balancing work lives with family care needs, and what is best for child development or the best way to care for one’s aging parents.</p>
<p>If there was one weak strand among some of the articles, it occurred in attempts to pull apart cultural attitudes from structural realities. For example, Chapter Three examines the question as to why, even in the most generous countries, women still do most of the care work? Certainly a reasonable question, given the assumption that cultural attitudes and everyday practices will change once policies are corrected. However, the author suggests that according to the cross-country attitudinal survey data, (perhaps a problematic basis for empirical analysis) many women want to stay home with their children three years and younger as this conforms to definitions of “good parenting.” The article is framed in a way that severs the cultural norms from the institutional apparatus and in doing so, excludes men and creates more questions than it answers. For instance, what are the institutional arrangements that make parental leave desirous? Regardless of the formal policies in place, do men feel pressured to remain at work rather than leave to care for newborns or aging parents? Are women’s desires to “opt-out” a response to less meaningful career and employment possibilities?</p>
<p>Likewise, Chapter Six raises questions over the moral obligations toward elder care: who should do it and where? Should families be supported to care for aging family members in the home or is the care better in outside facilities with trained staff? While it was interesting to read how the work of elder care is organized in different countries, the extent to which these different attitudes are reflections of or responses to policies (or both) is under-theorized.</p>
<p>By contrast, Chapter Four takes a look at child care work in several post-communist countries. The author suggests that cultural attitudes supporting early maternal child care at home are reactions to the negative experiences of communist-style public day care designed to emancipate women from the home. Whereas the transition to market economies has not enabled women to stay home to care for young children, (and in fact, doing so increases their economic insecurity), fertility rates are declining significantly in post-communist countries. Not only does this reveal some interesting tensions, it shows that cultural attitudes may affect institutional arrangements, as much as they can be changed by them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important take-away is that the marketization of care work has ultimately weakened its quality, a truth Americans know only too well. Eliminating or severely diminishing the access to necessary social care, especially for the elderly, has been a consequence of policy changes outlined in the articles. Such neo-liberal policies are often framed in the language of increasing choice. This book aptly demonstrates the limitations of the choice rhetoric and its associated policies. The implications serve as an important signal to our European counterparts, who may see their future in us, should they continue to embrace the woefully deficient market model of care.</p>
