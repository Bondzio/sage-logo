<abstract>
<p>This study examined unit-level associations of nurse staffing and workload, and the effect of the practice environment on adverse patient events. A secondary analysis was conducted of a longitudinal data set of 23 Army inpatient units from the Military Nursing Outcomes Database. Generalized Linear Mixed Modeling accommodated nested, nonparametric data. Staff category was found to be a significant predictor of medication errors and patient falls, but the relationship varied by unit type. Patient census had no effect on either outcome; however, a higher patient acuity was associated with an increase in both adverse events. The nursing practice environment mediated medication errors but not falls, in all unit types. Skill mix is important; however, additional components of staffing need consideration in producing positive patient outcomes.</p>

<p>It has been more than a decade since the publication of the Institute of Medicine’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911407090">2000</xref>) report, <italic>To Err is Human</italic>, provided a wake-up call to the health care community by articulating the system’s serious problem with medical error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911407090">Kohn, Corrigan, &amp; Donaldson, 2000</xref>). Perhaps even more disturbing to leaders in health care who have been aggressive in their attempts to improve the health care system is that little has changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911407090">Leape &amp; Berwick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193945911407090">Nembhard, Alexander, Hoff, &amp; Ramanujam, 2010</xref>). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ) latest Annual Report suggests that quality in hospitals is improving very slowly, and some quality indicators (e.g., hospital-acquired infections) are getting worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911407090">AHRQ, 2009</xref>). Patients continue to suffer adverse events at the hands of health care professionals who are supposed to cure or, at the very least, protect them from harm.</p>
<p>Nurses have always recognized their close ties to patient care quality, but documenting it empirically has been a challenge. However, despite the growth of research on nurse staffing and patient outcomes in the last decade and a half, the evidence linking nurse staffing to adverse outcomes (other than mortality) is less than conclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911407090">Cho, Ketefian, Barkauskas, &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911407090">Donaldson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911407090">Kane, Shamliyan, Mueller, Duval, &amp; Wilt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911407090">Lang, Hodge, Olson, Romano, &amp; Kravitz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911407090">Lankshear, Sheldon, &amp; Maynard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911407090">Needleman, Buerhaus, Mattke, Stewart, &amp; Zelevinsky, 2002</xref>). Researchers have attributed these mixed findings to variation in research methods, to include a wide range of measures of staffing and adverse events, and various risk adjustment techniques, analytic models, and measurement levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911407090">Clarke &amp; Donaldson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407090">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Nursing outcomes databases, such as the American Nurses Association’s National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) and the Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes (CALNOC) recognized early on the need for standardization of measures for valid comparisons. More recently, the National Quality Forum (NQF) has endorsed measures of staffing and some adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911407090">NQF, 2009</xref>). These efforts help ensure comparability among research studies. Risk adjustment is also important in this work and has been explicated very clearly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407090">Lake and Cheung (2006)</xref>. There seems to be a general consensus that analytic models need to take into account the nonindependent nature of studying nurses (or patients) within units and units within hospitals. Although earlier landmark studies have focused on the hospital level (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911407090">Aiken, Smith, &amp; Lake, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911407090">Needleman et al., 2002</xref>), providing a macroview of staffing and outcomes in the aggregate, there is a recognized need for more microsystem, that is, unit-level studies because not all units within a hospital are equally resourced and, therefore, can vary considerably in staffing processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911407090">Disch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911407090">Mohr &amp; Batalden, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945911407090">Sales et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to staffing as a contributor to patient outcomes, researchers have only begun to examine organizational features aside from staffing that may influence adverse events and outcomes. Certain types of nursing practice environments have been associated with good patient care and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911407090">Aiken, Clarke, Sloane, Lake, &amp; Cheney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911407090">Aiken, Havens, &amp; Sloane, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911407090">Friese, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911407090">Friese, Lake, Aiken, Silber, &amp; Sochalski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911407090">Kazanjian, Green, Wong, &amp; Reid, 2005</xref>). Yet, the effects of the nursing practice environment on the staffing–outcomes relationships have not been fully explicated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the exception of several studies conducted within the Veterans Healthcare Administration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945911407090">Sales et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945911407090">2008</xref>), studies about nurse staffing and outcomes have not considered federal hospitals. Very few studies conducted on staffing and patient outcomes in the military health system have been published. The purpose of this article is to examine the influence and relationship of nurse staffing and workload factors on medication errors and patient falls at the unit level between 2003 and 2006 in Army hospitals and to explore the effect of the practice environment on these relationships.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945911407090">
<title>Military Health Care</title>
<p>Health care in the military is delivered via one integrated system known as the Military Healthcare System (MHS). The Army, Navy, and Air Force each have their own medical departments, which are considered subsystems of the MHS. As a whole, the MHS has faced the same resource pressures as civilian hospitals, including shortages of nursing staff and rising costs of health care. As an added system requirement, the MHS has been supporting a nation at war for nearly a decade while providing health care to beneficiary populations (i.e., active duty [AD], active reservists, and retired soldiers and their families) worldwide. The Army Medical Department (AMEDD), one subsystem of the MHS and the medical arm of the Army, strives to provide a seamless chain of care stretching from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan to fixed hospital facilities around the world.</p>
<p>The nursing workforce in military hospitals differs from that of civilian hospitals in composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911407090">Patrician, Shang, &amp; Lake, 2010</xref>). Military hospital staffing combines the following four categories of nursing staff: AD military, Reserve Component (RC) military, Army civilians, and nonfederal contract nurses. The deployment of AD nurses to support military operations and the subsequent mobilization of RC nurses are common features of contemporary military health care staffing. For example, during the study reported here, the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) not only increased the numbers, acuity, and throughput of patients but also necessitated frequent and long deployments of Army medical personnel and increased use of contract staff and RC nurses. In other words, as large numbers of AD nurses have continued to leave their hospital duty assignments to deploy in support of military operations, the staffing deficits have been filled with RC nurses, contract nurses, and reassignments within the facility.</p>
<p>Donabedian’s Health Quality Model, in which the essential core is a balance of health benefits and harm within the three domains of quality, that is, structure, process, and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911407090">Donabedian, 1966</xref>), forms the theoretical foundation in this study. This paradigm presumes a linear relationship, whereby structures affect processes, which in turn affect outcomes. To this model, we have added the context of care. Although processes of care were not explicitly examined in this study, the nursing practice environment is conceptualized as the context within which all processes occur and where care is delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911407090">Mark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911407090">Patrician, Shang et al., 2010</xref>). Structures are embodied by human resources, such as numbers and mix of staff, and workload characteristics, such as census and acuity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911407090">Donabedian, 2003</xref>). These structures combine to create an environment that facilitates or detracts from the processes of care delivery, leading to either positive or negative outcomes. Outcomes in this study are adverse patient events, namely, medication administration errors and patient falls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0193945911407090" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This secondary analysis used data from the Military Nursing Outcomes Database (MilNOD), a multiphase, multisite data collection effort designed to develop a database of nurse and shift-level data related to nurse staffing, effectiveness, and patient safety indicators. A comprehensive description of the MilNOD is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911407090">Patrician, Loan, McCarthy, Brosch, &amp; Davey, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The data used in this study were obtained from two sources. The first was shift-level data set. This data set included measures of staffing and the presence of a medication error or fall on a particular shift, from 2003 to 2006 inclusive. The data were restricted to the four Army hospitals in the continental United States, and their 23 medical-surgical, step-down, and critical care nursing units to control for presumed differences in structural variables, organizational culture, and care delivery processes between the three services. The second data source was an annual survey of direct care staff nurses that assessed the practice environment in addition to demographics, education, and experience levels. The annual survey collected in 2006 was used in this study as it had the most complete data (506 nurses) and highest response rate (30%) when compared with other years and thus was considered more representative of the population. Only the 2006 nurse survey was used to control for the possibility of multiple responses over the years by the same individuals. Personnel education and experience were only used as descriptives; they were not part of the theoretical model for this study.</p>
<sec id="section3-0193945911407090">
<title>Staffing measures</title>
<p>The original staffing variables that were obtained in each shift were hours worked by direct care providers of each skill level and staff category. Total nursing care hours per patient per shift was calculated as a total number of hours divided by the number of patients on that shift. Skill mix was calculated as a percentage of the total nursing care hours that were worked each shift by either registered nurses (RNs; i.e., RN skill mix), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), or nurse’s aides (NAs). Staff category was calculated as a percentage of hours worked each shift by each type of nurse in an Army hospital (ADs, RCs, Army civilians, and contractors).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945911407090">
<title>Workload factors</title>
<p>Workload characteristics, conceptualized as structural concepts, include two measures: acuity and census. The standard acuity measure in Army hospitals is the Workload Management System for Nursing (WMSN). The WMSN is a military-developed prospective patient classification system that uses six ordinal-level categories (Category I-VI), with higher categories requiring a more intense level of nursing care. Points were assigned to the acuity categories, (1 point for category I, 2 points for category II, and so on up to 6 points for category VI). Daily average acuity was calculated by summing each patient’s acuity points and then dividing by the daily census (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911407090">Army Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System Program Office, n.d.</xref>). Census was defined as the number of patients on the unit, measured at the same time each day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0193945911407090">
<title>Practice environment</title>
<p>The practice environment refers to the extent of nurse participation in hospital affairs; nursing foundation for quality of care; nurse manager ability, leadership, and support; staffing and resource adequacy; and collegial nurse–physician relationships. It was measured with the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911407090">Lake, 2002</xref>). The PES-NWI contains a listing of characteristics of favorable working environments, a statement of the extent to which the characteristic is present in the respondent’s work environment, and a 4-point Likert-type response from 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> to 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>. Higher scores indicate a more favorable work environment. The Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency reliability for the entire PES alpha was .92. An average score was calculated from the subscales to represent a composite index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911407090">Patrician, Shang et al., 2010</xref>). This composite score was aggregated to the unit level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193945911407090">
<title>Adverse patient events</title>
<p>Two adverse event measures were used in this study: medication errors and falls. Medication errors were defined as a deviation from the physician’s medication order as written on the patient’s chart, traceable to a licensed nurse (RN or LPN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911407090">Allan &amp; Barker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911407090">Patrician, Loan et al., 2010</xref>). Types of self-reported errors included omissions and wrong patient, medication, dose, time, and route or administration technique (e.g., administration of expired medications). Falls were defined as a patient’s unplanned descent to the hospital floor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911407090">Morse, 1997</xref>). Both adverse event data elements were extracted from incident reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911407090">Patrician, Loan et al., 2010</xref>) and were assigned to the shift on which they occurred.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193945911407090">
<title>Database Preparation</title>
<p>The shift-level data set that contained staffing variables as well as adverse events was aggregated to the month level for each unit, resulting in a total number of 833 “unit–months.” Because the original data set contained shifts with adverse events and those without, a rate was created that was standardized to the shift level. In other words, a monthly rate for each adverse event was calculated by the total number of shifts with medication errors (or falls) as the numerator over the total number of shifts for that month as denominator, resulting in a monthly shift-level error (or fall) rate.</p>
<p>In addition, a unit-level data set was created that contained only the average PES score for the nurses from that unit. Only 2 of the 23 units had less than 10 respondents, and no units had fewer than 7 respondents; this was thus considered adequate for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945911407090">Verran, Gerber, &amp; Milton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911407090">Kramer, Schmalenberg, Brewer, Verran, &amp; Keller-Unger, 2009</xref>). The monthly staffing and workload data set described above was merged with the unit’s average PES scores.</p>
<p>To accommodate the staggered initiation of the study at the various hospitals, a date variable was created to measure duration of study in number of months. This is important, as it was found that over time, adverse events decreased (Loan, Patrician, &amp; McCarthy, 2010). The MilNOD parent study conducted several assessments to support data reliability and validity. These are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911407090">Patrician, Shang et al., 2010</xref>). The study received an expedited Institutional Review Board approval because it used de-identified secondary data with no individual nurse, patient, unit, or hospital identifiers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0193945911407090">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Once the necessary variables were created and data sets merged, the data were examined for frequencies, distributions, descriptive statistics, missing data, outliers, and multivariate assumptions. No outliers were discovered; however, the two outcome variables were resistant to transformation and remained skewed with a negative binomial distribution. Missing data were minimal and therefore listwise deletion was used. All analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0.</p>
<p>The effect of clustering of units within facilities was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) as evidenced by an intraclass correlation coefficient of .331, meaning that within-unit variation was smaller than the between-unit variation. In other words, there was more agreement within a unit as compared with between units. This confirms the notion that the practice environment is rated similarly between staff within a unit but can differ between units within the same hospital. Therefore, nested models were used.</p>
<p>For all multivariate models, negative binomial regression or Generalized Linear Mixed (GzLM) Model analyses were used. GzLM can accommodate both the nonindependent, that is, the correlated nature of the units as well as the skewed distribution of the data. A negative binomial GzLM regression model was applied to both medication errors and fall rates. Unit types were evaluated separately in all analyses to control for known differences in types of units. To investigate whether staffing and workload affect falls and medication errors, each outcome was evaluated in a stepwise fashion based on theoretical constructs. In Model 1, staffing variables were tested alone. In Model 2, workload variables were tested alone, followed by Model 3, where staffing and workload variables were evaluated together. In each step, sequential models were compared with the intercept or constant-only model (Step 0) and examined for their effect on the dependant variables. GzLM models were compared using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as the measure of goodness of fit, with smaller BIC values indicating better model fit. Sequentially tested models are judged as significantly different than the intercept-only model (Step 0) by using deviance statistics (the deviance value of the full model minus the deviance value of intercept-only model) and the BIC. Only the final models are presented here.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The four Army medical treatment facilities’ average daily patient census ranged from 44 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8) to 165 (<italic>SD</italic> = 20). Overall, there were 23 nursing care units in these four facilities and average workload and staffing characteristics are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945911407090">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Practice Environment</title>
<p>The PES-NWI composite score was added as a predictor to the GzLM models and tested as a mediator because the environment was theoretically conceptualized as a context that supports or influences structure’s effects on outcomes. All structural variables (workload and staffing constructs) were entered together into the model. Models were tested for medication error and fall rates; unit types were analyzed separately. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911407090">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> three-step regression model testing procedure, the inverse association between staff category and medication error rate increased with the inclusion of the PES in the model. The practice environment was a significant predictor of medication errors (β = −3.086, <italic>p</italic> = .001); the negative beta coefficient indicates that a less favorable practice environment rating was associated with increased medication error rates. The staff category predictors of medication error rates remained significant after the addition of the practice environment variable to the model; thus, the practice environment serves as a partial mediator of this relationship. These relationships held true for each type of unit.</p>
<p>The practice environment was then tested as a mediator of the association between workload and staffing constructs and falls. The practice environment was not a significant predictor (β = 9.283, <italic>p</italic> = .155) of falls, but a lower AD percentage was associated with an increase in falls (β = −1.524, <italic>p</italic> = .046). The practice environment did not mediate this relationship; this finding was consistent when tested across all unit types.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study revealed that among the structural variables, staff category and acuity were associated with medication error and fall rates. Total nursing care hours and census had no effect on these adverse events. The professional practice environment partially mediated the relationship between staff category and medication error rates but not fall rates.</p>
<p>Both medication error and fall rates were associated with unit type, acuity, staff category, and duration of study. Both medication error and fall rates were highest in medical-surgical units and lowest in the critical care units. This unit-type difference is congruent with the findings of other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911407090">Dang, Johantgen, Pronovost, Jenckes, &amp; Bass, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911407090">Kee et al., 2005</xref>). We postulate that the lower medication error rate is due to the nature of nursing care delivery and staffing mix in these units. For example, critical care units most often deliver care within a primary nursing model, where one nurse is responsible for all aspects of patient care, versus a team nursing care model found on most military medical-surgical units. Furthermore, although there is most likely a higher number of medications given in an intensive care unit, there is also a higher nurse-to-patient ratio, fewer geographic distances to cover, and differences in care in delivery. These considerations may influence the medication administration processes. The finding of lower falls in critical care was expected as patients there tend to be less ambulatory overall. They may have medical conditions and invasive lines that preclude movement, and they are thus less likely to fall.</p>
<p>Acuity has a complex relationship to outcomes as it varies across unit types. This study is consistent with those of others who found that units with higher acuity, such as critical care units, have lower rates of medication errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911407090">Blegen, Goode, &amp; Reed, 1998</xref>). This may have more to do with the factors described above, rather than the higher acuity itself. Acuity and falls had a positive relationship in medical-surgical units. We found that acuity was more variable in medical-surgical units, and this variability could have accounted for this finding. The original researchers, using quarterly data from the entire data set, found decreases in both falls and medication errors over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911407090">Loan et al., 2011</xref>); this study found significant decreases only in medication errors among the Army facilities.</p>
<p>In this study, neither total nursing care hours nor RN skill mix was a statistically significant predictor of medication errors or falls. This is inconsistent with other studies. The total hours of care have been found to be inversely related to rates of medication errors when examined at the unit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911407090">Blegen et al., 1998</xref>). Researchers have noted an inverse relationship between staffing (nursing care hours and/or skill mix) and falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911407090">Blegen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911407090">Dunton, Gajewski, Taunton, &amp; Moore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193945911407090">Sovie &amp; Jawad, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0193945911407090">Whitman, Kim, Davidson, Wolf, &amp; Wang, 2002</xref>), but this relationship is not consistent across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407090">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>). One explanation for this is that these studies do not capture the multifactorial nature of falls fully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911407090">Currie, 2007</xref>). Patient comorbidities, demographics, medications, preexisting conditions, and cognitive abilities all impact patient falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911407090">Agostini, Baker, &amp; Bogardus, n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911407090">Currie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911407090">Evans, Hodgkinson, Lambert, &amp; Wood, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911407090">Hitcho et al., 2004</xref>). Another is the methodological variety that exists in this body of research, such as different units of analysis and statistical techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407090">Lake &amp; Chueng, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Staffing category is a military-specific measure, but it is one that has some interesting implications. Reserve percentage staffing was inversely related to medication errors in medical-surgical and in critical care units, and directly related to falls in step-down units. Reservists are nursing staff who fill in for military staff who are deployed and as such are very important components of military staffing during times of war. A higher proportion of reservists relative to AD staff would typically indicate that because of a deployment of AD staff, reservists were needed and were present. This makes sense relative to lower medication error rates, but it does not help to explain the direct relationship with falls; that is, as the proportion of reservists relative to AD personnel increases, the falls increase—but on step-down units only. Falls may have more to do with overall surveillance and not with a particular type or category of personnel; however, this was not evident in our results in that we found no relationship between total hours of care and falls.</p>
<p>Although the data sets were not identical, that is, the current study used a subset of the MilNOD data, the original MilNOD analyses of adverse events were conducted at the shift level, and the staffing results were markedly different than those reported here. For example, at the shift level, nursing care hours, RN skill mix, and the percentage of civilians on the shift were associated with both falls and medication errors, but results varied by unit type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911407090">Patrician, Loan et al., 2010</xref>). The MilNOD researchers set out to collect staffing and adverse event data by the shift with the belief that adverse events happen within a context of factors present or absent at this submicrosystem level. Although many researchers advocate unit-level versus hospital-level analyses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407090">Lake &amp; Cheung, 2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911407090">Mark and Belyea (2009)</xref> go a step further suggesting that staffing and acuity data collected at the time of an adverse event “may provide more sensitive measures” (p. 28).</p>
<p>The practice environment was a significant mediator in the relationship between staffing characteristics and medication errors. The results indicated that a less favorable practice environment rating is associated with an increase in medication errors in all types of units. However, the practice environment did not significantly mediate falls. This is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911407090">Mark et al., (2008)</xref> who posited that the practice environment significantly influences the organizational structure of nursing units, which in turn predicts unit-level safety climate in the reduction of medication errors but not on falls. This differs from two studies that found lower fall rates in Magnet-designated hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911407090">Dunton, Gajewski, Klaus, &amp; Pierson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911407090">Lake, Shang, Klaus, &amp; Dunton, 2010</xref>). In addition, the “Magnet effect” on falls found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911407090">Lake et al. (2010)</xref> was not associated with better staffing levels. The practice environment, whether it is Magnet-designated or measured by the PES-NWI, has been shown by many to be important in producing better patient outcomes, but the mediating and moderating effects have not been fully explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193945911407090">Warshawsky &amp; Havens, 2011</xref>). This study has begun to explicate these complex relationships.</p>
<p>This unique longitudinal, unit-level analysis contributes to the growing understanding of the dynamic nature of nurse staffing and workload at the microsystem level. Although this study was performed in an Army hospital system and was limited to four hospitals, the results can be considered generalizable to the rest of the medical department and are important lessons learned for health systems in general. Strengths of the study were the prospective data collection and longitudinal evaluation of the relationship between staffing, workload, and outcomes. This study’s findings underscore the value of data captured and analyzed at the unit level, and need to control for clustering of units within hospitals.</p>
<p>Limitations include those typical of studies that rely on secondary data: limited control of variable definition, measurement, data collection, and other crucial aspects of design. For example, not having a denominator for the number of medications dispensed makes comparisons across types of units difficult. Other limitations include use of self-reported data for the nurse survey. Likewise, relying on incident reports for the outcomes of medication errors and falls as a data capture method is suspect because underreporting is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193945911407090">B. J. Wakefield et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193945911407090">D. S. Wakefield, Wakefield, Borders, et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193945911407090">D. S. Wakefield, Wakefield, Uden-Holman, &amp; Blegen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0193945911407090">D. S. Wakefield, Wakefield, Uden-Holman, et al., 1999</xref>) and has been estimated to be as much as 10% to 55% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911407090">Leape, 1995</xref>). Future studies should incorporate data extraction from electronic health records as one means of mitigating underreporting of adverse events. Although the gold standard of observation could theoretically be used, it is very expensive, time-consuming, and unrealistic in large-scale studies.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is that it used a unit average PES-NWI score as a measure applied to the unit. This single element is a limitation as there are unexplored factors that may either support or impede care delivery processes, such as geographical layout, supporting technology, and organizational culture. Examination of the influence of practice environment on outcomes was restricted to 2006; the nurses present in other years may not be the same. One method to accommodate and adjust for changes in practice environment over the years is to take the survey data for the year and populate the shift-level data set with the unit average results 6 months before and 6 months after the survey date.</p>
<p>Recommendations for future research include standardized definitions and measures of staffing, workload, and outcomes across acute care nursing studies. For medication error research, it would be most useful to have a denominator for the number of medications dispensed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911407090">Kane et al., 2007</xref>). Currently there are no standardized acuity measures; many are organization specific. Not only will standard measures promote comparison across research studies and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945911407090">Needleman, Kurtzman, &amp; Kizer, 2007</xref>) but they will also enhance interpretability and pragmatic application across nursing. Evaluating only the effects of staffing levels or other organizational structures ignores patient factors that contribute to falls. Future falls studies must control for patient-level falls risk, as well as acuity and unit type.</p>
<p>Although burdensome in shift-level data collection, the most accurate level of data collection and analysis used to attribute care processes to outcomes is at the microsystem level, either at the unit or shift level. Nurses providing hands-on care do so at bedsides—not as individuals but as teams on shifts within units. Thus, the appropriate level of analysis is the microsystem, where a collection of individuals may have the most powerful impact on patient care outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911407090">Batalden, 2001</xref>). Statistical techniques must appropriately address the nested data of nurses (and/or patients) within units and organizations.</p>
<p>The patient care unit is complex and dynamic. There is still a great deal that is unknown about organizational factors such as the professional practice environment. As policy makers struggle to identify optimum staffing levels, understanding day-to-day and shift-to-shift unit-level variation in staffing and workload is important. Although it is time and resource intensive, more longitudinal unit-level study is required to examine change over time and to give clarity to what transpires in the microsystem where patient care is delivered.</p>
