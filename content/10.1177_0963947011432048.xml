<p>There is a slight temptation with a volume of this kind connected to a family event of this kind that we succumb to something of a love-in. Family gatherings can, of course, end up in brawls. In the stylistics family, however, there is commonly a tendency for much mutual admiration, for nostalgic reminiscences, for celebrations of past successes and then, as here, for one or two of the elders to be asked to reflect on the past and comment on how things might be taken on into a sunny future by the next generation while, as in <italic>The Waltons</italic>, the same elders sit in the shade chewing tobacco and holding a large bottle of bourbon.</p>
<p>And there is indeed a family feel to quite a bit of the work in the field of stylistics. There are sometimes disagreements about what to call the field (does stylistics really do it?), some minor disputes as whether the future is mainly cognitive or mainly social (or a bit of both?) but most energy tends to be reserved for warding off attacks from outside, to maintaining family unity and to nurturing the next generation. Of course, as the family grows in numbers and complexity this becomes progressively more difficult to sustain. It is not unreasonable therefore to ask: What next? What kind of future might be envisaged at the interface of language and literature? What can be legitimately celebrated, what has not been so successful and what remains still to be done and to what extent can it continue to be done within the currently more nuclear family configuration of PALA, <italic>Language and Literature</italic> and related journals and the field of stylistics generally?</p>
<p>Space doesn’t allow detailed elaboration so the following, together with reflections on the contributions to this volume, are some brief pointers that might be debated more extensively on other occasions.</p>

<title>• Discussing how it works: The value of practical stylistics</title>
<list id="list1-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Practical stylistic analysis or ‘steam stylistics’ (before electricity and broadband) explores equations of linguistic forms with literary meanings and is the cornerstone of close reading. The article by Gavins and Stockwell in this volume and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947011432048">Hall (2010)</xref> provide a clear theoretical and practical rationale. The linguistic forms that are identified as significant are largely based on intuition and observation and may vary from one analyst to another but no stylistic account of the text can omit treatment and interpretation of such features. Practical stylistics operates in a systematic manner (sometimes drawing on checklists; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947011432048">Short, 1996</xref>) but in an otherwise relatively informal way with no specific technological support: just the reader, a detailed and systematic knowledge of how the language works and a willingness to seek to discuss and explain the effects produced by the language. It is a basic principle of stylistic analysis that others need to be able to see how you have reached the interpretive account that is offered. It is this process which makes an account of the text retrievable and recoverable, allows others to agree or disagree, and makes it possible for different interpretations to be compared transparently and objectively in the sense defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947011432048">Wales (2001</xref>: 373) who qualifies the extremes of this debate by saying that ‘[s]tylistics is only “objective” (and the scare quotes are significant) in the sense of being methodical, systematic, empirical, analytical, coherent, accessible, retrievable and consensual.’ It is, however, the analyst’s analysis and does not derive from others. Students of language and literature need to be able to do this more often and better. It is vital that this practice grows. <italic>It is also a practice that could be extended even more to the analysis of more non-literary texts and varieties so that a more inclusive model of rhetoric can be constructed.</italic> (See discussion to this end in several articles in volume 19(1) of <italic>Language and Literature</italic> (2010) and chapters in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947011432048">Munat (2007)</xref>. And, as Wales argues in this volume, it is a practice that must still, where appropriate, critically unpick ideologies and hidden presuppositions in everyday language use.</p></list-item>

<title>• From steam to broadband: Stylistics and empirical semantics</title>
<list id="list2-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Corpus stylistics extends practical stylistics and is growing as a methodology within the world of stylistics, linguistics and poetics, enabling more developed and detailed quantitative studies of literary linguistic patterns of meaning formation. Stylo-statistical studies are, of course, not new but for the first time in the history of stylistics contemporary corpus stylistics makes use of computer-informed searches of the language of large multi-million word databases, considerably advancing reliability in the identification of the traits of individual authors or groups of authors, although none of this can be done without proper interrogation of the size, balance and representativeness of any corpus authors (for further discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947011432048">Archer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947011432048">Hoover, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947011432048">2010</xref>; and for specific examples: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947011432048">Fischer-Starcke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963947011432048">Stubbs, 2005</xref>). The use of corpus linguistic techniques and strategies allows significant linguistic patterns to be identified that would not be normally be discernible by human intuition, at least not over the extent of a whole novel or long narrative poems and dramas. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947011432048">Mahlberg (2012</xref>; see also Mahlberg this volume) comments:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote><p>… with texts stored as a corpus, scholars can access frequency lists and concordances from the works of an author or groups of authors. These in turn can be compared statistically with texts by other authors, or with larger benchmark corpora, in ways that offer the promise of isolating authorial ‘fingerprints’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947011432048">Mahlberg, 2012</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<list id="list3-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Software advances (e.g. Wordsmith Tools – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947011432048">Scott, 2004</xref>) also now generate comparison between different corpora, allowing a novel by a contemporary writer to be stylistically compared and benchmarked with a multi-million word standard language corpus. Such procedures provide whole new vistas on issues of norms and deviations and of foregrounding and parallelism that in previous generations, however rigorous the analysis, would rely more on individual responses and judgements and that were in any case constructed, inevitably, on the basis of shorter texts and extracts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Corpus linguistic description of language prioritises lexis and lexical patterns, especially patterns that are frequently repeated and it has tended to focus more on the formal structures of such patterns than on their meanings. More recent developments in corpus procedures have involved the development of tools that are more sensitive to the semantic as well as to more structural components of language and style. For example, <italic>Wmatrix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947011432048">wmatrix, n.d.</xref>) is a software tool for corpus analysis and comparison. It provides a web interface to the University of Lancaster developed CLAWS corpus annotation tool as well as standard methodologies such as frequency lists and concordances. It also extends the ‘keywords’ method to key grammatical categories and key semantic domains for applications to literary text study. This tool has been applied to a number of different literary texts: for examples of applications see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947011432048">Archer, Culpeper and Rayson (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947011432048">Culpeper, Hoover and Louw (2010)</xref>. Compared with the CLAWS syntactic annotation tagger, at its current stage of development <italic>Wmatrix</italic> is only about 90% reliable, so it is therefore necessary to look at the contexts of the vocabulary items in order to weed out the oddities, as well as understand more precisely how the lexical items operate thematically. But this does not invalidate its developing value in helping systematic analysis of literary meanings. <italic>Corpus methods have emerged as a major methodological feature of the present and future landscape for the discipline of stylistics and have created the strongest platform yet for both detailed synchronic and diachronic stylistic studies</italic>.</p></list-item>

<title>• Reading reading practices</title>
<list id="list5-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>It is in the nature of stylistic analysis to ask to what degree responses to texts are shared and to explore the extent to which variant readings might be accounted for. In part, this kind of inquiry is stimulated by an underlying belief that interpretations should not vary markedly if texts are analysed with due care and with appropriate linguistic rigour. As a consequence, there have been numerous attempts over the years by practitioners of stylistics to go beyond the individual reader and to try to account for multiple reader responses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947011432048">Hanauer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947011432048">Kintgen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947011432048">Van Peer, 1986</xref> and others). The underlying impulse is to provide greater empirical evidence and in some cases quantitatively rooted support for understanding reader response.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Methodologies are still relatively thin on the ground but there have been and are interesting possibilities nonetheless for group reading and group interpretations of texts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947011432048">Alderson and Short (1989)</xref>, for example, develop the interesting practice of revealing a text line by line in a gradual unfolding of meaning and invite readers to undertake a qualitative, step-by-step interpretation and reinterpretation of features of the language of a text as it emerges. Such reader response approaches would <italic>inter alia</italic> be interested in measuring the kinds of attention readers give to the text as they read it, at what points exactly such attention is drawn more or less powerfully by particular foregrounded features and what the effects are that such foregrounding has on the reader. For example, just <italic>how</italic> do readers respond, for example, to numerous repetitions of the same word or to sequences of embedded subordinate clauses? Are they surprised, unsettled, overwhelmed? What are the precise points at which such feelings set in? Can effects of deliberate distancing or emotional engagement be precisely located in the process of reading? How cumulative are they?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How exactly do readers feel when reading sentences without main verbs or narratives written in the simple present tense? What other effects are produced and how can these effects be described? How exactly are interpretations formed, revised and accounted for and by what kinds of processes? Is it the same reading a text constructed to be literary from one constructed to be non-literary?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Such data is commonly elicited by questionnaires, by talk-aloud protocols collected as the readers individually audio-record their responses as they read, or in a process of post-hoc group discussion or are written up participant accounts after the analytical process has taken place. Each of these strategies for collecting the data are different and need to be disentangled but the aim is to get closer to the linguistic particulars, the actual ‘texture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947011432048">Stockwell, 2009</xref>) of the reading experience and to build theories that are based both on theoretical speculation as well as on empirical evidence of what readers (from various backgrounds and reading positions of course) actually <italic>do</italic>. Many approaches to reader response and investigations of readability and of literary reading practices have been remote from actual practice or have posited one idealised superreader (often the analyst). At its best such research is largely cognitive in orientation but it can be aligned to more social and sociolinguistic dimensions by following suggestive pathways in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963947011432048">Burke (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947011432048">Stockwell (2009)</xref> and by pursuing several of the research lines opened up by Joan Swann and her collaborators in relation to reading groups. In this work (see here the special issue of <italic>Language and Literature</italic> (volume 18 issue 3), more qualitative focus group methods, a wider social range of readers and a generally more ethnographic focus are employed. <italic>Understanding of reading practices is still very limited in several senses and is a major future challenge facing research in cognitive poetics and within the broad realm of stylistics.</italic></p></list-item>

<title>• Style, styling and the spoken language</title>
<list id="list6-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Emma Moore (this volume) underlines a key feature of style and its formulation within contemporary postmodern sociolinguistics. In such a perspective, style is not simply a case of foregrounding or parallelism or of norms and deviations; style is also an interactive practice, it can be a verb as well as a noun (styling as well as style), it is essentially unstable, it can be performed as an identity marker as well as a more static mediation of meanings. The focus of stylistics over the years on language and literature and on style as a written medium has led to some neglect of these dimensions and indeed exploration of how such perspectives on styling can inform the discipline. The sociolinguistic work of Nik Coupland on style (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963947011432048">Coupland, 2007</xref>) is seminal here.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Coupland’s use of the notion of styling and style as interactivity underlines how much of contemporary stylistics addresses the written text or at least the writtenness rather than the spokenness of texts. As corpora of spoken language grow, augmented by multi-modal and video corpora and the analysis of gesture styles, <italic>the challenge for stylistics to embrace a spoken poetics is unavoidable</italic>. Immensely valuable though such studies have been and continue to be (see Short this volume), at present analysis of spoken discourse styles tends to be restricted mainly to the text-immanent text worlds of dialogue and embedded speech presentation.</p></list-item>

<title>Creativity and patterns of everyday language</title>
<list id="list7-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Spoken corpora have played a large part in creativity studies and have undeniably pushed the field forward. Different aspects of creativity have been unravelled using everyday spoken corpus data and analyses, strengthening our understanding of the subject matter. That creative language in the form of everyday metaphors, puns, riddles or verbal duelling and the like, is ubiquitous in everyday conversations has led several researchers to argue that creativity and literariness are not exclusive to literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947011432048">Carter 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947011432048">Pope 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947011432048">Swann et al., 2011</xref>; although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947011432048">L Cameron, 2011</xref>, for a strong counter-argument).</p></list-item>

<title>• Beyond the text</title>
<list id="list8-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>In recent years our view of discourse has expanded beyond traditional notions of ‘text’ to include multimodal and multimedia semiotics and to consider more thoroughly the role of discourse in the creation and reception of different texts. This means that there is increased interest in how people, not exclusively professional linguists or literary critics, receive, interpret and use discourse in modes other than written and spoken language, including images, video, film, sonic patterns and music, and in how these different modes interact with verbal communication and with the more established and sometimes more exclusive notions of literary style.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is also a developing awareness of the crucial role played by new media practices such as various mobile devices, social networking technologies and by the creative interaction and relationship between these technologies and the discourse-based creativities produced by these technologies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947011432048">Tagg, 2011</xref>). With first, second or foreign language users of English examples abound of creative code-mixing and ‘crossings’ between linguistic codes, scripts and language forms in situations when feelings or emotions are intensified or when physical conditions are strained. Email, text messaging and internet chat systems such as skype and IRC also generate conditions of communication in which ‘speakers’ commonly appropriate a ‘between’ language which is not simply standard English (nor simply written or spoken English) but forms of language which enable users to give creative expression to their feelings of friendship, intimacy, resistance to and involvement with each others’ feelings and attitudes and accordingly new modes of speaking/writing are invented, creatively developed and facilitated by the technology. <italic>There is a role for stylistics more fully to enter this space.</italic></p></list-item>

<title>• Stylistics and impact</title>
<list id="list9-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>In the UK especially but increasingly worldwide, there are government-driven requirements (linked, in order to concentrate the mind, to funding and the removal of funding) for research to become more responsive to the world outside the academy, for engagement with the world of work, for research to demonstrate that it has cultural, social and economic impact. There are considerable opportunities for stylistics here and the capacity of its adherents to demonstrate the social impact of style, how language varies in real-world contexts and how reregistering of written and spoken language can help organisations engage more effectively with the public, deal with the media, deal with the language of the internet, handle meetings more efficiently, be more inclusive, listen more fully to female speakers, as well as to see through late-modern play with mediated identities, stylings and the like. Such advocacy can also attract students to work-place projects and internships of real value to them in post-formal education environments. The characteristic attention to detail of stylistics, its criticality, its sense of social responsibility can offer so much. In this context, however, it can be inhibiting to focus too narrowly on literary-aesthetic values. After all, there are other values than aesthetic values. Aesthetic values are important but are in this context not primary: there are, for example, social, political, affective and communal values too, of which language and style are essential constituents. <italic>However it is inflected – in different places for different purposes – stylistics should be at the centre of the impact agenda.</italic></p></list-item>

<title>• From lexical patterns to discourse prosody to cultural trends</title>
<p><disp-quote><p>A: What time does the film start?</p>
<p>B: I don’t know. It’s 8.30. (Cambridge International Corpus)</p></disp-quote></p>
<list id="list10-0963947011432048" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>One step yet to be taken in the field of stylistics is to investigate how close textual analysis can be married with analysis of social and cultural communities of feeling. How can a recognisably common way of speaking or a group’s style of writing, or a way of reporting the radio news or presenting TV weather or writing editorials in popular magazines, or constructing TV ads or developing a particular form of poetic syntax or a pervasively recurrent metaphor be located in the particulars of specific socio-cultural meanings? If we notice the increasing informalisation of language in society in all its many manifestations, how can this be generalised? And how can the analysis hold up beyond the commentary of one perceptive or insightful individual? It was a problem that beset cultural critics such as Raymond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947011432048">Williams (1983)</xref> who identified the changing cultural trends and textures carried by individual words; and it is still a problem that besets stylisticians who get close to linguistic particularities but cannot substantiate or attest the broader accompanying social and cultural insights. It is a case of moving from culture to lexico-grammatical cluster and from morphemic pattern to social change. In the context of literary studies such a step would give greater credibility to work that is perceived by literary critics as too reductive and insufficiently attentive to historical context; it would also challenge linguists who conversely believe stylistics to be a discipline that is too under-generalised and single text focussed to offer anything that is descriptively innovative beyond a single artefact.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Not for the first time, corpus stylistics offers possibilities as a result of the identification of large-scale patterns across texts and media and the developments in discourse theory developed by Sinclair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947011432048">Sinclair, 2004</xref>) and others that enable increasing attention to lexical patterns, semantic preferences and prosodies and the accompanying pragmatic interpretations that are entailed by the regularities in particular moments in spoken and written textual history. They are only possibilities but they may allow us to begin to see how social reality is culturally and creatively styled over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For example, by the end of the 20th century, discourse can be shown to have become more ‘democratic’ (even if society hasn’t to the same extent). Society has become less formal and ceremonial in such areas as dress and social behaviour and so too has the language changed to more informal and symmetrical linguistic modes, with the cultural phenomenon of conventional spoken forms entering more written language domains. People speak to each other less asymmetrically and it is inevitable that they should also increasingly write to each other in similar ways, especially in contexts such as advertising or email communication or through political rhetorics where it is important not to talk down or to sound too informed or authoritative, even if you do know things. As collections of recorded spoken data such as the British National Corpus develop and expand so more evidence of this kind will come to light and so our descriptive grammars and dictionaries will be increasingly rewritten in support of such evidence. What does it tell us that the formulaic sequence <italic>at the end of the day</italic> is the second most frequent six-word chunk in the spoken component of the 1 billion word Cambridge International Corpus? What leads to the pervasive impulse so commonly to mark conversational closings and summaries with this phrase? What does it reveal culturally that we commonly use the purposefully vague preface <italic>I don’t know</italic> before revealing answers to things? These common phrases, repeated innumerable times each day by all of us, are mini scenarios, cumulatively building and reinforcing and cognitively sedimenting how we construe the world. Is this a local affective cultural practice or is it common across cultures? Does the object change when we see it multi-modally as well as hear or read it? To what extent are communities of feeling manifest in linguistic clusters in both literary and non-literary texts as well as in everyday socio-cognitive exchanges?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is yet another a major challenge for stylistics to begin to form answers to such everyday cultural and cross-cultural challenges, to begin to try to embrace closer contact and interdisciplinary dialogue with sociologists, cognitive linguists, cultural historians, corpus linguists, literary critics and many researchers of many different hues and persuasions. <italic>Stylistics can and should keep its roots in steam stylistics but may well at this time be even stronger as a result of the many ongoing moves to extend the family</italic>.</p></list-item>
