<p>“The future of adult education holds many opportunities. AAACE’s goal is to provide its members with the tools that it takes to do exactly that.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is an interesting assignment to think about the future of adult education. In fact, it is an assignment I have the graduate students in my <italic>Introduction to Adult Education</italic> class at East Carolina University consider during one of our course units. In that unit, which occurs after examining the history of adult education, we consider where our field is heading. Not surprisingly, responses to this question are as diverse as the students in the class and as diverse as the field of adult education itself. Most students are excited about the future and interested in considering how their interests, education, and particular skill sets might best serve them in the field of adult education. Many who work in the field of adult education bemoan the lack of resources, institutional ambivalence, and other obstacles. Almost all students discuss their interest in working with adult learners and underlying motivation for helping adults learn and grow. Some comment on the diversity of the field, as represented by the many different jobs held by the members of the class. Despite the differences in backgrounds, career goals, and interests within the field, in the end, some common themes emerge. We agree that passion for helping adults learn and being present when <italic>light bulb moments</italic> occur is what drives us to do what we do. It is what motivates us and keeps us going as adult educators. We are also optimistic about the future and enjoy speculating about what the future of adult education holds for us.</p>
<p>As a member of the Board of Directors for the American Association for Adult and Continuing Education (AAACE), and now as incoming President-Elect, I have also been considering the future of our discipline. AAACE recently completed a strategic planning process and evaluated where the organization stands and where it is headed. Through a member survey and self-assessment, AAACE examined how the board can best serve the needs of members and promote the organization and the discipline.</p>
<p>As a result of these discussions and my own contemplation, several themes emerged that may hold the keys for future success for AAACE and the field of adult education.</p>
<sec id="section1-1045159513477849">
<title>The Future Means Being Flexible</title>
<p>We can look at the concept of flexibility in several different ways. Technology, for example, provides adult educators and learners flexibility in program delivery methods and access to formal education. This does not mean traditional face-to-face teaching will become obsolete. It simply means we can be more innovative in the options we offer learners. Flexibility also allows us to be more responsive to learner needs. Gone are the days when adults stayed in one job for their entire lives. Now, people change jobs and entire career paths on a regular basis. Often, they need education as part of these transitions. Furthermore, demographic shifts mean retiring baby boomers are looking for leisure-time learning activities. Social justice issues in our world continue to evolve. The demand for adult basic skills education continues to increase. As adult educators, we need to be flexible in response to the changing needs of adult learners and ready to provide the educational opportunities they need, when they are needed.</p>
<p>Flexibility means we at AAACE must continually evaluate the products and services we offer our members and make changes when appropriate. The recent additions of the Special Interest Group on Sustainability and Environmental Adult Education and the Special Interest Group for Labor/Workforce Education are good examples of responsiveness to the changing field of adult education and new needs of our members. We must be open to the opportunities that present themselves as the field of adult education evolves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1045159513477849">
<title>The Future Means Using Technology Wisely</title>
<p>As noted above, technology has changed the way we educate adults. It has also changed the way we communicate. We at AAACE are always looking for better ways to communicate with members and now use Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn and continuously work to improve the AAACE website. However, we do not want to overwhelm members with an overabundance of communication methods. We rely on our overall communications strategy to make the best choices about how we communicate respectfully with each other. Technology will continue to drive changes in education and communication; however, the key is to use it wisely and appropriately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1045159513477849">
<title>The Future Means Partnering and Working Together</title>
<p>We must continually look for new ways of doing what we do—reaching learners, developing programs, meeting societal needs, and promoting our discipline. This can mean partnering with other, like-minded organizations for the benefit of all. Developing partnerships with complimentary organizations is essential for our professional well-being. At AAACE, we are partnering with several other associations to connect and collaborate on programs related to our annual conference. These types of partnering agreements allow for more opportunities and variety for our members. Partnering can also benefit specific educational programs. For example, at East Carolina University, our Adult Education program is thriving, thanks in part to partnerships with the U.S. Army for the teaching of Army trainers. We also partnered with our medical school on a graduate certificate program in medical education and with the North Carolina Community College System on a graduate certificate in community college instruction. Partnering helps us to become stronger.</p>

<title>The Future Means Promoting the Field and Sharing What We Bring to the Table</title>
<p>East Carolina University’s faculty convocation marks the official start of the school year and each year the Professor of the Year is asked to make some remarks. These professors typically talk about their unconventional ways of teaching. They discuss their transitions from traditional lectures to getting students involved. They talk about acting more like a facilitator and providing an environment in which students can best learn. In short, they talk about all the things we as adult educators have known and done for years. Communicating the value of what we know and can offer learners is paramount to our success as a profession. Often, we spend so much time <italic>doing</italic> adult education that we forget to promote our achievements and successes. One of the steps in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159513477849">Caffarella’s (2007)</xref> <italic>Planning Programs for Adult Learners</italic> is communicating the value of the educational program. There are many adult educators doing wonderful and important work, but not sharing their achievements. It is important to the profession that our successes are shared and celebrated. At AAACE, that means getting involved in public policy initiatives that affect adult learners and promoting our organization to those who may be unfamiliar with it. It also means increasing the visibility of our organization’s public profile by continuously improving our website and electronic communications.</p>

<sec id="section5-1045159513477849">
<title>The Future Means Focusing on Professional Sustainability</title>
<p>I am fortunate to have had many great mentors throughout my career. These mentors made me the adult educator I am today. It is our collective professional responsibility to ensure we work to prepare the next generation of adult educators, just as we have been prepared. This might mean mentoring students in formal or informal situations or providing opportunities for early-career practitioners to grow within the field. We at AAACE have many great opportunities for students and early-career professionals to become involved in the organization and the field. Getting involved with AAACE has afforded me many opportunities to work with colleagues from all over the country—I urge everyone who is interested to inquire about how you can get involved. It is as simple as contacting the AAACE office or one of the members of our Board of Directors or Special Interest Groups.</p>
<p>Whether for a course assignment, as part of a strategic planning process, or when evaluating one’s personal and career goals, considering the future is something we all should do from time to time. I am proud to be one of many dedicated members working to plan for the future of AAACE. The future of adult education holds many opportunities for those who can take advantage of them. Our goal at AAACE is to provide you, our members, with the tools that it takes to do exactly that.</p>
