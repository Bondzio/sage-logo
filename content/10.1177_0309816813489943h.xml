<p>A neverending stream of material continues to emerge from the printing presses, as the second-largest crash in capitalism’s history continues to unfold. The focus of many of these works has mainly been on the structural and historical changes that the global economy has suffered. Rivers of ink have flowed, inspired by the hegemony of finance and, to a lesser extent, the global dispersal of production – two of capitalism’s most distinctive characteristics in the current historical period. Still, many of these studies, especially those that can be located within the progressive and radical spectrum, suffer from a lack of vision that might identify in our present the seeds of a possible post-capitalist society.</p>
<p>The second edition of Gar Alperovitz’s <italic>America Beyond Capitalism</italic> (ABC, from here on in) appears at a critical juncture in which many throughout the world are seeking and presenting alternative visions. Movements of global unrest have captured not only the imagination of those who support such movements but thought they were a thing of the past, but also the attention of those who are in power, and who benefit from a system driven by the profit imperative.</p>
<p>The need for a vision based on the existence of real, present-day experiences is mainly what ABC is about. Alperovitz offers a guiding hand to look around more closely, in order to find such elements within the society that seems to be collapsing around us.</p>
<p>From the outset, it is clear that the target audience of ABC is the citizens of the USA, irrespective of the position they might occupy within the ideological spectrum. This has, of course, positive and negative dimensions. Some might find ABC problematic in that it romanticises a questionable past: for example, when the author states that ‘the only way for the United States to <italic>once again</italic> honor its great historic values – above all equality, liberty, and meaningful democracy – is to build forward to achieve what amounts to systemic change’ (xliii, my emphasis). Along the same line, he mentions that the ‘the political-economic system <italic>no longer</italic> appears able to sustain a culture of liberty’ (p. 28, my emphasis). These types of statements are found throughout the book, and one wonders to what extent the author uses this as a conscious rhetorical move to grab the attention of as many Americans as possible, taking into account the ever present <italic>nationalism</italic> that in moments of crisis takes various shapes, and that historically has posed many obstacles for anti-capitalist politics.</p>
<p>Still, the work should not be reduced to this observation. The author provides a significant sample of historical and present-day experiences to document how within the USA there are what could be considered, under some conceptualisation, to be non-capitalist practices in very significant realms of society, and how certain perceptions of how the world works, such as globalisation, might be problematised.</p>
<p>For Alperovitz, the principle of <italic>direct</italic> democracy at various social sites is a central characteristic of a potential post-capitalist society. The guiding principle is that those that are affected by decision-making processes should actively take part in those same processes. This is the backbone of a critique of the ‘democratic deficit’ that the author sees in the workings of modern society. Alperovitz sees this democratic deficit, which he ties to significant inequalities in wealth, as a product of what he calls ‘corporate’ and ‘entrepreneurial’ capitalism and its monopoly of both political and economic power. From this perspective, liberal/representative democracy as a ‘universal value’ only serves to masquerade what is rotten about a system that has profits and not people as its aim.</p>
<p>The author then points his critical eye towards the scale of institutions as an important dimension of this search for ‘true democracy’. The dominant rhetoric puts the ability of people to govern themselves beyond their grasp by appealing to the interconnectedness of a globalised world, in which institutions take on more national and supranational forms. ABC attempts to demystify such a view by numerous examples at the state level that have direct bearings on the livelihoods of people, and which provide for viewing future societal arrangements in terms of ‘regions’ (p. 64). For the author, regional restructuring and authority is a reality, given ‘trends in Supreme Court and congressional decision making; an explosion of state-based initiatives; the impact of global political-economic forces on the current federal system; very large-order projected changes in the economy and population; and new trajectories of expanding ethnic political power concentrated in key regions experiencing economic distress’ (p. 152).</p>
<p>At the level of the firm, ABC documents how worker-owned and -managed firms contrast with the usual private capitalist enterprise in terms of the role democracy plays in economic outcomes. Interestingly enough, Alperovitz uses capitalism’s own lens to evaluate their performance, when he appeals to ‘several studies [that] demonstrate that greater participation leads to greater productivity and thus greater competitiveness in the market place’. In my opinion, this observation captures a tension contained in the book that touches upon a theme that has a long history behind it: what is the role of the market in understanding capitalism and possible alternatives to it? How do market imperatives shape worker’s control of production? Can the market be shaped to serve the needs of society? How do we move forward when taking into account these potential effects?</p>
<p>There is a massive and continuing output of works related to the questions posed above and it is not my intention to provide a sample of them here. Still, I would like to draw attention to a set of topics related to the market which I regard as relevant to the general message contained in ABC about democracy, and the specific theme of worker control and management in the context of the present day USA, which are seldom treated by economists. I am talking about the role of culture, the nation-state, and the ideology of economics during times of crisis as potential undermining factors to the alternatives with socialist characteristics that Alperovitz proposes in his book.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in ABC, Alperovitz provides an astounding empirical documentation of all types of economic and political activities that could be considered non-capitalist in significant realms of society, involving, for example, land trusts, municipal enterprises and cooperatives. The examples that operate between the coordinates of worker ownership and self-management are in tune with well-known critiques of how the firm does not need the capitalist to run it. The notion of democracy at the workplace and the concrete examples of cooperative organisation within the firm provided by ABC seem compatible with a situation in which there is no exploitation within the firm, therefore providing an anchor in the present to view some general contours of what the future might look like in terms of the organisation of production along non-exploitative lines.</p>
<p>Still, it is no secret that many workers within the USA put the blame on foreign countries like China for taking the jobs that once ‘belonged’ to them. The global dispersion of production and the outsourcing of jobs that accompanies it have helped to shape the way people in the USA and other places conceive the problems that affect their lives.</p>
<p>Just like those who point their fingers at irresponsible bankers, corrupt politicians and other individuals as the sources of the latest global socioeconomic crisis, many have also found the problem not in the system itself, but in those who in their eyes, the system now favours. These individuals and groups are defined in terms of their nationality, thanks to standard comparative economic analysis whose unit of analysis is the nation-state.</p>
<p>As a lens to understanding reality, economics actively participates in this shaping of perceptions when, for example, we are told that people in China and India are doing well because their economies, measured in GDP terms, experience high growth rates. Most economists do not even bother to look at the reality of millions of peasants and petty producers being thrown off the land for the sake of building infrastructure for capital (e.g. development of mining, plantation farming, urban real estate projects, etc.) in the continued process of accumulation by dispossession that might or might not lead to the proletarianisation of large sectors of those societies. The growth of these economies can then be seen, in part, as a reflection of the partial absorption of the newly victimised potential labour force. Not only do people suffer when capitalism does not work, but they also suffer when it is doing very well according to its own economic diagnosis.</p>
<p>None of the above observations are meant to oppose any workers’ initiative to transform their own workplaces. They are merely a recognition of the struggles that lie ahead in trying to implement and relate democracy at the micro level with international class solidarity and struggle, at moments in which nationalism, within the leading capitalist nation in a moment of crisis, is a real factor with real consequences.</p>
<p>Still, we should appreciate Alperovitz’s efforts in his book to open up the space to discuss what has historically become one of the victims of both socialism and capitalism, and which in moments of crisis demonstrates its continued relevance, as several cases, like Buenos Aires in 2001 or Chicago in 2008, have confirmed. Workers’ control and self-management are once again back on the discussion table as some of the many elements that might help constitute not only a defence against capitalism’s inhuman logic, but also an insight into what kind of post-capitalist future awaits us if socialism is to triumph.</p>
