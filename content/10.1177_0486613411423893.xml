<abstract>
<p>The current Robert Boyer-led French Regulation School (FRS) characterizes the contemporary era as a diversity of national capitalisms. Boyer’s new approach displaces the original FRS focus on “models of development.” This article rallies against the current direction and re-engages the FRS’s earlier mid-range Marxist-influenced account of capitalist development. In particular, key concepts of “regulation” and “model of development” are reworked in the context of a revised account of the Fordist model of development. These concepts are then adapted to work up an outline of the “neoliberal model of development.”</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Marx’s seminal analysis of capitalism’s core production relations grounds his account of capitalism’s long-range logic and the contours of its future trajectory. Though Marx also considered capitalism’s growth-crisis cycle and stages of industrial development, prognosis at this mid-range is hampered by the problem of predicting the effects of contingent political struggles and interventions. Central to the appeal of Althusser’s French Regulation School (FRS) “rebel sons” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1993</xref>: 99) was the implicit promise of a mid-range theory of capitalist development that could complement Marx’s long-range account. Michel Aglietta’s original account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0486613411423893">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423893">1982</xref>) and Alain Lipietz’s work through the ’eighties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0486613411423893">1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0486613411423893">1986b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0486613411423893">1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0486613411423893">1987b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0486613411423893">1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0486613411423893">1988b</xref>) most clearly represent this Marxist connection. By the ’nineties, the groundwork of a powerful mid-range theory of capitalist development was emerging from the FRS’s account of the Fordist model of development and its crisis. Since then, this research direction has lost momentum.</p>
<p>Recently, Robert Boyer’s focus on national difference, linked with a de-emphasis of the Fordist model of development and the absence altogether of a model of development in the analysis of the contemporary era has further undermined the original mid-range historical narrative. Under Boyer’s leadership the FRS has been distanced from its Marxist foundations, heterodox influences have been emphasized, and alignment has been promoted with the “Varieties of Capitalism” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0486613411423893">Boyer and Saillard 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0486613411423893">Amable 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">Boyer 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This article aims to set the FRS research agenda back on course towards the development of a mid-range Marxist explanation of the dynamic of the capitalist mode of production. The analysis brings in major writers following the regulation approach, both from within and beyond France.The first major segment reviews the original FRS concept of regulation and its account of the Fordist model of development. Then, in the light of conceptual reworking, a revised account of Fordism is presented. The second major segment critically engages with Boyer’s perspective. As an alternative which builds critically on the FRS’s earlier research agenda, an outline is presented of the “neoliberal model of development.”</p>

<title>2. Regulation and the Fordist Model of Development</title>
<p>Marx and Marxism have emphasized the determining role of the economic. Nonetheless, in celebrated fragments Marx points to the independent efficacy of the political and its causal reciprocity with the economic. Althusser’s Marxism, a central inspiration of the FRS, draws specifically on Marx’s methodological writing in the Introduction to the <italic>Grundrisse</italic> and Gramsci’s <italic>Prison Notebooks</italic> to further specify, especially in his concept of “overdetermination,” the independent character and causality of the political and ideological. Contrasting with the orthodox Marxist emphasis on the economic determination of a corresponding political and ideological superstructure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0486613411423893">Althusser (1969)</xref> emphasizes the independent dynamic of the political/ideological that “overdetermines” the economic base. Capitalist development is seen to comprise uneven mutual determinations between internally related but different elements. In the analysis of practice, this perspective encourages identification of the political imprint directly present in changing economic forms.</p>
<p>A foundational theme of this paper is to examine the FRS’s adaptation of overdetermination to regulation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1993</xref>). Regulation, the FRS’s master-concept, was developed to explain the anomaly between the inherently unstable crisis-ridden form of capitalism and the smooth stable growth pattern of the post-WWII “long boom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0486613411423893">Aglietta 1979</xref>). A mode of regulation—emerging from a class compromise outcome of hegemonic struggle induced by economic crisis—comprises an institutional framework and corresponding policies, norms, and modes of behavior that coordinate a period of stable growth.</p>
<p>As a process of overdetermination, politically constructed regulatory principles offset capitalism by counteracting or counterbalancing its core unstable and crisis-prone economic logic. In short, regulation politically modifies the economic process to temporarily stabilize, or contain, the contradictory core of capitalism. This conception is neatly summed up by Lipietz:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[C]risis is only the other side of regulation: the one expresses and the other contains the original conflictual nature of social relations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0486613411423893">1988b</xref>: 15, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0486613411423893">1988a</xref>: 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Capitalist economic relations drive increasing productivity and accumulation, but periodic crises occur because of the inherently unstable nature of capitalist economic coordination. For example, the Great Depression was essentially caused by the failure of market coordination to ensure demand adequate to increasing productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1988b</xref>: 27). This unstable tendency was contained by the post-WWII Fordist model of development, which offset this unstable direction and instead coordinated a stable growth trajectory or “regime of accumulation.” At its theoretical core, a model of development is a stylized construction of a stable regime of accumulation or virtuous cycle of production, investment, and consumption engineered by the stabilizing regulation of unstable tendencies of the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>Aglietta’s pioneering work proposed that “a theory of social regulation is a complete alternative to the theory of general equilibrium” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0486613411423893">1979</xref>: 13). Though modelling of an economic process is central to this alternative, the model, in contrast to mainstream economics, is grounded in observed historical experience. It focuses on linking a stable growth pattern, based on a labor process paradigm, with a specific regulatory framework. The Fordist model of development is an ideal-typical configuration that demonstrates the stable pattern of accumulation, labor process paradigm, and regulatory features that generally characterized the experience of the advanced capitalist countries in the post-WWII period.</p>
<p>The pattern of growth across the advanced capitalist countries during the long boom can be essentially described as stable rates of profit underpinned by wage growth calibrated to grow in line with increasing productivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0486613411423893">Glyn et al. 1991</xref>). This “virtuous circle” was maintained by the continuing investment of profits in advancing technology, which increased productivity at a rate that sustained both increasing consumption and investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0486613411423893">Boyer 1988</xref>). The engine of this growth pattern, defined according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0486613411423893">Braverman’s (1974)</xref> Marxist account, is the Fordist labor process. In addition, and corresponding with Marx’s conceptions of relative and absolute surplus value, the FRS define the Fordist regime of productivity as “intensive,” rather than “extensive.”</p>
<p>Stable growth was coordinated by the institutionalized form, or mode of regulation, of the post-WWII “class compromise.” This accommodation of class interests is formulated as labor’s acceptance of capitalist power in the sphere of production in return for secure employment and a rising standard of living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0486613411423893">Boyer 1988</xref>). Rather than being driven by competition over price or quality, productivity-seeking under the Fordist model of development was driven by increasing wages. The mode of regulation, of which the state is the central site, is summed up as Keynesian, corporatist, and welfarist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0486613411423893">Jessop 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In Boyer’s work, the empirical test of the existence of the Fordist model of development is the similarity across a group of countries of the growth pattern, and the “functional equivalence” of regulation. For Boyer, the model is derived from a cross-country comparison of the “economic adjustment process” that pays particular attention to the “speed of technical change,” “the nature of demand,” and “internationalization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">Boyer 2005</xref>: 521). Following these “canonical distinctions” across national experiences, Boyer re-interprets the Fordist model of development as “an intensive accumulation regime associated with a wage-led demand, within the context of a low degree of internationalization” (op. cit.).</p>

<title>3. A Revisionist Agenda</title>
<p>Weaknesses in the FRS account of Fordism have undermined progress towards a fully developed mid-range Marxist account of capitalism’s recent historical dynamic. In particular, progress has been limited by flaws in the concepts of “model of development” and “regulation.” These concepts are reworked and a revised account of the Fordist model of development is presented.</p>
<sec id="section4-0486613411423893">
<title>3.1 Rethinking Regulation: The Fordist Experience</title>
<p>In the emerging FRS mid-range account, capitalist history comprises unique models of development interspersed with periods of crisis. Each model of development is underpinned by a contingent response to the crisis effects of capitalism’s core imperatives and contradictions. And each model expresses a stable growth trajectory over time that breaks down into crisis, provoking a hegemonic struggle to discover and implement a new regulatory project. Thus capitalist history is over-determined by politically contingent struggles that underpin unique mid-range growth regimes. Regulation is primarily understood as offsetting the assumed unstable boom-bust cycle of unfettered capital logic, thus generating a smooth growth trajectory.</p>
<p>While contingent regulation is in the foreground of the FRS approach, core capitalist relations are placed in the background. The capitalist mode of production only appears at “the most abstract level” of analysis. It acts as an invariant core that “imposes the primacy of exchange value over use value and makes accumulation an imperative of the system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0486613411423893">Boyer and Saillard 2002b</xref>: 38). Analytical focus, at descending levels of abstraction, is on the concrete patterns of accumulation and modes of regulation that vary across space and time and underpin long periods of stable growth (ibid.: 38-9). In general, the FRS relegates core capitalist relations to an invariant and unchanging background status, rather than being, as in Marx’s analysis, the central focus.</p>
<p>Following Marx’s method, the invariant core elements of the mode of production define capitalism across all its stages as an “abstraction” that “brings out and fixes the common element,” but grasps “no real historical stage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0486613411423893">Marx 1973</xref>: 85, 88). As a rational abstraction, private ownership, wage dependence, and the market define key institutions and norms that govern core capitalist production relations. In turn, these relations can be expressed as the exploitative capital-wage-labor relation, plus competition-based market coordination of production. This core economic structure can be viewed as equivalent to the deep embedded base of capitalist regulation.</p>
<p>More significantly, this construction does not imply that the invariant core is in the background. On the contrary, the abstraction exists only in a concrete context, “at a definite stage of social development” (ibid.: 85). In its concrete existence, the abstraction always appears in a particular form as “the concentration and [“mutual interaction”] of many determinations,” as is “the case with every organic whole” (ibid.: 100). Thus, the core economic structure is to be considered not only as an unchanging abstraction, but in its contingent and changing historical forms. In historical practice, production relations are always in a form already over-determined by regulation. As such, the concrete object of regulation theory becomes core capitalist relations, not as a rational abstraction, but as they are politically varied by regulatory projects. This change of focus of regulation back to the economic core, albeit politically varied, in turn leads to further revisions of the standard FRS view.</p>
<p>A foundational element of the FRS perspective is to contrast an in-regulation situation of economic stability and smooth growth with the inherent out-of-regulation or crisis state of capitalism. This is the dominant meaning of regulation, as neatly expressed by Lipietz (see above, p. 2). But in the same text, Lipietz also refers to regulation that formalizes and reinforces the practice of unstable crisis-prone core capitalist relations of production (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1988b</xref>: 12-13). Here Lipietz implicitly recognizes that the capitalist mode of production is always varied by the political and ideological superstructure, understood as historically contingent regulation. Thus regulation in this revised sense refers not only to institutional forms that contain or offset essential capitalist relations, but also to regulatory projects that support or even intensify essential capitalist relations.</p>
<p>In addition, whether as pro-active or counter-active, and whether as embedded relations or contingent projects, regulation is not just directly of the accumulation cycle. More fundamentally, regulation refers to structures of power that motivate individual habits and behavior by “act[ing] as coercive or inciting forces” (Lipietz, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0486613411423893">Boyer 1990</xref>: 121). Capitalism’s embedded regulatory core defines the essential motivations underpinning dynamic capital accumulation. These core regulatory structures may be supported and even intensified by contingent regulatory projects, or they might be moderated or even displaced by an alternative motivational structure.</p>
<p>This argument can be illustrated with reference to the interaction of capitalism’s core production relations, focusing on “formal subordination” and competition, with the Fordist mode of regulation. “Formal subordination” is the necessity of selling labor power in order to live, or wage dependence. It defines the essential form of the proletariat and underpins capital’s power to exploit labor on its terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0486613411423893">Marx 1976</xref>: 1,019-38; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0486613411423893">Neilson 2007</xref>). Formal subordination is increased when waged work becomes more insecure because wages are low, jobs are scarce, and dismissal is easy. It is also increased to the extent that alternative means of working, such as self-employed subsistence, and alternative sources of consumption, such as personal saving, social welfare, and informal social support networks, are scarce or non-existent.</p>
<p>The Fordist mode of regulation is novel, first because it reduced the degree of formal subordination, while also deploying elements of a different motivational structure. Gramsci’s original discussion of Fordism identifies a hegemonic form of the capital-labor relation where, in contrast to the earlier despotic form of the exploitation relation, labor consents to the terms of capitalist production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0486613411423893">Gramsci 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0486613411423893">Burawoy 1985</xref>). The Fordist class compromise lessened formal subordination by delivering increased security in the form of full and secure employment, rising family wage levels, and the provision of a social wage. Compared with the direct coercive form of power represented by formal subordination, this consensual incorporation of the proletariat generates a more voluntary form of the capital-labor power relation.</p>
<p>Alongside formal subordination, market competition is a central disciplinary driver of economic behavior and performance under capitalism. Competition is driven by the market form premised on private ownership and monetized exchange relations. It usually refers to the on-going struggle between capitalists to sell their products and to increase profits. Competition between firms is intensified both by the broadening of the dimensions of competitiveness and by the degree of scarcity of buyers. Competition is not only a “coercive whip” for capital, but also for labor and for countries.</p>
<p>In chapter 25 of <italic>Capital</italic>, vol. 1, Marx offers a sustained analysis of the competitive logic of the labor market linked with an on-going process of labor’s retention, expulsion, and redeployment. This dynamic process, while reinforcing the insecurity inherent to formal subordination generally, also stratifies the proletariat into segments that have different degrees of employment insecurity, centrally comprizing the “active army,” “reserve army,” and other residual elements of the “relative surplus population.” Recent writers have developed the idea of competition between countries under the concept of the “competition state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0486613411423893">Jessop 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0486613411423893">Cerny 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423893">2003</xref>). In the current era, countries become like “hostile brothers” competing to retain or attract scarce international capital, and in the process become subordinate to capital’s requirements.</p>
<p>The FRS usefully characterizes the Fordist mode of regulation as “monopolist,” in contrast to the competitive regulation of the interwar period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0486613411423893">Boyer 1990</xref>). Market-driven pricing between competing firms was displaced by “nominal price setting [between colluding firms] through mark-ups over the cost of capital” that predetermined the profit margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1988b</xref>: 29).Monopolist national regulation is also underpinned by the containment of international competition between firms that, in turn, facilitate national-centered Keynesian-style regulation. Demand-led economic regulation also moderated scarcity-driven competition between firms.</p>
<p>The Fordist mode of regulation is novel, second, because competition was displaced by an alternative motivational structure. Competition regulated labor markets were displaced by the monopolist regulation of labor. Different national versions of statist and corporatist connective wage bargaining put Keynesian demand-side policies into practice. Resulting generalized wage movements plus high employment levels delivered lessened competition and increased solidarity amongst the proletariat. At the same time, inter-firm competition, both nationally and internationally, was reduced by labor’s monopolist regulation. In turn, capital’s low internationalization displaced competition between national states and workforces. The security for labor of increased wages, permanent employment, the welfare state, and reduced competition and segmentation, together eased formal subordination.</p>
<p>As industrialized mass production techniques are generalized and refined the regulatory tension between increased output associated with relative surplus value, and low wages associated with absolute surplus value, becomes more pronounced. The Fordist mode of regulation represents a novel solution to this overproduction crisis tendency. In particular, stable growth was sustained by Keynesian strategies that increased wages and employment levels, and thus consumption, in parallel with increasing levels of productivity. More generally, instead of being driven by the coercive power of capital over labor and competition between capitalist firms, accumulation was generated by winning the consent of the proletariat, and by the incentive created for capital by wage-led increases in demand.</p>
<p>The Fordist model of development weakened capitalism’s motivational core and instead offered a stable and socially progressive alternative form. However, the reduced power of capital over labor ultimately reduced Fordism’s economic viability. Declining regime viability can be described as wages continuing to rise while productivity began to level off. This squeezing of profits was not only a product of the “exhaustion of the Taylorist paradigm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1986a</xref>). Profitability was also undermined as an effect of the easing of formal subordination and the related power of institutionalized labor to maintain wage increases and resist various projects to deepen real subordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0486613411423893">Kalecki 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0486613411423893">Armstrong et al. 1984</xref>). This incompatibility with the core motivational structure of capitalism makes sense of Aglietta’s aphorism that “Fordism weighed capitalism down” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0486613411423893">Aglietta 1998a</xref>: 147).</p>

<title>3.2 Rethinking the Model of Development and the Fordist Experience</title>
<p>As an ideal-typical construction, the Fordist model of development appears to be a kind of national composite. The labor process of American Taylorism is combined, as its mode of regulation, with the Keynesian/corporatist/welfare state most characteristic of the advanced Northern European countries. More precisely, the Fordist model of development, in the standard format, is a stylized model of the ideal-typical features—but describing none specifically—of the political economies of the advanced capitalist countries in the post-WWII era. It operates as a benchmark against which actual national configurations are measured. National experiences accord only more or less with this ideal-typical benchmark, or what Boyer more recently defines as “canonical” form. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0486613411423893">Peck and Tickell (1994</xref>: 286-7) present a useful “more or less” typology of variants of Fordism, including some developing capitalist countries. In Boyer’s more recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0486613411423893">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">2005</xref>) the empirical test for, and the reality of, the model of development become fused in the idea of national convergence towards a canonical form. This standard understanding, while analytically useful, has certain limitations.</p>
<p>First, rather than as a canon retrospectively derived from cross-national comparison that then becomes the comparative benchmark, a model can be understood as a prospective project for national regulation. In this revised sense, a model of development inspires and facilitates practical national projects. The model may take the form of an outline or blueprint of a national mode of regulation and include a national exemplar, such as the experience of a leading country. In recent capitalist history, such blueprints and exemplars are closely associated with the transnational conception, facilitation, and coordination of a particular national institutional configuration or mode of regulation. Facilitation includes not only constructing and promoting the national blueprint, but also constructing and coordinating the international regulatory environment that facilitates the national model and coordinates international relations.</p>
<p>To bring in this international dimension requires moving beyond the FRS’s militantly endogenous method (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0486613411423893">Yaghmaian 1998</xref>: 245-246). Boyer’s approach in particular retains the early FRS emphasis on the “primacy of the national dimension” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0486613411423893">Aglietta 1982</xref>: 6). According to Boyer, the ways countries are inserted into an international regime “is largely a matter of choice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">2005</xref>: 52). How countries “insert themselves” into the international regime is central, but so is how the international regime “inserts itself” into countries. The object of inquiry is one-sided if one only focuses on national choices, but not the international framework that influences these choices.</p>
<p>Second, the idea of the “model,” either as an ideal-type or as a prospective blueprint, is distinct from specific empirical national forms. Certainly, the success of the model can be analyzed in terms of its manifestation in national forms of economic regulation and accumulation. One might also expect a degree of convergence of functionally equivalent institutional architectures, initially to the extent that the international framework directly inspires a particular national institutional form. Regulatory convergence is also encouraged to the extent that the proposed model addresses common national problems of accumulation. Over the medium term, convergence is encouraged by the regulatory discipline and incentives underpinning facilitation of a particular national architecture.</p>
<p>Even under the above assumptions, a straightforward regulatory convergence is not implied. Though working within the constraints of the same international regulatory environment, each country executes the plan according to its own interpretation and within its unique, politically over determined, and path-dependent constraints. Further, the international regulatory framework will likely allow within its constraints a degree of national variability in the forms of capitalist regulation and production. In sum, even though the direction of adaption will tend to be similar, each country will adapt to the prevailing model of development according to its own uniquely constrained choices. Success of a model is partly about the extent of its influence on how countries regulate themselves, and partly about the quality and stability of the mode of living it promotes.</p>

<title>3.3 A Revised Outline of the Fordist Model of Development</title>
<p>Keynes’s <italic>The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</italic>, first published in 1936, addressed demand-side market instabilities. It focused particularly on the theme of unemployment, linked with capitalism’s catastrophic crash of the 1930s. <italic>The General Theory</italic> in the historical context of the Great Depression and the American New Deal together comprise the essential background to the framework for capitalist development constructed at Bretton Woods. A plan for stable capitalist development was also the priority of the allied countries because of high social expectations at the end of the war and the need to see off the threat of “communism.” The United States’s economic and military dominance made it the key player in the postwar reconstruction, centrally including financial reconstruction through the Marshall and MacArthur plans and in the formulation of the Bretton Woods framework.</p>
<p>In June 1944, under the auspices of the United Nations, 44 countries dominated by the United States and then the United Kingdom, met to hammer out a plan for postwar recovery and development. The central intellectual figures in the construction of the plan were chief negotiators John Maynard Keynes (U.K.) and Harry Dexter White (U.S.). Although the United States was dominant, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0486613411423893">Corbridge (1994a</xref>: 1825) and to Keynes himself, the “overall shape of the Bretton Woods agreement” was primarily driven by Keynes’s vision of national capitalist economies driven by demand-side state intervention to secure and maintain full employment.</p>
<p>The significance of the agreement is not just in the discursive promotion at the international level of a particular model of national regulation. The agreement also proposed forms of international regulation that provided national states with the opportunity and the capacity to achieve national-centered regulation and accumulation compatible with the Keynesian vision. The Keynesian welfare state was centrally facilitated by controls, negotiated at Bretton Woods, on international capital movements. Such controls were widely accepted as necessary in order to prevent the national destabilizing effects of private global finance that had dominated the interwar years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0486613411423893">Helleiner 1995</xref>: 317-318). In particular, controlling flows of international capital was viewed as fundamental to the capacity of national states to maintain a stable domestic economy. Both White and Keynes argued for such controls so that national states could maintain financial autonomy against the disruptive effects of international private financiers, protect the welfare state, and pass progressive social legislation without capital flight (op. cit.). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0486613411423893">Kalecki’s (1943)</xref> general argument, the Bretton Woods framework can be understood as a regulatory environment where the key to high employment levels would no longer be “business confidence,” which is predicated on high levels of international capital mobility, but rather national state-led economic management of domestic demand.</p>
<p>The Bretton Woods framework was also designed to facilitate international trade, but within the terms of an “agreed set of rules” and in a “spirit of cooperative interdependence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0486613411423893">Corbridge 1994b</xref>: 1,838). Practically, exchange rates pegged to the U.S. dollar acted as global reserve currency to facilitate this spirit. In addition, import regulations and the spirit of comparative, rather than competitive, advantage was promoted. According to Lipietz, international trade was only of “secondary importance” and the “ratio of exports to the internal market reached its lowest historical point towards 1965” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1987b</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>The Keynesian formula was central to the post-WWII class compromise because the labor movement’s two key goals, employment security and rising living standards, were made compatible. Wage-led, demand-driven, and national-centered modes of regulation could remain economically viable while countries were relatively protected by the constraints placed on capital’s international mobility. During this era, capital was more closely aligned with the national interest than ever before. While not directly prescribing a social democratic model of national economic regulation, this framework certainly facilitated the project.</p>
<p>The U.S. national experience, especially related to the New Deal, was also central to the construction of the postwar international economic order and, more directly, as the national exemplar for economic development. American statesmen, capitalists, and labor leaders fostered productivity- oriented political consensus and its production paradigm around the entire globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0486613411423893">Rupert 1995</xref>: 44). According to Maier, the U.S. blueprint sought “to adjourn class conflict for a consensus on growth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0486613411423893">1978</xref>: 23).</p>
<p>The Fordist project was applied to a group of similarly advanced capitalist countries which were all confronting the problem of how, given “intensive accumulation,” to achieve macroeconomic stability. These countries were also commonly facing an increasingly well-organized, articulate, and growing labor movement. In sum, the Fordist model of development, both as a blueprint and an international regulatory framework, facilitated a particular form of regulation of the capitalist mode of production that addressed the internal accumulation instability common to all advanced capitalist countries which had been manifested as the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The continuing stability of the Fordist model of development, considered as an “international configuration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1987</xref>: 82) of national accumulation regimes, was dependent on the consensual behaviors of participating national states to operate a Keynesian style of economic regulation. Following Corbridge, the Bretton Woods framework can be understood as a “broad set of guidelines that was adopted and adapted by member states quite flexibly” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0486613411423893">1994</xref>: 1,829), rather than as a disciplinary framework that compelled national compliance. As long as most countries followed the Keynesian formula, then the model of development could remain stable.</p>
<p>Compliance incentives, however, were weak and a number of countries opted out of the national-centered Keynesian model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">Boyer 2005</xref>: 515). For any given country, an export-driven accumulation strategy, as followed by the small social democratic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">Boyer 2005</xref>: 515), Japan, and then the newly industrializing countries (op. cit.), was an even more viable way for individual countries to achieve both intensive and stable accumulation. As countries opted out, the viability of autocentric accumulation for the rest was systematically undermined. For the rest, increasing domestic demand through wage increases encouraged growth overseas while undermining domestic accumulation and competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1987b</xref>). In sum, the Fordist model of development’s viability was undermined by the absence for national states of a disciplining regulatory imperative and clear incentive to opt out.</p>
<p>Tension in the framework also existed between the liberalizing and hegemonic aspirations of the United States, and Keynes’s radical plan for a genuinely cooperative model of international economic governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0486613411423893">Corbridge 1994b</xref>). Instead of a genuine global currency, as proposed by Keynes, the U.S. dollar became the international reserve currency. Instead of a central global bank whose function would be to balance accumulation between unevenly performing capitalist countries, as proposed by Keynes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0486613411423893">Corbridge 1994b</xref>: 1,839), the IMF and GATT were established and charged ultimately with liberalizing missions. This tension, especially as growth and profits began to falter in the ’seventies, undermined the model’s capacity to contain indefinitely the global tendencies of capital, particularly international finance capital.</p>
<p>As U.S. economic growth and dominance faltered, the liberalizing mission began to become more dominant. U.S. domestic priorities undermined the international reserve currency role of the U.S. dollar, and with the ending of fixed exchange rates for the U.S. dollar in 1971, the Keynesian substance of the Bretton Woods system began to crumble. In the new liberalizing environment, especially as national growth regimes stumbled, the globalizing tendencies of finance capital and productive capital could once again come to the fore. Finance steadily became more privatized, liberalized, and re-internationalized. Multi-national corporations centered in the advanced capitalist countries, as part of the process to counter falling profits, began to internationalize production by out-sourcing or relocating parts of their production to labor forces in the newly emerging low-wage capitalist economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0486613411423893">1997</xref>).</p>
<p>For the first time in capitalist history, a model of economic development was deliberately constructed and facilitated in practice. This model’s practice across the advanced capitalist countries in the post-WWII period resulted in stable economic growth and social progress for about a generation. Declining productivity, putting pressure on profits and wages, triggered the unravelling of its institutional forms and gave capital the opportunity to escape its national confinement. From the perspective of long-run capital logic, one could say that the Fordist model of development merely contained capital’s global tendencies for a while. However, such a view underestimates the extent to which recent capitalist history has changed the game permanently, not only by embedding specific norms associated with the Fordist era, but more generally by embedding the mentality of intervention and overdetermination.</p>

<title>4. Critiquing Boyer’s Accent on Diversity: Towards the Neoliberal Model of Development</title>
<p>Boyer’s turn to national diversity is the latest manifestation of the FRS’s failure to extend its mid-range account of recent capitalist history into the current era. Long-standing problems stem from its attachment to a narrow, especially counter-active, sense of regulation, and to limitations in its conception of a “model of development.” Reworking these concepts is central to overcoming the current impasse and to developing the FRS’s earlier advance towards a mid-range theory of capitalist development. In this segment of the paper, this project is pursued by critiquing Boyer’s new turn and providing, as an alternative, a brief outline of the neoliberal model of development.</p>
<p>Though the counter-active sense of regulation has always been central to the FRS perspective, prior to Boyer’s new turn, the mode of inquiry was grounded much more clearly in the capitalist mode of production rather than in the specificity of national experience. Following the earlier FRS mid-range perspective, recent capitalist history can be thought of as a novel iteration, including both mid-range and short-range cycles, of the repeating boom-bust logic of capitalist development. Counter-active regulation of the Fordist model of development delivered smooth and stable growth for about a generation. In contrast, the spontaneous crisis-recurring “jungle law” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0486613411423893">Peck and Tickell 1994</xref>) driven pattern of capitalist development since the ’eighties is the outcome to be expected, following the standard FRS perspective, in the absence of a counter-active regulation-driven model of development.</p>
<p>FRS reluctance to characterize the after-Fordist experience as a model of development also arises from its tendency to generalize Fordist experience. Marx presents a recurring critique of political economists who, while applying trans-historical relational categories to examine a particular historical epoch, fail to identify categories that govern an epoch’s particular relations. The FRS’s mid-range inversion of this problem is to treat the particular relations that characterized the Fordist experience as the general template through which all eras of capitalism are viewed.</p>
<p>The Fordist account is generalized in three major ways: class compromise is the preface to all models of development; regulation is necessarily counteractive; and a growth regime or model of development entails a smooth trajectory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">Boyer (2005)</xref> circumvents the lack of applicability of standard FRS concepts to the current era by carefully separating out the institutional configurations of different national capitalisms from a model of development, in the orthodox sense, that entails stable growth and similar institutional forms across a group of countries. Under such definitional constraints, the last thirty years necessarily equals the absence of a model of development. Boyer goes on to fill the void by characterizing the current time period as a diversity of “contemporary forms of capitalism” (ibid.: 522).</p>
<p>Boyer’s argument, technically, refers only to a diversity of national forms of regulation, since the capitalist mode of production is treated as an invariant background abstraction. Examining the extent of convergence in terms of the regulation of core capitalist forms is lost from the research agenda, and instead the theme of national diversity shifts attention to the contingent political struggles that endogenously generate specific path-dependent national trajectories. Resulting national diversity is seen to be reinforced because, according to evolutionist theory, “diverse trajectories tend to diverge over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0486613411423893">Dosi 2002</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">Boyer 2005</xref>: 516).</p>
<p>Boyer observes that the institutional forms of contemporary capitalist countries are empirically diverse, especially once “emerging economies” beyond the established family of advanced capitalist countries, characterized by an “ever larger diversity,” are included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">2005</xref>: 522). Nonetheless, he concludes not that there are as many different modes of capitalist regulation as there are countries, but instead constructs a typology of national institutional forms. A plethora of “international comparisons” (ibid.: 522) involving “quantitative and qualitative methods and various research strategies, ranking from automatic data clustering to macro economic modelling” (ibid.: 529) are deployed to distribute countries across a typology comprising “market oriented,” “meso-corporatist,” “statist,” and “social democratic” “brands of capitalism.”</p>
<p>Adopting in the present era the original FRS approach used to identify the Fordist model, minus the criterion of counteractive regulation and in contrast to Boyer’s current branding exercise, would require examining the extent or otherwise of national convergence towards a neoliberal model or “canon.” No contemporary template has been constructed by FRS writers, provisional or otherwise, which could define the range of criteria against which national convergence or divergence can be assessed. In any case, as argued here, the formula of national convergence towards a canonical form needs to be examined in the context of the revised conception of “model of development.” In such an approach, the capitalist form itself also becomes an active part of the explanation, and the model can be assessed in relation to whether it facilitates pro-active institutional convergence towards, or counter-active divergence from, core capitalist production relations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0486613411423893">Boyer’s (2005)</xref> central contention that the capitalist world is becoming more diverse misses the more significant point that the world is becoming more capitalist as all countries are increasingly drawn into the global logic of capital which has been unleashed by the neoliberal project. While national diversity and uneven development are observable, countries are being pushed in the direction of a similar template. This claim is now considered in the context of an outline of the “neoliberal model of development.”</p>
<p>The neoliberal model of development is the culminating framework within which the project of neoliberalization has been institutionalized as a global national nexus. The neoliberal template evolved ideologically alongside, and as a critical alternative to, the developing Fordist model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0486613411423893">Peck and Tickell 2003</xref>). In the ’seventies, proponents of the neoliberal project were quick to exploit the political opportunity created by the faltering of the Fordist model of development. Neoliberal ideology moved from university economics departments into the outlooks of the agents of key international agencies and into some national state apparatuses. Right wing governments elected in the United Kingdom in 1979 and the United States in 1980, spreading to other countries through the ’eighties, spelled the end of their class compromises and the movement of national states towards neoliberal institutional forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0486613411423893">Neilson 1998</xref>). National projects of the ’eighties directly reversed national centered Keynesian-style accumulation by applying monetarist theory, deregulating capital and trade flows, and privatizing nationally-owned strategic economic assets. Such national projects facilitated “neoliberal globalization,” defined as the regulatory transformation of the international terrain towards a global free market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0486613411423893">Cerny 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423893">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0486613411423893">Ryner 1997</xref>). In sum, this national model was facilitating, and being facilitated by, the resulting neoliberalization of the international economic environment.</p>
<p>Though via a less public process than that which produced the Bretton Woods framework, the “Washington Consensus,” established by the mid-eighties, similarly represents agreement around the elements of an international framework and a template set of prescriptions to be pursued at the national level. In prescribing a national “canonical brand of capitalism,” the Washington Consensus is strongly influenced by the neoliberal critique of Keynesianism. More specifically, the neoliberal template comprises a two-stage strategy of regulatory reform. The first stage, which undermines the continuing viability of Fordist regulation, opens countries to international market forces through trade and market liberalization. Renewed international capital mobility subordinates nation-states to business confidence, while, as Lipietz put it, making “Keynesianism in a single country” non-viable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0486613411423893">Jenson 1987</xref>: 23). In response to the destabilizing effects of the first stage, national regimes reduce public expenditure, implying welfare state retrenchment, and begin to neoliberalize economic and social policy through tax reforms and flexible labor markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0486613411423893">Standing 2003</xref>: 26-29). In sum, opening up the country to international competition undermines the credibility of Fordist regulation and validates a narrowly prescriptive style of pro-active capitalist regulation that deepens and extends the essential capitalist form.</p>
<p>At the same time, key international regulatory institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, and more recently the WTO have consistently prescribed and promoted this national template, while at the same time directly promoting and constructing the broader principle and framework of unimpeded global market regulation. Strict financial controls of the previous era, which provided stability and protection for nation-states, have been replaced by de-regulated forms of money, especially credit and national currencies. Through such mechanisms, regulatory power has been directly transferred into the hands of finance capital. These key international agencies have also directly promoted the national template via structural adjustment programs for developing countries, and “shock therapies” prescribed for the ex-communist bloc. The indirect power of international finance capital to regulate capitalist production relations across all the countries in the world, in turn, has reinforced neoliberalization within each country. More generally, international capital mobility has intensified and broadened the capitalist regulatory principle of competition.</p>
<p>Internationally mobile capital is advantaged by the competitive form of the relations between countries and between workforces. Key to capital’s new power is the enlarging of the market to a global stage, combined with the continuation of an international framework of discrete countries. Countries and their workforces are turned into direct competitors to attract and retain internationally scarce and mobile capital, which is the primary source of national prosperity and employment in the current era. In responding to competitiveness imperatives, each country adjusts institutionally towards the neoliberal iteration of capitalist regulation. While the mobility of capital enhances its power relative to national states, the latter have reduced power because global capitalist logic occupies a space beyond any form of democratic political control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0486613411423893">Hirsch 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0486613411423893">1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The restoration and deepening of the principle of competition that subordinates national states to the power of capital also promotes regulation that intensifies formal subordination. Labor market flexibility expresses capital’s power to exploit labor, and hire and fire, on its terms. Intensified competition between firms and between workers, nationally and internationally, reinforces employment insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0486613411423893">Standing 1997</xref>). The growing redundancy of labor on a global scale, linked with deepening international segmentation and labor market competition, divides and disempowers labor while also forcing wages down. In this environment a wedge is driven between employment and wages, and both income and employment insecurity are increased.</p>
<p>Intensified formal subordination, in turn, returns the capitalist mode of production to a coercive reinforcement of real subordination/relative surplus value regimes. In addition, neoliberal globalization has unleashed a logic that enables capital to simultaneously pursue absolute surplus value-based accumulation strategies. That is, the imposition of global capitalist productivity norms on developing countries has created a rapidly growing latent surplus population in the countryside that implies on-going increases to an already massive informal proletariat in the city slums. This increasing relative surplus population, central to capital’s contemporary global dominance, is the source of a new cheap global proletariat that underpins absolute surplus value strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0486613411423893">Davis 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0486613411423893">McMichael 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0486613411423893">Taylor 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0486613411423893">Neilson and Stubbs 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The present neoliberal era not only restores capitalism’s basic regulatory dynamic, interrupted for about a generation by Fordism. It also deepens and broadens capitalism’s basic principles by promoting the transformation of national states and labor into directly capitalist forms. National states come closer to being “committees for managing the affairs of the bourgeoisie,” and more specifically, they become directly entrepreneurialized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0486613411423893">Cerny 2003</xref>). Instead of being democratic associations, national states become quasi-entrepreneurial associations limited in their room for manoeuvre within the priority of international competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0486613411423893">Petit 1999</xref>: 237).</p>
<p>The labor movement is forced also to validate itself in terms of the priorities of the competition state. Workers have become wedded to and divided by individual capitalist enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1992</xref>: ch. 4). The neoliberal contractualization of employment relations that underpins the return to pre-wage relation types of self-employment has entrepreneurialized even the most subordinated workers. Abolition of work in the industrial sector has facilitated an even more comprehensive commodification of social activities, as low-skill service sector work spreads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0486613411423893">Neilson 2007</xref>).More broadly, the proletariat of the advanced capitalist societies, in particular, appear infected by a neoliberal mentality that naturalizes competition, competitiveness, and competitive individualism. Aglietta neatly summarizes the effects of this logic: “… the globalization of enterprises intensifies competition, and hence the preponderance of capitalist interests, throughout the entire social fabric of each nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0486613411423893">1998b</xref>: 67).</p>
<p>However, new regulatory projects cannot completely reverse learnt behaviors and habits characteristic of the previous regulatory iteration of the capitalist mode of production. Vestiges of the institutions, discourses, and expectations of the Fordist model of development continue to live on, but with goals and functions adapted to the neoliberal project. In particular, although the neoliberal project in its original conception was strongly opposed to welfare and state-led economic management, it has been compelled pragmatically towards state-led projects and the retention of the welfare state. The “Schumpeterian workfare state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0486613411423893">Jessop 1993b</xref>), conceptually parallel to the Keynesian welfare state, acts to modify but not abolish all aspects of the latter. Instead, workfare, in either its hard neoliberal or soft neoliberal (Third Way) form, modifies welfare to the goal of labor market flexibility, rather than, as in the Fordist era, protecting people from market logic. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0486613411423893">Jessop argues (1994)</xref>, social policy, particularly including labor markets, becomes reoriented towards competitiveness and away from welfare security and redistribution. The Third Way, though state active, is a competitiveness strategy directed towards the deliberate supply-side, innovation-driven structuring of national advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0486613411423893">Albo 1997</xref>). At national levels political intervention occurs to promote competitive advantage, and at the international level, to stabilize the latest capitalist crisis.</p>
<p>A growing family of capitalist countries pursue a common direction of national change as they adapt to the imperatives of neoliberalized global capitalism. In addition, all countries are pushed towards forms of regulation that are compatible with the globally dominant lean configuration of capitalist production. However, convergence towards a common national institutional form of capitalist production relations is not the simple or direct effect. On the one hand, countries have path dependent specific histories and are at different stages of development. On the other hand, competition between firms is multi-dimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0486613411423893">Coriat 1997</xref>), and the dominant lean production paradigm is internationally segmented into different stages. Countries attempt to manoeuvre their institutional forms within these economic and political constraints in ways that enable competitive engagement. A global lean system of production based on networked firms operating at different stages of the production process is internationally distributed. High-skill stages are located in advanced countries where skill bases and wage levels are higher, and low-skill stages are sub-contracted to low-wage developing countries. Countries, in direct competition with each other to win over international capital, are more or less successful. At one pole are wealthy and powerful countries, and at the other are bankrupt dysfunctional nations with no means to participate competitively within the framework of neoliberal globalization.</p>
<p>As a partial evolution beyond this form of the international division of labor, national states begin to converge towards adoption of a basically functionally equivalent institutional format that combines in the same country both high-skill segments and low-skill, low-waged workforce segments, or what Lipietz called the “inconsistent hybrid” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0486613411423893">Lipietz 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0486613411423893">Leborgne and Lipietz 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0486613411423893">O’Neil 2005</xref>). This national segmentation tendency is enabled by the labor market flexibility associated with neoliberalized national modes of labor market regulation. High levels of unemployment in the Northern European countries push them away from “solidarity” towards segmentation, and the facilitation of a low-wage service sector. Amongst some of the more established newly developing capitalist countries, movement up to the lean national hybrid may occur as they transfer accumulated wealth derived from its low-skill, low-wage workforce into the promotion of a high-skill workforce segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0486613411423893">Neilson 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The specific history of some countries may politically constrain choices away from the neoliberal project, but the imperatives of international competitiveness and business confidence still push such countries towards this project. The examples of Sweden and China illustrate the argument. Sweden continues to retain social democratic principles of regulation, but it is being compromized in a neoliberal direction by the imperatives of global competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0486613411423893">Ryner 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0486613411423893">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0486613411423893">Meidner 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0486613411423893">1997</xref>). While China continues to maintain regulatory elements of its communist state-led mode of regulation, it has adapted rapidly to the imperatives of neoliberal global capitalism to become the world’s most successful low-cost competition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0486613411423893">He and Wu 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0486613411423893">Hung 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The neoliberal model of development has facilitated and intensified to a global dynamic the core motivations of the capitalist mode of production; delivered an extending power of capital over an increasingly insecure labor force; and promoted national convergence towards a common template. However, even under neoliberalism’s narrow and universal prescriptive form, straightforward national convergence is unlikely. Instead, uneven convergence is occurring and each national state adapts, within its endogenously determined path-dependent constraints, to the current global configuration of the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Fordist model, the neoliberal model is characterized by a deeply unstable crisis-ridden trajectory of development. The deliberate calibration of productivity and wages that was central to stable growth under Fordism is reversed under the present neoliberal era where wages lag behind productivity growth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0486613411423893">Boyer and Juillard 2002c</xref> on the U.S. case). Key to the difference is that the effects of international competition, especially the global wage “race to the bottom” and the growing population surplus to capitalism’s requirements, create a permanent demand-side deficit that is only partly countered by the massive increase in credit and the growth in size and spending-power of segments of the new middle class.</p>
<p>The systemic and global nature of capitalism’s current crisis reinforces the view that rather than simply comprising a diversity of unique national experiences, countries are all inter-connected as elements of the neoliberal iteration of the capitalist mode of production. The current crisis also reinforces the centrality of the international dimension to this regulatory framework, not only as a framework of competition but as one driven directly by private financial regulators. The present crisis has been contained for the meantime but, it would appear, only by intensifying the unstable logic of credit-driven neoliberal regulation. Furthermore, the neoliberal model of development that has unleashed the logic of capital on a global scale is intensifying long-term tendencies towards “a downward spiral of social and ecological competition, leading to recurrent financial, business and environmental crises” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0486613411423893">Leborgne and Lipietz 1992</xref>: 348).</p>
<p>Examination into the future of these long-term structural tendencies needs to be linked with further advancement of the medium-range Marxist explanation of capitalist development. Only once the mid-range account is harnessed with the long-range account can we begin in earnest to conceptualize a first stage blueprint or model of socialist development that can avert the current spiral of descent into the abyss. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0486613411423893">Lipietz (1994</xref>: 356), an alternative national blueprint that represents a new progressive social compromise cannot be established outside of a “non-aggressive” global economic order. However, even in the present this urgent project still remains undeveloped.</p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>The advancement of FRS mid-range theory into the current phase of capitalist development has been put on hold by Boyer’s focus on the persistence of varying forms of national regulation and his portrayal of the current time period as a diversity of national capitalisms. Critical examination of Boyer’s new project has exposed limitations in the original FRS approach. Problems stem from the FRS sense of regulation as only counter-active and external to an under-theorized capitalist mode of production, and from the conflation of the method for measuring the existence of a model of development, itself flawed, with a model of development itself.</p>
<p>In this paper, and in contrast to current FRS thinking, a dynamic capitalist mode of production is writ large, and regulation, both counter-active and pro-active, is presented as internal and responsive to capitalism’s imperatives and regulatory dilemmas. In addition, rather than conflating national convergence with the existence of a dominant model of development, the paper has defined a model of development as the trans-national conception, inspiration, and facilitation of a particular national form of capitalist regulation. Though the model, in this sense, generates a degree of national convergence, it also implies the continuation of national variation.</p>
<p>The neoliberal and Fordist models are similar in the generic sense that both are blueprints or projects which became embedded as international-national nexuses. However, compared to the Fordist national blueprint, the neoliberal national blueprint has a much more precise and prescriptive formulation, a common template applied to both developing and developed capitalist countries. Also in contrast to the Fordist model of development, the neoliberal model does not exhibit, at the national level, a class compromise-driven counter-active mode of regulation or a stable growth pattern. Instead, the neoliberal project has facilitated a pro-active market model of regulation that has unleashed the basic motivational drivers of the capitalist mode of production and generated a crisis-ridden path of unequal growth and social inequality within and across the countries of the world. While the international framework of the Fordist model facilitated the possibility of progressive national trajectories, even though countries could opt out, the neoliberal model has done the reverse. It has not only facilitated neoliberal national trajectories, but has limited the capacity for countries to opt out because all countries are subject to the power of international capital. In sum, the present model of development, unlike Fordism, has generated a dangerously unstable trajectory, but there has been no systemic crisis because, unlike Fordism again, the neoliberal project enjoys both the active embrace of capital and a structure that aggressively maintains national compliance.</p>
<p>The mid-range account of capitalist development presented recasts and reasserts the trajectory of development originally initiated by Althusser’s rebel sons. In particular, the FRS’s reduction of over-determination to counter-active regulation has undermined its capacity, as taken up in this essay, to recognize over-determination in pro-capitalist forms of regulation, or more generally as the political imprint directly present in the changing forms of the capitalist mode of production. Moreover, the argument presented here—while recognizing the usefulness of the over-determination concept for understanding national variation—has emphasized the sense of over-determination in the medium-term logic of capitalist development. Certainly, capitalist history has patterns of development that are grounded in the economic determination of capitalism’s boom-bust logic, and by long-term structural tendencies. Beyond this economic mode logic, however, capitalist history is politically over-determined by struggle between, on the one side, recurring versions of the dominant project that express the “consciousness and will of capital” and, on the other side, “counter-hegemonic” struggles to shift capitalism towards a progressive alternative. While the political economic parameters of the capitalist mode of production constrain the struggle, the accumulation of regulatory knowledge and capacity over time still points contingently and uncertainly beyond capital logic towards conscious counter-regulation. The urgent counter-hegemonic task in the present is to construct a new blueprint or model of development that can overcome the deepening instability and insecurity of the current model, and in doing so create the basis for the formation of a progressive counter-hegemonic social bloc.</p>
