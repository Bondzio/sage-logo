<p>
<italic>Beyond the Death Penalty</italic> is the product of a 2-day international conference hosted by the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights in 2010. Of the 48 papers presented at the conference, which was organized around the 150th anniversary of the last public execution in the Netherlands, 19 essays on various aspects of punishment and justice were included. The chapters are divided into five major sections: historical and cultural background, punishment in a populist context, reconciliation and rehabilitation, prison life, and efficiency and effectiveness. As reflected in these varied topical areas, this book aims to provide different angles and perspectives in its contribution to current debates on punishment.</p>
<p>The keynote speakers at the conference included David Garland (sociology), Chrisje Brants (criminology and criminal law), and Hans Boutellier (public administration). Garland follows the book’s introduction with a discussion on the evolution of the death penalty in Western cultures. He argues that “[t]he death penalty is always and everywhere an exercise of state power” (p. 15), and is continuously shaped by cultural and political forces. He concludes that humanitarianism and liberalism (which he distinguishes from civilization and democracy) have impacted the decline in the use of the death penalty. In particular, recent reform efforts have shifted the focus on the death penalty from the domestic policy arena to an international issue of human rights.</p>
<p>Brants considers a paradox in the Netherlands: compared to other European countries, the Netherlands was the first to abolish the death penalty and the last to have public executions. She reviews various theories to help explain this apparent contradiction, and concludes that the social, political, and legal–cultural context of the Netherlands left abolition as the only option. Brants finds that the perception of public executions as legitimate and the link between legal traditions and legal culture are important for understanding this apparent “backwardness” yet “progressiveness of total abolition” (p. 43).</p>
<p>The third keynote speaker shifts the conversation from the death penalty in historical context to punishment in the populist context. Boutellier describes populists groups—such as the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands and the Tea Party Movement in the United States—as opposing the establishment, having charismatic leadership, and emphasizing unity and patriotism. He questions why these groups are particularly tough on crime, and finds that issues of safety and security “stand for something that is bigger than the actual crime problem” (p. 98). Boutellier recommends that by viewing society as small, local entities that comprise the social order, criminal justice appears to be a system of support in a fairly stable society instead of a reaction to chaos.</p>
<p>
<italic>Beyond the Death Penalty</italic> opens with six chapters on the death penalty (including the papers by Garland and Brants), and covers issues related to reform, abolition and de facto abolition, imprisonment as an alternative punishment and international obligations to abolish the death penalty. As the title suggests, the subsequent chapters expand past the death penalty in their discussions of punishment and justice.</p>
<p>In attempting to provide a broad reach topically, the table of contents may appear disjointed from a brief skim. Some readers may be turned off to the large scope of the book, or may seek out a particular chapter or section (especially since some of the chapters are directed at narrow historical timeframes and policies or practices in specific locations). However, as different as each chapter is from the next, they all follow a similar structure and style and the book is well organized. The advantage in pulling this array of essays into one book is that it provides the opportunity for the reader to connect themes and think about punishment broadly. State legitimacy, balancing the victim perspective with justice for the larger public benefit, revenge, forgiveness, crimes that ignite moral outrage and disgust, the role of religion in a traditional punitive sense and through the reconciliation lens of restorative justice, and efficiency and effectiveness—to name just a few of the topics debated and analyzed—are issues scholars often grapple with when trying to understand, justify, and reflect on punishment and justice. Although the chapters originated from presentations at a human rights conference, they take an objective stance, reviewing the issues on both sides and providing thoughtful commentary.</p>
<p>This book is designed for criminologists, sociologists, penologists, psychologists, legal scholars, legal philosophers, legal historians, and others in related fields. The 24 contributors also have varied professional backgrounds and are primarily Dutch and Belgian scholars (although other countries, notably the United States, have contributors or are incorporated as comparisons in many of the pieces). With the exception of survey research findings on the ethics of sex robotics and preliminary meta-analysis results on intervention programs in the Netherlands, the book is largely qualitative in nature.</p>
<p>From the pessimistic outlook on “What Works” in the 1970s to policy shifts geared toward rehabilitation and treatment in recent decades, views on crime, punishment, and justice are continuously evolving and complex issues in search of policy answers. <italic>Beyond the Death Penalty</italic> is a good starting point for redirecting many of these multifaceted conversations and expanding the international discussion on punishment.</p>
