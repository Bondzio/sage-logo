<p>Drawing mainly on contemporary Ottoman chronicles, European travellers’ accounts, memoirs and newspaper articles, Ebru Boyar and Kate Fleet’s study seeks to present an engrossing picture of Ottoman Istanbul. The book begins with a short political history of the Ottoman Empire from 1453 to 1923. Then, in each chapter, the authors vividly describe different aspects of life in the imperial capital, such as political violence, natural disasters, welfare institutions, festivities, and consumption patterns. Through the course of their narrative the reader finds himself in the midst of sensational murder cases and political upheavals, as well as pleasure gardens and hamams. However, at several points in their account Boyar and Fleet reproduce uncritically the views and perspectives of contemporary Ottoman and European sources.</p>
<p>This tendency becomes visible in Chapter 3 where they analyse Janissary violence in the streets of the capital. Although at several points they mention the close relations between the Janissary Corps and certain urban groups in Istanbul, such as artisans and shopkeepers, the authors focus on their criminal records at the expense of a more detailed analysis of their social composition and everyday lives. By drawing mostly on the works of Ottoman chroniclers, they portray the corps as ‘a violent mob, disruptive, aggressive and often out of control’ (99). While they label various Janissary revolts with terms such as ‘unruly behavior’, ‘chaos’, ‘anarchy’ and ‘seditious action’, Boyar and Fleet do not question whether any of these revolts reflect social and political changes that the Ottoman polity and society underwent from the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries. In addition, they fail to interrogate the political agendas and ambitions of the Ottoman chroniclers writing on the janissaries and other ‘disruptive’ social groups. In this regard, the authors uncritically reiterate the traditional and dominant historiography on janissaries that views the corps as a corrupted institution composed of the criminal elements of Ottoman society. Likewise, in Chapter 6 where they discuss the gardens of Istanbul, Boyar and Fleet overlook the ethnic and religious heterogeneity of the city, instead adopting the term ‘Turk’ (used by the American and European writers to which they refer) to define the city’s population (220–30).</p>
<p><italic>A Social History of Ottoman Istanbul </italic>primarily highlights the continuities and sameness in the lives of people and the policies of the Ottoman state over the course of centuries. For this purpose, when Boyar and Fleet discuss a certain topic, such as festivities and celebrations, clothing laws, or security of the markets, they frequently combine events taking place in different centuries in a single paragraph, and in several cases within the same sentence. In their analysis of pageantry in Chapter 2, for instance, they mention in the same context the ruling elites from the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries: ‘Abdülmecid (1839–1861) ordered cannon to be fired for his accession in 1839, and cannon roared from the imperial arsenal for the accession of Selim II in 1566’ (46). Here is another example from Chapter 5:<disp-quote>
<p>The Venetian ambassador Alvise Contarini also recorded in his report to the senate after his return from Istanbul in 1641 that theft was rare. This was apparently true also for the nineteenth century, when Charles Pertusier commented on the security of the market, even arguing that too much contact with the Europeans had had a bad effect on the Turks’ natural honesty. (172)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In following such an approach, Boyar and Fleet tend to flatten historical time and overlook the historical context and specificity of each period under consideration.</p>
<p>While most of the study deals with the historical continuities in the imperial capital of the Ottoman Empire, Boyar and Fleet devote Chapter 8 to social changes taking place in the nineteenth century, and concentrate their attention mostly on the changes in the consumption patterns of the upper-class Ottoman men and women. They mention how Ottoman women ‘followed the latest fashion from the French fashion magazines’ (299) or how the fez ‘became such an integral part of the Ottoman dress code that no Ottoman gentleman could function without one’ (302). However, their narrative is silent when it comes to the question of how the lower classes in Istanbul, such as artisans and workers, experienced nineteenth-century social change. In other words, Boyar and Fleet seek to analyse social change in the landscape of Istanbul without paying attention to the realm of production and, more importantly, to the question of social inequality.</p>
<p>The intended audience of this work should perhaps have been defined in the introductory chapter of the book. But regardless of its audience, Boyar and Fleet’s vivid account remains unfortunately defined by its shortcomings; namely a tendency to flatten historical time, a preoccupation with elites as principal agents of social change, and a failure to problematize historical texts.</p>
