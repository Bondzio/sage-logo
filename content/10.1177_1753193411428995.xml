<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Preiser’s disease is an avascular necrosis of the scaphoid. It is uncommon, the aetiology is unknown, and there is usually no history of trauma. Diagnosis is made by imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals no fracture line.</p>
<p>A 13-year-old youth presented with wrist pain of a few month’s duration. Imaging revealed unusual density in the scaphoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411428995">Figure 1</xref>). There was no history of trauma or any risk factors for avascular necrosis. The wrist had not been immobilized before we treated him using a vascularized graft.</p>

<p>A posterior approach allowed access to the scaphoid and site of harvesting of the graft. After capsulotomy, the zone of necrosis was hollowed out through a chondral flap and samples were sent for histological analysis. The radial growth plate was identified by fluoroscopy and a corticocancellous bone graft, pedicled on the 1,2 supraretinacular artery, and was harvested proximal to the radial growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411428995">Zaindemberg et al., 1991</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411428995">Figure 2</xref>). Temporary K-wire fixation and plaster cast immobilization were maintained for 3 months. Histology of the curettage samples confirmed osteonecrosis. At the last follow-up 9 years after the procedure, the patient was pain-free with a Mayo wrist score of 93 points. No additional surgery was required. Radiographs were normal and contrast enhanced MRI revealed an improvement in the scaphoid signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411428995">Figure 3</xref>). These features indicate revascularization.</p>

<p>There are two options for the management of early stage Preiser’s disease in children: immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411428995">Gallie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411428995">Jensen and Leicht, 1995</xref>) or bone grafting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411428995">Jensen and Leicht (1995)</xref> reported on a 10-year-old child with the condition treated by immobilization for 3 weeks. At last follow-up, 28 months after immobilization, they reported improvement in pain and imaging. There are currently no specific criteria for the use of surgical treatment in children or adolescents. However, in our patient the diffusely abnormal MRI signal correlated with complete bone necrosis in the histological samples, and this might be a justification to carry out a revascularization procedure. We have found only one report about the use of a pedicled bone graft for the treatment of avascular necrosis of the carpal bones in children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411428995">Waters and Stewart (2002)</xref> reported the outcomes of three patients treated for scaphoid nonunion complicated by avascular necrosis of proximal pole. They reported consolidation in every instance after a mean 3.4 months. Based on this and our own experience, it is our opinion that a modified Zaidemberg’s procedure (with a more proximal harvest of the bone graft) should be considered as a treatment option for Preiser’s disease in children and adolescents. In skeletally immature patients, the donor site of a Zaidemberg vascularized bone graft should be shifted proximally to avoid damage to the growth plate. At this level the artery is smaller, but the blood supply of the bone graft is still adequate, as confirmed after tourniquet release. Another technical difficulty is to carry out complete curettage of the necrotic bone.</p>
