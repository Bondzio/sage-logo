<p>In the summer 2009 issue, I wrote about a proposed new media-heavy curriculum and called it “how one would really blow up a J-school curriculum.” I know anecdotally that at least a few JMC programs around the United States compared and contrasted the new media skills they were teaching or were planning to teach with the ideal/idealistic curriculum that I wrote about here (but which I did not design).</p>
<p>I’m back on the topic, but sharing with you an innovative curriculum that was designed from scratch, and already is in place—in a bilingual School of Communication in Spain, specifically at IE University, the university that has grown up from IE Business School (one of the five best in Europe and thus highly ranked worldwide) and was launched in autumn 2008.</p>
<p>IE Business School itself is not only private, but privately owned; it was founded by Diego del Alcázar (Tenth Marquis of la Romana), who in September 2007 was appointed chairman of Spain’s largest media conglomerate, Vocento, which owns the ABC national newspaper, regional newspapers, online media, television, and radio operations. Despite the marquis’s substantial wealth, the launching of IE University from IE Business School was still a huge risk and a huge investment for its owners—meaning that they had to do an awful lot right in terms of curriculum, hiring faculty, and marketing the university to potential students throughout Europe and the United States. And this was against a backdrop of the so-called Bologna Accords (1999) to more or less standardize European higher education by 2010.</p>
<p>Dr. Samuel Martín-Barbero, an IE Business School professor specializing in corporate communications, was appointed dean, and he and others (including significant advice from Penn’s Annenberg School for Communication) conducted a comprehensive analysis of what other universities were doing and not doing, what was feasible, necessary, and ideal. Eight of the “nine provocative ideas for change” (my paraphrasing here) were: fulfilling minimum local, national, and European recommendations is not enough to maximize quality; accreditation requirements are inadequate if they do not result in study abroad and fluency in a second language; all communication subdisciplines must obtain enough resources to pursue teaching excellence; “ironclad” defense of senior faculty and long-time courses is counterproductive when major change is needed; it is necessary to implement policies and strategies to achieve excellence in faculty, students, and curriculum, collect empirical evidence of that excellence, and work toward employers recognizing such excellence with appropriate salaries; “it is inappropriate to negotiate internship agreements, many of them unpaid positions, without first being able to influence the conditions and characteristics of the permanent positions and freelance opportunities offered by those same companies”; “expand[ing] multimedia infrastructures and resources” should be dependent upon attempts to “optimize, recycle, renew or eliminate existing” media; a university should not obtain additional research funding unless faculty are finishing and publishing their studies, and also working with industry experts and international peers; and communication scholars should have an “entrepreneurial spirit in the evolution of the area of communication knowledge.”</p>
<p>The ninth idea, which Martín-Barbero listed fourth, said in full:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is fruitless to continue a policy of hyperactive marketing of an ever-burgeoning portfolio of degrees with the objective of attracting more students, while remaining ignorant of the reality of the demand in the labour market and what the competition is doing, as well as when there is a transfer of recruitment and external prescriptor/advisor commitments to the faculty body itself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This list of nine “provocative ideas” led to nine recommendations/proposals for a new School of Communication at IE University. They were that the school had to execute:</p>
<list id="list1-1077695811430941" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“new concepts and actions such as ‘internationalization,’ ‘excellence,’ “entrepreneurship,’ ‘competitiveness,’ ‘recruitment and retention of talent,’ the figure of ‘mentor,’ ‘professional opportunities,’ and ‘bonuses.’”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“no abstract or functional basis for separating and isolating the diverse areas of knowledge and professional disciplines” (“Journalism, Advertising and Public Relations, and Audiovisual Communications”) because “they could be offered as specializations during the last year of a foundation communications degree programme.” Already, Martín-Barbero and his colleagues pointed out, students are and were obtaining joint degrees in communication and law (remember, this is Spain), or communication and business, which they perceived as even stronger than a joint degree in journalism and advertising/public relations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“English should be introduced alongside Spanish from the very beginning of any academic communication programme . . .”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“create a multicultural environment by activating an international recruitment tactic . . .”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“make . . . mandatory” courses whose titles include terms “such as ‘globalization,’ ‘minorities,’ ‘philanthropy,’ ‘lobbies,’ ‘audience measurement,’ ‘the consumer society,’ ‘digital literacy,’ ‘virtual communities,’ ‘risk management,’ ‘a correspondent’s work and special reports,’ and ‘multimedia reporting,’ among others.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a “MediaLab, a central contents unit interconnected with the television studio, the radio station, the editing rooms, the control room and the digital press editing centre”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“an individualized off-campus professional-mentoring programme,” starting with the student’s freshman year, which would give a “jumpstart” to their professional education and prepare them for an internship later</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>courses including longer seminar sessions, which would vary in content, format, etc.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>each university’s communication program focusing on its own areas and goals of excellence rather than universities’ communication programs engaging in collective groupthink and “clinging to the status quo that inevitably leads to diminished relevance.”</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>So what did they come up with in terms of curriculum? (Note that this a 240-credit curriculum, so split in half the credit count to convert it into the equivalent of a U.S. 120-credit degree plan.) First year, first semester: four courses called core: Mass and New Media (6 credits); Globalization (6); Contemporary History (6); Foreign Language (6); and two courses called mandatory: Humanities (6) and Ethics (3).</p>
<p>First year, second semester: two courses called core: Culture, Literature, Art and Image; and Freedom of Speech; and four called mandatory: Digital Literacy (3); Organizational Management (6); Minorities (3); and Interpersonal Skills (3).</p>
<p>Second year, first semester: two courses called core: International Relations (6) and Sociology of Consumption (6), and three called mandatory: Media Corporations (6); Information Law: Media Regulation (6); and Audiovisual Language (6).</p>
<p>Second year, second semester: two courses called core: Multimedia Reporting (6) and Corporate Communication (6); and three courses called mandatory: Public Opinion and Political Communication (6); E-Government: Democracy and Technology (6); and Journalistic Genres (6).</p>
<p>Third year, first semester: one course called core: Ethics (3); and seven courses called mandatory: Intellectual Property (3); Virtual Communities (3); Digital Content Management: Design and Production (3); Spanish-American Journalism (6); Brand Management: Marketing and Public Relations (6); Advertising Planning (6); and Professional Deontology (3).</p>
<p>Third year, second semester: one course called core: Organizational Skills (3); and five courses called mandatory: E-Commerce (6); Protocol (3); Cross-Cultural Communication and Development (6); Anglo-American Journalism (6); and Audience Research (6).</p>
<p>Fourth year, first semester: 6 credits of work on a mandatory final project, plus courses in one of four tracks: Journalistic Communication, Corporate Communication, Audiovisual Communication, or Communication. The first specifies courses in Radio Announcing and TV Presenting (6), World and Special Correspondents (6), and Investigative Reporting (6). The second specifies courses in Pressure Groups and Networks (6), Crisis Communication (6), and Media Management (6). The third specifies courses in Scenography Directing and Events Management (6); Creative Multimedia Design and Visual Thinking (6); and Digital Post-Production (6). The fourth allows for 18 credits of the student’s choice.</p>
<p>Fourth year, second semester: again, 6 credits of work on a mandatory final project, plus courses in the four tracks. Here, the Journalistic Communication track is: Photojournalism (6), Specialized Writing (6), Public Diplomacy (6), Specialized Journalism (6), and Media Coverage and New Channels and Formats (6). The Corporate Communication track is: Strategic Communication and Internal Communication (6), Communication Consulting (6), Advertising Creativity (6), Specialized Writing (6), and Public Diplomacy (6). The Audiovisual Communication track is: Scriptwriting and Storytelling (6); Broadcast Performance (6), Representing Reality: Fiction and Non-Fiction (6), Creative Industries and New Audiovisual Formats (6); and Photography and Digital Image. Again, the Communication track is simply 30 credits of electives.</p>
<p>Before I comment on the curriculum, which is intriguing in numerous ways, I will say a little about the full-time and part-time faculty, which is officially 27 strong (giving the IE School of Communication a mind-bogglingly low student-faculty ratio, at least until enrollment takes off). First, 14 of them hold a PhD and another holds two law degrees (LLB and LLM). Second, my count is that about 10 of them are not natives of Spain, hailing originally from the USA, Canada, Ecuador, Mexico, Poland, and Switzerland; and 10 are women. Ages seem to range from early 30s to at least 60. So the diversity of the faculty is notable. So is this: of the 14 PhDs, only 6 are in communication or mass communication, the others ranging from urban planning to social anthropology to literature. This reminds me of Northwestern’s Medill faculty: a minority of full-time faculty hold the doctorate, and a majority of them earned one in something other than (mass) communication. At IE, it is a rich stew, but one wonders whether its faculty, in a new program, can all be on the same page, or even speaking the same language.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was asked to guest lecture at IE University in November 2009, and also was asked to review the overall curriculum design and the Fall Semester 2009 syllabi. For the latter, I wrote about 10,000 words, overwhelmingly favorable, while also trying to provide some advice about various types of assessment, course by course. I’ll provide a few highlights here.</p>
<p>I thought the first-year curriculum is exceptionally well balanced between the social sciences, humanities, and business-oriented courses. And it is nicely balanced between the past (Contemporary History, parts of Freedom of Speech; parts of Culture, Literature, Art and Image; parts of Mass and New Media; and the first-year humanities course offered at the time, History of Ideas) and the present. The second year moves somewhat away from the humanities and toward the social sciences, and the fourth year is completely devoted to professional JMC courses. The obvious weak point in the School of Communication curriculum is that it gives essentially no attention to the sciences (as contrasted with technologies). But I liked how the first-year curriculum also importantly puts Ethics front and center, not as a course that “rounds out” a professional curriculum near its end, nor a strictly theoretical course for the philosophically inclined, but as a crucial course, a foundation and a context for knowledge and skills learned later. The IE curriculum in the third year notably circles back to ethics with a communication industries/professions course called Professional Deontology.</p>
<p>The IE School of Communication’s curriculum also quite appropriately, and unusually, emphasizes communication law and regulation through the Freedom of Speech course in the first-year curriculum; the Information Law: Media Regulation course in the second-year curriculum; and Intellectual Property in the third-year curriculum. Media law/regulation issues also are addressed in parts of up to five other courses in the program. This curriculum is serious about media law and regulation, and students cannot help but be favorably impacted by this.</p>
<p>Another key theme of the IE School of Communication that is well executed by the curriculum is the emphasis on business, economics, management, leadership, and organization in all of their relevant manifestations. This includes Organizational Management (first year); Media Economics and Corporations, and Corporate Communication (both second year); Brand Management: Marketing and Public Relations, Advertising Planning, Audience Research, E-Commerce, and Organizational Skills (all third year); and Economic and Financial News and Information, and Corporate Communication program–required Media Management (all fourth year).</p>
<p>I told the IE School of Communication that it had the right courses slotted in the right years, with a possible exception being that Media Management should be moved to being a required course for third-year students (from being a fourth-year course only for Corporate Communication students), swapping it with Advertising Planning. I also noted that if all professional coursework is only in the second- and fourth-year curricula, students may forget much between the end of the second year and beginning of the fourth.</p>
<p>My most frequent criticism of syllabi was that most courses were requiring very little research and/or writing, but I probably would say that about most courses at most institutions. Otherwise, for example, I noted that the syllabus for Mass and New Media (at least then) included four books on mass communication theory and none devoted entirely to research methods, even though the course is supposed to cover both. In fact, I suggested that research methods be moved out of the first year, to either a second- or third-year course, or at least to the beginning of the fourth-year Final Research/Applied Project. Failing that, I suggested that the course at least cover theory, then methodology, rather than mixing them together all semester. But, overall, my criticisms were few, and I like the curriculum a great deal, especially the way that it explicitly and implicitly ties journalism so strongly to democracy, international relations, ethics, and law. (Can you imagine a U.S. journalism school requiring a course on public diplomacy?) I hope that prospective journalism, public relations, and advertising students take a good, hard look at IE University’s School of Communication and get an idea of what a gem it is. And then there’s the campus, in the sensitively renovated, former Santa Cruz la Real Convent, founded in 1218. How many universities have, for example, a chapel balcony used by <italic>the</italic> Queen Isabella?</p>
