<p>This column is a regular feature about the CDS/ISIS software package running under MS/DOS or Microsoft Windows on personal computers. It also includes news of J-ISIS (JavaISIS) from UNESCO and ABCD, BIREME’s integrated library system which retains compatibility with CDS/ISIS.</p>
<p>Readers who have any comments, queries, suggestions, hints or advice on the use of the package are asked to send them direct to:</p>

<title>Information and user lists for CDS/ISIS and ABCD</title>
<p>There is a list available in which users of CDS/ISIS, J-ISIS and ABCD can request information from other users. Information can be found at http://lists.iccisis.org/listinfo/isis-users. Much of the correspondence is in Spanish but many of the announcements from the developers working for BIREME are in English and Spanish. It is also archived at http://lists.iccisis.org/pipermail/isis-users/ where discussions can be searched by subject over the period of the list. There is also a useful search interface at http://www.isis-users.amisis.org/.</p>
<p>There are a number of experts in CDS/ISIS, for example Ernesto Spinak who is a consultant for BIREME who have now taken over the development of CDS/ISIS from UNESCO along with undertaking the development of ABCD. The mx utilities were developed by BIREME using the C language and they work in parallel to CDS/ISIS for Windows. Bridgette Heron of The National Library of Jamaica asked “Can the MX utility be used to identify/search for and print to a text file the numbers of the logically deleted records in CDS/ISIS for Windows; by MFN number and/or by titles?” Ernesto Spinak then challenged the users of the list to help her in this. The information is available on the list and should be looked at to savour the atmosphere of the list!</p>
<p>In the meantime he suggested the easiest solution is to use the application Swiss Knife (SWK) which can be downloaded from UNESCO’s website at: http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17110&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html</p>
<p>Run the SWK programme, load the database, go to the tab Miscellaneous and access the procedure “Deleted” which will provide you with a list of deleted MFNs.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about C-ISIS, the manual in English is available at http://bvsmodelo.bvsalud.org/download/cisis/CISIS-ConceitosBasicos-en.pdf</p>
<p>The manual for ABCD is at http://isisabcd.pbworks.com/w/page/30987393/FrontPage</p>

<title>Repeatable fields</title>
<p>In CDS/ISIS for DOS and Windows it is possible to redefine the % sign used as a marker for repeatable fields. If you want to use \ which is a symbol used by UNIX but not used extensively elsewhere, you do this by adding to SYSPAR.PAR a parameter 8=\</p>
<p>If this parameter is moved as happened with an installation of CDS/ISIS whose operators got in touch with me, the \ will be treated as text from when the parameter 8 is deleted or changed. The way to put it to rights is, first change SYSPAR.PAR to include 8=\ and then do a global edit using the CDS/ISIS for Windows utility on the main menu for changing text in a field. The repeated fields will not become repeatable immediately, but if the records are accessed in the editor and saved in CDS/ISIS for Windows the repeated fields will reappear as repeated fields. If you have changed your repeatable field marker and it ceases to work correctly, check your parameter 8 of SYSPAR.PAR.</p>
<p>A string of &lt;Women empowerment&gt;\&lt;Women’s status&gt;\&lt;Women’s roles&gt;\&lt;Guidelines&gt; will appear as follows in the editor after the record has been saved.</p>

<title>J-ISIS developments</title>
<p>Jean-Claude Dauphin, the developer of J-ISIS (Java ISIS) reports that. J-ISIS is still under development and indeed being rewritten. He sends a summary of some of the recent developments which he expected to be released by the end of November:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The latest versions of J-ISIS have been using the DJ-Native Swing JWebBrowser library to offer a Web Browser through J-ISIS. It has been quite successful for providing a Web Browser for most popular platforms. But the Java integration has always produced from time to time some strange behaviour (like losing the focus on the other components after clicking on the Browser window, overlapping of windows, etc.), most probably because of mixing heavyweight and lightweight components.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Therefore they have changed to the JavaFX 2.2 WebView. The integration with Java works well and the DJ-Native Swing problems have been removed. However, some features which were given for free with the native browsers such as downloading resources in different formats and opening them in the right application have been lost. The embedded browser component is based on WebKit, an open source web browser engine. It supports Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, Document Object Model (DOM), and HTML5.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The Jetty Web Server has been embedded in J-ISIS, so when you start J-ISIS, you have a database server (Database is a Berkeley DB) as well as a Web server. Records are displayed through the Web browser and can access other Web resources with the embedded Jetty Web server.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Web-JISIS prototype is futher developed and tested to provide a more robust release. The menu bar is now stable, changing the PFT when displaying records is now working as well as changing the worksheet in data entry.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>There are also many minor improvements such as:</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Indexing Techniques: The field content is checked to see if it is html. In case it is recognized as HTML, the text part is extracted and used for indexing. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Import/Export: Better wizard screens and support for other formats such as Dublin Core</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Search: Better highlighting of the search terms in the results</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Worksheet Editor: Drag and Drop of the worksheet fields to change their order</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>PFT Editor: The output produced by a format with a specific record is now working properly, thanks to the new JavaFX Webview Browser.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>PFTs: Images stored in blob fields can be used in PFTs.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Images: Images are now well displayed through the new JavaFX Webview Browser which is independent from the platform. Images can be stored directly in a record and/or as a Web resource url.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Web Resources: A Web resource is anything that is addressable over the Web with a url. They can be addressed through a relative url if the resource is on the server machine or by an absolute url if the Web resource is on a remote machine. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Digital Library feature: Improved speed for large documents and better user feedback about the process.</p>
