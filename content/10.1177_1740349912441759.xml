<abstract>
<p>A novel electrospinning, which is characterized by low driven voltage threshold and ease to expand production rate, is demonstrated by using a probe tip to touch and withdraw from the surface of a polyethylene oxide solution with speed of about 1 m/s, to issue a jet. Thus nanofibers are obtained on the collector. The experiment results show that the spinning period increases with increasing applied voltage and the process eventually becomes continuous as the applied voltage reaches more than 31 kV. The effect of applied voltage on the diameter of the nanofibers is also discussed. Such method will open a new door to achieve massive production of nanofibers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Owing to their remarkable characteristics of unique properties (optical, chemical, mechanical, etc.) and high surface to volume ratio, electrospun nanofibers will play an important role in future applications in filtration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740349912441759">1</xref></sup> high-performance sensors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740349912441759">2</xref></sup> bioscaffolds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740349912441759">3</xref></sup> drug delivery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740349912441759">4</xref></sup> micro/nano devices,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740349912441759">5</xref></sup> and more. It is known that electrospinning is attracting more and more attention from scientists all over the world and is considered one of the most efficient, relatively simple, and cost-effective ways to produce long polymer fibers with diameter in the range of several nanometers to a few micrometers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740349912441759">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740349912441759"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740349912441759">8</xref></sup> Due to the poor production rate of single-spinneret electrospinning, some methods to expand the production of electrospun nanofibers have been explored, but problems still exist. As a natural extension of the single spinneret, a multi-spinneret array has been utilized to enhance the throughput of nanofibers, but the diameter of the nanofibers varies greatly and liquid droplets often occur on the collector because the electric fields around the spinnerets (calculated by simulation software) interact with each other and the electric field near the middle of the tip array is weakened greatly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740349912441759">9</xref></sup> Jirsak et al. invented a system called Nanospider, in which a rotating cylindrical electrode covered with some structures (such as thin nails, screw threads, etc.) is employed to take solution on to its surface from a solution reservoir and jets are issued from the tips of these structures, to electrospin nanofibers with high throughput; the system has been patented and commercialized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740349912441759">10</xref></sup> However, there is a foremost defect in that the rotating electrode must be periodically cleaned after half an hour of electrospinning due to gradual solidification of the solution adhered to the electrode surface. In order to manufacture nanofibers massively and continuously, electrospinning without fixed spinnerets may be the future direction of large-scale electrospinning. Yarin et al. proposed an approach in which a two-layer system, with the lower layer being a ferromagnetic suspension and the upper layer a polymer solution, is exposed to the combination of normal magnetic field and electric field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740349912441759">11</xref></sup> As a result, vertical spikes of the magnetic suspension perturb the free surface of the uppermost polymer layer and many jets are generated from the perturbation sites. However, the addition of the ferromagnetic suspension pollutes the polymer solution and this has hindered its applications greatly. A method called Tip-less Electrospinning has been provided, where a strong electrical field destabilizes the surface of a thin layer of polymer solution on a circular conductive electrode and multiple jets are ejected from the surface, to manufacture nanofibers with high production rate. Problems of a high voltage threshold of about 70 kV and repeated cleaning of the spinneret electrode, like for Nanospider, could not be solved until now.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740349912441759">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present work an improved electrospinning method is brought forward, where a probe tip is plunged into the free surface of a polymer solution and withdrawn quickly to induce the generation of a jet. Under strong enough electric field, the jet encounters stretching, bending instabilities, and solvent evaporation, and nanofibers come into being on a collector as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740349912441759">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Such a simple method can be easily modified to expand its production rate by means of a tip array.</p>

<title>Experimental details</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740349912441759">Figure 1(b)</xref>, the setup of electrospinning via mechanical probe-tip drawing mainly includes a means to generate high voltage potential, a solution tank, a probe, an actuator, and a collector. The high voltage potential is used to supply high voltage ranging from 0 to 40 kV, in which the anode and the cathode are connected to the polymeric solution and the collector respectively. The actuator is utilized to periodically drive the probe tip to touch and then withdraw quickly from the solution surface to induce the generation of Taylor cones therein. Three different stainless steel needles for acupuncture, with diameters of 200 µm, 250 µm, and 300 µm respectively, were used as the probe and the collector was placed about 30 cm above the solution tank. The experiments were conducted under the environmental conditions of 25 °C and 50–60% relative humidity. Polyethylene oxide (PEO, average molecular weight = 300,000 g/mol; Dadi Fine Chemical Co. Ltd, China) was dissolved in a mixture of deionized water and alcohol (3:1, w/w). A charge-coupled device camera (Sony model SSC-DC80) was used to record the electrospinning process and the videos were handled by ImageJ open source software with accuracy of 1/25 s. The nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Philips FEI XL30 SEM-FEG instrument) after being coated with gold.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>From the experiments it was found that the withdrawal speed of the probe greatly affects the generation of a jet. When the probe is taken away from the PEO solution surface at a speed lower than several centimeters per second, a conical spike comes into being at the site of tip withdrawal at first due to the viscosity but then the spike retracts quickly to the free surface. When the withdrawal speed of the probe is about 1 m/s however, a conical shape of solution appears therein and then a jet issues from the crest of the cone as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740349912441759">Figure 1(c)</xref>. This behavior is believed to occur for the following reason. As the probe leaves the surface at too much lower speed, the crest of the cone is flatter than that from quick withdrawal and the electric field force cannot overcome the larger surface tension; but with higher speed, the surface tension is smaller due to the sharper crest of the cone and smaller electric field force is needed to overcome the smaller surface tension. As such, electrospining via mechanically single probe-tip drawing with proper withdrawal speed can successfully lower the applied voltage threshold.</p>
<p>The effect of applied voltage on the duration of electrospinning was also explored. As described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740349912441759">Figure 2</xref>, when a probe with diameter of 300 µm is used and the applied voltage is changed from 10 kV to 37 kV, the average time of electrospinning increases from 0.68 s to 18.48 s. In particular, when the voltage was more than 30 kV, the spinning time would increase rapidly. It might be that the electric force generated by the applied voltage acts mainly to overcome the surface tension, gravity, and atmospheric pressure. It can be concluded that the duration of electrospinning becomes longer as the applied voltage increases. If the applied voltage is more than 37 kV, the electrospinning will go on continuously. It also can be seen that when the diameter of the probe is decreased, the threshold of applied voltage needed to generate continuous electrospinning is reduced because the local surface tension becomes smaller owing to the sharper shape of the crest induced by a probe with smaller diameter. An interesting phenomenon is that at the greatly increased part, the curves are parallel.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912441759">Figure 3(a)</xref>, the diameter of the nanofibers fluctuates very little when the electrode distance is 30 cm and the applied voltage varies in the range of 23 kV to 29 kV. The average diameter of the nanofibers is about 475 nm. Good morphology of the nanofibers can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912441759">Figure 3(a)</xref>. However, there are no nanofibers but liquid films on the collector once the applied voltage exceeds 29 kV when the electrode distance is 30 cm, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912441759">Figure 3(b)</xref>. Nearly the same phenomenon is observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912441759">Figure 3(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912441759">(d)</xref> when the applied voltage surpasses 27 kV with 25 cm electrode distance. This is mainly due to not enough solvent evaporation when the electrode distance is small. Increase in electrode distance can result in pure nanofibers being obtained if the applied voltage is more than 27 kV. Furthermore, the average diameter of the nanofibers is smaller when the electrode distance is 25 cm, because the enhanced electrostatic repulsive force on the fluid jets narrows the nanofiber diameter when the smaller electrode distance leads to higher electric field.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A novel electrospinning via mechanically probe-tip drawing the free surface of a polymer solution is described in this paper. Several benefits could be achieved with this new method, according to the experiments results. First, compared with Tip-Less Electrospinning, a much lower voltage threshold of about 10 kV is needed to induce electrospinning because the surface tension of the conical spike induced mechanically from the free surface of the solution is much smaller than that of the originally flat surface when other conditions are the same. Second, since the solution surface to generate a jet is flat, it is easy to expand its throughput by increasing the number of probes. Furthermore, apparatus cleaning is hardly needed. We believe that such method will open a new door to manufacture nanofibers with high throughput.</p>
