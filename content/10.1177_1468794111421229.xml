<p>The analysis of documents, written records, newspapers, reports and letters has a well established presence within the social sciences. A fact that reflects the ‘immensely pervasive, widespread and institutionalised place of texts in our society’; this book ‘consists of a series of chapters that establish a family of “takes” on texts and their analysis from an ethnomethodological (EM) and Conversation Analytic (CA) standpoint’ (Watson, 2009: 1). Of primary concern here is the second order professional description of social order and its relationship with primordial and ‘laic antecedents’ and practices. The exploration of the social organization of ethnographic texts has been well articulated by a number of authors, most notably by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111421229">Atkinson (1990)</xref>. Rod Watson’s book adds to this tradition through an excellent ethnomethodological consideration of the text as a social accomplishment that is grounded in members’ mundane and everyday sense making methods and practices. He is ideally placed to lead us through this particular field of enquiry given his unique and highly respected contribution to ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, membership categorization analysis and linguistic philosophy over many years. This book serves to remind us of Rod Watson’s unparalleled grasp of the relationship between ordinary language use and the sociological enterprise.</p>
<p>The first chapter is a superb and erudite explanation of the ethnomethodological approach to analysing texts (and associated activities such as reading and making sense) as socially organized and organizing phenomena and as textually mediated practical forms of social action (e.g. the situated negotiation of signage within the Cityscape). Of significance to Watson’s argument is his careful use of Edward Rose’s conceptualization of the ‘word’ in relation to the ‘world’; where the world is understood as a worded entity; the relationship between word’s and things are not separate but inextricably linked. Watson’s use of Rose’s work reflects his long standing friendship with him and concern with the important ideas that are conveyed within Rose’s Ethno-Inquiries and their critical importance to our understanding of the formulation and development of ethnomethodology more generally (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111421229">Carlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111421229">Slack, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111421229">Watson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapters 2 and 3 provide two case studies that illustrate the form of textual analysis that Watson eloquently outlines in the opening chapter. Chapter 2 is a detailed examination of Elliot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111421229">Liebow’s (1967)</xref> ethnographic text and, in particular, the categorization of persons among a specific Afro-American social group in the 1960s. Here Watson draws on ordinary English language philosophy, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Harvey Sacks and the recently late Harold Garfinkel in explicating the accountable features of categorizing persons that is both textually accomplished and realized through the invocation of ‘what everyone knows’ grounded in the mundane mechanics of procedural intelligibility and locally realized sense – assembly. Similar concerns are explored in Chapter 3 during which Horace Miner’s study of Nacirema Culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111421229">1956</xref>) is interrogated. Watson again draws attention to the necessary intrinsic accountability of members’ methods (including textual accomplishments) that are routinely drawn upon in order to realize various textual effects. As Watson (2009: 65) states:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Members, then, typically and routinely orientate themselves towards the descriptive features that they build into their settings. It is this ‘first order’ describability of settings – including the material objects actively incorporated into the setting – which Miner’s (re-) description of the Nacirema ironically disattends and subverts. Much of the humour and other interest of his paper derives from the reader’s skilful orientation to the contrast between the juxtaposed descriptions by the natives and by miner respectively: the reader’s artfulness must match that of the Miner in order to grasp the ironic and sardonic intent.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The chapter develops this idea by demonstrating how the text draws on member’s categorization work and the documentary method of interpretation in reading work. The search for underlying patterns is understood as a key means through which the ironic status of Horace Miner’s text is achieved.</p>
<p>The concluding chapter brings these elements and concerns together and applies them to the writings of Erving Goffman. This chapter is required reading for all Goffman scholars and Watson displays the full range and depth of his masterful and long established analytic and intellectual skill. This chapter is both an appreciation of Goffman as a writer and as a sociologist. The argument pursued in the course of the book reaches its zenith through an analysis of the textual incarnation of sociological analysis. Watson’s (2009: 103) longstanding concern with how ‘sociologists describe the phenomena they observe and how these descriptions at the analytic level are related to society-members’ common-sense description of those “selfsame” phenomena’ is exemplified here. For Watson (2009: 106) one of the main ways in which Goffman achieves insightful sociological description is through a perspective by incongruity, which ‘establishes incongruous applications of terms in that it violates the conventional uses of those terms’. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111421229">Burke (1965)</xref> Watson (2009: 107) notes how new descriptive alignments are established, which:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . involves a decontextualization and recontextualization of actions and/or settings. We might also add that the use of planned misnomers, plus incongruous or even contradictory predicates and the rest . . . relies unrelievedly on the primitive common-sense recognisability and identifiability of the phenomena to be redescribed.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>During the course of <italic>Analysing Practical and Professional Texts</italic> Rod Watson demonstrates the importance of a reconnection with ideas associated with the natural attitude and the unexplicated use of natural language within sociological and social scientific analysis. This is an excellent book by one of the most well known and accomplished members of the Manchester School of Ethnomethodology. It will be of great interest to those involved in the conduct of qualitative and ethnographic research. It will also be of great interest to Goffman scholars and also serves as an excellent primer on ethnomethodological and related ideas concerning language and social action by one of the best exponents in the business.</p>
