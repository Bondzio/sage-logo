<p>The description of the variables used to calculate the VC reputation index on page 41 reads incorrectly as, “These measures (all based on the five years prior to the focal year) are the total number of portfolio companies a VC invested in; the total funds invested in portfolio firms; the total dollar amount of funds raised; the number (count) of individual funds raised; the number of portfolio firms taken public; and VC age in the focal year (calculated as the IPO year minus the year a VC firm raised its first fund).” The correct description should be as follows:</p>
<p>“These measures (all based on the five years prior to the focal year) are the total number of portfolio companies a VC invested in; the total funds invested in portfolio firms; the average dollar amount of the total funds under management; the average number (count) of individual funds raised; the number of portfolio firms taken public; and VC age in the focal year (calculated as the IPO year minus the year a VC firm raised its first fund).” All subsequent references to the components of the index should also reflect these labels for the individual measures.</p>
