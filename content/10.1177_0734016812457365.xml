<p>The Supreme Court’s capital punishment jurisprudence has evolved into the most complex, abstruse, and difficult subfield known to the criminal law. Thus, we are indebted to veteran death penalty lawyer and law professor Kenneth Williams for this useful and accessible primer. <italic>Most Deserving of Death?</italic> is his first book following many scholarly articles on the subject. Seasoned death penalty advocates will find this a helpful refresher while students and the lay public can profit from his clear and lucid analysis.</p>
<p>Whatever one’s view on capital punishment, this book forces us to confront the unfairness of our maladministered death machine, exposing a criminal justice system infected by bad lawyering, racial discrimination, sloppy science, wrongful convictions and executions, biased judges and juries, and a system that fails rationally to winnow those who deserve the ultimate punishment. It challenges the irrationality of the machinery of death—a seemingly beyond repair Rube Goldberg contraption that we also cannot quite let go.</p>
<p>Disclaiming any intent to argue for abolition Williams asks, “How did we end up with a system that both supporters and opponents of the death penalty would agree has become dysfunctional?” He responds, “the United States Supreme Court, through its inconsistent and often incoherent jurisprudence, bears primary responsibility” (p. 2). The implicit question is whether, how and at what cost, the capital trial and appeal system could be made to work fairly.</p>
<p>The author’s extensive experience representing death row inmates in postconviction habeas corpus proceedings proves particularly valuable in assessing ineffective assistance of counsel claims. “Nothing,” he asserts, “causes wrongful convictions more than incompetent legal representation.” Lazy, incompetent lawyering, makes the other sources of trial error more likely as bad forensic science, bad eyewitness identifications, false confessions, and the like, go unchallenged. We learn that the system not only wrongly convicts people of capital crimes it also inevitably leads to executing the innocent. Bad lawyering, it seems, kills.</p>
<p>Williams provides a remarkable, honest, upsetting, and personal example of this from his own extensive case file—the tragic case of Johnny Ray Connor, whose trial lawyer failed at every possible juncture to challenge an otherwise weak prosecution case. One problem (from among many) appears to have been the lawyer’s failure to look at Connor’s medical record. Had he done so, he would have discovered that the defendant’s severely crippled right leg would have prevented him from running from the crime scene in the way that eyewitnesses had testified. Williams, who represented Connor through his postconviction appeals, leaves it to the reader to conclude that the state likely executed an innocent man. One can only imagine William’s feelings. There are few crueler things facing an advocate than losing a capital appeal; losing the person to execution—especially when he may well have been innocent—surely qualifies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court refuses to deal effectively with scientific evidence demonstrating that race, including race of the victim, continues to be a profoundly significant factor in predicting those who live and those who die. Capital defendants are precluded from relying on statistical evidence demonstrating biases permeating and tainting the system. Rather, they must meet the nearly impossible hurdle of proving, by direct evidence, that racism caused the conviction or sentence in their particular case. Williams concludes, “Race will continue to play an important role in determining who is sentenced to death . . . as long as the Supreme Court continues to abdicate its responsibility under the Constitution and challenge the institutional racism that reduces these disparities” (p. 58).</p>
<p>The chapter on innocence and wrongful convictions is particularly compelling. Rather than dry statistical proofs tending to demonstrate the inevitability of error, the focus is on proving that we have indeed executed wholly innocent persons. His burden is not to make a quantitative estimate of how often this occurs, but rather to demonstrate that such has tragically occurred already and that we can put names and faces to these errors. Cameron Todd Willingham, for example, was convicted and executed upon wholly implausible and unscientific “expert” testimony that the deaths of his children were the result of arson. Take away the almost certainly bogus arson evidence and it emerges that Willingham was likely innocent yet executed.</p>
<p>As this is written, Georgia prepares to execute a man found by the lower court to be intellectually disabled. The Georgia Supreme Court reversed finding he was unable to meet the state’s “beyond a reasonable doubt” threshold. This result will come as no surprise to readers of this book, as it takes the reader through the various state responses to our Supreme Court’s ruling prohibiting the execution of the mentally disabled yet leaving implementation to the states. Georgia, along with Virginia, has never found that anyone met the standard, while Alabama and Florida rarely do so. One is left to wonder about the penalogical goal surrounding execution of those who are only probably disabled mentally.</p>
<p>The treatment of extradition in the chapter on international law and the death penalty misses recent key cases from Canada, South Africa, and Europe as well as the most recent pronouncements of the UN Human Rights Committee. It also omits recent changes in various extradition treaties. The important trend toward nations requiring ironclad assurances that the death penalty will neither be sought nor imposed before a nation may extradite a death-eligible defendant to the United States thus receives superficial treatment. While one might think this an issue only of interest to death penalty extradition specialists, this issue has a larger significance in the international pressures that it brings to bear both on individual cases and on the system as a whole. However, this is a minor, perhaps inevitable, flaw in a book that covers so much in a short compass.</p>
<p>
<italic>Most Deserving of Death?</italic> merits reading by all who wish to discover the flaws inherent in our modern death penalty. One looks forward to more from this skilled death penalty advocate.</p>
