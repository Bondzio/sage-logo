<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>This study investigated whether the presence of malnutrition in critically ill children with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia increases the risk of unfavorable outcome. Malnutrition in children with hyperglycemia was found to be an additional risk factor for mortality, independent of clinical severity. The findings point to nutrition status as a variable to be considered in studies evaluating the effects of alterations in blood glucose homeostasis on the prognosis of critically ill children, as well as on the development of protocols for glycemic control in the pediatric intensive care unit.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the acute phase of severe illness, patients are prone to developing hyperglycemia. The causes are multifactorial and may depend on the individual predisposition of the patient but primarily stem from the release of catecholamines and activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with release of counterregulatory hormones, leading to peripheral insulin resistance. As a physiological response, hyperglycemia is believed to be part of an adaptive and protective response of the central nervous system since it ensures a constant supply of glucose to the brain. However, hyperglycemia is associated with a worse outcome and has gained attention since the initial study by Van den Berghe et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112458124">1</xref></sup> which demonstrated decreased mortality in critically ill hyperglycemic adult patients managed with intensive insulin therapy.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia also occurs in the critically ill patient, and there is increasing evidence of its role as a predictor of mortality. Hypoglycemia has proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects, including increases in interleukin (IL)–1-β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor–α, reactive oxygen species, and markers of platelet activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112458124">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112458124"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112458124"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112458124">4</xref></sup> In addition, hypoglycemia impairs neurological function, and severe hypoglycemia leads to neuronal cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112458124">5</xref></sup> The association between hyperglycemia and increased mortality has been reported for children in the general intensive care unit (ICU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112458124">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112458124"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112458124">8</xref></sup> and in specific subsets of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112458124">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112458124"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112458124">11</xref></sup> Hypoglycemia and wide glycemic fluctuations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112458124">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112458124"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112458124"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112458124">15</xref></sup> have also been associated with death. The majority of studies are retrospective, and none, to our knowledge, has considered the nutrition status of patients. Malnutrition and dysglycemia are two relatively common and comorbid conditions in critically ill pediatric patients, and it is not known whether stress-induced hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia may be influenced by malnutrition and what impact this condition might have on mortality. Based on the hypothesis that alterations in glucose homeostasis are common in ICU patients and are associated with a worse clinical outcome, the objectives of this study were (1) to determine the frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, taking into account clinical severity and nutrition status, and (2) to determine whether the presence of malnutrition in critically ill children with these glycemic alterations is associated with a poor outcome, defined as increased length of ICU stay, fewer ventilator-free days, and higher 28-day mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112458124" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>This prospective observational cohort study was conducted in an ICU of a teaching hospital with level 1A accreditation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112458124">16</xref></sup> Children consecutively admitted between January 2006 and January 2008 were eligible for inclusion in the study. Neonates were excluded, as well as children with liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, and suspected metabolic disorders. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the institution.</p>
<p>Blood glucose levels obtained within the first 72 hours after admission were analyzed. Hyperglycemia was defined as 1 or more blood glucose values &gt;150 mg/dL within this period. Prolonged hyperglycemia was defined if 1 or more hyperglycemic episodes (&gt;150 mg/dL) were detected on the first and second days from admission. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose values ≤60 mg/dL and severe hypoglycemia as values &lt;40 mg/dL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112458124">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112458124">18</xref></sup> Arterial blood glucose analysis was performed using a glucometer (MediSense Optium, Abbott Laboratories, MediSense UK Ltd, Abingdon, UK).</p>
<sec id="section4-0148607112458124">
<title>Nutrition Support and Glucose Control Protocol</title>
<p>As part of clinical routine care, a dietitian and a physician specializing in nutrition followed all patients admitted to the ICU. Initially, children received intravenous (IV) glucose infusion to meet the basal rate of endogenous glucose production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112458124">19</xref></sup> It started at 2–4 mg/kg/min in adolescents and 4–5 mg/kg/min in children and infants. Prescription of nutrition therapy was according to the ICU’s assessment protocol and commenced after nutrition assessment and in the presence of hemodynamic stability. Feeding was preferably delivered by the enteral route. Energy requirements for the acute phase of systemic inflammatory response were calculated according to the predicted basal metabolic rate, initially at 50% of the total volume, and the rate of infusion increased each 12–24 hours, if tolerated, reaching 100% of total estimated volume by day 2 of admission.</p>
<p>No rigid protocol for glucose control was applied during the study period. Glycemic control was established by reducing or increasing the glucose infusion rate when glycemic levels were &gt;150 mg/dL or &lt;60 mg/dL, respectively. IV insulin administration was recommended if glycemic levels surpassed 180 mg/dL. IV glucose bolus was indicated whenever glycemia was &lt;40 mg/dL. Blood glucose level measurements were performed on admission and at a 12-hour interval. If dysglycemia was detected, the frequency of monitoring was increased to a 1- to 4-hour interval, being performed every 1–2 hours when the patient had hypoglycemia, severe hyperglycemia (&gt;180 mg/dL), or after insulin administration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607112458124">
<title>Study Variables</title>
<p>Mortality within 28 days of admission was the primary outcome variable. Secondary outcome variables included were the length of stay in the ICU and ventilator-free days. Length of stay in the ICU was defined as the number of days from ICU admission until ICU discharge. Ventilator-free days was defined as the number of days alive and breathing without assistance from admission to day 28. Patients who did not survive to 28 days were assigned zero ventilator-free days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112458124">20</xref></sup> The potential risk factors for adverse outcome included hyperglycemia, prolonged hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia. The following factors were considered exposure variables that could potentially affect the outcome: age &lt;1 year, sex, malnutrition upon admission, the revised Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM 2),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112458124">21</xref></sup> and the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112458124">22</xref></sup> from the day of admission to the third day of hospitalization. The severity of organ dysfunction and the use of corticosteroids during the ICU stay were considered exposure variables for hyperglycemia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148607112458124">
<title>Assessment of Nutrition Status</title>
<p>Assessment of nutrition state was performed on each patient for up to the first 72 hours after admission. For classification, anthropometric indexes of weight and height were compared against the World Health Organization 2006 growth standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112458124">23</xref></sup> The weight-for-age index was used as the anthropometric index for children &lt;2 years of age, and body mass index was used for children &gt;2 years old. Patients were considered malnourished when they presented a <italic>z</italic> score of the anthropometric index less than −2. Besides these conditions, children with chronic diseases who presented a <italic>z</italic> score of expected height for age less than −2 were considered malnourished, independently of their body mass index. Since these children often have stunted growth, their body mass index <italic>z</italic> scores may be within the normal range or even increased. If only the body mass index criterion is used, such patients may be erroneously classified as well nourished or even overweight. Therefore, in these cases, in addition to body mass index, we took height for age into account. The calculations were performed using the Anthroplus (version 1.02; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607112458124">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>As this was a preliminary study, formal sample size calculations were not performed. Data are expressed as frequency (percentage), median, and semi-interquartile and interquartile ranges. Patients were classified into malnourished and well-nourished subgroups in which nutrition status was considered a categorical variable. The variables length of ICU stay and ventilator-free days were converted into categorical variables in which the median and the first quartile values, respectively, were taken as cutoff points, whereas the third quartile of the distribution was used for PIM 2 and PELOD scores. In the analysis of ventilator-free days, the first quartile of the distribution (19 days) was chosen as a cutoff because this number is closer to the average value reported in the literature. The associations of interest were examined by the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used for the analysis of the association between hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and respective outcomes while controlling for nutrition status. Categorical variables that evidenced association with the outcome with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .1 in the bivariate analysis were included in nonconditional multiple logistic regression models, using the stepwise forward technique. Differences were considered statistically significant when, for each independent variable, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the odds ratio (OR) did not include the value of 1. The Intercooled STATA 10.0 software (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) was used for statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 281 children admitted to the ICU during the study period, 17 were neonates, 18 had liver disease, 4 had suspected inborn error of metabolism, and 2 had diabetes mellitus. From among 240 eligible patients, 19 had incomplete anthropometric data and were excluded from the analysis. Therefore, 221 children were enrolled in the study, of whom 86 (38.9%) were surgical patients. Mortality rate and PIM 2 median value of the 19 excluded patients were similar to that of the study group.

<p>A total of 856 blood glucose samples were obtained, giving an average of 3.87 samples per patient. The values of the glycemic peaks on the first, second, and third admission days were 123 ± 28 mg/dL, 121 ± 24.5 mg/dL, and 119 ± 21.8 mg/dL, respectively. The prevalence of hyperglycemia in these time periods was 27.6% (61/221), 23.4% (48/205), and 16.8% (31/184). Prolonged hyperglycemia within the first 48 hours occurred in 10.2% of patients (23/205) and within 72 hours in 5.9% of patients (11/184). The rates of glucose infusion (median ± semi-interquartile) on the first, second, and third days were 4.0 ± 0.5 mg/kg/min, 4.0 ± 0.5 mg/kg/min, and 3.5 ± 1 mg/kg/min, respectively. The use of corticosteroids was not associated with hyperglycemia during the studied period. The frequency of hyperglycemia was similar in the clinical and surgical patients during the period studied.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia occurred in 30 patients (13.6%) and severe hypoglycemia in 9 patients (4.1%). Age &lt;1 year (OR, 4.79; 95% CI, 2.08–11.01; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and sepsis (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.01–5.75; <italic>P</italic> = .05) were associated with hypoglycemia in the multiple logistic regression analysis. Of the 5 hyperglycemic patients who received insulin therapy (2.26%), 2 died. Insulin infusion was associated with hypoglycemia (≤60 mg/dL and 40 mg/dl) in the univariate analysis, and this association was detected in both well-nourished and malnourished groups. After receiving insulin therapy, all patients developed hypoglycemia, of whom 2 had severe hypoglycemia. Insulin therapy could not be fitted into the logistic regression model because too few patients received it. The severity of organ dysfunction (PELOD ≥12) was associated with hyperglycemia (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.21–4.24; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and with hypoglycemia (OR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.10–11.75; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and this effect was independent of nutrition status. The incidences of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were 56.2% (41/73) and 24.4% (20/73), respectively, among patients with PELOD ≥12 and 37.2% (55/148) and 6.7% (10/48), respectively, in those patients with PELOD &lt;12.</p>

<title>Clinical Outcomes</title>
<p>Of the exposure variables analyzed, hyperglycemia in the first 24 hours after admission, prolonged hyperglycemia in the first 48 hours, and hypoglycemia showed a significant association with clinical outcomes in the ICU. For the analysis of clinical outcomes, patients who were hyperglycemic and developed hypoglycemia after insulin therapy were not included in the hypoglycemic category. The associations were determined as follows.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0148607112458124">
<title>Mortality</title>
<p>The overall mortality rate was 5.9%. The mortality rate was 13.1% (8/61) among patients with hyperglycemia within the first 24 hours and 21.7% (5/23) for patients with prolonged hyperglycemia. After excluding patients who received insulin, mortality rates were 16.0% (4/25) in patients with hypoglycemia and 28.6% (2/7) in those with severe hypoglycemia. Age &lt;1 year and sex were not found to be associated with mortality in the univariate analysis.</p>

After controlling for nutrition status, both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were associated with higher mortality. These associations were upheld in the malnourished patients.

Adjusting for clinical severity (PELOD or PIM 2), the odds ratio of mortality was higher in malnourished patients with hyperglycemia, whereas no significant associations were detected in the well-nourished group of patients. Hypoglycemia could not be fitted into the multivariate analysis of mortality because of the small number of observations. Hyperglycemia on the third day was not associated with mortality (Fisher exact test <italic>P</italic> = .26). Hyperglycemia over the first 3 days was associated with higher mortality in all patients (Fisher exact test <italic>P</italic> = .02). After controlling for nutrition status, this association was not upheld in the group of malnourished patients (OR, 16.00; 95% CI, 0.80–319.70).</p>

<title>Length of ICU Stay and Ventilator-Free Days</title>
<p>Controlling for nutrition status, no significant association between hyperglycemia (within the first 24 hours or within the first 48 hours, prolonged) and length of ICU stay or ventilator-free days was observed in both groups. Hypoglycemia showed a significant association with the length of ICU stay and ventilator-free days only in the malnourished group of patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112458124">Table 3</xref>). Hyperglycemia on the third day and prolonged hyperglycemia over the first 3 days of ICU stay were not associated with length of ICU stay and ventilator-free days.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hyperglycemia was frequently observed upon admission to the ICU, affecting approximately 30% of patients studied in the first 24 hours, a proportion that decreased on the second and third days of hospitalization. Hyperglycemia has been reported to occur in approximately 10% of malnourished children admitted with acute gastroenteritis and dehydration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112458124">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112458124">25</xref></sup> We have not found recent studies about the hormonal response to stress or to glucose load in malnourished, critically ill patients. An early study showed a poor insulin response to oral or IV glucose loading in severely malnourished children. The insulin/glucose ratio was consistently low in all cases, both in the basal state as well as after oral glucose loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112458124">26</xref></sup> Another situation where hyperglycemia can occur in these patients is the refeeding syndrome. Thus, theoretically, such children would be at increased risk of hyperglycemia during the metabolic stress response. Such risk was not observed in the present study.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia occurred in about 13% of patients. Similar to what has been previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112458124">27</xref></sup> hypoglycemia was associated with age &lt;1 year and sepsis. The frequency of severe hypoglycemia in malnourished patients was 4-fold of that observed in the well nourished, and there was a tendency for an association between malnutrition and severe hypoglycemia in the univariate analysis. The etiology of hypoglycemia in malnutrition is poorly understood. In recent studies using a stable isotope technique, severe malnutrition was shown to be associated with impaired glucose absorption and with decreased endogenous glucose production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112458124">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112458124">29</xref></sup> Hypoglycemia was found to be associated with increased mortality in children admitted to a district hospital in Kenya. Mortality was especially high in hypoglycemic children with signs of severe illness (prostration or deep breathing) on admission or severe malnutrition. However, statistical analysis provided no evidence that the association of hypoglycemia with mortality was different in children with severe illness or with severe malnutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112458124">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our results showed that hyperglycemia was independently associated with mortality in the malnourished group of patients after adjustment for clinical severity. Such an association was not found in the group of well-nourished patients. This suggests that malnutrition might confer an additional risk of death in patients with alterations in blood glucose homeostasis. We can only speculate on the possible reasons for higher mortality risk in malnourished patients compared with that in well-nourished ones. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia lead to oxidative stress by increasing release and/or defects in removing reactive oxygen species produced during glycolysis and excessive oxidative phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112458124">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112458124">32</xref></sup> Antioxidant status is impaired in the malnourished as the result of deficiency in micronutrients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112458124">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112458124">34</xref></sup> An imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant activity would result in increased oxidative stress and inflammation in malnourished patients. Malnutrition could therefore contribute to higher risk of mortality by aggravating oxidative stress. Besides increasing oxidative stress, alterations in glycemic homeostasis impair immune response and induce endothelial dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and procoagulant state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112458124">32</xref></sup> These biological effects could be more pronounced in a malnourished patient.</p>
<p>It is not known whether existing protocols for glucose control would be appropriate and safe for malnourished patients. Therefore, a more thorough and focused response to this question must be determined by future research.</p>
<p>This study does have limitations. We only examined glucose levels obtained during the first 72 hours after admission, a period that corresponds to the acute phase of metabolic stress and when greater changes in blood glucose homeostasis are expected. Thus, cases of hyper- or hypoglycemia that may have eventually occurred after this period were not detected. Nonetheless, hyperglycemia on the third day and prolonged hyperglycemia over the first 3 days of hospitalization were not independently associated with adverse outcomes. We acknowledge the lack of a rigid protocol for blood glucose control in our study. Considering the variability of glycemic management practices between pediatric intensivists, it is of great importance that future studies on outcomes related to glycemic alterations incorporate a formal protocol for glucose control. Given the small number of deaths, a common finding in pediatric ICUs, the study may have limited statistical power to detect a strong statistical effect of glycemic alterations on mortality. By using the rates of hyperglycemia and mortality observed in our study, we performed a post hoc power estimation for a 2-sample comparison of proportions. Assuming a 2-sided hypothesis with α = 0.05, a total of 287 patients (40 of whom being malnourished, hyperglycemic patients) would be needed to yield a power of 80% to detect the observed differences in mortality between exposed and nonexposed groups. The effect of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia on the outcome of pediatric critically ill, malnourished patients should be confirmed by further individual studies with larger sample sizes or by multicenter studies.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no studies on glucose blood alterations in children admitted to the ICU have taken into account the patient’s nutrition status. Our primary conclusion is that, in critically ill children with hyperglycemia, malnutrition may be an additional risk factor for mortality, independent of clinical severity. Controlling for nutrition status, there were no significant associations between hyperglycemia and secondary outcomes. The adverse effects of hypoglycemia on mortality and secondary outcomes were seen only in the malnourished group of patients. Finally, consistent with previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112458124">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112458124">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112458124">36</xref></sup> we found significant associations between organ dysfunction, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia, suggesting that both conditions are early markers of clinical severity.</p>
<p>The results of this study point to nutrition status as an additional variable to be considered in studies evaluating the effects of blood glucose alterations on the outcomes of critically ill children, as well as in the development of protocols for glycemic control in the pediatric ICU.</p>
