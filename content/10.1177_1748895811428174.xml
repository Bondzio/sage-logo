<abstract>
<p>This article explores what the existing literature has to say about what is most important in the probation supervision: staff characteristics, staff skills or programmes? In broader historical perspective, the story begins in a time when the probation officer was cast as ‘a man of God … full of the milk of human kindness’ (Jarvis, 1972: 8) and arrives in the present day when the probation officer looks like ‘homo technicus’; equipped to deliver sophisticated programmes. One important observation of this critical historical analysis is that although they were considered essential in the early days, the centrality of staff characteristics faded from view in the years after professionalization. At the same time staff skills and programmes came to be seen as more and crucial in probation supervision. A possible explanation of these developments is that the quest for professionalization increased the pressure on probation practice to gain public recognition, and that this was pursued through the imperative of objectification (Kaufmann, 1998 [1996]) which forces all sciences to use observable tools. Another explanation of the disappearance of probation characteristics in the literature could be that the current mainstream research methodologies are not fully capable of capturing the complexities of the human and social worlds in which supervision takes place. By using Cohen’s (1985) and Garland’s (2001) work, it also provided a possible framework for understanding this dynamic within a broader crime control perspective. At the end of the article the author suggests some ideas that could be explored in future research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The aim of this article is to provide a critical historical analysis of the literature on the question of what matters most in probation supervision: staff characteristics, staff skills or programme? Since there have been few empirical studies focusing on this topic and insufficient data in the published materials, a meta-analysis was considered to be premature.</p>
<p>Instead, using different keywords (like probation staff, probation staff characteristics, effectiveness, probation programme and so on) the relevant literature was chosen from a significant number of databases. Books and handbooks were identified, using the same keywords in the library search engines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895811428174">1</xref></sup> The language used in this search was English and the libraries contacted were in England and Wales and the research accordingly covers these countries, which constitute a single jurisdiction. Taking into consideration the similarities between Anglo-Saxon countries in terms of probation development, it is likely that some of the comments resonate also with other jurisdictions (for a full account of the commonalities in pressures and demands on practice across the world see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1748895811428174">Vanstone, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article the concept of staff skill is understood as ‘a complex organization of behaviour directed towards a particular goal or activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811428174">Datar et al., 2010</xref>: xxxi). Furthermore, skills are explicit behaviours that can be learnt and refined through exposure and experience. Examples of probation skills include skills of communication (especially interviewing) and personal engagement that staff require to undertake assessment, planning, intervention and evaluation. In contrast, staff characteristics are moral qualities or personality features that can be considered as inner traits of the probation officer that are relevant to his/her job (e.g. being reliable, respectful, trustworthy and so on). Obviously there is no clear-cut distinction between these two categories, but overlaps and shifting boundaries. One example of this is empathy. Some authors consider empathy as inherited or a personality feature, while others argue that empathy can be taught and could therefore be considered as a professional skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1748895811428174">Trotter, 2006</xref>). The term ‘programme’ in the probation context refers to a planned sequence of learning opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895811428174">McGuire, 2001</xref>). Thus a programme is an organized and systematic intervention directed towards specific objectives. The term ‘programme’ will be used to refer not only to the sequenced and systematic interventions associated with What Works, as will be discussed later on, but also to the diverse range of methods that have been employed by probation officers to bring about change.</p>
<p>The article is divided into seven parts. The first six of these describe the profile of the probation officer in different eras of probation history, exploring the relative emphasis on staff skills, characteristics and programmes in each period (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone, 2004</xref>). Although these eras are described as having distinct time limits, in reality there is no such clear-cut differentiation. Aspects of probation ideals and practices from the early days can be found nowadays under different names or in different practice paradigms. Sometimes distinctive probation practices run in parallel. Even in the present time, although the mainstream rhetoric is towards managerialism and risk assessment there are probation officers practising social casework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811428174">Deering, 2010</xref>). The last part of the article presents the conclusions and suggests some directions for further research.</p>
<p>In the course of this article some words are put in bold in order to emphasize the existence of different staff skills, characteristics and programmes at different times.</p>

<title>Early Days – Man of God</title>
<p>According to some authors, the origin of probation can be found in the work of the Church of England Temperance Society and the Washingtonian Total Abstinence Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811428174">Jarvis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895811428174">Mair, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895811428174">McWilliams, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone, 2004</xref>) in the context of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895811428174">Mair (1997)</xref> defined as a moral panic about the problem of drinking which characterized some parts of Victorian society. The activity of police court missionaries (as the forerunners of probation officers) was almost exclusively missionary and was based on the ‘Christian charity and humanitarian concern’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811428174">Jarvis, 1972</xref>: 1). The main duty of the probation officer was to ‘save the souls’ of those ‘drunkards’ whose ‘foot has once slipped’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811428174">Jarvis, 1972</xref>: 2, citing the letter of Frederick Rainer from 1876). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895811428174">McWilliams (1983)</xref> suggested, the drink problem was an obstacle that had to be removed in order for the person to be open to God. In their effort to remove the obstacles between man and God, missionaries had to visit prisons and police courts, at temperance meetings, deal with ‘individual drunkards, both charged and convicted, with a view to restoration and reclamation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811428174">Jarvis, 1972</xref>: 4) and also to provide practical help in terms of accommodation, employment and emigration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone (2004)</xref> for instance mentions also friendship, exhortation, persuasion and confrontation as some of the possible methods used by probation officers at those times.</p>
<p>Mostly sustained by their religious beliefs, the missionaries had to have faith in every single individual and treat them all as holders of the ‘divine spark’. The qualities (characteristics) that a person had to possess in order to become a missionary were very well captured by the London Police Court Mission: ‘man of God, a man with vocation, a man of character, a man with experience and tact and full of the milk of human kindness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811428174">Jarvis, 1972</xref>: 8). According to other historians (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811428174">Grinnell, 1941</xref>) the origin of probation could also be found in the effort to introduce a more humane approach and elements of ‘practical justice’ into a harsh system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone, 2004</xref>). Practices such as ‘recognizance’ were meant to free offenders who had committed petty crimes under the guidance of some trustworthy member of the community.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428174">Bottoms and McWilliams (1979)</xref> noted, no matter whether the origins of probation were located in the religious domain or in humanistic pressures, the offender’s salvation came in the context of a strongly moralistic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Consequently the probation officer had to be ‘a man of God’ with the right vocation and personality animated by the desire to make good. A suitable probation officer was therefore described in the literature by his moral characteristics and not by his skills. What was primarily important was what the probation officer should be like (as a person) and not what exactly he/she should do. The predominant presentation of the probation officer’s profile included no reference to effectiveness. The ideal probation officer’s characteristics were taken for granted and described as if they emanated logically from the missionary or humanistic philosophy.</p>

<sec id="section3-1748895811428174">
<title>Years of Professionalization – the Right Personality and Training</title>
<p>The age of professionalization could be considered as starting in 1878 in the USA when the first Probation Act was passed and in 1907 in England and Wales when the Probation of Offenders Act was adopted. In both places, courts were asked to consider an offender’s age, offence and character before making a decision. That was the beginning of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811428174">Garland (1990)</xref> called the shift from individualism to individualization. Punishment had to fit not only the offence, but also the personality of the offender. In the process of determining ‘true responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1748895811428174">Saleilles, 1911</xref>) probation officers were asked to contribute in separating those offenders who deserved to be saved from those considered as incorrigible. This new approach required indirectly a certain level of specialized skill: not everyone could provide the court with a reliable and robust assessment.</p>
<p>In this context, some officials and scholars started to think about probation as a professional undertaking rather than a mission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811428174">Trought (1927</xref>: 193) for example stated that probation as a profession ‘involves training and a technique based on scientific principles. It requires not only personality – the principal asset – but training on and off the job.’</p>
<p>This shift from a religious and moral discourse to one based on science and rationality was defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811428174">Garland (1985)</xref> as characteristic of the modern penal complex. However the shift from a religious to a more secular approach did not take place at once. Even after the First World War probation practice was guided by evangelical principles and the spirit of God, as well as by social and practical realities such as education, employment, social structures and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The tension between science and religion recurs in the literature (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811428174">Le Mesurier, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748895811428174">Poulton, 1925</xref>). Selbie (cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811428174">Trought, 1927</xref>: 193–194) for instance tried to solve this tension by stating that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Knowledge without love is almost as useless as love without knowledge. Something much more mysterious and much more powerful is required to change the heart of humanity; but when love and knowledge go hand in hand you get the great teacher and the good shepherd.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Selbie (cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811428174">Trought, 1927</xref>: 194) even went so far as to address the question by recalling the religious roots of the probation work: ‘Can there be a better definition of a probation officer – the great teacher and the good shepherd?’</p>
<p>Enacting the caring nature of probation work, the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907 (section 4) stated that the duty of the probation officer is: ‘… d) to advise, assist, and befriend him, and, when necessary, to endeavour to find him suitable employment’. To implement these duties a probation officer had to acquire or possess certain characteristics and knowledge:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Apart from any question of personal qualities, such as tact, patience or common sense, it is evident that to deal effectively with all these different applications definite knowledge of two kinds is required: The officer must possess a sound knowledge of the law governing the grounds on which various summonses may be granted by the court … And it will be equally vital for him to have a practical working acquaintance with the charitable organizations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811428174">Le Mesurier, 1935</xref>: 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Le Mesurier noted that Probation Committees still selected probation officers according to their personality and vocational call. These personal characteristics were important in a probation officer because they were able ‘to release the true personality of the person we are trying to help – to free him from the discouragement, the deprivation …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811428174">Le Mesurier, 1935</xref>: 60). Therefore a probation officer should inspire hope and self-confidence in those they were engaged to ‘advise, assist and befriend’.</p>
<p>During the years of professionalization both training and personality were emphasized. These dual requirements for a potential probation officer are clear from early recruitment literature:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>a) Education: Preferably graduation from college or its equivalent, or from a school of social work.</p>
<p>b) Experience: At least one year in case work under supervision.</p>
<p>c) Good personality and character; tact, resourcefulness and sympathy. (Probation and Supervision, Juvenile Courts at Work, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1748895811428174">Trought, 1927</xref>: 45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As noted earlier, in the process of professionalization, the link between probation and social work played an important role. It was not only that significant tasks in probation work were common with social work but also that the techniques borrowed by probation from social work enhanced the professional status of probation. Regarding programmes, for example, the years of professionalization marked the beginning of a more systematic approach to intervention, especially in terms of assessment. It appears that access to scientific knowledge coming mainly from social work gave probation access to a new discourse and helped probation officers to build up their legitimacy and public status. This close relationship between probation and social work was largely facilitated by the dominant penal-welfare ideology that had rehabilitation as a core characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland, 2001</xref>). Punishment was meant to be more than retribution but also rehabilitation. As the closest professional field to rehabilitation of offenders was social work this was the main source of inspiration for probation interventions. At the same time, religious values such as ‘love’, ‘charity’ and so on were still present in the probation discourse, though apparently not on the front page of job descriptions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone (2004</xref>: 57) puts it: ‘the literature of probation in its early years remains a curious hybrid of evangelistic fervor, scientific aspiration and what McWilliams has termed uninformed “moral judgment”’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1748895811428174">
<title>Years of Casework – Good Relationship and Diagnosis</title>
<p>In the context of the ‘destructuring impulse’, as it was called by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428174">Cohen (1985</xref>: 33), prison and other forms of asylum came under serious attacks and criticism. While calling for decarceration, this new movement claimed a more substantial role for community control, community alternatives and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428174">Cohen, 1985</xref>). This ideological enthusiasm, alongside the advances in psychology, psychiatry, social work and sociology, helped the probation service to shine even more.</p>
<p>At the same time the notion of offender rehabilitation was articulated with a new type of intervention: social casework. This new method was defined as a direct method of intervention based on a strong and open relationship between the offender and a trained social worker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895811428174">Home Office, 1962</xref>). In order for a relationship to be created some pre-conditions had to be met. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811428174">Monger (1964)</xref>, for instance, suggests that for a client to consider entering a relationship with a probation officer he or she needs to be aware of a need or problem and also have some hope or expectation that help will be forthcoming. On the other hand, in order to create a relationship with a client, a probation officer needs to have a capacity for concern, a capacity for understanding and a capacity of bearing burdens. Other authors describe the probation officer–client relationship as a ‘special type of friendship … in which the probation officer’s warm and sincere concern fertilizes the probationer’s capacity for growth and change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811428174">King, 1958</xref>: 73–76).</p>
<p>Beside relationships, casework is based on ‘social diagnosis’ and the ‘interview is the medium through which casework operates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811428174">King, 1964</xref>: 84). King also underlines the importance accorded to early childhood experiences in the development of offending behaviour: opening the door for psychoanalytic considerations of this type of behaviour. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428174">Heywood (1964</xref>: 45) suggests, a good caseworker needs to have some characteristics such as being a ‘person of warmth and likeability’ with the ‘quality of imaginative sympathy, allied to temperament’. Moreover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428174">Heywood (1964</xref>: 46) considers that the basis of casework consists of two elements: the application of the casework principles of acceptance, self-determination, client-participation, confidentiality and also ‘the ability and mastery of his subject which the worker brings and which give hope to the client so that he goes forward confidently with the worker to try to do something about his problem’.</p>
<p>One of the features of the casework era was that social work had become very concerned with psychological theories (usually Freudian) and tended to neglect issues of social policy and social environment, including the criminal justice environment. During this period, the probation officer was not well equipped to deal with issues of social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748895811428174">Raynor and Robinson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Practical help or interest in the material well-being of the probationer was still important for probation intervention but it also represented an opportunity for the person to reflect on ‘the inner person, enabling clients to get a clearer picture of themselves and develop insight into their behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1748895811428174">Robinson and Crow, 2009</xref>: 26). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748895811428174">Raynor and Vanstone (1994)</xref>, once professional status was gained through training and education, practice had to acquire more theoretical substance. As they put it: ‘uncomplicated help in itself was not enough’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748895811428174">Raynor and Vanstone, 1994</xref>: 396). Based on the conception that offending is a disease, a significant number of models of interventions began to develop (see, for example, the Models of Probation Practice in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone, 2004</xref>: Appendix 5).</p>
<p>To summarize, during the years of casework professional skills became more and more important in probation work. Probation officers needed to demonstrate significant specialist abilities such as the capacity to create a positive relationship, to diagnose, to plan and so on. At the same time, he or she was expected to display only a few personal characteristics (e.g. warmth, likeability, etc.). The role of those qualities seems to be in supporting professional skills. Most of them are meant to help the probation officer to create a good relationship and to give the offender the confidence to explore the ‘inner person’ or solve their problems. The mainstream ideology, at this time, was rather focused on the technicalities of how to do probation work in a scientific way.</p>
<p>McWilliams very well captured this smooth shift from a vocational profession to a more scientific one: ‘The gradual movement from the religious, missionary ideal to the scientific, diagnostic ideal, depending, in part, on notions of professionalism, required that probation work should be something for which people were trained to enter rather than called to follow’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811428174">May, 1991</xref>: 12). The tendency towards a more prescriptive approach to probation work was even more obvious in the years of casework. Taking examples from medicine, psychoanalysis or psychology, writers like Heywood and King describe probation interventions as a set of successive stages. Most of the time the process starts with the creation of a warm and open relationship, followed by a thorough social diagnosis. The interventions then take different directions: practical help; counselling; family counselling; ‘talking cure’ and so on.</p>
<p>As documented by others (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811428174">May, 1991</xref>) few studies had been conducted before the 1970s regarding the forms of the impact of probation work. We learn most of what we know about probation during this period from manuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428174">Heywood, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811428174">King, 1964</xref>) and descriptive or analytic articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428174">Bottoms and McWilliams, 1979</xref>). Neither official nor professional thinking about probation, prior to the 1970s, was connected to notions of effectiveness or other outcome indicators. Probation and its skills base were derived from social work-based theories and values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748895811428174">Smith, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1748895811428174">
<title>Years of Pessimism – Help in the Client’s Terms</title>
<p>At the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s, probation services in the UK and the USA came under serious attack from the evaluation studies. Governments in both the UK and the USA instigated a range of studies with the aim of assessing the impact of probation interventions on reoffending rates.</p>
<p>After the damning results of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895811428174">Martinson (1974)</xref> report and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811428174">Brody, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895811428174">Folkard et al., 1974</xref>) were published, probation services entered an era of pessimism – at least at the policy level. Although none of these studies stated directly and explicitly that probation interventions were ineffective, politicians and the media understood their reserved tone as pessimistic and declared, following Martinson that ‘nothing works’. As it was suggested in the literature, the ‘Nothing Works’ sentiment could be explained also by the ‘aggressively disappointed reaction’ or as a ‘cathartic reaction to the problems and conflicts the system entailed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland, 2001</xref>: 69). In the context of significant changes that transformed social and economic life in late modernity and as a reaction to the perceived crisis of the welfare state faith in rehabilitation lost its appeal for the official discourse. The new socio-economic forces – described as a combination between free-market ‘neo-liberalism’ and social conservatism – posed new challenges for the crime control field in terms of crime and insecurity, legitimacy and the effectiveness of welfare institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland, 2001</xref>). At the same time a new political configuration started to evolve based on a new set of class and race relations and a new political bloc that defined itself in opposition to the welfare state. All these forces created or at least facilitated the paradigm shift that that took place at the end of the 1970s in the crime control narratives.</p>
<p>If rehabilitating offenders is not possible then what is left for probation services to do?</p>
<p>Among the most influential theorists of the new probation policy and practice during the years of pessimism were <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428174">Anthony Bottoms and Bill McWilliams (1979)</xref> who proposed the ‘non-treatment paradigm’. This model prescribed a new role for the probation service, taking into account the structural characteristics of the service in the UK and also the research on effectiveness. According to this paradigm, the probation service is left with four ‘primary aims’: ‘1) the provision of appropriate help for offenders, 2) the statutory supervision of offenders, 3) diverting appropriate offenders from custodial sentences and 4) the reduction of crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428174">Bottoms and McWilliams, 1979</xref>: 168). Unlike the previous model of practice, the notion of ‘help’ is interpreted as defined by the client and not by the so-called expert-caseworker: ‘The caseworker does not begin with an assumption of client-malfunctioning; rather he offers his unconditional help with client-defined tasks, this offer having certain definite and defined boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428174">Bottoms and McWilliams, 1979</xref>: 172). This approach is designed to create a more collaborative effort where the client is sure about his options and makes the choices himself. Therefore, the probation officer is expected to deliver help in client-defined terms. Being based on a number of parole studies, help was mainly understood as practical support aiming at helping parolees to overcome the obstacles of reintegration. Commenting on a number of previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428174">Bottoms and McWilliams (1979</xref>: 175) noted also that ‘certain sorts of post-institutional social situations did have a significant impact on reconviction rates – this included marriage, jobs, and so on’. They continued:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it is not suggested that probation officers become marriage brokers, but an implication of this study is that if offenders are genuinely seeking to ‘settle down’, and probation officers are able to help them by collaborating in getting them into stable social situations, this will be more beneficial than intensive casework on the treatment model. (1979: 175)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Probationers had to be treated not as objects or as sick people but as people in concrete social contexts and within certain boundaries set up by the court. As for reducing crime, Bottoms and McWilliams see the role of the probation service more in the area of prevention. By changing elements in the community micro-structures (e.g. employment, housing, etc.) the probation service might contribute to crime reduction. Therefore the role of the probation officer would then be ‘that of helper and catalyst’ (1979: 188). Although the authors make use of different influential studies in the USA, the Netherlands and the UK, they admit that this new theoretical model is speculative and based on reflexivity rather than on solid research knowledge (for a full review of the ‘non-treatment paradigm’ see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748895811428174">Raynor and Vanstone, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland’s (2001)</xref> terms the decline of the rehabilitative ideal marked the ending of the penal-welfarism that started in the 1890s. Once rehabilitation disappeared as a core value the whole set of probation practices and ideologies collapsed. The new modern framework of corrections not only discouraged old practices but also labelled them as counter-productive and dangerous. The ‘non-treatment paradigm’ transformed the role and therefore the profile of the probation officer from treatment provider to sick individuals to a help provider, where the main role was not played by an expert (as in the previous ‘medical model’) but by the client himself. Another significant change within the probation officer’s profile was the turn towards law enforcement. Once the second aim of the probation service became the provision of ‘statutory supervision of offenders’ the surveillance side of the probation officer’s profile was made more visible. In the early 1980s, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811428174">Home Office (1984)</xref> changed the aim of the probation service from rehabilitation into diverting offenders from custody. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748895811428174">Smith (2005</xref>: 626) put it: ‘The purpose of the service was thus re-written to stress its value as a vehicle for reducing, or at least controlling, the prison population.’ The probation officer was expected to practise a new form of casework that maximized the area of choice for the offender within the limits of the probation order, but the emphasis of probation shifted from benefits to the offender to benefits to the system. Skills such as collaborative assessment, task setting and so on were still important but the probation officer’s personal qualities and characteristics were rarely mentioned. It looks as if they were now considered by academics and policy-makers as belonging to that counter-productive and dangerous set of ideas from the past. However, as noted earlier, the probation officer was expected to divert offenders from custody and that required officers to have knowledge of the criminal justice system and sentencing practice, and skill in communicating with decision-makers, especially through social inquiry reports. These skills might be seen as relevant in addition to those identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428174">Bottoms and McWilliams (1979)</xref>. From the literature, it seems that the departure from rehabilitation implies no special staff characteristics – or at least not the ones typical for social workers. The best illustration of this drift is the replacement of the Diploma in Social Work with the Diploma in Probation Studies in 1998 in the UK. One of the arguments for this move was to remove probation training from social work and turn probation’s profile towards a more technical and punitive attitude (Knight, 2002, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895811428174">Nellis, 2003</xref>). All these changes had some implications for the probation system in England and Wales. In terms of probation practice the impact of the new official discourse was not so easy to discern. According to some authors, all the assumptions that built the rehabilitation ideal of probation service were demolished and that led to a deep crisis and professional anomie among probation practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland, 2001</xref>). By contrast, other authors have argued that probation officers started to develop exciting and innovative practices, stimulated especially by the work of McGuire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748895811428174">Priestley and McGuire, 1983</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811428174">Priestley (1974)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428174">Canton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone, 2004</xref>). Therefore it is possible that most of the staff characteristics, skills and programmes described in the previous section continued to be present in the probation service.</p>

<title>Rehabilitation Revival – What Works and Its Limited ‘Transfer’ into the Real World</title>
<p>At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, researchers from the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895811428174">McIvor, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748895811428174">Raynor, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1748895811428174">Roberts, 1989</xref>) and from Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1748895811428174">Ross et al., 1988</xref>) started to question the Nothing Works ideology. Most of their conclusions were based on the re-assessment of past evaluations or on new experiments with a more solid methodological foundation. For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1748895811428174">Ross and his colleagues (1988)</xref> reviewed 40 years of experimental work with offenders and noticed that persistent offenders ‘suffer’ a range of thinking skills deficiencies (e.g. lack of awareness of the consequences, lack of rigorous planning skills, insufficient negotiation skills and so on). On this basis, they designed the Reasoning and Rehabilitation programme aiming at dealing with all these thinking deficits.</p>
<p>Although in another article <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1748895811428174">Ross and Fabiano (1985)</xref> have made a full list of qualities that a good probation officer should have (ability to motivate, to model reasoning and problem solving, to identify cognitive distortions, creativity, etc.) and stated that the personal qualities of the practitioner are essential in any successful programme, this tended to be neglected at the policy level or when transferred to real life practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895811428174">Raynor et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In England and Wales, Peter Raynor and Maurice Vanstone (1994) adapted this programme for the Mid-Glamorgan Probation Service (under the name STOP) and demonstrated, using a quasi-experimental study with matched comparison groups, that a rigorous application of it could lead to a significant reduction in reconviction rates (from the expected rate of 42 per cent to an actual rate for those who completed STOP of 35 per cent).</p>
<p>The logical question that followed was ‘What Works?’ in reducing reoffending. Several meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811428174">Andrews and Bonta, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811428174">Antonowicz and Ross, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895811428174">Dowden and Andrews, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811428174">Lipsey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895811428174">Lösel, 1995</xref>) have suggested that interventions based on the principles of risk, need and general responsivity (RNR) are associated with important reductions in reoffending. Briefly, the principle of risk suggests that the intensity of a programme or intervention should match the level of risk. The need principle states that an effective intervention should target criminogenic needs (e.g. substance misuse, peer associations, antisocial attitudes, etc.). The responsivity principle suggests that the style and mode of intervention should match the learning style of the offenders. Cognitive–behavioural and social learning strategies proved to be most effective in reducing reoffending. Other meta-analyses indicated that the integrated application of all these three principles can reduce reoffending by between 26 per cent and 30 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811428174">Dowden and Andrews, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As noticed, most of these principles focus on the content of interventions and not on the way they are implemented. Although staff skills and characteristics were not recognized in the early 1990s as being at least as important as the programme design or content in reducing reoffending, they have begun to be emphasized in more recent What Works literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1748895811428174">Trotter (1996)</xref> was probably one of the first researchers who put staff skills back on the agenda (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811428174">Andrews and Kiessling, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748895811428174">Raynor, 1988</xref>). In his probation experimental study undertaken in Victoria, Australia, he concluded that pro-social modelling and reinforcement were significantly correlated with lower reoffending and imprisonment rates, while the use of problem solving and role clarification and empathy together with pro-social modelling were associated with reduced reoffending.</p>
<p>Probably to compensate for the excessive focus on the programme content and to emphasize further the role of staff skills, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811428174">Dowden and Andrews (2004)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis that summarized the role of core correctional practices (CCP) in reducing reoffending. In their analysis they found that five particular skills were associated with significant reduction of reoffending: effective use of authority; anti-criminal modelling and reinforcement; problem solving; use of community resources; and the quality of interpersonal relationship between staff and clients.</p>
<p>In their latest edition of the now classical book <italic>The Psychology of Criminal Conduct</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811428174">Andrews and Bonta (2010</xref>: 1332–1333) suggest under the principles of general responsivity and specific responsivity that effective correctional staff should ‘employ behavioral, social learning and cognitive behavioral techniques and skills building strategies’. They also advise correctional staff to build on strengths; reduce personal and situational barriers; establish high quality relationships and so on.</p>
<p>Using an experimental design, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895811428174">Bonta and colleagues (2010)</xref> demonstrated that probation officers trained in using risk–needs–responsivity principles are more effective than others. Those probation officers who were trained within the Strategic Training Initiative in Community Supervision (STICS) adhered more closely to the need principle and also had a more clearly defined structure of intervention (teaching focus), had better relationship skills and employed more cognitive techniques. These techniques were also correlated with reconviction rates after two years and the conclusion was very encouraging: the difference in reconviction rate between the control group and the experimental group was 15 per cent (25.3 per cent for the experimental group and 40.5 per cent for the control group).</p>
<p>Most of these skills sets were also identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895811428174">Raynor and colleagues (2010)</xref> in their Jersey study. In their interim conclusion they also noted that significant differences among probation officers are in terms of their structuring skills (e.g. problem solving, prosocial modelling, cognitive restructuring, etc. – skills intended to bring about change) and this might influence the offender’s progress. Furthermore it seems that offenders supervised by probation officers who scored above average on the skills scale had significant improvements in their LSI-R (Level of Service Inventory – Revised) scores. Another important preliminary finding is that ‘use of authority’ and ‘problem solving’ are also strongly associated with improvements in LSI-R score (Raynor, personal communication). As the author suggested, all these preliminary findings need to be investigated in larger studies.</p>
<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811428174">Dowden and Andrews (2004)</xref> noted, there are still not many studies that examine the role of staff characteristics in effective correctional treatment. The possible explanations they proposed were: the programmes failed to describe their staff and treatment procedures; and there is an absence of these skills in these human services. Since the vast majority of the evaluation studies focus on the programme design or content and neglect matters of implementation the first explanation seems more plausible.</p>
<p>Based on this fresh scientific evidence, probation officers in Canada, the UK and the Netherlands are asked by their managers to deliver evidence-based programmes and interventions. In England and Wales for instance the National Offender Management Service was created ‘to reflect learning from other reviews, studies, research and experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811428174">NOMS, 2006</xref>: 7). Increasingly probation officers in Canada and the UK are required to utilize very sophisticated methods of risk assessment (e.g. Level of Service/Case Management Inventory, OASys) that demand weeks of training and extensive manuals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428174">Burnett (2004)</xref>, one reason for introducing standardized risk assessment instruments was the belief that the traditional relationship between offender and probation officer led to subjectivity and therefore was unreliable. This new technology led to a radical transformation of the probation officer from caseworker to the manager of risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811428174">Fitzgibbon (2007</xref>: 88) for instance understands this transformation as a deskilling experience: ‘Deskilling takes place through substitution of the old casework skills with pre-formatted “tick box” assessment system epitomized by OASys. Practitioners thereby become interchangeable.’</p>
<p>Groupwork programmes are also designed, described in very elaborate, detailed manuals and accredited by special expert bodies. Working procedures are also prescribed and detailed and the room for professional discretion is less and less. Offender managers (as some probation officers are called) are also required to engage with other organizations, within and beyond the criminal justice system, to provide services to offenders. According to NOMS, offender managers are required to deliver evidence-based practice in a standard model – the Offender Management Model. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811428174">NOMS (2006</xref>: 9, emphasis added) put it, the model ‘defines in more detail … what it is that Offender Managers <italic>do</italic> in order to “manage” offenders’. It was only recently that the National Offender Management Service in England and Wales returned to the ‘old’ probation style and asked probation staff to act as ‘active collaborators’ and use pro-social modelling in their daily practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811428174">NOMS, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this managerial context the way and the extent to which these evidence-based interventions are implemented in practice is rather difficult to estimate. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811428174">Bonta and colleagues (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1748895811428174">Trotter and Evans (2010)</xref> and others, practitioners make some use of the effective core correctional skills. They seem to use some relationship skills, positive reinforcement and problem exploration skills but tend to under-use confrontational skills (when they encounter anti-social expressions), paraphrasing and reflection. As a consequence of the new managerialism, most of these evidence-based programmes take the form of precisely prescribed interventions applied to different groups of offenders following the model of ‘one size fits all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1748895811428174">Ward and Maruna, 2007</xref>: 23). Groupwork seems to have regained its momentum as one of the main methods of working with offenders. ‘Programme fetishism’ seems to have replaced ‘normal’ supervision instead of supplementing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748895811428174">Smith, 2005</xref>: 627).</p>
<p>As shown earlier, there is some evidence of a clear divide between theory and research on the one hand and policy and practice on the other hand. While research documents interventions based on content and skills, policy and practice seem to attend mainly to contents and not to the manner of implementation. It seems that although the What Works literature had begun to stress the importance of staff skills, this failed to be reflected appropriately in the official practice guidance. The difficulty of ‘technology transfer’ into the ‘real world’ of probation practice is already acknowledged in a significant number of studies (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811428174">Andrews and Bonta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811428174">Bourgon et al., 2010</xref>). The focus of probation policy and practice is therefore on what the probation officer does and not on how. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone (2004</xref>: 155) puts it ‘the world of the practitioner has become increasingly prescribed and rule-bound’. In other words the policy emphasis is on procedure and technicality and not on the probation officer’s personal characteristics. Staff skills became more and more important, but only as subordinates to the ‘programme fetishism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1748895811428174">Smith, 2005</xref>: 627). As argued earlier, this order of priorities made some scholars believe that the last stop on this road is the deskilling of staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811428174">Fitzgibbon, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Desistance and Other Emerging Approaches – the Return to Morality</title>
<p>In early 2000, a number of scholars started to look at rehabilitation from a different perspective. If the ‘non-treatment paradigm’ and the What Works paradigm ask the question of how practice should be designed in order to reduce reoffending, the new paradigm – the desistance paradigm – starts by asking the question of how ex-offenders desist from offending. Drawing on a significant number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811428174">Burnett, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895811428174">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811428174">Farrall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895811428174">Maruna, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811428174">Maruna and Farrall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811428174">Maruna et al., 2004</xref>, among others), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811428174">McNeill (2006)</xref> articulates the theoretical bases of the desistance paradigm. One of its most important features is that desistance is understood as a process, led by the client, that the probation officer needs to promote and support. Desistance is also placed at the intersection between structure, agency and reflexivity, emphasizing at the same time the importance of both human and social capital as well as the motivation and the subjective identity of the offender. In terms of probation intervention, skills and characteristics this new approach has the merit of assigning a great importance to a ‘legitimate and respectful relationship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811428174">McNeill, 2006</xref>: 55) in which the worker acts ‘as an advocate providing a conduit to social capital as well as a “treatment” provider building on human capital’ (2006: 57). Drawing on literature in psychology and counselling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811428174">McNeill (2006</xref>: 52) notes that the therapist’s variables that bring about the change are: ‘empathy and genuineness; the establishment of a working alliance; and using person-centered, collaborative and “client-driven” approaches”.</p>
<p>This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811428174">Farrall’s (2002)</xref> findings based on the experience of a group of 199 probationers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811428174">Farrall (2002)</xref> noted that desistance could be attributed to probation interventions in only a few cases where the probation officer had helped with finding a job or reconciling the offender with his family. Apart from those isolated cases, desistance took place away from the probation service, in the probationer’s personal and social context where different obstacles to desistance were addressed. The importance of overcoming obstacles to achieve and sustain desistance was stated again in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811428174">Farrall (2004)</xref> and that put the role of probation officer into a new perspective: supporting desistance by helping individuals to overtake obstacles to desistance within their own personal and social context. Instead of ‘managing’ the offender, an effective probation officer should practise a more collaborative approach in ‘co-designing interventions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811428174">McNeill, 2006</xref>: 57) to support change.</p>
<p>In her study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748895811428174">Rex (1999)</xref> anticipated some of these variables as being highly relevant in the process of probation supervision. Based on interviewing 21 probation officers and 60 probationers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748895811428174">Rex (1999)</xref> concluded that probationers who attributed positive change to probation benefited from an active and participatory supervisory experience. In terms of the professional skills that probationers would like to see in the probation officer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748895811428174">Rex (1999</xref>: 371) noted that the probation officer needs to be experienced, knowledgeable, reasonable and also to display ‘expert qualities’ that would encourage probationers to disclose sensitive information and feel confident that they are listened to and taken seriously. The same study stated that in order for probationers to feel committed and positively engaged in the supervisory relationship, the probation officer needs to demonstrate empathy (87 per cent of probationers), to have the capacity to listen and to show interest and understanding, and enable them to talk (65 per cent of probationers). At the same time, 65 per cent of the probationers said that they appreciate more formal aspects of supervision, 35 per cent of them declared that a certain amount of distance would be useful and 58 per cent wanted to be treated with respect. Although it is not known whether those probationers were desisters – and there is no demonstrable causal relationship between those variables and desistance – the contribution of this study is significant for its understanding of the ‘user’s view’ and their expectations for engaging in a positive relationship.</p>
<p>In their Liverpool Desistance Study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811428174">Maruna et al. (2004)</xref> emphasized that in the effort to reintegrate ex-prisoners back into society risk has to be balanced with potential strengths of the offender. An effective way of achieving that is by involving the individual in his/her own evaluation and using techniques that look at the ‘whole individual’ and not an artificial individual constructed from ticking boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811428174">Fitzgibbon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An even more offender-focused approach is the one promoted by the Good Lives Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1748895811428174">Ward and Maruna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1748895811428174">Ward and Stewart, 2003</xref>). Briefly, the Good Lives Model (GLM) is a strength-based rehabilitation framework that focuses on the offender as a whole person and not only as a risk carrier. The correctional staff who use this model ‘seek[s] constructive and collaborative ways of working with offenders on their achievement of pro-social and personally meaningful lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748895811428174">Purvis et al., 2011</xref>: 6). Since GLM is grounded in the principles of human dignity and human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1748895811428174">Ward, 2009</xref>), the concepts of respect and human agency are essential. The offender plays the main role in the information gathering stage but also in designing the case management plan and the goal setting. The probation officer and the offender constitute a team that works towards a more constructive and fulfilling life for the offender. As the developers of GLM suggest, in order to be effective in the use of GLM, probation staff are required to attend specialist training and benefit from supervision and mentoring. Although this approach has not been empirically evaluated yet, probation services like the one in Victoria/Australia which have implemented the model since 2008 make positive comments about its potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748895811428174">Purvis et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As can be seen from the earlier discussion, desistance and GLM literature make a clear and convincing return not only to staff skills but also to staff characteristics. An effective correctional officer is one who has all the skills described in the What Works literature to develop human and social capital and at the same time must be ‘experienced’, ‘knowledgeable’ and to ‘show respect’. In order to capture these new dimensions of probation practice, desistance research turned its focus on the ‘user’s view’ and stimulated the development of a new research stream complementary to the one promoted by What Works which was very much focused on effectiveness and impact.</p>
<p>In terms of how this literature is reflected in practice there are some studies that indicate that despite the ‘punishment in the community’ and public protection focus promoted by the UK government, ‘real practice’ tends to ‘continue to be based on a more humanistic, person-based approach’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811428174">Deering, 2010</xref>: 24). It can be therefore assumed that probation officers exercise some of these skills and characteristics for a long time but invisibly.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this article is to capture the dynamics between staff skills, staff characteristics and programmes over time in the probation literature. As demonstrated in the previous sections, the way these elements have been ordered and conceptualized has depended primarily on the purpose of the probation service as it was established in the literature or at policy level. For instance when the purpose of the service was to ‘save souls’ the main staff characteristic of a probation officer was to ‘be a man of God’.</p>
<p>As time passed, the purpose of the service became more and more multi-dimensional and the dynamics between these three components became more and more sophisticated. However, at risk of oversimplifying, one trend could be identified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748895811428174">Figure 1</xref>):</p>

Programmes and skills tend to be approached separately especially after the emergence of the What Works literature.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another important factor that influenced the dynamics between staff characteristics, staff skills and programmes was criminology. While the source of criminal behaviour was seen as poor or uncompleted socialization, deprivation or even some abnormal psychological dispositions, the probation officer’s mission was to tackle these issues alone (as an expert) or (later) in partnership with the offender. In this sort of approach engaging and structuring skills and characteristics played a crucial role. Programmes and special interventions were also useful in structuring the work with offenders. The rise of a criminology of everyday life that treats the offender as a rational actor who seeks to maximize pleasure and explains crime as a lack of inhibitors shifted the focus from the individual to the event or the criminological situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland, 2001</xref>). If the most effective way to control crime is by blocking targets, work with offenders does not sound so important any more. One of the consequences is that probation staff are not required to work primarily on changing offending behaviour but to monitor the risk and contribute to the control ‘net’.</p>
<p>Over time some characteristics or skills appeared on the scene of probation practice and policy, played an important role for a while and then disappeared into the background (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748895811428174">Table 1</xref>). Some of them returned onto the stage (for instance empathy, collaborative relationship, etc.), some others are still forgotten. What is striking is that the new desistance literature and to a certain extent the What Works research draw our attention towards the old and traditional casework skills and characteristics that could enhance the effectiveness of the new case-management skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811428174">Fitzgibbon, 2007</xref>). These new research studies could become an important source of return to the old values and practices. This U turn made <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1748895811428174">Vanstone (2004</xref>: 157) end his book with the chapter ‘Back to where we started’, where he states that the success of the probation officer depends on the principles of effective practice but also ‘on the ability to engage with the individual in a relationship founded on concreteness, empathy and commitment’.</p>

<p>From an historical perspective it can be seen that after the era of professionalization, staff skills are becoming more and more prominent in the probation officer’s professional profile. Although they were essential in the early days, staff characteristics, like respectability, likeability, reasonability, kindness and so on disappeared almost completely from the literature until recently when the desistance research sent them back on stage. Empathy seems to have had the longest ‘career’, promoted as a staff characteristic since the years of casework, with one break during the years of pessimism.</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for these developments. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland (2001</xref>: 9) the modern penal system is characterized mainly by ‘just deserts’ and the ideology of ‘condemn more and understand less’. In this framework it seems that staff characteristics have no role to play – at least not one coming from the social work tradition. The end of penal welfarism led also to the end of staff characteristics in official probation discourse. Although the what works and desistance literature make a strong case for staff skills and characteristics they are not yet fully acknowledged in the official documents. This might be a sign of a parallel monologue between research on effectiveness and the mainstream ideology where policy-makers operating within a different framework play deaf to the findings of research.</p>
<p>The disappearance of staff characteristics in the official discourse could also be explained by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428174">Kaufmann (1998 [1996])</xref> describes as the <italic>imperative of objectivity</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895811428174">2</xref></sup> When studying the history of sociology, the author observed that sociology started to be recognized as science once <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811428174">Durkheim (2002 [1895])</xref> formulated his fundamental rule: ‘social facts should be treated as things’. That means that the social world should not be interpreted from inside, from a subjective perspective, but rather as external and independent from the personal feelings or values. That was the beginning of a long process aiming to develop methods, techniques and approaches to ensure objectivity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428174">Kaufmann (1998 [1996])</xref> suggested, objectivity can be constructed with the assistance of numbers and also with a very detailed description of the criteria that capture the reality. In order for science to be recognized as such, it needs to cover a very specific field, to have a clear and sophisticated body of knowledge that a number of experts are able to share and also a technical language that allows these experts to intervene in the reality.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428174">Kaufmann (1998 [1996]</xref>: 205) identifies two main elements that characterize the industry of data production: industrial procedures (e.g. techniques that are impersonal, people who could be easily replaced, functioning is collective and integrated according to a clear set of criteria and procedures) and the trend towards more sophisticated tools: ‘the technique becomes a tool of the scientific objectification’. Interpretation is perceived as opposed to scientific neutrality and therefore reduced. The main effort focuses on the methodology that should be impersonal and objective. Looking at these descriptions it is striking to note that some of these features are quite common to probation developments. Since the years of professionalization probation practice was under severe and systematic pressure to objectivize its interventions. Probation started to become a real profession when it was called to provide specialist assessment for the court in order to assist the process of individualization. Since then, practice has become more and more sophisticated, demanding specialist-training programmes. A good example of the struggle for objectification is the new fashion in correctional interventions – risk assessment. One of the most important criteria for a reliable risk assessment tool is its replicability (inter-rater reliability): independent test administrators should produce similar results. Therefore it is not the probation officer who determines the outcome but the tool. Thus the probation officer can be easily replaced by another with the same skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811428174">Fitzgibbon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These similarities can be noted when comparing the procedures and performance indicators of contemporary probation and industrial production. Even the language seems to imply that probation is another industrial sector. Researchers like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811428174">Bourgon and colleagues (2010</xref>: 92) use the concept of ‘technology’ to designate ‘the “what works” body of knowledge and its corresponding principles of effective correctional treatment’. The evolution of probation practice and thus of programmes, staff skills and characteristics can be explained arguably as a process of <bold><italic>probation industrialization</italic></bold>. In this process, probation practice became more and more focused on objectivizing its techniques and therefore only what was external, measurable and objective was promoted in mainstream policy and practice (e.g. skills, programmes). By contrast what was perceived as subjective, non-replicable and impossible to measure was assumed non-professional and therefore rejected from the mainstream policy and practice (e.g. staff characteristics).</p>
<p>Another explanation for the disappearance of staff characteristics in the literature might be found in the research methodologies now fashionable. The rehabilitation research developed since the 1990s is almost exclusively based on meta-analytic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811428174">Dowden and Andrews, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811428174">Lipsey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895811428174">Lösel, 1995</xref>, among others) or randomized experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895811428174">Bonta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1748895811428174">Trotter, 1996</xref>, among others). These two research strategies seem to be promoted as reliable in providing evidence of correlations between certain practices and subsequent reoffending rates (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895811428174">Lösel, 2008</xref>). Although these two approaches have their advantages they fail to acknowledge fully the complexities of the social or human world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811428174">Byrne, 1998</xref>). As described earlier the correctional world is highly complex and includes besides contents other aspects such as context, social structures, personal style and so on. In randomized experiments, for instance, the researcher may manage to measure what he or she has intended to measure but may fail to examine other factors that may have interacted with these measured variables. As noted in some of the studies mentioned earlier, the impact of some interventions could be attributed substantially to the way they are implemented by the professionals involved. Furthermore, randomized experiments or other similar approaches are not designed to measure variables such as likeability, reasonableness and so on. More sophisticated or mixed research methods, such as case study, auto-ethnography or qualitative comparative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1748895811428174">Rihoux and Ragin, 2009</xref>), could probably produce a more complex and dynamic picture of the impact of one intervention. The merit of such methods would be that while based on small numbers they could generate possible causal relationships between unexpected different variables such as individual factors, social structures, staff characteristics and desistance. Moreover, it can be noted that most of the studies are based on one single method of data collection: some solely based on interviews, others based only on video data and so on. Although these methods are recognized as serving their purpose, they cannot capture the rich and the complex contexts (institutional, structural, subjective-narrative) in which probation interventions are taking place. A useful aid in this respect could be ‘triangulation by method’ (Denzin, 1978, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748895811428174">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>: 266) where different methods (observation, interview, document) look at the same phenomenon from different angles ‘showing that independent measures of it agree with it or, at least, do not contradict it’ (1994: 266) (for a more detailed description of how triangulation could be used in probation research see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895811428174">Bauwens, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This critical historical analysis sheds light on the dynamics across time of probation staff skills, characteristics and programmes. By using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428174">Cohen’s (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428174">Garland’s (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428174">Kaufmann’s (1998 [1996])</xref> work, it also provided a possible framework for understanding this dynamic within a broader crime control perspective. In the final section the article pointed to some new ways of exploring effectiveness or desistance using methodologies that could capture more accurately the nuances and the complexities of correctional practice, including the importance of staff skills and characteristics. In the end it is possible that staff characteristics, staff skills and programmes are centrally important for probation practice although we need to understand better their dynamics and their role within the post-welfare penal system. It would be further important to clarify whether the desire for effectiveness will moderate the impact of the neo-liberal penal populism on probation practice. If, for instance, staff characteristics such as caring, humane, charity-oriented and so on will receive more support from research, is the policy level ready to take this into official discourse? It can be reasonably anticipated that ‘payment by results’ (the new catechism in the public sector in England and Wales) may facilitate a more flexible and innovative practice by abandoning the over-regulatory impulses that characterized the probation policy in the last 10 years. The question is are the probation managers and probation officers ready to take the risks?</p>
