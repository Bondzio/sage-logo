<abstract>
<p>Conflict appears more often between neighboring states. Adjacency generates interaction opportunities and arguably more willingness to fight. We revisit the nature of the border issue and measure geographical features likely to affect states’ interaction opportunities as well as their willingness to fight. We do so for all on-shore borders from the period 1946–2001. Although each border is unique, a general result shows that the longer the border between two states, the more likely they are to engage in low-intensity conflict. This is particularly so for conflicts active during the Cold War and located in highly populated border regions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>International conflict is shaped by states’ interaction opportunities and their willingness to engage in conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0738894211433164">Starr, 1978</xref>). Neighboring and proximate states engage in more conflicts than other country dyads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0738894211433164">Bremer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0738894211433164">Gleditsch and Singer, 1975</xref>), mainly for three reasons: they have the opportunity to do so, they interact more overall, and they fight over territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0738894211433164">Vasquez, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The investigation of the role geography plays in shaping international interaction dates far back (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0738894211433164">Boulding, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0738894211433164">Mahan, 1918</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0738894211433164">Richardson, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0738894211433164">Sprout and Sprout, 1965</xref>), and important in studies of the geography–conflict nexus are issues related to international borders. Although most statistical studies represent geographical proximity by a dichotomous contiguity variable, by inter-capital distance, or by minimum distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0738894211433164">Gleditsch and Ward, 2001</xref>), some attention has also been devoted to the role of international borders per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0738894211433164">Furlong and Gleditsch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0738894211433164">Starr and Thomas, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr (2002)</xref> borders provide states with both opportunities and willingness to fight. While the relationship of proximity to conflict is one of the most robust findings in the study of interstate war, the results of empirical analyses on the influence of boundaries remain inconclusive.</p>
<p>Here we focus on how different geographical features in a border area shape neighboring states’ interaction opportunities, their willingness to interact, and consequently their propensity towards mutual conflict, based on a dataset on dyadic borders from 1946 to 2001 generated using a Geographical Information System (GIS). Our purpose with this study is twofold. First, we aim to mediate between the diverging findings in earlier studies. Our study provides more extensive geographical data in an attempt to reach more robust results: we start from the CShapes dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0738894211433164">Weidmann et al., 2010a</xref>) with a set of historically accurate boundaries and boundary changes since 1945. Rather than the more commonly used “flat” distance measures whose accuracy crucially depends on the map projection, we compile the length of international borders by measuring geodesic distances on the globe.</p>
<p>Second, we also aim to improve the understanding of environmental effects on borders and border regions more generally. We thus add several geographical characteristics of border areas using GIS: we include a new measure for terrain ruggedness and in addition measure the share of the border covered by forest, mountainous terrain, swamp land, and river. In order to take account of the local human environment, we add a variable estimating the population concentration in the border region, and we control for whether or not the border divides ethnic groups. Finally, we include spatial and temporal controls. We test our models for regional differences and for the entire temporal domain, as well as for the Cold War and post-Cold War periods separately.</p>
<p>Our results fall somewhere between the results of earlier studies. Border length is associated with an increased risk of conflict in a dyad, but only for low-intensity conflict or conflict in the border region itself. After the Cold War the conflict-inducing effect of border length is weaker and the impact on fatal conflicts is actually negative, suggesting that more recently, dyads with long borders have experienced less conflict. Further, other geographical features of a border, such as whether or not it follows a river, is covered by forest, or runs through rugged terrain or swamp land, do not seem to affect the risk of conflict in general. Conflict in the border regions is to some degree affected by these factors. Rugged terrain is positively associated with a greater risk of conflict in the border regions, whereas conflict is less likely in border regions with swamp land. Finally, population density in the border regions also has an impact on conflict risk.</p>
<p>We conclude that borders are complex phenomena, but that their geographical characteristics affect the risk of militarized disputes, especially near border regions to some extent. We also suggest cautiously that there seems to be a difference between before and after the end of the Cold War. Whereas the proximity of the administrative centers of two neighboring states and the population density in the border region are much more decisive for high-intensity conflict in the Cold War era, the tendency after the Cold War is that borders matter more than inter-capital distance.</p>
<p>The next section briefly presents relevant literature on geography and conflict, with particular reference to the role of borders. We then present the data and run an empirical analysis with a broader time span and spatial frame than in earlier studies.</p>

<title>Geography and Conflict: The Role of Borders</title>
<p>The role of geography in shaping conflict follows a long tradition in international relations research, particularly within a realist model (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0738894211433164">Holsti, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0738894211433164">Mackinder, 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0738894211433164">Mahan, 1918</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0738894211433164">Sprout and Sprout, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0738894211433164">Spykman, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0738894211433164">Vasquez, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0738894211433164">1995</xref>). Evolving from a geopolitical focus on location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0738894211433164">Mackinder, 1919</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0738894211433164">Spykman, 1944</xref>) and the importance of naval power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0738894211433164">Mahan, 1918</xref>), via the “ecological framework” of the Sprouts (1965) with emphasis on how international action was shaped by a state’s physical environment (or the state’s leaders perception of the opportunities and constraints within this environment), most recent studies have focused on the role of distance in relation to conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0738894211433164">Boulding, 1962</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0738894211433164">Diehl, 1991</xref> for a review).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0738894211433164">Starr (1978)</xref> introduced the concepts of opportunity and willingness to the study of international interaction. They are considered ordering concepts, necessary but not sufficient conditions for war, and provide a framework for linking environmental and systemic factors to the behavior of decision-makers. Opportunity represents the total set of environmental constraints and possibilities available within a given environment. Willingness is the process of choice or the selection of specific behaviors. Opportunity has most frequently been operationalized by geographical factors, and specifically by different measures of proximity, notably contiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0738894211433164">Gochman, 1991</xref>), inter-capital distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0738894211433164">Buhaug and Gleditsch, 2006</xref>), or minimum distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0738894211433164">Gleditsch and Ward, 2001</xref>). In fact, geographers have sometimes criticized the political science literature for equating geography with distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0738894211433164">O’Loughlin, 2000</xref>: 131; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0738894211433164">Flint et al., 2009</xref>). Willingness, on the other hand, has been measured by such variables as alliances, voting preferences, or democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0738894211433164">Mitchell and Prins, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0738894211433164">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0738894211433164">Vasquez (1995)</xref> put forward three explanations for the robust relationship between proximity and conflict: first, the classical realist explanation argues that neighboring states fight more simply because they have the opportunity to do so—neighbors are within reach as states are better able to project force across short distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0738894211433164">Boulding, 1962</xref>). The second explanation focuses on the total volume of interaction. Proximate states have more connection points and are likely to have more overall interaction, and some of this may generate friction. Both of these explanations point to the interaction opportunities provided by borders.</p>
<p>But international borders can also shape states’ willingness to fight. The third of the broad explanations for why neighbors fight focuses on the willingness aspect: border areas can be considered particularly salient areas for a number of reasons, and thus worth fighting over. States may desire to expand their home territory and border areas can be resource rich, both with respect to natural resources and human resources. Also, because other states are near, neighboring central governments may monitor activities in these areas attentively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr, 2002</xref>). Others have also discussed the role of proximity and borders in relation to conflict. For instance, whereas Richardson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0738894211433164">1952</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0738894211433164">1960</xref>) focused on the importance of contiguity itself, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0738894211433164">Wesley (1962)</xref> claimed that the length of the border between two states was likely to be more important.</p>
<p>Gibler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0738894211433164">2007</xref>: 517f) argued that international borders are likely to be stable when the states feel that their territoriality is not threatened. Thus, islands will have stable borders, and so will states with “natural borders” where the frontiers follow topographic features on the ground. Such sharp geographical differences add legitimacy to border demarcation as opposed to ad hoc or arbitrary boundaries. However, Gibler’s study is based on data at the national level and is thus less well-equipped to provide information about the border region as such.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr (2002)</xref> pointed to the need to look more closely into the nature of the actual borders to clarify their real impact. Obviously, borders are not uniform. Can a long border going through steep mountainous terrain ease the interaction opportunities between two states? More so than a shorter border between two large cities connected by highways and railroads? As a first attempt, Starr and colleagues developed a comprehensive dataset on international borders based on GIS, in order to incorporate both factors of opportunity and willingness. Based on the <italic>Digital Chart of the World</italic> for 1992, they created three indices, assessing respectively <italic>ease of interaction, salience</italic>, and <italic>vitalness</italic> of border areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0738894211433164">2</xref></sup> Starr and Thomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0738894211433164">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">2005</xref>) analyze a total of 301 contiguous land borders and find some support for the importance of the nature of borders. Their main empirical finding is that the relationships between conflict and their measures of ease of interaction and salience are curvilinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">Starr and Thomas, 2005</xref>). Where ease of interaction or salience is at mid-range, the risk of conflict is higher than at either end. A major problem with their analysis, however, is the lack of control variables and the fact that their analysis only covers a single year, 1992. Indeed, they point to the need for a more thorough investigation with variation over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">Starr and Thomas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0738894211433164">Furlong and Gleditsch (2003)</xref> covered a long time period (1816–1992) and used their measure of boundary length in a standard model of interstate conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0738894211433164">Furlong et al., 2006</xref>). At the time, reliable time-variant GIS data were not available, so they applied a mechanical curvimeter to manually measure current and historical international borders. However, they only measured the length of the shared borders and not any of the other measures developed by Starr. They had expected that controlling for the geographical opportunity of a long border would render insignificant their measure for willingness—a shared river. But this turned out not to be the case. They therefore concluded, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0738894211433164">Toset et al. (2000)</xref> that sharing a river makes two states more willing to fight, over and above the effect of geographical proximity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0738894211433164">Braithwaite (2006)</xref> applied the vitalness index from Starr in a study of the geographical spread of conflict. He found that conflicts between states that share a vital border are actually less likely to spread. However, his analysis did not address the issue of whether or not conflicts are likely to occur in the first place between countries sharing a vital border.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0738894211433164">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>By generating variables characterizing several geographical aspects of international borders for a longer period of time, we reexamine how various characteristics of borders and border areas influence the risk of conflict.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0738894211433164">
<title>A Geographical Model of Conflict</title>
<p>Based on the work of Starr and Vasquez, we expect that international boundaries are likely to affect both the opportunity and willingness to engage in international conflict. First, two adjacent states have more interaction opportunities and are likely to have a higher overall volume of interaction. Second, we also expect certain geographical features of a particular border region to affect states’ willingness to engage in conflict. We do not claim that geographical factors are the sole catalysts of conflict, or even the most important, merely that they contribute to an increased risk of conflict between two neighboring states. Conflicts vary tremendously in intensity and area, and we expect that features of a border region may affect large-scale international conflict and smaller interstate disputes located in the border regions differently. Below we specify these expectations through testable hypotheses.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr (2002)</xref> and Starr and Thomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0738894211433164">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">2005</xref>) measured features of borders through three indices. Instead, we focus on specific geographical features of border regions in order to be able to isolate the separate effects of each factor. The main factor reinvestigated here is the length of a border. Although scholars suggested rather early using border length as a measure for geographical opportunity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0738894211433164">Wesley, 1962</xref>), reliable measures for border length were not developed until recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0738894211433164">Furlong and Gleditsch, 2003</xref>). However, as noted, studies using these measures have not yielded conclusive results. We improve the existing measurement and reinvestigate the hypothesis that states with longer shared borders engage in more conflict because of increased opportunities or higher interaction volume. In addition to a higher overall increased risk of conflict, states with long shared borders will also be more likely to experience conflicts located in the border regions, as higher interaction volume would lead to incidents in the border regions. Our first hypotheses are thus:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>H1a</italic>: The longer a shared border between two states, the higher the risk of onset of interstate conflict.</p>
<p><italic>H1b</italic>: The longer a shared border between two states, the higher the risk of onset of interstate conflict in the border region.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the sheer length of a shared border, several other geographical factors are likely to affect the interaction opportunity between two states, since such features make a border more or less permeable.</p>
<p>In the civil war literature some measure of inaccessible landscape is often included with the expectation that it has an impact on conflict. Typically this includes mountains, jungle, and swamps and is commonly referred to by the generic term “rough terrain” (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0738894211433164">Fearon and Laitin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0738894211433164">Buhaug and Rød, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0738894211433164">Rustad et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas rough terrain can make it easier for guerilla troops to hide from government forces in civil wars, our expectation for international conflict is that areas that are mountainous, with dense canopy cover or with much swamp, are likely to be difficult or impossible to penetrate for troops with heavy machinery and supply. In addition, the interaction volume is likely to be smaller, with less contact across the border. We thus expect the risk of conflict to be lower in general if the border runs through particularly rough terrain. For the same reasons we also expect that there will be fewer conflict incidents in such border regions:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0738894211433164">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>H2a</italic>: The higher the percentage of a border that runs through some form of rough terrain, the lower the risk of onset of interstate conflict.</p>
<p><italic>H2b</italic>: The higher the percentage of a border that runs through some form of rough terrain, the lower the risk of onset of interstate conflict in the border region.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While rough terrain can inhibit interstate conflict, we expect borders that are delineated by rivers to increase conflict risk. River borders generally ease interaction. Large rivers, if navigable, make troop removals easier and quicker than across land. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0738894211433164">Gibler (2007</xref>: 517, relying on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0738894211433164">Vasquez, 1995</xref>: 288) considers rivers as natural and therefore stable frontiers. However, this overlooks the possibility that a shared river border is potentially volatile and may lead to territorial disputes. River borders generally follow the Thalweg (the deepest channel in the river), which is exposed to erosion as well as silting and may move over time. For example, the Sino-Soviet border clash in 1969 involving several months of fighting occurred over a disputed demarcation line between the two countries in the Ussuri River and the ownership of Chenpao Island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0738894211433164">Gleditsch et al., 2006</xref>: 365). River borders can also be especially prone to fighting because states seek control over such resources as fishing or navigation rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0738894211433164">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two hypotheses are put forward to test the argument about river boundaries. The first relates to how rivers serve to increase interaction opportunity. We expect the risk of interstate conflict overall to be higher when a large part of the shared border is a river. The second hypothesis focuses on the willingness aspect. We expect that if a conflict is over the border delineation itself, or over the control of islands, fisheries or navigation, the conflict will be more likely to take place in a border region.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>H3a</italic>: The higher the percentage of a border that follows a river, the higher the risk of onset of interstate conflict.</p>
<p><italic>H3b</italic>: The higher the percentage of a border that follows a river, the higher the risk of onset of interstate conflict in the border region.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, in addition to the geographical factors, we also examine the demography of the border region. Populous border areas and possibilities for contact across the border are likely to increase the opportunity as well the willingness to fight. Both the volume of interaction and the salience of a border are likely to be affected by demography. More people mean more interaction opportunities and more to fight over. It is also likely that a higher population indicates that the land is fertile and salient to the country. We thus expect high population density in a border region to affect both the opportunity and willingness of states to engage in conflict, both in general and in the border regions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>H4a</italic>: The higher the population concentration in the border region, the higher the risk of interstate conflict.</p>
<p><italic>H4b</italic>: The higher the population concentration in the border region, the higher the risk of interstate conflict in this region.</p>

The geographical variation of a phenomenon is expressed by pixel values which typically could represent elevation, temperature, forest cover, population or any other continuously varying phenomena. Vector data, on the other hand, use points, polylines, and polygons to represent geo-referenced phenomena. A polyline is a series of straight line segments and a polygon is one or more polylines enclosing an area. The scale typically determines which geometry is used to represent a certain phenomenon. A city, for instance, may be represented as a point on a global scale, but as a polygon on a local scale. Currently, many datasets used by conflict and peace studies, such as the CShapes dataset, are available in GIS-readable form.</p>
<p>The CShapes dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0738894211433164">Weidmann et al., 2010a</xref>) contains a set of historically accurate country boundaries after 1945 and is compatible with the Correlates of War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0738894211433164">COW, 2008</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0738894211433164">Gleditsch and Ward (1999)</xref> lists of states in the international system. Each country in the dataset is represented as a polygon with attributes for the year, month, and day the country entered or left the state system. For 1946, for example, only four African countries existed; Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, and South Africa. The variation of borders over time is taken care of by using overlapping polygons. Thus, one large polygon represents Ethiopia for the period 1946–92, overlapping with a smaller polygon representing Ethiopia from 1993 as well as a new polygon representing Eritrea. As our unit of analysis is the onshore border-dyad-year, we transformed the country polygon to linear features and removed the coastal border. Linear features stored in a GIS have directions that allowed us to use the left–right topology to identify the two countries sharing the border. We used the Correlates of War (COW) country codes for identifying the dyads. The COW codes for Ethiopia and Eritrea are 530 and 531, respectively, so the dyad identifier (dyadid) of their border is 530531 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0738894211433164">Figure 1</xref>). Eritrea gained its independence from Ethiopia in May 1993. Thus, this border dyad first enters our dataset in 1993 and appears nine times until the end of our times series (2001). Based on the GIS data we compiled a dataset in Stata format with the border-sharing dyad-year as the unit of analysis (N=11,714).</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>We used four different dependent variables, all variants of onset of a militarized interstate dispute (MID) between two states in a dyad in a given year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0738894211433164">Table 1</xref>). First, we distinguished between all MIDs (<italic>MID</italic>), MIDs with at least one fatality (<italic>fatalMID</italic>), and war (<italic>War</italic>) that requires a minimum of 1,000 battle deaths. The data are from the Correlates of War Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0738894211433164">Ghosn et al., 2004</xref>). The variables are dummy-coded with a 1 if a conflict started in the given year. Years with continuation of the conflict are coded as 0. In addition, we also applied MIDloc data, which include information about the geographical locations of MIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0738894211433164">Braithwaite, 2010</xref>). We restricted our sample of these MIDs to those situated 50 km or less from an international border. This variable, <italic>MIDloc</italic>, is also dichotomous, taking the value of 1 if a MID within this restriction occurred in a given year between two states.</p>

<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Our independent variables are geographical and demographic characteristics of borders and border regions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0738894211433164">Table 1</xref>). We introduced a new measure for border length, <italic>BorderLen</italic>, the log-transformed geodesic distance. No projection enables us to calculate true distances on a global map. We therefore calculated the geodesic distance, that is, the shortest segment of a great circle connecting two points on the surface of the Earth. Thus, instead of measuring the length of the linear features representing borders in two-dimensional geometry (the “flat” projected map), we measured the lengths of each individual straight line segment used to represent the border-dyad as it appears on the globe.</p>
<p>As a measure for terrain roughness, we also calculated the surface distance and divided it by the “flat” distance to create a rough terrain index, <italic>Rugged terrain</italic>. In level terrain, the surface distance will equal the “flat” distance, but in steeper terrain the surface distance will be longer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0738894211433164">Figure 2</xref> for an exaggerated hypothetical example). To secure the best accuracy when measuring these “flat” distances, we applied the Winkel-Tripel projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0738894211433164">Goldberg and Gott, 2007</xref>). For level terrain, <italic>Rugged terrain</italic> is close to 1. An extreme case is the border between Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which runs across Lake Tanganyika and gets a <italic>Rugged terrain</italic> value of exactly 1. The two highest <italic>Rugged terrain</italic> values are for the short border between Monaco and France (1.0253) and the border between Pakistan and China (1.0252). To measure surface distance, we used the digital elevation model GTOPO30 from the US Geological Survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eros.usgs.gov">http://eros.usgs.gov</ext-link>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0738894211433164-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Other geographical measures indicating rough terrain include data on forests, swamps, and mountains. Information on forest cover and swamps were taken from VMap0 which is a relatively new vector dataset that represents an updated version of the <italic>Digital Chart of the World</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gis-lab.info/qa/vmap0-eng.html">http://gis-lab.info/qa/vmap0-eng.html</ext-link>). We measured the geodesic distance of the part of the border passing through forests or swamps and divided it by <italic>BorderLen</italic> to get the percentages. The variables are called <italic>%Forest</italic> and <italic>%Swamp</italic>, respectively. Mountain data for the variable <italic>%Mountain</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0738894211433164">Figure 1</xref>) were received in raster format from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0738894211433164">UNEP (2002)</xref>. Pixel resolution on this dataset is five arc minutes (approximately 10 km at the Equator) and each pixel has a value between 0 and 1 that indicates the amount of mountainous terrain in the area covered by the pixel. We generated polygons from this dataset for all pixels with a pixel value greater than 0.5 (mountainous terrain dominates) and measured the percentage of the border passing through these polygons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0738894211433164">Figure 1</xref>, approximately 63% of the border length separating Ethiopia and Eritrea is covered by mountainous terrain.</p>
<p>To calculate the river variable, <italic>%River</italic>, we used the dataset on <italic>navigable</italic> rivers from the CIA World DataBank II project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.evl.uic.edu/pape/data/WDB/">www.evl.uic.edu/pape/data/WDB/</ext-link>). Navigability is here defined as the stream of water moving slowly enough for a vessel to pass (that is less than 20 km/hr or 3 min per km). We calculated the percentage of a border that follows a river.</p>
<p>In order to have a more precise control for population, we estimated the size of the population living within a 50 km buffer area on both sides of the border dyad. We used the Gridded Population of the World (GPWv3) dataset—with resolution 2.5 arc minutes—from CIESIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw/index.jsp">http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw/index.jsp</ext-link>) where each pixel value represents the number of people in the area covered by the pixel. The population rasters represent population size as it was in 1990 and every five years thereafter. We thus used the population datasets from 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0738894211433164">6</xref></sup> By summarizing the pixel values located within all dyads on the border, we arrive at an estimate of the population living within the border area. We log transformed the variable and called it <italic>borderpop</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0738894211433164">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>In addition to the new geographical variables we applied several control variables common to conflict models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0738894211433164">Bremer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0738894211433164">Oneal and Russett, 2005</xref>). First, to control for country size we included data for the population of the largest (<italic>lnlrgpop</italic>) and smallest (<italic>lnsmlpop</italic>) country in the dyad. To control for wealth, we used GDP per capita for the richest country in the dyad (<italic>lnlrggdpc</italic>) and the poorest (<italic>lnsmlgdpc</italic>). All these variables are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0738894211433164">Hegre (2008)</xref> and are log-transformed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0738894211433164">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>We also included <italic>lndistan</italic>, which measures the distance between the two states’ capitals, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0738894211433164">Oneal &amp; Russett (2005)</xref>. <italic>Twodemoc</italic> is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 if both countries in the dyad are democratic. The variable originally comes from the Polity IV project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0738894211433164">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Peacehis2</italic> is a decay function containing the number of previous years without militarized interstate dispute (MID) in the dyad or the time since the younger of the two countries gained independence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0738894211433164">8</xref></sup> This variable was included because the level of interaction in a dyad is dependent on the level in previous years. The variable was originally created to be a control for temporal dependence in conflict, widely used in logit regressions. <italic>Dytrd</italic> measures total trade in the dyad in millions of USD (1996). All values below 0.2 (USD 200,000) were replaced by that figure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0738894211433164">9</xref></sup> The variable is log-transformed.</p>
<p>Finally, as robustness checks we ran the final models controlling for whether or not the border divides one or more ethnic group settlements. The ethnicity variables used were based on the Geo-Referencing of Ethnic Groups (GREG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0738894211433164">Weidmann et al., 2010b</xref>). We included a dummy variable that was given the value 1 if at least one ethnic group lived on both sides of the border. According to the GREG dataset, more than half of the border dyads have two or more transnational ethnic group settlements. The boundary between Pakistan and India from 1947 to 1971 had 12 different ethnic group settlements crossing the country boundary. We therefore also included a count variable that summed the number of transnational ethnic groups. This was tested separately for different regions and for different periods. We divided the world into five regions following the division used in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0738894211433164">Gleditsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0738894211433164">Themnér and Wallensteen, 2011</xref>): Europe, the Middle East,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0738894211433164">10</xref></sup> Asia, Africa,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0738894211433164">11</xref></sup> and the Americas. We ran separate models for each of these regions. We also ran separate models for the time periods before and after the end of the Cold War.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Geodesic distance is the most accurate measure for geographical distance. However, we are not fully certain about the accuracy of the CShapes dataset, which seems to be somewhat coarser than the Digital Chart of the World (DCW). For instance, in the Digital Chart of the World as well as in the Furlong and Gleditsch data, there is a small border, approximately 2.5 km, between Botswana and Zambia. In the CShapes dataset, however, there is no border length between Botswana and Zambia, just a border point (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0738894211433164">Figure 3</xref>). By implication, there is a spurious border point between Zimbabwe and Namibia in the CShapes dataset.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0738894211433164">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>We have compared the geodesic distances measured using the CShapes dataset with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0738894211433164">Furlong and Gleditsch (2003)</xref>. Although the CShapes dataset obviously is a more generalized dataset than DCW, a scatter plot (not reproduced here) shows that the overall picture looks very similar. The correlations between the three measures are also very high (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0738894211433164">Table 2</xref>). Thus, our new measure of border length is likely to provide a reliable tool to investigate the differing results of Starr and Thomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0738894211433164">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0738894211433164">Gleditsch et al.

<p>The following analyses examine the effects of the geographical independent variables on the risk of a conflict erupting between two states in a dyad. We investigate several levels of conflict intensity as well as conflicts located in border regions. We develop the models including only the measure for border length, and successively add the other new independent variables. Finally, we develop fuller conflict models with control variables included as well. We then move on to discuss different specifications of the models, notably separation by region and different time periods. The results of the first models with the effect of border characteristics on MID onset are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0738894211433164">Table 4</xref>. Hypothesis 1a, that the longer the border between two states the higher the risk of conflict, is not fully supported. When controlling for population concentration in the border area, as we do in Model 6, the effect of length of a shared border fades into insignificance. Thus far, our results are in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0738894211433164">Furlong et al. (2006)</xref>. At first glance, it seems as though geographical factors do not affect conflict risk when controlling for demographics in the border regions, as neither H2a nor H3a are supported in Model 6. When we restrict the sample of MIDs to include only fatal MIDs or wars (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0738894211433164">Tables A1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0738894211433164">A2</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0738894211433164">Appendix</xref>), the results change somewhat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0738894211433164">13</xref></sup> Controlling for population concentration in the border area, the length of the border actually reduces the risk of a conflict erupting.</p>

<p>Although geographical features of borders or border regions appear not to affect the risk of experiencing a conflict in general, the results may change when we focus on conflicts located specifically in the border regions. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0738894211433164">Table 5</xref> we reran the models with the MIDloc variable in a first attempt to address this question. Indeed, when controlling for population concentration, conflicts in border regions are affected by the percentage of the border that is made up by a river, but they are more peaceful! This is contrary to H3b, that river borders would increase conflict risk. Based on Model 12, H4b on population concentration is the only hypothesis concerning conflict location that receives tentative support.</p>

<p>Our main hypotheses, H1a and H1b, relate to the effect of border length. H1b is supported: the longer a shared boundary between two states the higher the risk that they experience a MID in the border region. Specifically, the probability of a conflict occurring in the region increases more than 30% if a border is among the 10% longest compared to a border with mean length.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0738894211433164">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>H1a receives partial support. Although the probability of experiencing a MID overall is more than 30% higher for the longest 10% of the borders compared to a border with mean length, the risk of experiencing high intensity conflicts (fatal MIDs) is not affected, and the risk of war is actually reduced. Although we can assume that border length increases the interaction opportunity between states and thus the interaction volume, the conflicts that erupt are not likely to escalate to serious conflicts or wars. The negative effect of border length on the outbreak of war may relate to the population density in the area. We ran interaction terms with border length and population concentration to examine this possibility (not shown here). The interaction term was positive and significant in Models 13 and 14, indicating that indeed the population concentration combined with the length of the border matters for conflict risk. Entering the interaction term rendered both the border length variable and the population concentration variable negative though, and it is difficult to draw firm conclusions based on including this interaction term, as the correlations with the single terms are very high (r &gt; .9). However, even interpreted with caution, it makes sense to assume from this that population concentration in a border region is closely connected with the effect of border length.</p>
<p>Our second pair of hypotheses argues that rough terrain will affect the risk of conflict, both in general (H2a) and in the border regions as such (H2b). Hypothesis 2a is not supported. Rough terrain does not affect the risk of two states engaging in conflict in general. Conflicts occurring in the border regions, on the other hand, are to some degree affected by geographical characteristics. Swamp land slightly reduces the risk of conflict outbreak. The probability of a MID outbreak in border regions with large percentage of swamp land (in the 90th percentile of our sample) is reduced by approximately 1.5% compared to border regions with swamp land at mean level. This is in line with our expectations, as swamps arguably hinder interaction opportunities. Fewer people are likely to have contact across such terrains. The rugged terrain variable has a positive impact on conflict risk along a border, and actually increases the probability of conflict with more than 20% for terrain that is among the 10% most rugged compared to mean levels. It thus appears that the hillier the border, the higher the risk of clashes along it. This result is contrary to expectations, but more in line with the importance attributed to rough terrain in parts of the civil war literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0738894211433164">16</xref></sup> It also speaks to the point about “natural frontiers” raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0738894211433164">Gibler (2007)</xref>. We would expect less interaction across a hilly border which mostly follows mountain ridges than across an equally hilly border that crosses valleys as well as mountain ridges. A study differentiating between these two kinds of mountainous terrain might yield interesting results.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 3a and 3b argue that river borders are more conflict-prone than other borders. This is not supported. Whether or not a border is made up by a river for a long part of its course does not affect the risk of conflict between two neighbors in general. When it comes to conflicts in the border area, river borders are actually more peaceful than other borders. A move from the mean value to the 90th percentile on this variable reduces the risk of a conflict breaking out in the area by over 20%. Again, including interaction terms with shared river and population concentration offered some interesting results (not shown here). The interaction terms in all three models were negative and significant, indicating that population concentration along a river border reduces the risk of conflict, with the caveat that the correlations between the interaction terms and the original variables were very high (&gt; 0.95). The single terms for river borders in Models 13 and 14, however, became positive and significant when the interaction terms were included. This is probably due to the high correlation with the interaction term. Nevertheless, we conclude with some caution that conflicts over river borders are less likely if the river runs through populous areas. At first glance this may seem to lend support to the argument that natural frontiers add legitimacy to border demarcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0738894211433164">Gibler, 2007</xref>). However and as previously noted, a river may be important for other reasons than its mere geographical presence. People may be concerned about the water resources provided by the river, especially if water is scarce. To control for this possibility, we ran models including a variable measuring average rainfall in the dyad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0738894211433164">17</xref></sup> Including this variable rendered the river variable insignificant in Model 15. The rainfall variable itself was not significant either. Improved data on water scarcity could perhaps provide more insights into the effect of rivers and their water resources, but overall it seems plausible to conclude that rivers do not increase conflict risk.</p>
<p>Finally, Hypotheses 4a and 4b concern demographic factors. We expected more people in the border region to increase interaction opportunities and thus also the risk of conflict. This is partly supported by our analyses. Although the population density in a border region does not affect the risk of MIDs in general, the risks of both conflicts in the border region and more severe conflicts in general are higher if the population concentration along the border is high. Indeed, the probability of a fatal MID is more than 130% higher if the border region is very populous (in the 90th percentile) compared to regions with population levels at the mean. The population in the border region is in fact the only factor pertaining to the borders or the border regions that we have tested that has an impact on the risk of fatal conflicts. We control for the total population of the country so population in the border region is not just a proxy for state size. Conflicts in the border regions themselves are also more likely if there are many people living there. These conflicts have more than 45% increased probability of occurring if the border is among the most populous compared to the mean.</p>
<p>In addition to population as such, we ran analyses to control for the effect of transnational ethnic group settlements. Whether or not a border divides ethnic groups does not seem to have an impact on conflict though, as neither of our ethnicity variables are significant in any of the models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0738894211433164">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the other control variables perform as expected. The greater the population in the smaller of the two states in a dyad, the higher the risk of a conflict. However, the overall population of a country does not affect the risk of conflict in the border regions. The wealth of the countries also matters. The more unequal they are, the higher the risk of conflict. Again, this is only significant for conflicts in general, not for border conflicts. As expected, two democracies have a lower risk of conflict, and the further apart the capitals of the two states are, the lower is the conflict risk. Years of peaceful relations decrease the risk of new conflicts emerging, and the more two states trade, the lower is the risk that they have a conflict in general. Border conflicts are not affected by the trade flow between two states.</p>

<title>Regional Differences and the Effect of Time Periods</title>
<p>Borders are not uniform and they are demarcated under very different circumstances. We thus performed some further tests that separated the data by region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0738894211433164">19</xref></sup> For the Middle East, long borders are associated with less conflict risk. Both the risk of MIDs in general and fatal MIDs decreased when border length increased. MIDs in the border regions were not affected, however. Rugged terrain, on the other hand, increased the risk of both MIDs close to the border and in general in the Middle East. If the border is covered by forests it also increases the risk of conflict in the Middle East, although not in the border region itself. Interestingly, in the Middle East, river borders increased the risk of fatal MIDs, even after controlling for rainfall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0738894211433164">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Europe, border length and rugged terrain are associated with an increased risk of conflict in general. High-intensity conflicts are not affected by any of the geographical factors, whereas conflicts in border regions are more likely to happen in Europe where there is rugged terrain and less likely if the border runs through swamp land. Both the presence of swamp land and the presence of forests along borders decrease the risk of MIDs in general in Europe, as does population concentration.</p>
<p>In Asia, border length increases the risk of low-level conflicts, but high-intensity conflicts are less likely where there are long borders. Conflicts in the border regions as such are not affected by border length. Population concentration in the border regions increases the risk of all levels of conflict in Asia. Border conflicts in Asia are more likely to happen if the border runs through swamp land.</p>
<p>Conflict risk in Africa is in general not affected by geographical factors in the border regions, but the risk of war is reduced if the border region is covered by forest, and rugged terrain increases the risk of war onsets. This holds true also when we investigate only sub-Saharan Africa. However, when excluding North Africa, other deviations appear: border length increases the risk of low-intensity conflicts in general (but does not increase the risk of conflicts along the borders), and population concentration increases the risks of war onsets.</p>
<p>To sum up, there are clearly regional differences with respect to border geography and conflict risk. But overall, low-level conflicts are more likely when the states share long borders. Other geographical factors do not affect conflict risk to a large degree overall. The Middle East confirms its position as the region most prone to water conflicts as it seems that river borders in this region increase conflict risk.</p>
<p>In addition to the regional analyses, we also added to the original models (from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0738894211433164">Table 6</xref>) a variable that indicated whether or not the border separates two regions. Dyads separated by a region border seem to have a higher risk of low-level conflict.</p>
<p>Finally, to control for the differences in geopolitics during and after the Cold War, we tested separately for those two time periods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0738894211433164">21</xref></sup> In addition to some smaller changes in significance levels, one interesting pattern emerges: the role of proximity and border length on the risk of high-intensity conflicts seem to change after the end of the Cold War. Whereas long distance between the capitals of two countries traditionally has been associated with a reduced risk of conflict, after the end of the Cold War inter-capital distance does not seem to matter for high-intensity conflicts (it still reduces the risk of low-level conflicts and conflicts in the border regions). Border length on the other hand, reduces the risk of high-intensity conflicts (it does not significantly affect low-level conflicts or conflicts in border regions). But, the period following the Cold War is significantly shorter (11 years out of 66), so we do interpret these results with some caution.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article applies GIS-generated variables to a time-series cross-section investigation of international conflict onset. We have examined the effect of border characteristics on the risk of conflict between states. Within the framework of opportunity and willingness, several authors have previously argued that features of borders will affect conflict risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0738894211433164">Furlong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0738894211433164">Starr and Thomas, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">2005</xref>). However, the results so far have been inconclusive. Here we provide some new insights.</p>
<p>First of all, the geography of borders is not a uniform phenomenon. There are significant regional differences and differences across time periods. Overall, however, the length of a shared border increases the risk that two states experience a low-level mutual conflict or a conflict in the border region itself, although this relationship no longer is significant after the end of the Cold War. High-intensity conflicts are not affected to the same extent and it even seems to be a tendency that the risk of such conflicts is reduced if states share a long border in more recent years. Based on our examination of interaction terms with border length and population density, we cautiously suggest that it is not the length of the border as such, but rather the combination of a long border and high population density that actually increases the risk of fatal conflicts. This is not surprising. A long border may offer interaction opportunities, but can also limit cross-border contact if the area is sparsely populated. Since the small clashes that occur do not escalate to high-intensity conflicts, we are inclined to attribute the conflict-inducing effect of shared borders, and especially border length, to greater opportunity. Although long borders increase the risk of clashes across borders, these have remained local and low-scale, and political leaders have been unwilling to let them escalate to fatal conflicts or wars. The fact that long borders actually seem to reduce conflict risk after the Cold War in combination with the fact that inter-capital distance no longer seems to matter suggests a changing pattern of geopolitics. Technology and communication make the actual distance between heads of states less important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0738894211433164">Vasquez’s (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr’s (2002)</xref> suggestions that neighbors fight more because of an increased willingness to fight over valuable border terrain is thus not supported here.</p>
<p>Second, the decisive factor for why border regions have a higher risk of conflict is demographic. More densely populated border regions increase the risk of fatal conflict and local conflict, whatever the level of severity and irrespective of time period. Since we controlled for the overall population in the two countries, this is not a general size effect. People do, however, tend to settle down where land is fertile, so a high population concentration may be an indication of valuable territory.</p>
<p>Third, in general, our results provide little support for the notion that geographical features of border regions increase conflict risk between neighbors. Only one of these hypotheses was supported, that border regions with swamp land are less likely to experience local conflicts. Contrary to our expectations though, rugged terrain seems to increase the risk of conflicts. This may be due to disagreements when demarcating the borders, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0738894211433164">Gibler (2007)</xref>. This finding suggests that the ruggedness of the borders is more decisive for conflict risk than the length itself.</p>
<p>Fourth, some studies have found that river-sharing states have more conflict and argue that this is due to an increased willingness to fight over a highly salient resource or that river borders are particularly conflict-prone because of their inherent fuzziness and fluctuations in the water flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0738894211433164">Furlong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0738894211433164">Gleditsch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0738894211433164">Toset et al., 2000</xref>), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0738894211433164">Brochmann and Gleditsch (2012)</xref> query whether this might be a proximity effect. Here, we show that conflict between two states is not affected in general by whether or not the border is made up by a river. In fact, at first glance, borders that are delineated by rivers actually seem to reduce the risk of conflict close to the border. In the Middle East, however, river borders do in fact increase conflict risk, even when controlling for water availability. This is not surprising but indicates that water problems in the Middle East go beyond the question of supply and demand. In the Middle East, water is also a territorial issue.</p>
<p>To sum up, we aimed in this study to mediate between earlier diverging findings on the effect of border length on the risk of conflict outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0738894211433164">Gleditsch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0738894211433164">Starr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0738894211433164">Starr and Thomas, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0738894211433164">2005</xref>). Based on our results it seems that a plausible reason for the inconclusive results with respect to border length can be a failure to look into the severity and location of the conflicts as well as time periods. Borders are not uniform. This is also the main conclusion based on our second aim: to examine and understand the effects of certain geographical features of border regions on conflict risk. Although geographical features affect the risk of conflict in the conflict regions to some extent, overall, demography is much more decisive for conflict outbreak.</p>

<p>The short border between Botswana and Zambia is not recorded by the CIA’s <italic>World Factbook</italic> either, but there seems to be no doubt that it exists (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazungula_Ferry">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazungula_Ferry</ext-link>).</p>

<p>We also ran all the analyses for non-fatal MIDs only. The results were similar to those for all MIDs.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn15-0738894211433164">

<p>We also ran models controlling for whether or not the two states were allied and the number of IGO memberships they shared, but these variables were never significant and were thus removed from the final models.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-0738894211433164">

<p>All marginal effects are calculated using the Clarify software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0738894211433164">Tomz et al., 2003</xref>) for a specific interval on the independent variables’ values while holding the other variables constant. The baseline value is set to the mean if it is a continuous variable and 0 if it is dichotomous. We do not report all marginal effects here but refer to our replication files.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-0738894211433164">
<label>16</label>
<p>We also ran interaction terms with rugged terrain and population concentration, but the results were never significant. However, the same problems pertain to this interaction term as noted with respect to border length.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-0738894211433164">

<p>The variable is taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0738894211433164">Gleditsch et al. (2006)</xref> and measures the average rainfall in the dyad over a 30-year period from 1968 to 1998.</p>

<p>The models with the ethnicity variables included are thus not reported here.</p>

<label>19</label>
<p>In the interest of space, tables for the regional models are not included. The significant results are commented on. We were unable to obtain results for the Americas as the models would never converge.</p>

<p>Again, tables are not reported to save space, but can be obtained from the authors or through the replication file available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prio.no/cscw/datasets">www.prio.no/cscw/datasets</ext-link>.</p>
