<p>Investable real estate markets have developed in many countries over the past 20 or 30 years. As a consequence of this and a desire to understand the operation of new markets, a small number of texts have been published to analyse international real estate markets and international real estate investment decisions. This book by Richard Barkham provides a useful addition to this existing literature. It is also quite different in structure from other recently published texts. The book’s content is a structured compilation of monthly research topics from the Global Outlook written by members of the research team at Grosvenor. The chapters contain discussions on specific topics based upon the these monthly ‘outlooks’ from 2000 until 2011. This means that the flow of argument is different from other published texts. The latter tend to rely more on exposition of theory before application. In this text, given the source of content, the debates are current or topical at the time of original publication and theory is applied in a practical setting. However, using what were current debates of the time to create the text can potentially be a source of difficulty because with hindsight it becomes easy to see if predictions turn out to be correct, or whether the focus of debate is reasonable or simply flavour-of-the month. Fortunately, the book avoids these possible pitfalls.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter frames the context for the discussion in the rest of the book. It identifies key issues by examining macroeconomic variables, the growth of real estate investment, asset price inflation, the global financial crisis and the consequent bursting of the property price bubble. It asserts that real estate research has tended in the recent past to focus on a narrow microeconomic and finance-driven agenda and had not been able to predict the great financial crisis caused by inflated real estate values. While this may be true, very few predicted a financial crisis or identified the causes before it happened. Those that did were ignored, and the babbling crowd said it was all to do with fundamentals. A similar story is provided to support increasing house prices in Norway today. The price signal then combines both fundamental and (possibly inaccurate) expectations.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 develops the discussion on the ‘global’ macroeconomy and real estate markets. This sizeable chapter underlines the importance and strength of the interlinkages between the macroeconomy and the real estate sector. There are many interesting pieces within this chapter. There is good application of historical data to aid analysis and support arguments on each individual topic covered.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 focuses on real estate and one part of the economic cycle, the recession. This is relevant given the continuing impact of the global financial crisis as indicated in the introductory paragraph of the chapter. Usefully, the chapter examines markets that have been significantly exposed to the impact of bad debts. It also discusses debt instruments and increased debt exposure. Consumption and wealth effects are also examined. The reader is left with the question, why didn’t we see it coming?</p>
<p>Chapter 4 examines inflation and real estate and provides a mix of microeconomic and macroeconomic discussions. Oil prices, food prices and real wages provide the exogenous variables for discussions on real estate impacts.</p>
<p>Chapters 5, 10, and 12 examine retail, residential and office markets respectively. Chapter 10 is particularly interesting in light of the sub-prime mortgage crisis leading into the global financial crisis and also because housing accounts for a substantial proportion of all wealth. The chapter provides international and intranational comparisons.</p>
<p>Global office markets are examined in chapter 12. There is a good discussion on cyclical volatility and trend performance. Comparison is made across markets on both short- and long-term movements. Analysis of the other large commercial real estate investment market, retail, is provided in chapter 5. The relationship between retail performance and consumer spending is evident in the chapter. In addition, there is a discussion of the relationship between house prices (and housing equity withdrawal) and retail spending. This is often related to a wealth effect in macroeconomic consumption function studies. This wealth effect has been posited to be stronger since financial deregulation and hence permits an increase in liquidity available to consumers.</p>
<p>Securitised real estate is discussed in chapter 6. The graphical comparison of property and property shares is useful in highlighting the smoothness of appraisal-based unsecuritised series and the graph also suggests that property share price movements lead the change in property returns (discussed in detail in the literature on price discovery). Returns to real estate investment are more generally discussed in chapter 9 and a more substantial and in-depth discussion on yields is provided in chapter 11.</p>
<p>Real estate and the construction sector is the focus of chapter 7. Correlations between GDP growth and construction cost inflation are examined. The size of the sector within the economy is also discussed. The latter is important on the supply side in Ireland and Spain. The reduction in demand after the global financial crisis was then met with high supply and significant price falls in these countries.</p>
<p>The book allocates a whole chapter (8) to focus on Asia. The chapter analyses the contrasting experiences of China and Japan before more briefly looking at real estate in the Asia–Pacific region. Some of the imbalances relating to China’s undervalued currency are argued in the final chapter (13) to be the largest in history and could contribute to adjustment problems as Western economies try to grow from the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this book is different in structure from other texts in the subject area being based upon short reports written by the research team members at Grosvenor since 2000. However, these reports are always insightful. There is substantial use of good quality data to support and explain points that are made. This is helped by the fact that data availability has improved substantially over time. Some of the chapters go further and provide econometric analysis of key relationships. There is significant depth to discussions and the original reports are collected together to provide a coherent breadth to discussions within the relevant chapters.</p>
<p>The book makes very good use of statistics and there are many useful graphs throughout. The applications are robust and the topics presented show how to apply theory to practical contemporary issues in real estate in an economic context that has become increasingly global. The book also highlights the importance of the links between real estate and general economic forces at local, national and international levels. It identifies relationships between variables endogenous to and exogenous of the real estate market. Thus it provides an exemplar of how to analyse real estate markets and is definitely worth reading.</p>
