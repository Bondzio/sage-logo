<p>In January 2010 we published an article entitled “Mexico at the vanguard: A new era in medicines of biotechnological origin” in which the Chairman of the Health Committee of the Mexican Senate addressed the new law that had been just passed defining a pathway for the approval of biological products in that country. Although Mexico is one of the largest pharmaceutical markets in the world and the second in Latin America after Brazil, the government also faces serious challenges to afford the medicines needed by its citizens. This will become even more obvious when Mexico is faced with the increasing prescription and consumption of biotechnology drugs, which are the most expensive in the market.</p>
<p>The implementation of the law, however, was still pending at the time of the last article. After more than one year of debate both within the government and in coordination with different stakeholders the regulations of the law were finally passed. It was rumored that some interest groups had promised to undo in the regulations what the law had achieved, but on October 18<sup>th</sup> Mexican President Felipe Calderon finally signed the regulations implementing the biotechnology law. Much was at stake and conflicting economic interests worked hard to try to prevail. Although there is room for improvement, as in the case of the law, the regulations adopted by the Mexican government set a good precedent.</p>
<p>Governments throughout the world, both executive and legislative branches, have an enormous responsibility in their hands with regards to biologic medicines. We cannot expect to have a similar market to that of generic medicines or similar prices. Therefore, the adoption of a similar system for biologics is out of the question. Governments are increasingly adopting new biotech laws and regulations that will have an impact on the health and productivity of their citizens, their budgets, their domestic industries and the jobs they generate.</p>
<p>As governments get ready to address biologic laws and regulations in their countries they should look carefully at what Mexico has accomplished. It is not by any means perfect, but it strikes a balance that is worth a close review.</p>
