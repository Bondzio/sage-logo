<abstract>
<p>We assessed the association between alcohol consumption and condom use during penetrative sexual assault acts perpetrated by young adult men. Men aged 21 to 35 who reported inconsistent condom use and heavy episodic drinking (<italic>N</italic> = 225) completed a questionnaire assessing their perpetration of sexual assault since the age of 15, their consumption of alcohol prior to these acts, and their use of condoms during acts involving penetration. Descriptive statistics and Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to examine the simultaneous use of alcohol and condom nonuse during penetrative sexual assault acts. More than one third of respondents reported perpetrating at least one penetrative sexual assault 35.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 79). Condoms were not used in 70.0% of penetrative sexual assaults. When they had consumed alcohol, perpetrators were significantly less likely to use condoms. The sexual assaults reported by this sample typically consisted of perpetrator alcohol consumption and the nonuse of condoms. Programs targeting sexual health and assault risk reduction would be enhanced by addressing this interplay of alcohol, violence, and risk.</p>

<p>Despite prevention efforts, sexual assault remains a widespread public health concern in the United States, with approximately 300,000 women being raped each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438277">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2006</xref>). In addition to its negative mental health consequences, sexual assault is associated with adverse effects on women’s sexual and reproductive health. Studies of global-level associations indicate that women with a history of sexual assault victimization report increased somatic complaints, including dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and sexual dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438277">Golding, Wilsnack, &amp; Learman, 1998</xref>) and also have elevated rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438277">Reynolds, Peipert, &amp; Collins, 2000</xref>). Although it is difficult to determine the risk of acquiring an STI specifically from a sexual assault, studies estimate that sexual assault involving penile penetration results in 3% to 20% of victims acquiring an STI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438277">Jenny et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438277">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438277">McFarlane et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, approximately 5% of victims that are of reproductive age become pregnant from their assault; however, this rate rises to up to 20% when sexual assault within intimate relationships is included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512438277">Holmes, Resnick, Kilpatrick, &amp; Best, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438277">McFarlane et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the use of a male latex condom during penetrative sexual assault may decrease the risk of both STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies, studies indicate that penetrative sexually aggressive acts often do not involve condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438277">Davis, Schraufnagel, George, &amp; Norris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438277">Peterson, Janssen, &amp; Heiman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438277">Raj et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, men who self-report perpetration of sexual violence present an elevated STI transmission risk to their victims due to their greater number of sexual partners and less frequent condom use during consensual vaginal and anal sexual intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438277">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438277">Raj et al., 2006</xref>). As these research findings make clear, elevated sexual risk on the part of the perpetrator coupled with unprotected sexual assault further increase the sexual and reproductive health risks to sexual assault victims. Of course, simply encouraging perpetrators to use condoms during the commission of sexual assault is not sufficient for addressing these risks; sexual assault prevention programs must continue their efforts to reduce the overall incidence of sexual assault. It is hoped, however, that research investigating the overlapping risks involved in unprotected sexual assault may provide key information regarding potential risk factors that may ultimately serve as fruitful targets for intervention.</p>
<p>One such risk factor is alcohol consumption, which is often present in incidents of unprotected sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438277">Cooper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438277">George &amp; Stoner, 2000</xref>) as well as the majority of sexual assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438277">Testa, 2002</xref>). Although these associations are well established, there has been little study of the relationship between alcohol consumption and the use or nonuse of condoms during sexual assault. In a previous study, we examined the use of alcohol and condoms during sexual assault with a community sample of young heterosexual male social drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438277">Davis et al., 2008</xref>). Findings indicated that the majority of sexual assault perpetrators reported consuming alcohol and not using condoms (or using them inconsistently) during their assault perpetration. In addition, perpetrator alcohol consumption and condom nonuse were significantly globally correlated for forcible rape: The more frequently men drank prior to or during forcible rape acts, the greater their frequency of not using a condom during these acts. These analyses were conducted at the perpetrator level; act-level relationships regarding alcohol consumption and condom nonuse within the same assaultive act were not addressed in that study.</p>
<p>The goal of the present research was to contribute to the current literature by attempting not only to replicate the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438277">Davis et al. (2008)</xref> findings with a larger community sample of men at elevated sexual risk but also to expand our understanding of alcohol-related unprotected sexual assault by examining these relationships at the act level. We hypothesized that the majority of reported sexual assaultive acts would involve alcohol consumption by the perpetrator and that the majority of penetrative sexual assault acts would not involve condom use. We also hypothesized an act-level relationship between perpetrator alcohol consumption and condom nonuse such that acts involving alcohol would be less likely to include the use of a condom.</p>

<p>The present study reports data gathered from questionnaires which were administered as part of a larger experimental study. Measures that assessed demographics, sexual assault perpetration, and alcohol and condom use during sexual assaults were administered to every participant, without regard to their experimental cell assignment. All procedures and protocols were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Single men (<italic>N</italic> = 225) were recruited through advertisements in a local weekly free newspaper, a campus newspaper, public fliers, and online bulletin boards (e.g., Craigslist). Advertisements stated that the study was recruiting single male “social drinkers” and that it would investigate “decision-making.” Inclusion requirements consisted of (a) being a man between the ages of 21 and 35; (b) being interested in a sexual relationship with a woman; (c) being a social drinker; (d) having had at least one heavy drinking episode (defined as having consumed 5 or more drinks on one occasion) in the past 6 months; and (e) having had sexual intercourse without a condom at least once in the past 12 months. Exclusion criteria consisted of (a) being in a steady, committed relationship with a woman; (b) current or historical problem drinking as defined by a score of 5 or higher on the Brief Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438277">Pokorny, Miller, &amp; Kaplan, 1972</xref>); or (c) having an alcohol contraindication such as a health condition or medication regimen.</p>

<title>Modified Sexual Experiences Survey (MSES)</title>
<p>This 61-item questionnaire is a modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438277">Koss and Oros’s (1982)</xref> original Sexual Experiences Survey (SES). Among men, the MSES is used to assess sexual aggression perpetration since the respondent turned 15 years old. Items assessed participants’ self-reported engagement in the following sexually aggressive acts: <italic>forced sexual contact</italic> (unwanted kissing, fondling, or genital touching), <italic>verbal sexual coercion</italic> (unwanted sexual intercourse obtained through verbal means), <italic>incapacitated rape</italic> (victim was incapacitated by drugs or alcohol), <italic>attempted rape</italic> (unsuccessful attempts to force sexual intercourse), and <italic>forcible rape</italic> (forced unwanted sexual intercourse). Our modifications allowed for the assessment of alcohol consumption during any sexually aggressive act and for condom use during sexually aggressive acts that involved penetration. For each type of assault a participant endorsed engaging in, he was given follow-up questions regarding whether he had consumed alcohol prior to or during these acts and, if alcohol was consumed, the number of drinks that were usually consumed during that type of assault. Furthermore, for each act that was endorsed, we also assessed the number of times the participant did not use a condom (only for acts involving penetration). Of note, some of these sexually assaultive acts (i.e., specific sexually aggressive behaviors) may have occurred during the same assault incident (i.e., a distinct sexual assault event that could include multiple sexually aggressive acts). For example, a respondent who reported perpetrating an act of forced sexual contact and an act of forcible rape may have committed both of these assaultive acts against the same victim during a single assault incident. Please see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438277">Davis et al. (2008)</xref> for a more complete description of the MSES.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants for this study were recruited using the convenience sampling procedures listed above. Interested potential participants called the laboratory, were given additional information about the nature of the study, and were screened for eligibility. On their arrival at our laboratory, the participant was greeted by a male experimenter who escorted him to a private office and guided him through the process of informed consent. The participant was oriented to the computer, asked to notify the experimenter when he had finished, and left to complete all questionnaires privately. On completion of the study, the participant was debriefed and compensated for his time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260512438277">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive analyses were conducted to examine self-reported perpetration rates as well as condom use and alcohol consumption during sexual assault perpetration. The relationship between (a) condom involvement and assault type and (b) alcohol involvement and assault type was assessed using Pearson’s chi-square tests. The relationship between assault type and average number of drinks consumed during that assault type was tested through paired sample <italic>t</italic>-tests. Descriptive statistics and Pearson’s chi-square tests were conducted to examine the simultaneous use of alcohol and condom nonuse during penetrative sexual assault acts. Finally, repeated measures <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted to examine the use of alcohol and condoms among repeat perpetrators, using perpetrators, rather than sexual assault acts, as the unit of analysis. Repeat perpetrators were defined as respondents who had perpetrated the same type of assaultive act more than once, thus assuring that they had perpetrated sexual aggression during at least two separate assault incidents.</p>

<title>Sexual Assault Perpetration</title>
<p>More than half of the respondents reported some form of sexual assault perpetration (52.7%; <italic>n</italic> = 117). Forced sexual contact was reported by 33.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 75), sexual coercion by 18.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 40), attempted rape by 10.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 23), incapacitated rape by 20.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 44), and forcible rape by 10.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 24) of respondents. Respondents were permitted to endorse more than one form of sexual assault. When categorized for the most severe type of assault perpetrated (i.e., rape, attempted rape, sexual coercion, forced sexual contact, in descending order of severity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438277">Koss, Gidycz, &amp; Wisniewski, 1987</xref>), 26.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 59) of respondents reported perpetration of rape (either incapacitated or forcible); 2.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) reported attempted rape but not forcible rape; 8.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 18) of respondents reported perpetration of sexual coercion but not rape or attempted rape; 15.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 35) of participants reported perpetration of forced sexual contact but not rape, attempted rape, or coercion.</p>
<p>Repeat perpetration of any sexual aggression was reported by 69.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 81) of perpetrators. We summed the number of sexual assault acts reported across the entire sample. Perpetrators (<italic>n</italic> = 117) reported committing a total of 686 sexually aggressive acts, ranging from 1 act (<italic>n</italic> = 25) to 35 acts (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</p>

<title>Act-level analysis</title>
<p>Out of 307 sexual aggression acts involving penetration, 51.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 158) simultaneously involved alcohol and condom nonuse. Among sexual coercion acts, 50.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 55) involved alcohol and condom nonuse. Among incapacitated rapes, 56.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 72) involved alcohol and condom nonuse. Among forcible rapes, 43.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 31) involved alcohol and condom nonuse.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0886260512438277">Table 5</xref> shows chi-square tests of association between alcohol and condom nonuse, overall and separated by assault type. Across all acts and for sexually coercive acts, condom nonuse was significantly associated with alcohol consumption. However, there was no association between alcohol and condom nonuse for incapacitated rape, perhaps owing to the fact that 88% of these acts involved the perpetrator consuming alcohol. There was also no association for forcible rape, again, possibly owing to the high rates of condom nonuse in this type of act (76%).</p>

<p>When examining the percentages, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0886260512438277">Table 5</xref> appears to show a relatively uneven split between condom use and nonuse among respondents who drank alcohol but a relatively even split among those who were sober. Within each alcohol group for each assault type, we conducted post hoc chi-square tests to ascertain whether the split between condom use and nonuse was significantly different from 0.5 (i.e., one half of the acts involve condom use and one half do not). As expected, when alcohol was involved, respondents were less likely to use a condom across all types of assaults (all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .005). In contrast, only forcible rape had a detectably higher condom nonuse rate than expected when alcohol was not involved, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 5.12, <italic>p</italic> = .02.</p>

<title>Perpetrator-level analysis</title>
<p>The previous analyses treat all acts as independent from one another, an assumption which is violated for repeat perpetrators. To address this problem, we conducted similar co-occurrence analyses using repeat perpetrators as the unit of analysis. For each repeat perpetrator (<italic>n</italic> = 79), we computed four proportions: (a) the number of times he consumed alcohol and did not use a condom/total penetrative assaults; (b) the number of times he consumed alcohol and did use a condom/total penetrative assaults; (c) the number of times he did not consume alcohol and did not use a condom/total penetrative assaults; and (d) the number of times he did not consume alcohol and did use a condom/total penetrative assaults. We then computed repeated measures <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing the average proportion of assaults involving alcohol consumption but no condom use to each of the other three proportions.</p>
<p>Repeat perpetrators reported that a higher proportion of their penetrative assaults involved alcohol and condom nonuse (<italic>M</italic> = .404, <italic>SD</italic> = .444) as compared with their sober, condom nonuse assaults (<italic>M</italic> = .205, <italic>SD</italic> = .364, <italic>t</italic>[78] = 2.685, <italic>p</italic> = .009) and as compared with their sober, condom-using assaults (<italic>M</italic> = .141, <italic>SD</italic> = .327, <italic>t</italic>[78] = 3.673, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, repeat perpetrators were only marginally more likely to consume alcohol and not use a condom than to consume alcohol and use a condom (<italic>M</italic> = .250, <italic>SD</italic> = .390, <italic>t</italic>[78] = 1.956, <italic>p</italic> = .054).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our hypotheses regarding alcohol consumption, condom nonuse, and the co-occurrence of the two during acts of sexual assault perpetration were supported. As hypothesized, we found that more than half (61.2%) of all reported sexual assaults involved alcohol consumption by the perpetrator. Moreover, results indicated that the majority (70.0%) of penetrative sexual assaults did not involve condom use. Finally, both act-level and perpetrator-level analyses supported the hypothesis that penetrative sexual assaults were significantly less likely to involve condom use when the perpetrator had consumed alcohol.</p>
<p>The association between alcohol and condom nonuse during sexual assault was largely consistent in this study. However, the mechanisms that underlie this association require further research. Prior research has suggested two primary pathways that may undergird the association between alcohol and condom nonuse during sexual assaults. The first of these pathways involves the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption on cognitive decision-making processes (referred to as alcohol myopia theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438277">Steele &amp; Josephs, 1990</xref>). According to alcohol myopia theory, the pharmacological effects of alcohol result in cognitive deficits that impair one’s ability to make safer sexual decisions. As these alcohol-induced cognitive impairments have been related to both sexual assault perpetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438277">Testa, 2002</xref>) and to unprotected sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438277">Davis, Hendershot, George, Norris, &amp; Heiman, 2007</xref>), interventions that reduce men’s alcohol consumption may ultimately also decrease their perpetration of unprotected sexual assaults.</p>
<p>The second of these alcohol-related pathways involves the beliefs that individuals maintain about alcohol’s effects (referred to as alcohol expectancy theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438277">MacAndrew &amp; Edgerton, 1969</xref>). According to alcohol expectancy theory, individuals’ expectations about the effect of alcohol on their behavior then guides said behavior during states of intoxication. Thus, individuals who expect alcohol to increase their aggressivity or sexual riskiness are more likely to engage in these types of behaviors when intoxicated—a supposition borne out by prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512438277">Abbey, McAuslan, Ross, &amp; Zawacki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438277">Dermen &amp; Cooper, 1994</xref>). Men with stronger alcohol expectancies regarding both sexual risk and aggression may therefore be at the greatest risk of perpetrating alcohol-involved sexual assault without a condom and thus may be a particularly important group toward whom to target intervention efforts.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that for forcible rape, condom nonuse was more likely than expected even in situations that did <italic>not</italic> involve alcohol. Thus, research investigating potential risk factors other than alcohol consumption in the perpetration of unprotected sexual assaults is also clearly warranted. For example, one study found that slightly more than one third of young men in a nationwide sample reported having used coercive or forceful tactics to avoid using a condom during sexual intercourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438277">Davis &amp; Logan-Greene, in press</xref>). There was a direct association between men’s misogynistic attitudes and use of coercion to obtain unprotected sex, indicating that men’s attitudes about women and gender roles may be a key component in understanding not only sexual assault in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438277">Malamuth, Sockloskie, Koss, &amp; Tanaka, 1991</xref>) but also sexual assault that does not involve condom use in particular. Moreover, attitudes about condom use, as well as personality factors such as sexual sensation seeking, have both been related to general condom nonuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438277">Kalichman &amp; Cain, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438277">Sheeran, Abraham, &amp; Orbell, 1999</xref>) and coerced condom nonuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438277">Davis &amp; Logan-Greene, in press</xref>). Thus, both attitudinal and personality factors may be useful for identifying men most in need of intervention efforts.</p>
<p>As the present research only examined sexual assault situations, we do not know to what extent the current findings regarding the relationship between alcohol consumption and condom nonuse would generalize to our participants’ consensual sexual behaviors. Future research exploring the ways in which these associations may differ between consensual and nonconsensual relationships is needed. Moreover, it is quite likely that the conjunction of alcohol, sexual risk, and sexual aggression varies based on situational factors as well as individual men’s particular combination of risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438277">Logan-Greene &amp; Davis, 2011</xref>). In particular, future research would do well to examine the utility of dispositional latent constructs that may underlie alcohol-involved unprotected sexual assaults given that several dispositional factors (e.g., impulsivity, sensation seeking) have been related to all of the behaviors under consideration in this study, namely, condom nonuse, sexual aggression, and heavy alcohol consumption (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438277">Davis &amp; Logan-Greene, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438277">Hendershot, Stoner, George, &amp; Norris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438277">Zawacki, Abbey, Buck, McAuslan, &amp; Clinton-Sherrod, 2003</xref>). Such research could inform our knowledge about risk profiles specific to the perpetration of alcohol-involved unprotected sexual assault, thereby fostering the development of sexual assault prevention efforts that are appropriately targeted and effectively tailored for particular groups of men.</p>
<sec id="section17-0886260512438277">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>It is important to note that the high rates of sexual assault perpetration reported in this study are not necessarily reflective of those in the more general male population given that our alcohol and sexual risk-related eligibility criteria selected for men at risk of committing alcohol-involved sexual assault. In addition, the data provided here are not only subject to recall biases due to their retrospective nature regarding assaults that may have occurred several years prior but also survey-based and can thus only provide evidence for variable associations rather than causal linkages. Finally, data from the current study do not capture the victim’s alcohol intoxication level and therefore cannot speak to its relevance to condom use during penetrative sexual assault.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0886260512438277">
<title>Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite advances in sexual assault prevention efforts, young male social drinkers’ reported rates of sexual assault perpetration remain high, necessitating continued diligence in our research and prevention efforts. Although the present study cannot ascertain the rates at which the reported assaults may have resulted in unwanted pregnancies or STI transmissions, the possible sexual health risks for the victims involved were likely exacerbated by the low rates of condom use during these assaults. These findings further substantiate current clinical recommendations to provide emergency contraception and STI prophylaxis as a standard of care for rape victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438277">Luce, Schrager, &amp; Gilchrist, 2010</xref>). Moreover, they underscore the need for continued research on the associations among alcohol, sexual risk-taking, and sexual aggression. Greater knowledge regarding the ways in which these associations may vary for men with certain risk profiles or across different situational contexts would facilitate a more nuanced, targeted, and—hopefully—effective approach to sexual assault prevention.</p>
