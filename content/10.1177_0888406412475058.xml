<p>Welcome to the first issue of Volume 36 and to the first of 2013! We wish all of you a Happy New Year! There are a few changes here at TESE and we are excited to share them with you.</p>
<p>First, I am honored to be given the opportunity to be editor of <italic>Teacher Education and Special Education</italic> (TESE). I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to Michael Rosenberg, with whom I worked closely for the past 3 years as coeditor. Michael helped move TESE into the digital era and assisted in making it the high-quality journal it is today. I will do my best to continue in this tradition, and maintain high-quality standards for TESE. We wish Michael well in his new position in New York!</p>
<p>Second, we added Sara Hooks as my editorial assistant. Sara, a 2nd-year doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University, is assisting me in the process of moving manuscripts through to production quickly.</p>
<p>Third, we added a few new members to our Review Board. Please welcome Deborah Griswold, Brittany Hott, Bianca Montrosse, Stephen Pape, Nicole Pyle, Margaret Shippen, and Raschelle Theorharis.</p>
<p>Last, we will be adding associate editors to our Editorial Review Board—Please look for their names and areas of support in our next issue.</p>
<p>This issue focuses on the belief that the teacher is one of the most important factors in the success of all students—those with and without disabilities. We believe this is a timely issue given the present debates on how best to prepare and evaluate high-quality and highly qualified teachers. The articles’ themes encompass designing preservice training, supporting 1st-year teachers, designing professional development for teachers working with students with autism, designing transition-specific professional development for secondary teachers, and evaluating university training provided for teacher educators. The conclusions of all authors lend credence to the importance of systematic teacher training from preservice to in-service. More details on each article are in the following paragraphs—Enjoy!</p>
<p>The first article authored by Susan Courey, Phyllis Tappe, Jody Siker, and Pam LePage, examined the effectiveness of a 3-hr Universal Design for Learning (UDL) training session to help preservice special education teacher candidates incorporate the principles of UDL into their lesson planning. Their results suggest that UDL training improved the teachers’ use of differentiated options and varied teacher strategies. The authors believe the teachers will need more experience when implementing the UDL principles in their own classrooms. Those of you who teach an instructional planning class will benefit from reading this article.</p>
<p>The second article authored by Patti Whetstone, Michael Abell, Belva Collins, and Harold Kleinert described the process undertaken by a consortium of faculty from across institutions of higher education to address the challenges of supporting 1st-year teacher interns when assigned mentors who do not have expertise in the same disability area. The authors share the process they used to develop materials and documents used to support the mentors of interns working with students with low-incidence disabilities. All of us who have assigned mentors and supervisors to our interns will benefit from reading this article.</p>
<p>The third article authored by Laura Maddox and Christine Marvin provided data from an evaluation study of a professional development effort conducted by a state-sponsored autism spectrum disorders network. This 18-month professional development project was designed to provide educators who work with students with autism students with recommended, comprehensive, and evidence-based training; and the results were encouraging. The authors provided insights into the challenges and efforts of an ongoing, mentored program of professional development for teachers who work daily with the growing number of students with autism.</p>
<p>The fourth article authored by Mary Morningstar and Debra Benitez examined the critical features of secondary special educators’ experiences with transition professional development to predict which variables were more likely to influence the frequency with which special educators perform activities related to transition planning and services. Their results suggest that completion of transition courses and involvement in professional development matter when expecting special educators to implement transition interventions and services.</p>
<p>The final article authored by Greg Conderman, Sarah Johnston-Rodriguez, Paula Hartman, and David Walker investigated recent graduates’ perceptions of their preparation program. The authors collected data from 1st-year special educators concerning their level of preparation and confidence, the most beneficial components of their preparation program, and suggestions for improvement. The authors emphasize the importance of surveying graduates to determine programmatic and curricular changes that institutions of higher education should consider.</p>
<p>Our vision for TESE is to continue the long-standing tradition of publishing high-quality research and commentary on teacher education and special education. We hope to increase the number of manuscripts reviewed; so please send in your manuscripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscript-central.com/tese">http://mc.manuscript-central.com/tese</ext-link>). We also look forward to increasing our readership nationally and internationally; so we hope you will encourage your friends to read TESE by going to the website and signing up for SAGE Journal email alerts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tes.sagepub.com/cgi/alerts">http://tes.sagepub.com/cgi/alerts</ext-link>). In addition, we will be offering podcasts discussing special issues—Please look for them on the SAGE website. We recognize that the success of TESE is a collaborative, team effort. The TESE journal is only as good as the manuscripts received and the quality of the reviews posted by members of the editorial board. We want to thank in advance those of you who will submit your best work in the area of teacher preparation to TESE, as well as those on the Board of Reviewers who will spend quality time providing thoughtful and constructive suggestions to their colleagues. We look forward to receiving your manuscripts, reviews, feedback, and ideas to improve the journal. Together we can continue TESE’s tradition of quality scholarship!</p>
<p>We are continuing to mentor doctoral students in reviewing for TESE and want to especially thank the faculty mentors who have worked with the doctoral students listed below during the past year.</p>
