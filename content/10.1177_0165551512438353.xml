<abstract>
<p>This paper explores the possibility of using data from social bookmarking services to measure the use of information by academic researchers. Social bookmarking data can be used to augment participative methods (e.g. interviews and surveys) and other, non-participative methods (e.g. citation analysis and transaction logs) to measure the use of scholarly information. We use BibSonomy, a free resource-sharing system, as a case study. Results show that published journal articles are by far the most popular type of source bookmarked, followed by conference proceedings and books. Commercial journal publisher platforms are the most popular type of information resource bookmarked, followed by websites, records in databases and digital repositories. Usage of open access information resources is low in comparison with toll access journals. In the case of open access repositories, there is a marked preference for the use of subject-based repositories over institutional repositories. The results are consistent with those observed in related studies based on surveys and citation analysis, confirming the possible use of bookmarking data in studies of information behaviour in academic settings. The main advantages of using social bookmarking data are that is an unobtrusive approach, it captures the reading habits of researchers who are not necessarily authors, and data are readily available. The main limitation is that a significant amount of human resources is required in cleaning and standardizing the data.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Studies of researchers’ use of scientific and scholarly information are of interest to all stakeholders in the scholarly communication system, including authors, publishers, librarians, research managers and policymakers. Researchers’ information practices have been studied using a variety of approaches, from those that use more naturalistic and interpretive methods, such as diaries, observation and interviews, through more broadly based participative methods, such as questionnaire surveys, to large-scale non-participative methods, such as bibliometrics and deep-log analysis, which are based on data generated as a by-product of information-seeking, dissemination or publication activities.</p>
<p>In the naturalistic tradition, studies have resulted in holistic understandings of the information practices of researchers where all aspects of information seeking and use are considered in the context of specific research cultures. For example, in the context of interdisciplinary humanities researchers, Palmer and Neumann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551512438353">1</xref>] revealed the translation and boundary-crossing techniques that researchers developed in order to locate and make sense of information from diverse disciplinary information landscapes. More recently, Benardou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551512438353">2</xref>] have demonstrated the different ways in which researchers in the arts and humanities treat information sources as primary data, highlighting fine-grained details such as the reading and annotating of texts, and the different ways in which these annotated texts are shared with other researchers. The series of reader surveys conducted by Tenopir and King [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551512438353">3</xref>] in the USA since the 1970s depict patterns of use for sources of information both formal (journal articles, books, etc.) and informal (meetings, seminars, etc.).</p>
<p>Citation analysis, traditionally based on bibliometric data obtained from published journal articles, is an unobtrusive way of capturing authors’ reading habits, but the results of such studies need to be interpreted with caution, owing to the variety of motivations that can underpin the inclusion of a citation in a published work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551512438353">4</xref>], and authors do not necessarily cite every useful information source that they have read. Furthermore, studies based on citation analysis of published outputs exclude those researchers for whom the publication of their research outcomes is not a matter of course, e.g. readers from industry or the public sector. Studies based on usage data – transactions recorded in the servers that host electronic information resources – depict patterns of behaviour on a large scale in terms of number of visits, time spent, browsing sequences, dates and hours of the visits, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551512438353">5</xref>] These large-scale studies of actual, as opposed to self-reported, behaviour have the potential to augment other approaches to understanding information behaviour, such as those described above. Usage data are not widely available, however, as transaction records are held in the servers of publishers, and are commercially sensitive. Additionally, local download statistics compiled by individual libraries are difficult to interpret, since COUNTER<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0165551512438353">1</xref></sup> reports offer no evidence of where the usage originates.</p>
<p>Bibliometric-based methods have an application beyond research into information behaviours. They have been applied in a variety of evaluation contexts to measure, among other things, the research output and impact of individuals and higher education institutions. In turn, results might be used to inform tenure, promotion and resource allocation decisions. Although citation analysis has been the approach typically applied to the evaluation of research, in the context of the internet and digital information resources bibliometric-based methods have been extended to include a wider range of behaviours relating to information-seeking, dissemination and publication activities. For example, techniques have been developed to evaluate the use and readership of specific journal titles based on download data. Consequently, new usage indicators that are calculated in a way that is similar to citation indicators have been developed, such as the journal usage factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551512438353">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Global download usage data for journal titles are not publicly released by publishers, which is the main limitation in calculating journal usage factors. In order to overcome the lack of global download statistics, Haustein and Siebenlist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165551512438353">7</xref>] have recently proposed that global journal usage should be estimated by analysing data from social bookmarking services. Social bookmarking services enable users to store, search and share online information resources. Over the last few years, social bookmarking services that are targeted at the academic research community have emerged, which allow researchers to manage bibliographic metadata of scholarly and scientific literature. In 2010 four social bookmarking services were being used within academic research communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512438353">8</xref>]. With the discontinuation of Elsevier’s 2collab in April 2011, three services remain: BibSonomy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bibsonomy.org">www.bibsonomy.org</ext-link>), CiteULike (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.citeulike.org">www.citeulike.org</ext-link>) and Connotea (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.connotea.org">www.connotea.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Among stakeholders in the scholarly communication system there has been a growing interest in evaluating the use and impact of open access resources and sources, both within and beyond the academic research community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551512438353">9</xref>]. There are two main routes to open access: the ‘gold road’, which is based on the model of open access journals; and the ‘green road’, which is based on the model of digital repositories of papers published in traditional subscription-based journals, typically after an embargo period. Digital open access repositories can be defined as openly accessible, web-based databases of research materials that may or may not be peer-reviewed, and may or may not be published in a subscription-based journal. There are two main types of open access repository: institutional repositories, containing the research outputs of research-active employees; and subject-based repositories, which hold research outputs relating to particular disciplines or subdisciplines.</p>
<p>Traditional approaches to citation analysis based on published journal articles are not an effective means by which to measure use and impact in the context of the ‘green road’ to open access, since authors typically do not cite unpublished versions of articles, preferring to cite the final published version, although there are disciplinary differences in this pattern of behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551512438353">10</xref>]. Whereas the ‘gold road’ (e.g. open access journals) is well developed in the life and medical sciences, in other broad disciplinary areas, such as physics and earth sciences, the ‘green road’ has been adopted to a greater extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551512438353">11</xref>]. Consequently, in order to achieve a holistic picture of the use and impact of open access, it is important to develop methodological techniques that are effective in the context of the ‘green road’ to open access. The characteristics of social bookmarking services lend themselves to exploration of their potential to contribute to such methodological techniques.</p>
<p>This paper aims to expand on the possibility of using social bookmarking services to measure the use of both published and unpublished information by academic researchers using BibSonomy, a free resource-sharing system, as a case study. The research is underpinned by the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0165551512438353" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What types of source (journal articles, conference proceedings, books, etc.) are being bookmarked by users, and do any of these types predominate?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the types of information resource (commercial publishers’ platforms, databases, repositories, catalogue records, etc.) being bookmarked by users?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are any of these resources available via open access and, if so, can a pattern be determined as to predominant open access resources?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are social bookmarking data useful for measuring information use within the scholarly communication system?</p></list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If so, how might such data be incorporated into existing approaches for understanding information behaviour in order that stakeholders might have access to a complementary set of techniques that collectively provide a holistic picture of information behaviours with regard to informal and formal scholarly communication?</p>

<title>2. Methods</title>
<p>We use BibSonomy as our data source. BibSonomy is a free resource-sharing system that allows the sharing of bookmarks and bibliographic references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551512438353">12</xref>]. When a user discovers a website or a publication on the web, they can store the bookmark on BibSonomy’s server, adding tags in order to retrieve it more easily in the future. The system works in a way that is similar to any internet browser’s bookmark options, but allows users to access data from anywhere and share their bookmarks with other users.</p>
<p>BibSonomy was selected from among the three existing social bookmarking tools serving the academic research community because it offers a free dataset of the database for research purposes in the form of an SQL dump. According to Reher and Haustein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512438353">8</xref>], all three existing tools (BibSonomy, CiteULike and Connotea) have a comparable number of users, as measured by traffic statistics. Although BibSonomy is a product targeted at academic researchers, it is important to emphasize that it is a freely available tool that anyone can use. BibSonomy distinguishes between two different types of bookmark: websites and publications. For the purpose of this study we worked with the publications.</p>
<p>We used the dataset corresponding to 1 January 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551512438353">13</xref>]. The dataset included 370,585 records with a URL bookmarked between December 2005 and December 2010. Each bibliographic reference was classified into nine categories according to the type of information resource it pointed to:</p>
<list id="list2-0165551512438353" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Bookseller</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Book publisher</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Catalogue record</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Database</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Digital library</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Digital repository</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Journal publisher</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Open access journal</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Website.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When the URL was not self-evident for classification purposes, the website was visited. If the URL was no longer available, pointed to a local disk (C:/), or was password protected, the record was removed from the database. Every effort was made to classify all the records in the dataset, even where the URL pointed to an information resource requiring a subscription.</p>
<p>The classified records had been created by 3168 users. Of the 3168 users, 17 were responsible for creating more than 1000 records each, and these users were analysed individually. The 281,590 records associated with 14 out of these 17 users had been uploaded within a narrow time period (always less than five days) and referred to a highly limited range of information resources (usually a single catalogue or digital repository). It was assumed that records created by these 14 users had been uploaded by managers of digital libraries in order to enhance use, and did not represent typical behaviour of researchers using BibSonomy: therefore such records (281,590) were removed from the sample. The analysis reported in this paper is based on the remaining 81,683 records, which were created by 3154 users.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551512438353">Figure 1</xref>, there is a linear relationship between the number of users and the number of bookmarks for the nine categories of resources considered in this study. This indicates that results are not affected by outlying users who bookmark large amounts of a specific kind of resource.</p>

<title>3. Results</title>
<p>When bookmarking a bibliographic reference in BibSonomy, users can specify the type of information source the bookmark links to, and 61,649 records included this information. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165551512438353">Table 1</xref>, the most popular type of source bookmarked was journal articles, which accounted for nearly half (47%) of the sources bookmarked. A quarter of the bookmarks (25%) linked to conference proceedings, and 16% of records referred to books or book chapters.</p>

The number of unique users per publisher (<italic>U</italic><sub>p</sub>) and the average number of bookmarks per user (<italic>B</italic><sub>p</sub>/<italic>U</italic><sub>b</sub>) have also been recorded.

<p>After commercial journal publishers, the second most popular type of information resource bookmarked is websites. This category included bookmarks of information sources that were available from websites within the higher education, government and industry sectors. In the first instance, these are bookmarks of sources that are located at the websites of institutions and organizations where research is performed: for example, the websites of university departments (including the websites of research groups, research projects and individual academics), government agencies, and the research departments of private companies that provide copies of staff publications. In the second instance, this category included websites of congresses and conferences that offer online access to their proceedings, and there was a wide variation in the types of information source available. Sources ranged from conference abstracts, posters and presentation slides to the full text of talks and papers given. Finally, the website category also included bookmarked references to non-scholarly/scientific sources and resources, such as newspapers and magazines, and bookmarks to other websites, such as Wikipedia articles and blog entries, which strictly speaking would be more appropriate in the ‘bookmarks’ section of BibSonomy, since they are not publications per se.</p>
<p>The third most popular type of information resource to be bookmarked is records in bibliographic databases. The top four most frequently bookmarked resources in the databases category (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0165551512438353">Table 4</xref>) accounted for 85% of this type of bookmark, and it is worth noting that all four allow for searches in freely available databases. The top three most popular databases specialize in computer science. Strictly speaking, the most popular resource (ACM Digital Library) could be considered as a publisher platform, since it includes the full text of every article published by the Association for Computer Machinery (ACM), but since it also offers bibliographic records from other publishers it has been considered a database for the purpose of this study. In contrast, DBLP and CiteSeer are produced by academic departments of computer science. The position of Google Scholar in sixth place in the list is due to the creation of bookmarks directly from Google Scholar’s results page (URLs such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=keywords">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=keywords</ext-link>). Typically, BibSonomy users bookmark the full-text documents that they access, leaving no trace of the information resource that they used to locate the publication. There were, however, users who did bookmark the search results pages of the information resource they used, and this was particularly the case for users of Google Scholar. Given the potential idiosyncrasies among users in the stage of their information search at which they choose to create a bookmark, the result in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0165551512438353">Table 4</xref> showing that Google Scholar accounted for 3% of the bookmarks to databases may actually be masking a much greater rate of use, and conversely may mean that it is disproportionately represented compared with other popular general search engines.</p>

<p>In BibSonomy, bookmarks of documents available in open access repositories represent 7% of the bookmarks created by users of the tool. This is not necessarily an accurate representation of the extent of use of open access repositories among users of BibSonomy, owing to differences in the way that bibliographic databases link to the full text of documents. Most of the records bookmarked in databases include a link to the full text of the document, whether it be available via a toll fee or via open access. Some of the databases, such as CiteSeer, link most of the records to an open access source, whereas other databases, such as CiteBase, are created by harvesting the metadata and full-text links to documents held in open access repositories, such as arXiv. On this basis it can probably be assumed that some users searching for literature in bibliographic databases bookmark the records that include links to open access repositories where they can access the full text of the document. In these cases, users will probably not bookmark the repository record itself, even if this was how they accessed the full text. In addition to the 7% of total bookmarks that link to documents held in open access repositories, consideration also needs to be given to the large number of links to preprints and postprints hosted on institutional websites (usually departmental websites that host the publications of the academics in the department), research projects’ websites, research groups’ websites or academics’ personal websites, since these websites represent resources that often play an important open access role in the scholarly communication system.</p>
<p>When analysing the most popular bookmarked repositories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0165551512438353">Table 5</xref>), arXiv accounts for nearly half (48%) of the bookmarks to publications in repositories. In addition, it is worth emphasizing that the top five most popular bookmarked repositories, which account for 68% of the bookmarks, are subject based, as opposed to institutional. The first institutional repository to appear in the list is that of University College London, which comes seventh, with 2% of the bookmarks. In fact, just 25% of the documents bookmarked in repositories are hosted in institutional repositories; the remaining 75% are hosted in subject-based repositories. In terms of scatter, the limited number of bookmarked documents held in institutional repositories is distributed among 224 repositories, showing a low number of documents bookmarked per repository, whereas bookmarks to documents held in subject-based repositories are concentrated in just 35 repositories.</p>

<p>Another element that is of interest is whether there are any differences in the type of open access repository sources bookmarked, compared with those bookmarked from other information resources. If we compare the typology of open access repository sources bookmarked in BibSonomy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0165551512438353">Table 6</xref>) with those of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165551512438353">Table 1</xref>, the percentage of articles (34%) and conference proceedings (20%) bookmarked in repositories is lower when compared with the entire population of bookmarks in the dataset (47% and 25% respectively). Correspondingly, a higher percentage of other types of open access source have been bookmarked, compared with the entire population of books, namely book chapters, technical reports and dissertations. There are several open access repositories that specialize in dissertations, such as OhioLINK ETD Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://etd.ohiolink.edu">http://etd.ohiolink.edu</ext-link>), TEL (thèses en ligne) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr">http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr</ext-link>), Tesis Doctorals en Xarxa (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tdx.cat">http://www.tdx.cat</ext-link>), and a number of sources in these repositories have been bookmarked.</p>

<p>In terms of other types of open access information resource, 3% of the bookmarks in BibSonomy pointed to articles published in open access journals. The most popular publishers of open access journals, according to the number of BibSonomy bookmarks received, were BioMed Central<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0165551512438353">2</xref></sup> (10% of the bookmarks) and PLoS<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0165551512438353">3</xref></sup> (Public Library of Science) (9%). The majority of the bookmarks, however, point to individual journal titles published by academic departments, scientific societies and professional bodies. A high degree of scattering in the bookmarks to open access journals was expected, given the relatively recent adoption of open access journals, which have been more popular in some disciplines than in others, and the relative immaturity of the reputation of many open access journals, compared with traditional subscription-based journals. This expectation was not realized, however, with 25% of the open access journals accounting for 80% of the bookmarks to this type of resource. This distribution was identical to the distribution of bookmarks to journal titles in the total population of bookmarks, where 26% of journal titles accounted for 80% of the bookmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165551512438353">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The BibSonomy dataset corresponding to 1 January 2011 included publications bookmarked from December 2005 to December 2010. When we analyse the evolution in the number of publications bookmarked during this period, we observe an exponential increase in the use of the service until 2009, when the total number of bookmarks peaked at 26,740. During 2010 the number of bookmarks started to decline, with the total number of bookmarks decreasing to 20,130. When we compare the evolution in the number of bookmarks by type of information source it becomes clear, however, that the number of bookmarks to open access repositories and open access journals has remained stable, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0165551512438353">Figure 3</xref>. Further research with longer temporal trends will be necessary in order to determine whether these data indicate an increase in the use of open access resources and sources compared with other types of resource and source.</p>

<p>‘Booksellers’ were a target for 5% of the bookmarks in BibSonomy, the majority of which comprised Amazon (75%) and Google Books (24%). Despite the fact that Google Books is not a bookseller, it has been included in this category since, from the point of view of the information it offers its users, it offers a service similar to that of ‘booksellers’, e.g. full-text searching of monographs, and access to excerpts of their contents.</p>
<p>Finally, 3% of the bookmarks point to catalogue records, mainly from German academic libraries (BibSonomy has been integrated into several of these catalogues), 0.6% to book publishers and 0.4% to digital libraries (i.e. collections of digitized documents), with Gallica (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gallica.bnf.fr">http://gallica.bnf.fr</ext-link>; 25% of the bookmarks) being the most popular resource.</p>
<p>The 81,683 bookmarks in BibSonomy were created by 3154 users. There is a high degree of concentration of use among a few of these users: 15% of the most active users (472 people) are responsible for 80% of the bookmarks. In fact, 1849 users (59%) have only between one and five bookmarks in their accounts.</p>

<title>4.1. What types of source are bookmarked by users?</title>
<p>Published journal articles are by far the most popular type of source bookmarked by users of BibSonomy. This result is consistent with what has been systematically observed in studies of information behaviour in academic settings. Tenopir and King [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551512438353">3</xref>], in a monograph synthesizing the results of successive readership surveys in American universities since the 1970s, observe that in every survey they have conducted, scientists were found to read many more scholarly articles than any other type of document. More recently, studies of information behaviour show that scholarly journal articles account for over 90% of scholars’ information sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165551512438353">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551512438353">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The fact that conference proceedings appear as the second preferred type of document bookmarked is probably related to the fact that BibSonomy seems to be especially popular among academics in computer science, as suggested by the disciplinary scope of the databases and repositories bookmarked. In fact, a comparative study performed by Reher and Haustein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512438353">8</xref>] concluded that BibSonomy is the most commonly used social bookmarking service in the discipline of computer science. The preference for conference proceedings as an important channel for scholarly communication in computer science has been well documented. A recent bibliometrics study conducted by Wainer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551512438353">16</xref>] found that around 40% of the bibliographic references in ACM papers were to conference proceedings, with 30% to published journal articles and 8% to books.</p>
<p>BibSonomy distinguishes between ‘bookmarks’ (any website a user wants to bookmark) and ‘publications’ (articles, books, theses, etc.). We have analysed the ‘publications’ only, but we have come across many websites bookmarked in this category that are not publications as understood in the broader context of scholarly communication (e.g. bookmarks to blog entries and Wikipedia articles). This seems to mean two things: first, that users do not understand the distinction imposed by BibSonomy, or are not concerned about following such a distinction; and second, that websites that are not publications, such as blogs and Wikipedia, are of great interest to them, since they bookmark many of these resources.</p>
<p>This result is consistent with recent observations by Niu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551512438353">17</xref>], who conducted a study of five universities based in the USA. They found that websites were among scholars’ primary information resources, and were used on a daily basis to support research activities. As they point out, most survey-based information behaviour studies prior to 2000 did not include web pages as a possible information resource. Traditionally, scholars have used formal (publications) and informal (face-to-face interactions with colleagues, seminars and conferences, etc.) channels of communication for dissemination and collaboration purposes. In the academic research context the internet has been adopted to such an extent that available tools (e.g. email, VoIP, blogs and personal websites) afford informal communication that is on a par with, or in some cases superior to, face-to-face informal communication. Nicholas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551512438353">18</xref>] showed that a greater number of UK-based researchers rated websites and blogs as being important than those who rated conference or working papers as important, illustrating a shifting pattern in researchers’ information behaviour with regard to informal scholarly communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0165551512438353">
<title>4.2. What types of information resource are bookmarked by users?</title>
<p>Commercial journal publisher platforms were the most popular type of information resource bookmarked by users of BibSonomy, and accounted for almost one third of the bookmarks to information resources. The popularity of commercial journal publisher platforms among users is consistent with journal articles being the most popular type of source to be bookmarked. Although this result is in line with what might be expected, based on the documented predominance of the published journal article as an information source, one of the advantages of using social bookmarking data to measure the use of information by researchers is that it allows comparisons to be made across different publishers and journals that would otherwise not be possible, since usage data from commercial publishers are not widely available.</p>
<p>Bibliographic databases were also a popular information resource to be bookmarked, which reflects their popularity for literature searches. The most popular bookmarked databases had two characteristics in common: they allowed searches to be made in freely available databases, and they provided the link to the full text of the information source. It seems feasible that users search bibliographic databases and bookmark the relevant records they retrieve. These records may include a link to the full text of the source, available most commonly either from a publisher’s platform or from an open access repository, but also including other types of information resource. The position of Google Scholar as the sixth most popular bookmarked bibliographic database suggests extensive use of this internet search engine, but since we have counted only the bookmarks created directly from its results page, this may be a disproportionate representation, since the usual bookmarking behaviour would be to link to the source once it has been retrieved. Previous related studies based on either referring web pages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551512438353">19</xref>] or surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165551512438353">20</xref>] have shown that internet search engines, especially Google and Google Scholar, are now among the most important sources of information for researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0165551512438353">
<title>4.3. To what extent are open access information resources and sources bookmarked by users?</title>
<p>Bookmarks can be a good way to measure the use of open access resources and sources, since even though some open access repositories and open access journals offer ‘usage’ statistics, comparative data across different resources are not readily available, not least because of the different approaches used to measure ‘usage’. As a result, most of the research regarding the use of repositories seeks to understand adoption and usage patterns by contributors to repositories, e.g. those who place documents into repositories, but there is little research on the perceptions and experiences of readers (sometimes referred to as end-users in the related literature). According to Jean et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551512438353">21</xref>], despite the widespread recognition of the central importance of readers to the ultimate success of open access repositories, we know very little about them. One reason is that repository managers have been concerned more about overcoming barriers to depositing content than about the reader experience, and another is the practical difficulty of identifying and surveying repository users.</p>
<p>According to our results, the usage of open access information resources is low in comparison with toll access journals. Open access repositories represent 7% of the bookmarks in BibSonomy and open access journals 3%. In the case of open access repositories, there is a marked preference for the use of subject-based repositories over institutional repositories. This finding is likely to be related to the volume and type of sources these two different types of repository hold, but does appear to corroborate current understanding with regard to the use of institutional repositories. For example, according to Asunka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551512438353">22</xref>], there is growing certainty that most institutional repositories remain largely empty, ineffective, or underutilized. Previous research on the use of repositories has also found low levels of usage by readers. For instance, Organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165551512438353">23</xref>] analysed the download statistics at the institutional repository of the University of Wollongong (Australia). During the six-month period of the study, 6.2% of the sources received more than 50 full-text downloads, with the vast majority (79.5%) within the 1–50 full-text download range and 14.3% not being downloaded at all. It is worth noting that 95.8% of the downloads were referred from Google.</p>
<p>Caution is required, however, when using the results of bookmarking service analyses as a proxy for the use of open access repositories. The actual use of open access repositories among users of BibSonomy is likely to be higher than the 7% of total bookmarks suggests. It should be taken into account that most of the records bookmarked in databases include a link to the full text of the document, either toll or open access. Some of the databases link most of the publications to an open access source, whereas other databases are created by harvesting the metadata and links to the full text from open access repositories. It can probably be assumed, therefore, that some users searching for literature in bibliographic databases bookmark the records that include links to repositories where they can get access to the full text of the document. In these cases, BibSonomy users are unlikely to bookmark the repository record, even if this represents the full-text version that they accessed. In addition to the links to published sources in open access repositories, the large number of links to preprints and postprints hosted on institutional websites (usually departmental websites that host the publications of the academics in the department), research projects’ websites, research groups’ websites or academics’ personal websites should be considered when measuring the use and impact of open access resources and sources, as they represent a large proportion of scholarly output available via open access.</p>
<p>When we compare the typology of sources bookmarked in open access repositories with those bookmarked from other information resources, we find that the proportion of journal articles and conference proceedings bookmarked in repositories is underrepresented compared with that of the entire population of bookmarks. This is balanced out by the higher proportion of book chapters, technical reports and dissertations bookmarked from open access repositories. This finding suggests that the impact of open access repositories may be greatest in terms of grey literature, and this warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to journal articles held in open access repositories, 3% of the bookmarks to open access information resources pointed to articles published in open access journals. Since the successful adoption of open access journals is relatively recent, and there are a large number of open access journals that do not yet have well-established reputations, it was expected that there would be a high degree of scattering in the bookmarks to open access journals. This expectation, however, was not realized, with just 25% of open access journal titles accounting for 80% of the bookmarks.</p>

<sec id="section8-0165551512438353">
<title>4.4. Are social bookmarking data useful for measuring information use in the scholarly communication system?</title>
<p>Social bookmarking data can be used to augment participative methods (e.g. interviews and surveys) and other, non-participative methods (e.g. citation analysis and transaction logs) to measure the use of scholarly information. Our results concerning the types of information resource and source bookmarked by users are consistent with those observed in other studies based on surveys and citation analysis, confirming the possible use of bookmarking data in studies of information behaviour in academic settings. It should be emphasized, however, that although BibSonomy is a product targeted at academic researchers, it is a freely available tool that anyone can use.</p>
<p>As the use of bookmarking data, compared with survey data, is a non-participative approach, its main advantage is that it is an unobtrusive strategy, and therefore not vulnerable to low response rates. Compared with citation analysis, the main advantage is that it captures the reading habits of all kinds of reader, not only those who are authors. In relation to usage data, the main advantage is that bookmarking data are readily available, whereas transaction logs are recorded in private servers. In addition, whereas logs indiscriminately record all types of use (including, for instance, the download of articles that are quickly examined and dismissed), the action of creating a bookmark implies a certain degree of interest from a reader who wants to keeps the URL for future reference.</p>
<p>When considering the analysis of social bookmarking services to develop understanding of the use of scholarly information, some limitations need to be recognized. A great deal of the metadata provided in the bookmark records proved to be incomplete or erroneous, with many discrepancies in spelling. A significant amount of human resources were required in order to code the records manually and standardize data such as journal titles. Despite the fact that BibSonomy offers scrapers, which allow for the automatic extraction of metadata from selected resources, the results of Reher and Haustein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512438353">8</xref>] suggest that these do not always work well, and often fail to import metadata correctly. The fact that social bookmarking services offer automatic metadata scrapers probably makes users more inclined to bookmark resources that make use of this facility. In turn, this could influence the results of our study, and as a point of reference, as of July 2011 BibSonomy offered scrapers for 79 information resources, which included the major scholarly publishers and databases. Furthermore, the existence of links from some platforms to BibSonomy might affect the representativeness of bookmarking data, since users might be more inclined to bookmark publications when a link is readily available. As of December 2011, two of the most frequently bookmarked commercial publishers’ platforms (American Institute of Physics and Ingenta Connect), one of the most frequently bookmarked databases (CiteSeer) and one of the most frequently bookmarked repositories (arXiv) provided a link to BibSonomy.</p>
<p>Another issue that should be taken into account is that records created in social bookmarking services can be automatically uploaded by managers of digital libraries in order to enhance their use. These ‘users’ do not represent the typical behaviour of researchers using the tool, and needed to be removed from the sample. For instance, in our study we removed 281,590 records from the original dataset that were uploaded by just 14 users. All of these records had been uploaded within a very narrow time frame, and usually referred to a single catalogue or repository. This reinforces the point that, in order to use social bookmarking data to measure the use of scholarly information, attention needs to be paid to cleaning and standardizing the data.</p>

<title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>Social bookmaking data can be used to augment other methods to measure the use of scholarly information, such as surveys, citation analysis or server transaction logs. It is a non-participative approach, which offers readily available data that capture the reading habits of all kinds of reader, not only those readers who are authors. A large amount of work is required, however, in order to standardize incomplete or erroneous metadata. Additionally, it needs to be borne in mind that some social bookmarking services are especially popular among academics in specific disciplines or countries, which may have an influence on the results. Since the dataset provided by Bibsonomy is anonymized, it was not possible to determine the disciplinary identity of users (e.g. through their departmental affiliation or through surveying them); if this were possible, it could be very enlightening to reveal patterns of behaviour along disciplinary dimensions.</p>
<p>The results of this research are consistent with what has been observed in systematic studies of information behaviours in academic settings, which confirms the possible use of social bookmarking data in studies concerned with researchers’ information behaviours. It should be borne in mind, however, that although BibSonomy is a product targeted at academic researchers, it is a freely available tool that anyone can use.</p>
<p>Social bookmarks can be a good way to measure the use of open access resources from the point of view of the perceptions and experiences of readers. According to our results, the usage of open access resources is low in comparison with toll access journals. There is a clear preference for the use of subject-based repositories, and it is likely that the use of open access repositories among users of BibSonomy is probably higher than our results suggest. It should be taken into account that most of the records bookmarked in databases include a link to the full text of the document available in open access, whether that happens to be an open access repository or a researcher’s website, for example.</p>
<p>The results reported in this paper are based on a single case study. Further research should be carried out using data from other social bookmarking services.</p>
