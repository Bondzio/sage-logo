Abstract
Coming out of mission efforts
focused on evangelism, the rising Business as Mission movement stakes a claim
to effective holistic mission by focusing on profit, evangelism, and development.
Research indicates, however, that the development aspect of this `triple
bottom line' is significantly weak. If, in fact, Business as Mission efforts
were to incorporate the social and political dimensions of development, there
would be great potential for a partnership with grassroots organizations
to bring about deep-reaching social transformation.

Introduction
Business as Mission (BAM) is a concept in mission theory and practice that
has been emerging during the last decade. Its substantial growth in practice
is reflect- ed by the slow and steady increase in the amount of literature
on the subject, both in academic sources and in magazine articles. The basic
concept behind Business as Mission is that a person engaging in business can,
and should, have a transfor- mational role on a spiritual, economic, and societal
level. BAM is attractive to traditional missionary sending agencies, and increasingly
to churches tied in with them, for two main reasons. First, it is a way to
reach peo- ple with the Gospel who live in countries that are `closed' to
missionaries seeking to share Christ's message of salvation: a business visa
is a way to get around those restrictions. Second, it is a way to incorporate
new people who in the past would not have been interested in missions, namely
business people, and encourage them to feel that their endeavors have a larger,
perhaps eternal, meaning. In theory, Business as Mission is more than just
about evangelism and incorpo- rating more people into that endeavor. As stated,
it is supposed to be a `holistic'
83
praxis
of missions, in which social transformation is a key element of its design.
In reality, however, this aspect of Business as Mission, this third `bottom
line' (profit and evangelization being the other two), has been extremely
weak. In part this is because BAM has sprung up out of an evangelical context
in which social aspects of the gospel are only recently coming into the forefront,
meaning that BAM has been viewed primarily, although not always entirely exclusively,
through the lens of evangelism. This article takes a different approach. It
looks at BAM from a development perspective, from the perspective of that
third bottom line, and evaluates lit- erature and current practice in the
light of insights from development practice. It does so by, first, quickly
reviewing the literature on Business as Mission, pointing to how the focus
on business and evangelization has tended to dominate. Second, it draws on
survey research and follow up interviews with 39 BAM practition- ers working
in 11 different countries to show that the `development' aspect of Business
as Mission is weak in current practice. This article concludes by outlin-
ing what the dimensions of a significant development focus in BAM might look
like, and the challenges and promises that adopting this approach would hold
for the transformation of societies. Business as Mission Literature: Trends
and Points of Emphasis As one reviews the literature on Business as Mission,
there are two things that jump out fairly quickly. The first is that the literature
is dominated by authors are coming from two primary vantage points: as business
people who begin with business and want to see their efforts have an eternal
impact, or as mis- sionaries who start with the strategic need to enter difficult
countries. The second is that even though authors are analyzing, and promoting,
BAM from these two different starting places, they tend to focus on similar
points about the definition, Biblical basis, historical basis, and current
practice and reach quite similar conclusions. In what follows, each of these
four points will be taken in turn. Definition The literature on BAM is moving
toward a coherent definition of the concept, although there is not yet a consensus
(Winter, 2007). A number of authors offer working definitions, which are used
for their writing but not seen as definitive for all. As stated by one author
unconcerned by this state of affairs, `The descrip- tions used here are simply
to aid us to communicate clearly and consistently. It is not our aim to create
a “Business as mission orthodoxy” or terminology, or to exclude
groups or initiatives that prefer other terms and definitions' (Tunehag et
al., 2005: 12). The definitions agree on three main points: monetary profitability,
social responsibility or social transformation, and Kingdom purposes, or the
spread of the Kingdom of God. Some of the more popular definitions are as
follows. Rundle and Steffen offer a definition of Business as Mission that
focuses on the role of the `Great Commission Company: “a socially responsible,
income producing busi- ness managed by kingdom professionals and created for
the specific purpose of glorifying God and promoting growth and multiplication
of local churches in the least evangelized and least-developed parts of the
world.”' (Rundle, 2003: 41). Tunehag offers a similar definition in
an unpublished work: `Business as Mission is about real, viable, sustainable
and profitable businesses; with a Kingdom of God
84
purpose,
perspective and impact; leading to transformation of people and socie- ties
spiritually, economically and socially – to the greater glory of God'
(Tunehag, 2006: 3). Both definitions include the elements of monetary gain
or profit, and intentionality about sharing the Gospel and spreading the Kingdom
is important to both authors, seen in the fact that the businesses should
have a missional pur- pose. However, it is noticeable that in only one of
them is the issue of transforma- tion of culture and society present, although
other authors such as Eldred (2005) also have it in theirs. In summary, the
main elements of a definition of Business as Mission are a business that seeks
monetary profit, social transformation, and the glorification of God by seeing
His kingdom expanded. Biblical Basis In addition to placing great emphasis
and time on defining BAM, the literature also shares a commonality in arguing
that the Bible supports and encourages business endeavors, and specifically
Business as Mission. Invariably, with most authors citing the same examples
and verses, the focus is on the Apostle Paul making tents (Cox, 1997; Smith,
1998; Winter, 2007), the examples of Joseph, Daniel and Jesus and their combination
of work and ministry (Cox, 1997), and a number of Old Testament and New Testament
figures who engaged in commerce (Tsukahira, n.d.). The analysis of these examples
focuses primarily on a theology of work (Russell, 2008). The main argument
is that while God honors work, and there- fore business, the western world
has built a wall between the sacred and the secular, leading to secular work,
business work, not being honored. The result is that people feel that being
a full-time Christian worker, defined as a pastor or missionary, for example,
is the highest calling for a Christian. The literature emphatically points
out that being a full-time business person is a calling equal to that of a
pastor or missionary, and how the real issue is to ensure that the sacred
aspects of that calling inform the actions in the secular world (Baer, 2006; Eldred, 2005; Steffen and Barnett, 2006; Tunehag, 2006). Once again, however,
there is little reflection on the Biblical mandate to engage with the poor
in terms of `good works' and `justice',1 essential elements of what should
be the social aspect of Business as Mission. History Another point of commonality
in the literature is its citation of a number of simi- lar historical examples
of Business as Mission, with little variation, in an attempt to show that
BAM as a practice is not simply a new fad, but a well-established way of spreading
the Gospel. The Moravians of the 18th century are often dis- cussed due to
the way they moved out from Germany around the world doing missions together
with business (Cox, 1997). In addition to the Moravians, the Nestorians also
come in for frequent mention. Beginning in Persia, they traveled along the
silk route all the way to China, and it was they, not missionaries, who were
responsible for spreading the Gospel in these areas (Cox, 1997; Eldred, 2005; Steffen and Barnett, 2006). Missionaries did, however, also engage in business.
William Carey, for example, considered the father of modern missions, was
a shoemaker (Cox, 1997). Other examples mentioned frequently in the literature
are the Basel Mission based in Switzerland (Eldred, 2005), Hans Nielsen Hauge,
a businessman and the `father of democracy' in Norway (Tunehag, 2006), and
the historical research done by the Lausanne Occasional paper on BAM (Tunehag
et al., 2005). As can be seen, the emphasis of the review of history of Business
as
85
Mission
is primarily on the combination of business and evangelism, with the third
bottom line of social impact and development being significantly absent. Current
Practice A final common stream in the literature is the focus on sharing,
describing, ascer- taining and/or analyzing the current practice of Business
as Mission. In some cases, examples are limited to sharing personal experiences
(Baer, 2006; Eldred, 2005), while in others there is a more systematic focus
on researching case studies and examples of BAM (Eldred, 2005; Forman, 2007; Russell, 2008; Rundle and Steffen, 2003). The purpose of this literature tends
to be to draw conclusions and recommen- dations on the best practices of Business
as Mission and put those at the service of practitioners.2 While it is beyond
the scope of this article to detail them here, some of the major conclusions
are the importance of mission agencies and their integration of BAM into their
mandates (Forman, 2007; Wilson, 1997), the need for accountability, prayer,
teamwork, and partnership (Lai, 2005; Russell, 2008; Swarr and Dwight, n.d.; Tsukahira, n.d.), the need for cultural sensitivity and adaptation, and the
importance of creating an appropriate business strategy, purpose, and mis-
sion statement (Russell, 2008). As will be seen in further detail, the social
dimen- sions of BAM in this literature and in actual practice are also considerably
weak. The Absence of the Third Bottom Line in Theory and Practice From the
brief literature review,3 it is clear that there is a huge gap in the analysis
and theory of the development and social dimensions of Business as Mission.
This is understandable, given the fact that BAM has come out of a drive by
most of the authors and practitioners either to redeem business for the Kingdom
or to use business as an entry point into closed countries for evangelistic
purposes. While it is laudable that the literature affirms the social and
developmental aspects of BAM as part of its inherent definition, there is
no doubt that the exploration of the implications of this dimension has taken
a back seat. This is true not only in the literature, but in practice as well:
the analyses and evaluation of the social impact of BAM activities are limited
and point to meager efforts on the ground,4 giving credence to the concerns
expressed by Ewert (2006) several years ago about the potential lack of a
holistic approach in BAM practice. A recent survey of current practice also
appears to confirm these concerns. During 2008, 39 Business as Mission practitioners
and theorists working in 11 countries were surveyed by one of the authors
about successes in producing a profit, or return on equity, spiritual and
societal transformation, and what they regarded as best practices. The majority,
59 percent, were working in Asia and 32 percent were in Central Asia. 73 percent
of respondents were affiliated with a mis- sion organization, representing
11 different organizations. The other 27 percent of the respondents were working
independently. The results of this survey, in terms of the issue at hand,5
were quite revealing. Even though 39 percent felt they had a sufficient social
impact (48 percent of respondents indicated a minimal social impact), when
the experts and practition- ers listed the 15 major best practices reproduced
below, there was absolutely no mention of the social or developmental aspect
of BAM: 1 Working with a sending agency is a recommended practice for BAM.
2 Capital should be obtained on an investment not a grant basis. 3 BAM practitioners
should work in teams.
86
4 Teams
should be multicultural. 5 The local language should be studied and learned
as well as possible. 6 The local culture should be studied and learned as
well as possible. 7 The business strives to be pro table and
sustainable in the long term. 8 The business has a system of accountability.
9 Compensation can be a combination of salary from the company and support
as long as there is transparency. 10 The business should have a written business
plan. 11 The business should have updated yearly goals for the business plan.
12 The business should have a written spiritual impact plan. 13 The business
should have updated yearly goals for the spiritual impact plan. 14 The business
should be proactive in intercession. 15 The business should actively seek
the prayer support of others. Making the Development Bottom Line a Reality:
Problems and Potential Even when development and social transformation are
mentioned in the BAM literature and present in practice, they tend to be limited
to a consideration of the provision of jobs, modeling Christian principles
in business management, and creating spiritual capital to transform cultural
practices seen as barriers to development.6 While these are important considerations
and practices, they sell development, and Business as Mission, far short of
what it can and should be. In large part this is because several key aspects
and insights into the complexity of development, and the role of business
in it, are missing. These key aspects have much to do with the way that development
and social change inevitably involve issues of power in terms of the control,
use, and crea- tion of material, economic, and political resources. Poverty
exists to a large extent because of how individuals are driven by a host of
sinful motivations to use power in relationships in a way that creates social,
economic, political, cultural, and psy- chological structures that limit the
access of the poor to opportunities and resources needed for them to flourish
.7 And, as is clear to anybody who has worked in a developing country, a key
variable in explaining poverty is the way that powerful business interests
often intersect with, use, and many times control government and military
resources to protect and further their interests rather than those of the
common good, contributing in this way to cultures of corruption and the absence
of the rule of law. The existence of these kinds of political economies, and
barriers they throw up to development, is precisely why the multilateral community
has focused so much over the last several decades on promoting policies of
`good governance'. Business as Mission, therefore, operates in a context that
is highly political and conflictive, and not just because of the dimensions
of competition that are inherent to the business endeavor and which at times
pit Business as Mission missionaries against each other (Russell, 2008). And,
just as development workers and organiza- tions who in many instances do not
even consider getting involved with the politi- cal dimensions of advocacy
and justice because of the complexity and risk, BAM up until now does not
appear to even have thought about the political implications and possibilities
of its work in the development arena other than the ambiguous claims that
somehow spiritual capital will bring about structural change. The fact is,
however, that Business as Mission holds great potential in this area, for
several reasons. First, the growth and development of countries is, in this
globalized world, completely dependent on businesses to create jobs, and BAM
87
practitioners
who point to that aspect as an important component of the third bottom line
are right to do so. Second, business owners hold a significant amount of power
(either individually depending on the size of their businesses, or as a group),
at the local, national, and international level based precisely on their control
of jobs and resources. They are leaders in the community, and can play a huge
role formally or informally in pushing for changes in the political arena
and political and economic culture in ways that open the doors for development
to occur. Third, as a result of their variegated dimensions of power, business
people also hold the keys to tempering the free market's push towards materialism
and consumerism, which needs to be dealt with if we are talking about true
develop- ment based on Christian principles. Finally, Business as Mission
provides an intriguing opening to combine the best of grassroots movements
working for development and social change with the power that is held by owners
of resources, jobs, and wealth creators. One of the great limita- tions of
the NGO movements, including the evangelical and secular development organizations,
has been that they have done little to incorporate the private sector into
their struggles against poverty.8 To a large extent, this is because they
have traditionally seen business as a major source of the problem, as tainted
and sinful, rather than as a potential ally. Business as Mission, if it truly
incorporates the third bottom line in all of its dimensions, changes this
equation, and holds out the pos- sibility of bridging the gap between evangelicals,
liberals, and secular development workers struggling for social change. This
will require BAM theorists and practition- ers to actively pursue and look
for opportunities and collaboration with these other groups, and with the
business community as a whole, and to reflect and pray about what this kind
of approach will mean in the face of the whole host of issues that need to
be dealt with as part of the development process, including trade, fiscal
and monetary policies, government reform, and yes, even unionization. The
kind of challenge we are presenting to Business as Mission here is a tremen-
dous one. We would like to make clear that we are not saying that all who
engage in BAM or a variety thereof will be called to adopt a holistic approach
that has a deep, development component, just as all who are called to work
in development are not called to engage in advocacy. What we are saying, though,
is that those who engage in BAM, just as those who engage in development from
an evangeli- cal perspective, should at the very least be aware of, consider,
and pray about the issues we have outlined and the ones that Robb Davis outlines
in this issue of Transformation. The vision of business people, development
organizations, people from the communities, and government authorities at
all levels working hand in hand and holding each other accountable is a vision
that inspires, and is a vision that Business as Mission makes possible. And,
we cannot help but wonder if BAM were to move towards a deeper understanding,
engagement, and commitment to the third bottom line, whether its witness in
terms of sharing the salvific message of Christ might not be more effective
and reach a much larger set of people.
