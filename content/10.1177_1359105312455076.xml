<abstract>
<p>Compensatory health beliefs, a self-defence strategy, were examined in a theory-guided intervention promoting influenza vaccination at the workplace. In total, 851 employees were randomised to one group aimed at enhancing intention formation (standard group) or to another one assisting self-regulation (intervention group). Assessments took place after the intervention and 5 months later, investigating whether the intervention would interfere with compensatory health beliefs. The intervention generated an indirect effect via planning on vaccination. Compensatory health beliefs mediated between intention and behaviour. An interaction between intervention group and compensatory health beliefs on behaviour transpired. At low compensatory health belief levels, the intervention group resulted in more vaccinations than the standard group.</p>

<p>Seasonal influenza represents one of the most contagious diseases, leading annually to severe economic (e.g. absenteeism), societal (e.g. hospitalisation) and individual problems. Crowding conditions in the workplace may lead to an increased risk of seasonal influenza infection. The annual influenza vaccination represents an important health behaviour in the workplace as it provides the best possible prevention of influenza onset and its complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312455076">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312455076">Gilman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312455076">Robert Koch Institut, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359105312455076">World Health Organization (WHO), 2011</xref>). However, immunisation rates are lower than desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312455076">CDC, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312455076">Robert Koch Institut, 2008</xref>). This raises the questions of which psychological mechanisms are involved in vaccination adherence and how interventions can be designed to promote this health behaviour.</p>
<p>In this study, German employees received an intervention promoting immunisation via email (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312455076">Schwarzer, 2008</xref>). The construct of compensatory health beliefs (CHB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312455076">Knäuper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312455076">Rabiau et al., 2006</xref>) was applied to vaccination to investigate whether people fail to participate in a vaccination programme because they hold CHB that serve to justify their non-adherence. Furthermore, this study examined whether the promotion of self-regulatory strategies could counteract this potential barrier.</p>

<title>Theory-based intervention to promote participation in seasonal influenza vaccination behaviour</title>
<p>Considering the fact that a lot of people do not behave according to the official recommendations, it becomes obvious that the adoption and maintenance of vaccination behaviour represents a challenge for health promotion. Theories of health behaviour change specify constructs and mechanisms to predict or explain behavioural change (for a discussion and comparison of models, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312455076">Lippke and Ziegelmann, 2008</xref>) and are used as a framework for developing health behaviour interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312455076">Leventhal et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In theories such as the Social Cognitive Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312455076">Bandura, 1997</xref>) or the Theory of Planned Behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312455076">Ajzen, 1991</xref>), intention is specified as the key predictor of subsequent behaviour. However, a major problem is that individuals often fail to translate their good intentions into behaviour. The likelihood of successful health behaviour change could be improved by taking a closer look at postintentional processes. Self-regulatory strategies such as planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312455076">Milkman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312455076">Payaprom et al., 2011</xref>) are more proximal predictors of the pathway from intentions to behaviours and should therefore help to bridge the intention–behaviour gap, making goal attainment more likely.</p>
<p>The intervention in this study was inspired by the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312455076">Schwarzer, 2008</xref>) that distinguishes between a preintentional motivation process, in which a person forms an intention (e.g. to get a flu shot), and a postintentional volition phase, in which the target behaviour is carried out. In each phase, different patterns of social cognitive predictors operate. Accordingly, an intervention was designed to provide evidence for the importance of postintentional factors above and beyond motivational factors for the adoption of this health behaviour. Employees were assigned either to a standard group (targeting motivational factors) or to an intervention group (targeting motivational and volitional factors). Accordant behaviour change techniques were applied to address the intervention components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312455076">Michie et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>CHB</title>
<p>When adopting and maintaining health behaviours, people often face a trade-off between aversive short-term consequences (e.g. getting a flu shot) and attractive long-term consequences (e.g. avoiding infections). This can lead to situations in which a reluctance to initiate the health behaviour needs to be overcome. When individuals do not overcome this reluctance, even though they are aware of their intentions (e.g. to lead a healthy lifestyle) as well as of an opportunity to attain their goals (e.g. to get a flu shot), they often start to create excuses or justifications for not carrying out their intentions. CHB are assumed to operate as a justification or self-defence strategy. Individuals then believe that they can engage in an unhealthy behaviour, such as smoking or not obtaining a flu shot, because they assume that they can compensate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312455076">Radtke et al., 2011a</xref>) or neutralise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312455076">Knäuper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312455076">Rabiau et al., 2006</xref>) the negative consequences of unhealthy behaviours by engaging in other healthy behaviours: ‘Smoking can be compensated for by exercising’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312455076">De Nooijer et al., 2009</xref>) or ‘I live a healthy life and, therefore, I don’t need a flu shot’. The focus of attention is shifted from the risk behaviour to the health behaviour selected for compensation. Thus, individuals can maintain their positive self-image despite engaging in an unhealthy behaviour by conjuring up CHB. These can be accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312455076">Knäuper et al., 2004</xref>), such as the belief that perfect (hand) hygiene behaviours may prevent infections, making vaccination unnecessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359105312455076">WHO, 2009</xref>). However, holding accurate CHB does not guarantee that individuals will (consistently) carry out these compensatory behaviours. Moreover, in the case of inaccuracy, their activation can be detrimental for health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312455076">Rabiau et al., 2009</xref>) because they create an inaccurate sense of invulnerability, which may also apply to influenza, for example, the belief that only old and physically weak people get infected.</p>
<p>CHB can be activated when experiencing cognitive dissonance, which longs for dissolution. CHB can occur either in anticipation of engaging in an unhealthy behaviour, for example, vaccination non-adherence, or subsequently after engaging in an indulgent behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312455076">Kronick and Knäuper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312455076">Radtke et al., 2011a</xref>). CHB may also function as a motivational factor that contributes to the intention formation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312455076">Radtke et al., 2011a</xref>); however, in this study, CHB were assumed to operate as a posteriori justification strategy after a decision was formed, providing an excuse for not engaging in this health behaviour while maintaining a positive self-image. This rationale does not exclude the idea of CHB as a motivational factor in the context of vaccination behaviour; it rather points to the idea of a theoretical distinction between pre- and postintentional factors; that is, a stage-specific construct that can contribute to motivational as well as volitional self-regulation processes (e.g. such as self-efficacy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312455076">Schwarzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105312455076">Schwarzer and Luszczynska, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1359105312455076">
<title>Aims</title>
<p>The study was guided by three research questions. At the end of the flu season, participants of the intervention group were expected to show higher vaccination rates than those of the standard group, adding evidence to previous studies that highlighted the importance of postintentional factors for the adoption of health behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312455076">Koring et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312455076">Luszczynska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105312455076">Schwarzer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105312455076">Sniehotta et al., 2005</xref>). This between-group effect was expected to be explained by mediator variables (planning, self-efficacy) after controlling for sex and age (Hypothesis 1).</p>
<p>It was further hypothesised that participants with low intentions at Time 1 (T1) would be more likely to conjure up compensatory health beliefs. As a result of this, adherence at Time 2 (T2) would appear to them as less important, because their beliefs offer an excuse for their health-compromising behaviour. By contrast, those with high intentions were expected to show lower levels of CHB and to be more likely to receive a vaccination (Hypothesis 2).</p>
<p>CHB can be assumed to operate as a volitional self-regulation strategy that may compete against other health-enhancing self-regulation strategies, such as planning or self-efficacy, when it comes to the translation of intentions into behaviour. Previous research has revealed negative associations with self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312455076">Rabiau et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that individuals low in self-efficacy will be less able to stick to a healthy lifestyle. This suggests that the promotion of concepts such as self-efficacy or planning should help individuals to translate their intentions into behaviour. Thus, the main question of this study was whether CHB would interfere with a self-regulation intervention that promotes planning and self-efficacy. We asked whether the promotion of volitional self-regulation strategies (intervention group) would counteract the negative effect of CHB and consequently make vaccination adherence more likely compared to the standard group that received only motivational messages (Hypothesis 3).</p>

<title>Research design and procedure</title>
<p>Participants of the randomised controlled trial with a component control design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105312455076">Willis, 2001</xref>) were recruited from a German company via email before vaccination was available. Employees were randomised to either the standard or the intervention condition, receiving different information on seasonal influenza via an email-based leaflet. They were then forwarded to an online questionnaire (T1). Shortly after T1, vaccinations were provided for free at the company. Five months later (T2) when the influenza season was over, employees received a link to the follow-up questionnaire. Completion of each questionnaire took about 10 minutes, and participation was anonymous and voluntary. The company’s work committee approved the study for data privacy and ethical standards. The research was conducted in line with the ethical guidelines of the German Psychological Society.</p>

<title>Intervention</title>
<p>Individuals in the standard group received an email aimed at enhancing the intention to undergo vaccination. Risk perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312455076">Bish et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312455076">Brewer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105312455076">Weinstein et al., 2007</xref>) was addressed by providing information on the severity of influenza; positive and negative outcome expectancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312455076">Bish et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312455076">Hofmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312455076">Nexøe et al., 1999</xref>) were targeted by providing the pros and cons of either getting vaccinated or not getting vaccinated, elucidated by illustrations (e.g. displaying the ratio of the likelihood of different kinds of side effects and no side effects due to the vaccination in a pie chart). In the intervention group, the email additionally addressed volitional self-regulatory strategies. Employees were encouraged to plan their vaccination date (action planning: when and where; coping planning: definite back-up plan for when something prevents the execution of the original plan), and, finally, written testimonials by role models were presented to enhance self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312455076">Bandura, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>All measures were adapted to the vaccination content from validated scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312455076">Schwarzer, 2008</xref>). Item examples are translations from German. Intention at T1 was measured with the item: ‘I intend to get the flu shot this season’ (7-point Likert scale from 1 (‘I don’t intend to at all’) to 7 (‘strongly intend to’)). Planning was measured with three items, for example, ‘I already have a definite plan for when to get vaccinated, i.e., a specific day or occasion X’ (<italic>α</italic> = .75) on a 6-point Likert scale from 1 (‘I strongly disagree’) to 6 (‘I strongly agree’), as was self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312455076">Schwarzer, 2008</xref>): ‘I am sure I can obtain the flu shot, even if I have to overcome inner barriers such as uncertainty about its effectiveness, worry about side effects, the stress of going there, etc.’. Behaviour assessment at T1 referred to vaccination behaviour during the past flu season, and behaviour at T2 assessed behaviour within the past 6 months (response categories: 1 (yes), 0 (no)).</p>
<p>CHB were assessed with a single general item (6-point Likert scale from 1 (‘I strongly disagree’) to 6 (‘I strongly agree’)) on vaccination behaviour at T2 (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312455076">De Nooijer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312455076">Knäuper et al., 2004</xref>): ‘I live a healthy lifestyle, and therefore I don’t need a flu shot’. Holding CHB in one health behaviour domain was found to go together with holding CHB in another content area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312455076">Knäuper et al., 2004</xref>), which suggests that CHB reflect a rather general tendency, allowing its assessment with a unidimensional scale.</p>

<title>Theory-based intervention: effects and mechanisms</title>
<p>To examine the mechanisms of putative group differences in vaccination behaviour, multiple regression procedures with raw scores were conducted with group membership as the independent variable (0 = standard group, 1 = intervention group), self-efficacy and planning as mediating variables and behaviour at T2 as the dependent variable, controlling for baseline behaviour, sex and age.</p>
<p>There was no overall group effect (intervention → vaccination T2: <italic>b</italic> = .33, standard error (SE) = .31; <italic>p</italic> = .29) on behaviour, but a total indirect effect of .35 (SE = .16; 95% CI = .06, .71; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .56). The intervention was associated with planning (<italic>b</italic> = .67, SE = .14; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and planning predicted behaviour (<italic>b</italic> = .50, SE = .14; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The intervention group was associated with more planning, which made participation in vaccination more likely (indirect effect: intervention → planning → vaccination = .33, SE = .14; 95% CI = −.09, .65). By contrast, self-efficacy did not operate as a mediator (indirect effect: intervention → self-efficacy → vaccination = .02, SE = .05; 95% CI = .09, .15). Intervention conditions were unrelated to self-efficacy (<italic>b</italic> = .09, SE = .21; <italic>p</italic> = .69), but self-efficacy predicted subsequent behaviour (<italic>b</italic> = .22, SE = .09; <italic>p</italic> = .01).</p>

<title>CHB: simple mediation between intention and behaviour</title>
<p>Regression procedures were applied to investigate CHB as the proposed mediator between intention and behaviour at T2. An indirect effect with CHB as the mediator emerged (indirect effect: intention → CHB → vaccination = .17, SE = .04; 95% CI = .11, .24), controlled for baseline vaccination (<italic>b</italic> = 1.19, SE = .27; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).

<title>Interaction between CHB and intervention conditions</title>
<p>The main question was whether the mediation mechanism would operate in the same manner for the two groups receiving different interventions. A moderated mediation analysis was performed using standardised scores with intervention (0 = standard group/1 = intervention group) as the putative moderator between CHB and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312455076">Preacher and Hayes, 2008</xref>). Although there was no overall treatment effect on subsequent behaviour (<italic>β</italic> = −.03; SE = .02; <italic>p</italic> = .26), the interaction between CHB and experimental conditions was significant (<italic>β</italic> = −.06; SE = .02; <italic>p</italic> = .02). Dominant effects of past behaviour (<italic>β</italic> = .23; SE = .04; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and intentions (<italic>β</italic> = .45; SE = .04; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) on current behaviour were observed as well as the negative direct effect of CHB on behaviour (<italic>β</italic> = −.17; SE = .03; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The moderated mediation effect is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105312455076">Figure 2</xref>, which displays the odds for participating in the vaccination programme (<italic>y</italic>-axis), depending on the level of CHB (<italic>x</italic>-axis) for the two groups (separate lines). The <italic>x</italic>-axis represents the values of CHB with a redefined range from −1 to +1. Overall, individuals with high CHB (+1) had a low likelihood of getting the flu shots in contrast to individuals with low CHB (−1). The weaker the CHB, the higher the likelihood of adherence. Moreover, predicted participation varied among intervention groups. For individuals with low CHB (−1) in the intervention group, the odds of receiving a vaccination were 4.5, compared to 1.8 in the standard group.</p>

<title>Theory-based intervention: the importance of volitional factors</title>
<p>The study adds evidence to previous findings on volitional factors (planning, self-efficacy) that were designed to supplement motivational intervention components (risk perception, outcome expectancies) for the adoption of influenza vaccination behaviour at the worksite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312455076">Milkman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312455076">Payaprom et al., 2011</xref>). The intervention condition, addressing both motivational and postintentional factors, was assumed to be superior in increasing vaccination compared to the standard condition in which only motivational factors were addressed.</p>
<p>Mediation analyses revealed an indirect effect on vaccination behaviour. Individuals in the intervention group showed more planning than those in the standard group, indicating that the intervention effectively influenced the target construct. Planning predicted behaviour at T2, making vaccination adherence more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312455076">Milkman et al., 2011</xref>). There were no group differences in self-efficacy levels, but self-efficacy predicted subsequent behaviour, as was found in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312455076">Payaprom et al., 2011</xref>). The lack of intervention effect on self-efficacy may be due to the role-modelling strategy applied to increase self-efficacy. Testimonials by putative role models were not sufficiently convincing or participants did not identify with them for other reasons. As role modelling is known to be an effective way to promote self-efficacy beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312455076">Bandura, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105312455076">Warner et al., 2011</xref>), it may still be a feasible strategy in the context of vaccination to be improved in future studies.</p>
<p>Moreover, previous research revealed synergistic effects of planning and self-efficacy on behaviour, demonstrating that individuals who lack self-efficacy benefited less from planning treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312455076">Lippke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312455076">Luszczynska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312455076">Richert et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the missing intervention effect on self-efficacy may have affected the vaccination rates twice, failing to operate directly on vaccination behaviour as well as failing to boost planning.</p>
<p>Overall, addressing volitional factors above and beyond motivational factors in an email-based intervention in the workplace indirectly increased the likelihood of vaccination adherence. The findings point to the importance of targeting postintentional constructs, although further research (e.g. experimental studies) is needed to resolve the ambiguous results of the previous and present studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312455076">Gargano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312455076">Milkman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312455076">Payaprom et al., 2011</xref>). Adding to this, future studies could explore the role of other volitional constructs such as action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312455076">Schüz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105312455076">Sniehotta et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section16-1359105312455076">
<title>CHB</title>
<p>The idea of excuses or CHB was applied to receiving an influenza vaccination. The analyses affirmed CHB as a negative mediator between intention and subsequent behaviour. Individuals with low intentions were more likely to report that they believed themselves to be sufficiently protected against influenza because of their healthy lifestyle, and this was associated with a lower probability of receiving the flu shot; vaccination seemed to be considered as a rather unnecessary health behaviour as individuals perceived their lifestyle to be sufficiently protective, and CHB provided an excuse for non-adherence. By contrast, individuals with high intentions were less prone to conjure up CHB, and thus, they became more likely to act according to their intentions and receive vaccination. Future interventions should explicitly consider CHB to reduce their detrimental effect on the execution of health behaviours, and further research on CHB is needed to gain more insight into underlying processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1359105312455076">
<title>Interaction between CHB and intervention conditions</title>
<p>The main focus was on the particular interplay of CHB and the intervention conditions. It was assumed that the self-regulation intervention would have the potential to buffer CHB. Moderated mediation analyses supported this assumption, revealing that the intervention group, which received planning and self-efficacy components, buffered the negative effect of CHB better than the standard group. Low CHB individuals in the intervention group were more likely to receive a vaccination than those in the standard group. However, beyond a certain level of CHB (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359105312455076">Figure 2</xref>), both interventions had an overall small potential to counter CHB. Targeting self-regulatory strategies to support vaccination behaviour was able to oppose CHB only to a certain degree. It is possible that the buffering effect would have been even stronger if the intervention had affected self-efficacy, rather than only planning.</p>
<p>The results underline the need to explicitly consider CHB in future interventions as well as to focus on mechanisms that may operate when competing self-regulation strategies come into play. For example, false CHB (‘being young and healthy provides sufficient protection against influenza infection’) need to be uncovered to expose an inaccurate sense of invulnerability; a false belief could be the assumption that being young and healthy is sufficient protection against the influenza infection. Moreover, the issue of inconsistent or incorrect adherence to effective compensatory behaviours, such as personal hygiene or avoiding exposure to viruses (avoidance of public transport, social distancing), should be discussed, as a high behavioural intention does not guarantee its correct or consistent implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312455076">Rabiau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312455076">Radtke et al., 2011b</xref>). Besides, CHB could represent a mere excuse without intentions to perform the compensatory behaviour. Therefore, when approaching CHB and compensatory behaviours, self-regulation strategies, such as planning and self-efficacy, should also be strengthened. This could help to reduce the activation of CHB, as well as inaccurate or inconsistent compensatory behaviours, and to strengthen health-promoting self-beliefs. Thus, participation in vaccination programmes should be enhanced and potential health-impeding effects due to CHB or incorrect or inconsistent compensatory behaviours could be diminished. However, intervention studies are needed to validate these assumptions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1359105312455076">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Some limitations should be mentioned. One of the key constructs, CHB, was measured with a single item. Other researchers have developed entire scales to assess such CHB (e.g. smoking behaviour, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312455076">Radtke et al., 2011b</xref>). These could be adapted to measure vaccination behaviour in future studies, extending the present assessment of CHB as a general tendency for regulating health behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312455076">Knäuper et al., 2004</xref>). The role of CHB could be further extended by examining the kind (e.g. accurate or inaccurate) and amount of potential compensatory behaviours for not getting flu shots (e.g. hygiene practices) and to examine whether these behaviours are carried out (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312455076">Bish and Michie, 2010</xref>). This could enlarge the focus of this study, which considered CHB as a suitable self-regulatory excuse strategy for avoiding vaccination without suffering from health-detrimental effects. Thus, these beliefs did not necessarily need to have a valid basis. Accordingly, as CHB could represent a mere excuse without any intention to perform compensatory behaviours, self-regulation such as planning and self-efficacy should always be strengthened in interventions. This might help to reduce the activation of CHB, as well as inaccurate or inconsistent compensatory behaviours, and to strengthen health-promoting self-beliefs. Thus, participation in vaccination programmes should be enhanced, and potential health-impeding effects due to CHB or incorrect or inconsistent compensatory behaviours could be diminished. However, intervention studies are needed for validation.</p>
<p>Also, the attrition rate was slightly above average rates that are typical for other longitudinal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312455076">Cook et al., 2000</xref>). This well-known problem needs further investigation to identify feasible remedies, such as addressing participants personally instead of mailing circulars. Adding to this, the attrition rate was related to some of the key variables, such as intention. This may affect the generalisability of the findings and requires further investigations. However, the valuable insight into the role of CHB in the context of vaccination behaviour can be assumed to prevail over the limitations.</p>
<p>Next, vaccination was assessed by self-report, which may be of limited validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312455076">Prince et al., 2008</xref>). Objective measures (e.g. medical reports of vaccination or sick notes) may be preferable but were not available. However, studies on other health behaviours have demonstrated the validity of self-report measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312455076">Glanz et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Age is another important variable in the context of influenza vaccination behaviour. In Germany, the seasonal flu shot is officially recommended for adults older than 60 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312455076">Robert Koch Institut, 2011</xref>; note that there are country-specific variations, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312455076">CDC, 2010</xref>), resulting in higher vaccination rates in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312455076">Robert Koch Institut, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105312455076">Szucs et al., 2006</xref>). However, in this study, analyses revealed no significant associations with age, suggesting that employees realise the increased risk of influenza infection due to crowded working conditions independent of age. Nonetheless, it is always recommended to consider age as a potential moderator when analysing vaccination adherence.</p>
<p>Another limitation applies to the intervention. First, despite the randomisation procedure, employees may still have exchanged information among themselves; this could have confounded the intervention effect. Moreover, the intervention material in the intervention group was longer in length, which may also have affected the validity. However, the results of the mediation analyses documented an indirect intervention effect (planning), reflecting that randomisation and the intervention worked in the intended manner.</p>
<p>Finally, this study did not investigate the functional role of CHB in health behaviour theory but rather explicitly and uniquely focused on postintentional processes. This was done to primarily investigate the contribution of CHB to volitional processes regarding the adoption and maintenance of a health behaviour. However, to further clarify the findings presented, we recommend analysing CHB within existing theory, such as the HAPA (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312455076">Radtke et al., 2011a</xref>), and in relation to other psychological concepts, such as risk perception. CHB can be specified at different points in health behaviour models, including the HAPA. The same is true for other constructs such as social support. The role of CHB needs to be understood in the temporal context. If we ask preintenders about their CHB, their responses may be part of their defences against forming an intention. In this case, CHB operate similar to risk perception. However, if we ask postintenders about their CHB, their responses may reflect internal barriers to action, and CHB serve as justifications for not carrying out their initial intentions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides evidence that CHB may operate as a mediator between intention and behaviour, explaining why some people do not follow the call for flu shots. Moreover, the results indicated that the promotion of self-regulation strategies might be a useful component in email-based interventions to counteract such cognitions. Future vaccination campaigns might want to consider CHB in addition to motivational and volitional intervention ingredients.</p>
