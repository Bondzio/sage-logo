      <p>Eva Magnusson and Jeanne Marecek cover a great deal of material in their short book, <italic>Gender and Culture in Psychology: Theories and Practices</italic>. The authors have four aims for their book—first, to provide readers with conceptual tools for thinking about gender and culture in psychology (e.g., power and knowledge, cultural psychology, “doing gender,” and intersectionality). Second, the authors introduce readers to interpretive research practices and methods (e.g., reflexivity, interviewing, and feminist discursive methods). Third, they give examples of feminist research projects that have used the concepts and methods covered in the previous two sections (e.g., research on inequality in heterosexual couples). Finally, they reflect on the kind of knowledge psychology has contributed to society and what limitations result from psychology’s typical form of knowledge production (e.g., biological reductionism). Because of the breadth of material covered, many readers will be able to learn something new, although the brevity of the book means that it can only “acquaint” readers with the concepts and epistemologies addressed (p. 5). Nevertheless, the book accomplishes what it sets out to do; that is, it introduces readers to important theories and practices for understanding gender and culture in psychology. Further, the book’s breadth combined with its brevity makes this a usable multipurpose text.</p>
      <p>Although this text could be useful to many different audiences, it may be especially suitable for undergraduate psychology and gender/women’s studies students. The book is clearly written, with accessible explanations of difficult concepts (e.g., the description of Foucault’s theory of power in Chapter 3), and helpful writing strategies that walk the reader through the book (e.g., each chapter begins with a paragraph outline of the chapter content). The authors’ straightforward presentation of material provides a lucid, relatively nonthreatening introduction to the concepts, although some clarity is lost in the authors’ succinctness. Additional concrete examples might help readers new to the concepts gain a better understanding. For instance in Chapter 4, the authors give a clear definition of intersectionality, but an example would likely help readers new to this concept better grasp its meaning. Similarly, their brevity frequently left me asking, “But what if I want to know more about this topic?” Thankfully, the authors often anticipated my question and included suggestions for further reading. In short, this book could be a concise supplemental text that does the hard work of clearly explaining foundational concepts, allowing the instructor to use class time to provide concrete examples for additional clarity.</p>
      <p>
         <italic>Gender and Culture in Psychology </italic>is written accessibly enough for undergraduates, but its usefulness does not end with this audience. Other readers may find that they are exceptionally knowledgeable about some of the materials and relatively unfamiliar with other materials covered in the book. For example, a feminist psychologist will be knowledgeable about theories of gender but may be relatively inexperienced with discursive psychological research. Again, Magnusson and Marecek’s discussion of epistemology and methodology is very clearly articulated and is well situated within a larger feminist psychological perspective. Ultimately, however, the short explanations are strengths of the book; the authors provide just enough information to allow a reader to know whether she or he would like to learn more. This also holds for their discussion of specific research projects. They provide enough information for a reader to decide whether she or he would like to read the original sources to learn more about the research topic or methods.</p>
      <p>The fourth section of the book provides critiques of the knowledge that psychology produces and could be useful for feminist therapists (e.g., critiques on psychiatric diagnosis) and researchers alike (e.g., sex difference research). Magnusson and Marecek conclude their book with a chapter on “disciplinary reflexivity,” including a discussion of the importance of “scrutinizing one’s own discipline,” which they do in the previous three chapters. The final chapter’s critique could be especially helpful to feminist psychologists who would like to clearly articulate some of the limitations of psychology’s standard operating procedures to psychology students and colleagues alike.</p>
      <p>In sum, Magnusson and Marecek provide clear explanations of important concepts related to gender and culture, a succinct introduction to feminist interpretive and discursive research methods with examples of research projects completed in this tradition, and a useful critique of psychology as a discipline. All of this however is, by design, only an introduction. It will be important for readers to follow-up <italic>Gender and Culture in Psychology </italic>with additional reading to gain more in-depth understandings of the topics addressed.</p>
