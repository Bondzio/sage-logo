<abstract>
<p>The 60 percent rule has served as a controversial policy change within the postacute care sector since its revision in 2004, requiring inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) to admit no less than 60% of patients according to 1 of 13 specific conditions or else risk the loss of IRF designation according to Medicare’s prospective payment system. Using a contingency theory framework, this study proposes that the 60 percent rule introduced considerable uncertainty into freestanding IRFs’ operational environment, and as a result, IRFs’ operational performance varied according to their “fit” between certain structural characteristics and the pervasive environmental uncertainty. The results suggest that operational performance, as measured by facility Malmquist Index scores, decreased on average for freestanding IRFs following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement in 2005. In contrast, organizations possessing structural characteristics that better “fit” the heightened environmental uncertainty exhibited improved performance on average during the study’s 6-year time period.</p>

<p>It has been described both as a severely blunt policy instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712453206">Center for Post-Acute Studies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712453206">Murer, 2008</xref>) and a Medicare rule that dramatically shook the rehabilitation industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712453206">Britt &amp; Herring, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712453206">Cameron, 2008</xref>). Formerly referred to as the “75 percent rule,” the “60 percent rule” requires 60% of all inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) admissions—including non-Medicare patients—to meet 1 of 13 specific conditions and has been a significant source of confusion and controversy since its revision and enforcement in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712453206">Britt &amp; Herring, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712453206">Murer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712453206">Tilson, 2006</xref>). However, despite anecdotal evidence of the rule’s radical impact on the postacute care sector, few studies have attempted to examine and measure the policy’s consequences, particularly at the organizational level. Our study seeks to address whether freestanding IRFs improved operational performance following the 60 percent rule’s revision and enforcement, or whether the limitations imposed on IRFs as a result of the rule were associated with increased inefficiencies across the freestanding IRF setting. We use data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist Index methods to measure IRF efficiency from 2003 to 2008, spanning before the 60 percent rule’s revision and past its full enforcement. Linear regression models are then used to determine what factors are associated with freestanding IRFs exhibiting improved or declining operational performance during the study’s 6-year period.</p>

<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>Empirical studies have largely neglected examination of the 60 percent rule’s impact on IRFs and the postacute care sector. Exceptions include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712453206">Pezzin, Roberts, Miao, and Dillingham’s (2011)</xref> findings that the rule reduced IRF utilization among patients with strokes, hip fractures, and hip and knee replacements, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077558712453206">Segal, Pedersen, Freeman, and Fast’s (2008)</xref> discovery that readmission and mortality rates increased among elderly patients following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the effects of the 60 percent rule on IRF operational performance, answering calls for research that evaluates the impact of the 60 percent rule on performance among freestanding inpatient rehabilitation providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712453206">Thompson &amp; McCue, 2010</xref>). In addition, our conceptual framework is built on a contingency theory perspective, which has seldom been applied explicitly as a theoretical framework within health care organizational studies in the past 20 years despite empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712453206">Donaldson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford, 2011</xref>).

<title>Background: The 60 Percent Rule</title>
<p>With approximately 1,200 locations across the United States, IRFs are a critical element of the postacute care continuum, offering specialized rehabilitation services to patients functionally limited by a range of ailments and impairments. IRFs exist as freestanding facilities as well as specialized units within acute care hospitals, and they are characterized by the provision of at least 3 hours of intense rehabilitation therapy services to patients on a daily basis as well as 24-hour nursing services and continual physician oversight.</p>
<p>Medicare spending for postacute care services has risen dramatically over the past several decades. From 1988 to 1997, Medicare expenditures for postacute care grew annually at an average rate of 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712453206">Medicare Payment Advisory Commission [MedPAC], 2003</xref>), and Medicare spending for postacute care has continued to increase over the past 10 years, growing from $26.6 billion in 2001 to $54.4 billion in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2010a</xref>). In response to such growth, legislators have enacted various policies and laws to limit increases in postacute expenditures. A noteworthy example of a Medicare reimbursement policy developed to limit IRF spending is the 60 percent rule, formerly known as the 75 percent rule from its introduction in 1983.</p>
<p>The 75 percent rule was originally introduced as a means to identify freestanding IRFs and inpatient rehabilitation units so that they may be exempted from the inpatient acute care hospital prospective payment system (PPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712453206">Cameron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712453206">Murer, 2005</xref>). The rule dictated conditions that were specifically suited for inpatient rehabilitation services, originally requiring 75% of an IRF’s admissions to meet 1 of 10 specific conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and hip fracture. However, as the IRF PPS was being implemented in 2002, legislators discovered that the 75 percent rule was poorly and inconsistently enforced across IRFs, with a majority of IRFs admitting patients with “compliant” conditions well below the 75% threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712453206">Britt &amp; Herring, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712453206">Buntin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712453206">Durkin, Deutsch, &amp; Heinemann, 2010</xref>). As a result, the rule was reexamined, and in 2004, legislators revised the rule to include 13 specific impairment groups with greater limitations on the types of patients who could be admitted as compliant IRF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712453206">Cameron, 2008</xref>). These impairment groups included conditions previously deemed compliant (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury, amputation, hip fracture, brain injury, etc.), as well as additional restricted conditions such as specific instances of arthritis and knee or hip replacements either occurring bilaterally or meeting specific patient age and weight criteria. In addition, the rule’s enforcement was scheduled to occur in phases, beginning with a required compliance rate of 50% in 2005 and increasing annually to the 60%, 65%, and 75% compliance levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of concerns of the dramatic limitations that were imposed on IRFs as a result of the rule’s revision and enforcement, representatives from the inpatient rehabilitation industry successfully lobbied legislators to freeze the rule’s required compliance threshold at 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712453206">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services [CMS], 2011</xref>). In 2007, the compliance threshold was fixed at 60% and the “75 percent rule” became commonly referred to as the “60 percent rule” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712453206">Cameron, 2008</xref>). Since its revision and enforcement in 2004, providers that fail to meet the required compliance thresholds jeopardize their IRF designation and qualification for IRF PPS reimbursements, thereby risking being paid according to considerably lower acute care rates (CMS, 2010).</p>
<p>Convincing evidence exists that the 60 percent rule has had a significant effect on IRFs across the United States. For example, inpatient rehabilitation providers realized a 10% reduction in utilization in the year following the revised rule’s enforcement, a dramatic contrast to years of consistent increases in annual beneficiary utilization leading up to 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712453206">Buntin, 2007</xref>). In the subsequent years, the inpatient rehabilitation industry experienced a steady decline in Medicare patient volume throughout the 60 percent rule’s implementation, with approximately 27% less Medicare caseloads in 2008 than in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712453206">The Moran Company, 2011</xref>). IRF occupancy rates also declined, dropping from 67.8% in 2004 to 61.3% in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, industry estimates suggest that IRFs collectively lost between 25,000 and 40,000 Medicare cases annually as a result of the rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712453206">The Moran Company, 2011</xref>), while IRFs’ costs per case increased on average between 5% and 10% annually from 2004 to 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2010b</xref>). As IRFs spread costs across a declining number of patients, Medicare margins for rehabilitation providers dropped from 16.3% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2011</xref>). These trends are paired with anecdotal evidence of rehabilitation facilities that experienced difficulty sustaining desired operations while complying with the rule’s criteria (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712453206">Britt &amp; Herring, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712453206">DeBellis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712453206">Gans, 2008</xref>), leading to the loss of more than 1,600 beds across the IRF sector from 2004 to 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of such dramatic consequences following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement, our study aims to address the research question of how freestanding IRF operational performance has changed since the revision and enforcement of the 60 percent rule. This study’s focus on freestanding IRFs is for two reasons: First, data set limitations restricted our ability to identify and separate operational data for inpatient rehabilitation units operating within acute care facilities during the study’s time period. Second, freestanding IRFs are more likely to feel greater effects as a result of CMS policy changes in comparison with inpatient rehabilitation units given their larger size (with freestanding IRFs averaging 60 beds vs. an average of 23 beds among inpatient rehabilitation units), restricted access to alternative funding, and greater dependence on relationships with external organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712453206">Durkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712453206">Thompson &amp; McCue, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>Among major organizational theories, only contingency theory was explicitly developed to examine organizational performance and explain why organizations vary in their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712453206">Donaldson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford, 2011</xref>). Contingency theory suggests that organizational performance is connected to how well an organization’s structural characteristics fit its environmental demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712453206">Scott &amp; Davis, 2007</xref>). When organizations find themselves in situations where their contingencies do not fit their structure, organizational performance suffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712453206">Scott &amp; Davis, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A variety of possible contingencies affect organizations at any given time, and one of the most dominant contingencies includes environmental change or uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712453206">Donaldson, 2001</xref>). The 60 percent rule’s revision and enforcement in 2004 constituted a dramatic environmental change for IRFs across the country, creating frustration and confusion among rehabilitation providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712453206">Britt &amp; Herring, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712453206">Murer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712453206">Tilson, 2006</xref>). Given the uncertainty and change resulting from the 60 percent rule’s revision and enforcement, this study focuses on uncertainty stemming from the 60 percent rule as the environmental contingency that IRFs commonly confronted, anticipating that IRF operational performance varied according to the degree of fit between their organizational structures and the pervasive environmental uncertainty.</p>
<p>According to contingency theory, uncertain environments yield constraints and opportunities for organizations depending on their internal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712453206">Scott &amp; Davis, 2007</xref>). A major structural trait among health care organizations in the United States is system membership, particularly in light of the increased consolidation of hospitals into health care systems during the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712453206">Bazzoli, Chan, Shortell, &amp; D’Aunno, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712453206">Bazzoli, Shortell, Dubbs, Chan, &amp; Kralovec, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712453206">Cuellar &amp; Gertler, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712453206">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712453206">Luke, Ozcan, &amp; Olden, 1995</xref>). However, when examining system membership as a structural trait affecting organizational performance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712453206">Halpern, Alexander, and Fennell (1992)</xref> note that contingency theory does not predict that system membership is a universally positive or negative structural trait, but that instead system affiliation is a better fit for organizations under certain structural and environmental conditions. Recent studies have supported this argument, indicating that the relation between system affiliation and improved hospital performance is conditional on system characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712453206">Bazzoli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712453206">Rosko &amp; Proenca, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712453206">Rosko, Proenca, Zinn, &amp; Bazzoli, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>One key factor relating to organizational structure and operations within contingency theory is an organization’s size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712453206">Donaldson, 2001</xref>). Organizations that are smaller in size have the ability to maintain greater flexibility, while larger organizations require greater efforts to ensure that members are appropriately organized and directed, resulting in less flexible and more complex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712453206">Miller &amp; Droge, 1986</xref>). As a result, larger organizations are less likely to adapt and perform effectively in the midst of environmental change and uncertainty. This study evaluates the impact of organizational size at the system level, recognizing the utility of considering system-level organizational properties and their influence given the widespread consolidation of the hospital sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712453206">Bazzoli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712453206">Bazzoli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712453206">Rosko et al., 2007</xref>). When examining how IRFs’ organizational structure would match with the environmental uncertainty produced by the 60 percent rule, we predict that IRFs belonging to large health care systems would exhibit a “misfit” with their environmental contingencies.</p>
<list id="list1-1077558712453206" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: IRFs that are members of large health care systems will exhibit worse operational performance following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement in comparison with IRFs that are not members of large health care systems.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Industry observers also acknowledge that hospitals willingly compromise autonomy by joining local systems in order to improve efficiencies and gain access to increased market power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712453206">Luke et al., 1995</xref>). Some IRFs belong to systems composed of numerous rehabilitation facilities, whereas others exist as the only IRF within their health care system. Rehabilitation hospitals serving as their system’s sole IRF may preserve a suitable degree of autonomy given their unique specialty focus within the system, enabling them to readily adapt to the environmental instability confronting rehabilitation providers. At the same time, system membership for these providers may produce benefits of improved efficiency and access to valuable resources in the midst of an uncertain environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712453206">Connor, Feldman, &amp; Dowd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712453206">Rosko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712453206">Rosko &amp; Proenca, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we predict that IRFs operating as the sole IRF within a health care system would exhibit a “fit” with their environmental contingencies in light of the 60 percent rule.</p>
<list id="list2-1077558712453206" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: IRFs that are the only IRF within their health care system will exhibit better operational performance following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement in comparison with IRFs that are independent or are members of health care systems with multiple IRFs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another principal argument of contingency theory is that organizations adopt strategies given dynamic environmental requirements, and these strategies affect performance according to their “fit” with different organizational characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712453206">Scott &amp; Davis, 2007</xref>). As shown in freestanding IRF responses to the introduction of the IRF PPS in 2002, rehabilitation providers have used strategies in previous instances of policy and reimbursement change to protect necessary sources of referral as well as to preserve expected levels of operation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712453206">Durkin et al. (2010)</xref> observed that, following the implementation of the IRF PPS, IRFs participating as members of multihospital health care systems enjoyed “streamlined access to patient referrals from other [acute care] facilities within their system” as well as enhanced relationships with key external stakeholders such as suppliers and physician groups due to their membership in an acute care hospital system (p. 165).</p>
<p>As the 60 percent rule’s revision and enforcement heightened uncertainty among IRFs regarding their ability to continue admitting a desired level of patients while meeting strict compliance threshold requirements, IRFs belonging to health care systems with acute care hospital members may have enjoyed better access to compliant patient referrals and stronger relationships with key external stakeholders in comparison with independent IRFs or IRFs belonging to health care systems without acute care facilities. We predict that rehabilitation hospitals belonging to health care systems with acute care hospital members would better “fit” the environmental contingencies resulting from the 60 percent rule.</p>
<list id="list3-1077558712453206" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: IRFs belonging to health care systems with acute care hospital members will exhibit better operational performance following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement in comparison with IRFs that are not members of health care systems with acute care hospitals.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>On a similar note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712453206">Durkin et al. (2010)</xref> observed that a group of IRFs converted underused or unused beds to other levels of care such as skilled nursing following the implementation of the IRF PPS. Converting a portion of rehabilitation beds to skilled nursing designation allowed facilities to avoid wasting organizational resources by attempting to minimize empty beds and offered IRFs the opportunity to efficiently discharge patients to their own skilled nursing units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712453206">Durkin et al., 2010</xref>). Following the 60 percent rule’s revision and enforcement, IRFs that struggled to maintain desired census levels would find benefit in designating underused rehabilitation beds as skilled nursing beds, allowing them to continue admitting “non-compliant” patients to their skilled nursing units, to preserve relationships with key referral sources, and to manage patients’ length-of-stay by “transitioning” higher acuity patients requiring continued postacute care within the facility from inpatient rehabilitation to skilled nursing care. In this sense, we predict that inpatient rehabilitation hospitals operating skilled nursing units would better “fit” the environmental contingencies resulting from the 60 percent rule.</p>
<list id="list4-1077558712453206" list-type="simple">

<p>Contingency theorists suggest that as organizations vary in their degree of “fit” between structure and dominant environmental characteristics, their performance will also vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712453206">Scott &amp; Davis, 2007</xref>). For this reason, the calculation of an organization’s composite fit between its structural and environmental contingencies is critical when empirically testing a conceptual model of organizational performance built on contingency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712453206">Donaldson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712453206">Drazin &amp; Van de Ven, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford, 2011</xref>). Within this study, previously mentioned characteristics of “fit” and “misfit” are combined to generate a cumulative measure of fit between an IRF’s structural characteristics and the environmental uncertainty produced from the 60 percent rule’s revision and enforcement. This cumulative measure of fit becomes the key variable in explaining IRF operational performance.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Given this study’s interest in evaluating operational performance among freestanding IRFs following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement, the DEA technique was selected to determine organizational efficiency as a measure of IRF operational performance. Since its introduction by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712453206">1978</xref>, DEA has been increasingly used in performance studies to compare efficiency among organizations and organizational units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill, Rauner, Heidenberger, &amp; Kraus, 2008</xref>). In addition, the recent emphasis on efficiency measurement in health care—as observed in the United States as well as Europe—has allowed for the increased promotion and spread of DEA studies examining hospital efficiency as well as efficiency in other health-related industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As a nonparametric technique, DEA evaluates the efficiency of specified decision-making units (DMUs) by comparing each DMU’s resources used (i.e., inputs) with its outcomes realized (i.e., outputs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712453206">Ozcan, 2008</xref>). Based on these calculations, DEA methods identify optimal efficiency frontiers that can be used for benchmarking purposes, thereby distinguishing DEA from other statistical methods that yield outcomes based on averages such as linear regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712453206">Ozcan, 2008</xref>). Although DEA methods are commonly applied to cross-sectional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712453206">Ozgen &amp; Ozcan, 2004</xref>), several techniques have been developed to support DEA across panel data. One such method is the Malmquist productivity index, which is “one of the most frequently used techniques to measure productivity changes over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>, p. 163).</p>
<p>As an extension of DEA methodology, the Malmquist Index was developed as a DEA performance measure through the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712453206">Caves, Christensen, and Diewert (1982)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712453206">Fare, Grosskopf, Lindgren, and Roos (1994)</xref>. Malmquist efficiency is calculated as the product of two components: the change in technical efficiency (also known as the “catching-up effect”) and the change in technology (also known as innovation). The efficiency change measures how units “catch-up” to the efficiency frontier from period <italic>t</italic> to period <italic>t</italic> + 1, and the technical change measures shifts in the production frontier or “best-practice technology” during the same time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712453206">Ozcan, 2008</xref>). Such production frontier shifts may be the result of various changes in clinical technologies, information- or system-based technologies, organizational structures, management systems, and populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712453206">Ozcan &amp; Luke, 2011</xref>). The following formula illustrates the calculation of the Malmquist Index as the product of efficiency change and technical change across time periods <italic>t</italic> to <italic>t</italic> + 1:</p>

<p>This study used the Malmquist Index to examine freestanding IRF performance before and after the revised 60 percent rule’s enforcement. A Malmquist Index was calculated for each IRF in the study sample, with scores greater than 1 indicating productivity progress, and scores less than 1 indicating a decline in productivity over the specified time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712453206">Cooper, Seiford, &amp; Tone, 2007</xref>). Averages of Malmquist Index scores for groups of freestanding IRFs were then determined, with IRF groups designated according to various organizational characteristics.</p>
<p>Linear regression methods were then used to test the study’s five hypotheses. Within this analysis, the IRFs’ Malmquist Index scores were converted using log transformations, allowing for a normal distribution of the regression’s dependent variable. Converted Malmquist indices were then regressed on independent and control variables to estimate organizational factors’ association with freestanding IRF operational performance. Concerns of multicollinearity were raised when all of the study’s independent variables (i.e., the fit measure groups and variables relating to fit measure components) were included in a single linear regression model. Evidence of multicollinearity also existed in a model that excluded the independent variables related to the fifth hypothesis (i.e., fit measure groups) but retained the independent variables relating to Hypotheses 1 through 4 (i.e., fit-score component groups). For this reason, our linear regression analysis includes five separate models testing each of the study’s five hypotheses while controlling for confounding factors. Wald tests were then performed to compare the equality of coefficients among the models’ categorical variables.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077558712453206">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>Annual data for freestanding IRFs from 2003 through 2008 were obtained from the American Hospital Association (AHA) hospital files. IRFs were identified within the AHA data based on their service code, with a total of 1,337 observations representing hospitals described primarily as inpatient rehabilitation service providers from 2003 to 2008. Hospitals that did not provide data for each year of the study time frame as well as IRFs that failed to provide care to Medicare patients were eliminated from the data set. As a result, the total number of observations was reduced to 888, comprising 148 IRFs across the 6-year period between 2003 and 2008 and representing approximately 68% of the 217 freestanding IRFs in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712453206">Thompson &amp; McCue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712453206">Tilson, 2006</xref>). County-level data were also obtained from the 2003 Area Resource File, providing important data pertaining to each IRF’s market population size.</p>

<title>Models and Variables</title>
<p>An input-oriented variable returns to scale model was adopted for the DEA and Malmquist Index calculations within the study. This decision was based on two reasons. First, we assume that a proportional change in inputs may yield a greater or smaller change in outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712453206">Ozcan, 2008</xref>). Second, although we recognize that hospital managers may use strategies to reduce inputs as well as augment outputs (e.g., marketing activities, referral systems, admissions practices, etc.), we assume that productivity improvement may be achieved in a relatively shorter period of time through initial input reductions. This assumption stems from industry observations that opportunities to adjust inputs affecting hospital performance are more readily available to health care managers than opportunities to directly control outputs themselves (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077558712453206">Ozcan &amp; Luke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712453206">Ozgen &amp; Ozcan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Five input measures were adopted in the study for Malmquist Index calculations: beds, RNs, LPNs, other personnel, and nonlabor expenses. The number of staffed beds is often included as an input variable in hospital DEA studies, commonly used as a proxy for a facility’s capital investments and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to beds, the number of staff—clinical as well as nonclinical—have often been included as inputs in hospital DEA studies and serve as a proxy for labor expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>). This study divided IRFs’ number of staff into the three input variables of “RNs,” “LPNs,” and “other personnel.” For each DMU, the number of other personnel was determined as the difference between total facility FTEs and the FTEs reported for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses in the AHA survey. The fifth input variable, nonlabor expenses, has been included in many hospital DEA studies among input sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>). For most of the DMUs, nonlabor expenses were calculated as the difference between total expenses and the combined total facility payroll expenses and employee benefits. However, for IRFs operating nursing home beds, nonlabor expenses were calculated as the difference between total rehabilitation hospital expenses and the combined total inpatient rehabilitation payroll expenses and employee benefits.</p>
<p>Three output measures were adopted in the study for Malmquist Index calculations: outpatient visits, Medicare patient days, and non-Medicare patient days. Outpatient visits is an output variable commonly found in the majority of hospital DEA studies, and inpatient activity is preferably measured using DRG-adjusted discharges in U.S. hospital DEA studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>). However, because of a lack of available data or IRF case-mix indices as well as a lack of reported non-Medicare discharges or total facility discharges in the AHA survey, case-mix adjusted discharges were not included as an output measure in this study. In the absence of such information, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712453206">O’Neill et al. (2008)</xref> suggest that patient days disaggregated by payment types (i.e., Medicare and non-Medicare patients) helps capture case-mix differences across DMUs. In our study, non-Medicare inpatient days were calculated as the difference between DMUs’ reported total inpatient days and Medicare inpatient days.</p>
<p>In addition to the input and output measures included in the Malmquist Index calculation, numerous independent variables are included in this study and used in the linear regression models. The first three hypotheses developed from the study’s conceptual framework pertain to IRFs’ system membership. Information from the AHA data set was used to categorize each DMU’s system membership status (i.e., system member or independent facility), and the size of the system to which an IRF belonged was determined according to the number of hospitals and long-term care facilities owned by the system, using the system size categories of “national” systems (with 25 or more facilities), “regional” systems (with less than 25 facilities), and “independent” IRFs not belonging to a health care system. To test the second hypothesis, the number of IRFs in the system to which each DMU belonged was identified, with system IRF categories including 1 system IRF, 2 to 10 IRFs, more than 10 IRFs, and independent IRFs not belonging to a health care system. To test the study’s third hypothesis, DMUs’ systems were categorized as either “diverse” (including acute care hospital members as well as postacute care facilities), “postacute” (solely operating postacute care facilities), or “independent” (IRFs not belonging to a health care system). Information to test the study’s fourth hypothesis was also gathered from AHA data. IRFs that operated skilled nursing beds during the study’s 6-year period were assigned to an “SNF beds” dummy variable, with IRFs not operating skilled nursing beds serving as a reference group.</p>
<p>The fifth hypothesis directly tests contingency theory’s proposal that organizational performance depends on an organization’s degree of fit between its structure and its environment. Using methods adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford’s (2011)</xref> study of rural hospital performance and system affiliations, this study creates a composite measure of organizational fit based on the contingent relationships described in Hypotheses 1 through 4. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford (2011)</xref> created a composite measure of organizational fit by adding together contingent relationships in which an organization displayed “misfit,” our study both adds together contingencies that are predicted to provide “fit” and subtracts contingencies that are predicted to provide “misfit.” Therefore, facilities gained 1 “fit” score for each of the following characteristics: operation as the sole IRF member within a health care system, membership in a health care system with acute care hospitals, and operation of skilled nursing beds within the facility. Facilities subtracted 1 “misfit” score for membership in a national health care system (defined as 25 or more hospitals and long-term care facilities). With four possible contingent relationships predicting “fit” or “misfit,” facilities’ composite fit scores could range from a minimum score of −1 (indicating the lowest degree of “fit”) to a maximum score of 3 (indicating the highest degree of “fit”). IRFs were then grouped into three “fit” categories based on their composite fit scores: the “low-fit” group included 65 facilities with a composite fit score of −1, the “medium-fit” group included 48 facilities with composite fit scores of 0 or 1, and the “high-fit” group included 35 facilities with composite fit scores of 2 or 3.</p>
<p>An important number of control variables were also incorporated into the study. Past studies acknowledge the proven importance of ownership status for hospitals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712453206">Durkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712453206">Thompson &amp; McCue, 2010</xref>), and in light of this, IRFs were assigned to one of three ownership groups: for-profit, government-owned, or not-for-profit facilities. Recognizing reports that CMS found 75 percent rule compliance to significantly vary by region prior to its revision and enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712453206">Tilson, 2006</xref>), regional location is also a valuable control variable. IRF location was categorized as a dummy variable based on each facility’s reported region in the AHA survey: West, South, Northeast, or Midwest. Local market size is also an important and commonly used control variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712453206">Durkin et al., 2010</xref>), and Area Resource File data from 2003 were used to generate variables for county population. Population categories included less than 200,000 residents, between 200,000 and 499,999 residents, between 500,000 and 1 million residents, and greater than 1 million residents. Descriptive statistics of these control variables as well as each of the previously described independent variables are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712453206">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that we sought to control for ownership by the HealthSouth Corporation given its dominance in the freestanding IRF market and its reorganization in the wake of corporate fraud that overlapped the 60 percent rule’s revision and enforcement. HealthSouth operated 275 IRFs in 2004 (including 93 freestanding IRFs), representing more than 40% of the nation’s freestanding IRFs and nearly a quarter of the entire IRF population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712453206">McCue &amp; Thompson, 2010</xref>). In 2003, the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged HealthSouth for fraudulent behavior, resulting in severe fines as well as a reorganization of the company and its leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712453206">McCue &amp; Thompson, 2010</xref>). As a part of its reorganization, HealthSouth’s new leaders implemented a new organizational direction which focused on its postacute care services and sought to realize greater operating efficiencies in staffing, supply chain management, and technology utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712453206">McCue &amp; Thompson, 2010</xref>). These strategic changes coincided with the revision and initial enforcement of the 60 percent rule, presenting factors unique to HealthSouth facilities during the study’s time period. However, during our preliminary analysis of the data, we identified evidence of multicollinearity when including HealthSouth ownership as a control within the linear regression models. For this reason, we excluded HealthSouth ownership as a control in the linear regression analysis.</p>

<p>The results of the variable returns to scale model Malmquist Index calculations indicate an average decline in freestanding IRF performance from 2003 to 2008. The average Malmquist Index score among freestanding IRFs was 0.956, with an average efficiency component score of 1.002 and an average technical component score of 0.962. Overall, a total of 52 IRFs exhibited improved performance during the study’s 6-year time period, representing approximately 35% of the study’s sample. The remaining 96 facilities, or 64.9% of the study sample, exhibited a decline in performance between 2003 and 2008. Malmquist Index scores ranged from a minimum of 0.340 to a maximum of 2.732, with a standard deviation of 0.373 and a median score of 0.91.</p>

<p>During the 6-year period before and after the 60 percent rule’s enforcement, IRF performance measures varied across important characteristics within the IRF sample. Focusing on unadjusted means of Malmquist Index scores among IRFs grouped according to fit-score component characteristics, we observe that IRFs owned by systems that are smaller or “regional” in size, that operate only one IRF, or that operate acute care facilities all exhibited average Malmquist Index scores indicating an increase in overall performance during the study’s time period. Furthermore, IRFs earning high composite “fit” scores (2 or 3 points) displayed average Malmquist Index scores indicative of improved operational performance from 2003 to 2008. In contrast, the lowest average Malmquist Index scores were identified among IRFs owned by systems that are larger or “national” in size, that operate more than one IRF, or that solely operate postacute care facilities. In addition, IRFs earning low composite “fit” scores (−1 point) displayed the lowest average Malmquist Index scores in comparison with IRFs in other “fit” groups.</p>
<p>Using the log transformations of the Malmquist Index scores as the dependent variable, each of the study’s five hypotheses were tested by separate linear regression models. The converted Malmquist indices ranged in values from a minimum of −1.080 to a maximum of 1.005, with an average of −0.110, a median score of −0.095, and a standard deviation of 0.356. Log-transformed Malmquist Index scores less than 0 indicate performance regress, and scores greater than 0 indicate performance progress. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712453206">Table 3</xref> provides the results of the linear regression analysis.</p>

<p>Linear regression results for Model 1 indicate that, when controlling for confounding factors, differences in operational performance between the reference category of independent IRFs and facilities owned by either regional systems or national systems were not statistically significant. However, according to Wald test results, IRFs owned by large, national systems were associated with significantly poorer performance in comparison with IRFs operated by regional systems during the study’s 6-year period (<italic>p</italic> = .010). This finding partially supports Hypothesis 1.</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis, anticipating better operational performance among system-owned IRFs that operated as the sole IRF within their system, was supported by linear regression (Model 2) and Wald test results. In comparison with independent facilities, IRFs operating as the sole IRF within their system exhibited significantly better performance when controlling for confounding factors. In addition, Wald test results suggest IRFs operating as the sole IRF within their system exhibited significantly better performance than IRFs owned by systems with 2 to 10 IRFs (<italic>p</italic> = .013) as well as IRFs owned by systems with more than 10 IRFs (<italic>p</italic> = .014).</p>
<p>With regard to Hypothesis 3, differences in performance scores between independent IRFs and IRFs owned by systems with acute care hospital members were not shown to be statistically significant. However, Wald test results reveal that IRFs owned by “diverse” systems operating both acute care and postacute care facilities were associated with significantly better operational performance in comparison with IRFs owned by “postacute” systems solely operating postacute care facilities (<italic>p</italic> = .002). These findings are partially supportive of the study’s third hypothesis.</p>
<p>The study’s fourth hypothesis did not generate support according to the linear regression results found in Model 4. When controlling for confounding factors, IRFs operating skilled nursing beds were not shown to perform at significantly different levels than IRFs without skilled nursing beds.</p>
<p>The linear regression results in Model 5 test the association between operational performance and IRFs’ degree of fit, the key independent variable of the theoretical framework. When controlling for confounding factors, IRFs with a high composite “fit” score (2 or 3 points) were associated with significantly higher performance scores in comparison with facilities with a low composite “fit” score (−1 point). Similarly, IRFs with a medium composite “fit” score (0 or 1 point) were also associated with higher performance scores at statistically significant levels when compared with the low-fit reference group. However, the Wald test results revealed that the coefficient found in Model 5 for IRFs with high composite “fit” scores was not significantly different from the coefficient obtained for IRFs with medium composite “fit” scores. These findings partially support Hypothesis 5.</p>
<p>Among regional groups, freestanding IRFs located in the Northeast and South regions were consistently associated with significantly lower performance scores than the reference group of IRFs located in the West region across the five linear regression models. However, performance differences between IRFs in the West region and those in the Midwest regions were not shown to be statistically significant. Ownership status was inconsistently identified as a significant factor in identifying performance differences: In Model 4, not-for-profit IRFs were associated with higher performance scores in comparison with for-profit IRFs, and in Model 5, government-owned IRFs were associated with lower performance scores in comparison with for-profit IRFs. However, comparisons between ownership groups in the remaining models were not shown to be significantly different. Market size was not a statistically significant predictor of operational performance among this study’s freestanding IRFs, and Wald test results did not identify significant differences in the remaining cross-category comparisons among regional, ownership, or market size groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Applying Malmquist Index methods to a sample of freestanding IRFs from 2003 to 2008, this study found that operational performance, as measured by the Malmquist Index, decreased on average for freestanding IRFs following the enforcement of the 60 percent rule. However, in contrast to the average decline in performance among freestanding IRFs during the study’s time period, a few structural characteristics were found to be associated with the minority of freestanding IRFs that improved performance following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement.</p>
<p>Overall, the concept of fit, which is a central construct of contingency theory, is supported in this study. Freestanding IRFs that were measured to have a better “fit” between their organizational structure and the environmental uncertainty generated from the 60 percent rule were associated with higher performance scores in comparison with IRFs with low degrees of “fit,” as previously predicted.</p>
<p>This study found no statistically significant difference in operational performance between system-owned freestanding IRFs and independent freestanding IRFs in general, supporting previous assertions that system membership is not a universally beneficial or detrimental trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712453206">Bazzoli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712453206">Halpern et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712453206">Rosko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712453206">Rosko &amp; Proenca, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford, 2011</xref>). However, differences within systems appeared to be associated with differences in IRF operational performance, including system size, system ownership of multiple IRFs, and system ownership of acute care facilities.</p>
<p>The association found between a system’s operation of acute care facilities and freestanding IRF performance may be indicative of advantages IRFs enjoy when they maintain close connections to acute care facilities, which IRFs depend on for referrals. Similarly, the association between performance and system ownership of a single IRF may be indicative of an ideal fit such facilities enjoy between the resources offered through system membership and a suitable level of autonomy to react and adapt quickly to environmental change.</p>
<p>Furthermore, IRFs owned by large, national systems were associated with poor performance following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement in comparison with IRFs owned by smaller, regional systems. This finding may be indicative of the enhanced complexity and limited flexibility associated with large organizational structures. Previous literature has identified a close relationship between large organizational size and both centralized and formalized organizational structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077558712453206">Miller &amp; Droge, 1986</xref>), and contingency theorists argue that such structures poorly fit unstable environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712453206">Donaldson, 2001</xref>). In addition, studies evaluating the association between system centralization and hospital performance have found moderately centralized facilities to exhibit better performance and efficiency in comparison with highly centralized firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712453206">Bazzoli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712453206">Rosko et al., 2007</xref>). Recognizing that a wide range of characteristics may affect the performance of system-member hospitals, these results may be in line with previously supported arguments that high degrees of centralization and formalization restrict organizations’ autonomy and ability to readily adapt to change.</p>
<p>However, our decision to test the five hypotheses in separate models given the multicollinearity observed among the study’s independent variables impedes our ability to control for these various structural characteristics simultaneously. As a result, we are prevented from conclusively identifying which structures truly determine freestanding IRFs’ operational performance, and we must caution against rash assumptions that the specific structural characteristics tested in this study are definitively responsible for this study’s findings. This is an important limitation to consider.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize several additional limitations presented within this study. Because of the limitations of the AHA data set, the study was unable to identify and separate operational data for inpatient rehabilitation units operating within acute care facilities from 2003 to 2008, as previously noted. This is an important limitation given the significant role hospital-based inpatient rehabilitation units play within the inpatient rehabilitation sector, comprising roughly 80% of the nation’s IRFs, supplying approximately 62% of the nation’s inpatient rehabilitation beds, and representing nearly 58% of Medicare IRF discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712453206">Aguiar &amp; Lisk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712453206">MedPAC, 2011</xref>). Hospital-based inpatient rehabilitation units exhibit some noticeable differences in comparison with freestanding IRFs: For example, in 2008, hospital-based units had lower occupancy rates (59.8% vs. 66.1%) and lower Medicare margins (4.1% vs. 18.2%) than freestanding facilities, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712453206">Aguiar &amp; Lisk, 2011</xref>). Given such differences, it would be of interest to examine whether the 60 percent rule’s impact was felt equally between the two types of inpatient rehabilitation providers. A comparison between freestanding IRF performance and the performance of inpatient rehabilitation units would also be of interest given the connection that such units maintain with acute care facilities as their “landlord” and potential referral source. The inability to examine performance across inpatient rehabilitation units limits the generalizability of this study’s findings to freestanding IRFs and prevents the study from incorporating a larger sample size.</p>
<p>AHA data set limits also prevented the inclusion of a service mix index as an input variable and case-mix adjusted discharges as an output variable, which are ideal within DEA studies and help account for variation in the type of care offered by IRFs as well as the types of patients they serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712453206">Ozcan, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of the measurement of fit scores to test the study’s fifth hypothesis, we echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712453206">Swofford’s (2011)</xref> sentiments regarding the difficulty and crudeness of measuring fit. Our determination of organizational fit did not identify an iso-performance line, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712453206">Donaldson (2001)</xref>, given our categorical rather than continuous measurement of fit, and we concede that additional environmental contingencies and structural characteristics beyond the scope of this study may have affected individual IRFs’ level of fit, thereby influencing their performance.</p>
<p>As previously noted, this study’s time period coincides with the revision and enforcement of the 60 percent rule as well as the reorganization of the HealthSouth Corporation. Despite the inclusion of 63 HealthSouth facilities within our sample, concerns of multicollinearity prevented us from controlling for HealthSouth ownership in our linear regression models. It is also important to consider that our study period coincides with the adoption and stringent enforcement of medical necessity criteria for IRF admissions among certain fiscal intermediaries across the country, potentially contributing to the uncertain environment faced by rehabilitation providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712453206">Pezzin et al., 2011</xref>). As a result, causal inferences are reserved, and conclusions that these findings can be solely attributed to the 60 percent rule are premature.</p>
<p>Finally, though this study presents findings regarding freestanding IRF operational performance following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement, questions remain pertaining to the policy’s impact on IRF effectiveness and patient access to appropriate postacute care. Future studies are needed to examine the 60 percent rule’s effects not only on IRF operational performance and efficiency but also on the quality, satisfaction, effectiveness, and equity of inpatient rehabilitation and other postacute care services.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that the majority of IRFs realized a decline in performance in the years following the 60 percent rule’s enforcement, particularly among providers with structural characteristics that did not fit the pervasive environmental uncertainty. Such results may support previously expressed fears within the rehabilitation sector that the 60 percent rule was too blunt an instrument to direct postacute care services. As legislators and industry observers anticipate future waves of health care policy changes, including proposed bundled payments within the postacute care sector, these findings highlight the need for careful consideration of the potential effects of health care legislation on providers’ abilities to maintain efficient and productive practices. For example, as recently as September 2011, President Obama proposed revisiting the 60 percent rule to return its compliance threshold to 75%. In response, leaders throughout the inpatient rehabilitation sector have warned of the potentially devastating consequences that an increase in the compliance threshold would have on IRFs across the country. Jay Grinney, CEO of HealthSouth, warned that a return to the 75% compliance threshold would cost providers substantially and force the nation’s largest rehabilitation system to close a number of its facilities, reducing the availability of rehabilitation beds in certain markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712453206">Eisenberg, 2011</xref>). The results of this study also highlight the potential consequences that such a raise in the compliance threshold might have on IRF operational performance.</p>
