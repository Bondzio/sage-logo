<abstract>
<p>Coal to liquid fuel has the potential to substitute the petroleum fuels due to the huge reserves of coal in the earth, the development of direct coal liquefaction technology and the application of carbon dioxide capture and storage technology. The effect of coal to liquid fuel on the combustion and emission has been investigated experimentally in a heavy-duty diesel engine. The experimental results showed that compared to diesel, the coal to liquid fuel had obviously longer ignition delay but slightly later CA50, and the higher premixed combustion ratio and maximum rate of heat release; it had the benefit in soot reduction but slightly higher HC, CO and NO<italic><sub>x</sub></italic> emissions. The brake specific fuel consumption of coal to liquid fuel was slightly higher than that of diesel, while the brake fuel conversion efficiency of coal to liquid fuel was slightly lower than that of diesel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the trade-off of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>–soot emissions in diesel engines has been improved by coal to liquid fuel, due to the predominant evaporation rate, virtually free from sulfur and aromatics, and the longer ignition delay.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the increasing consumption of crude oil, the world is presently confronted with the crisis of crude oil depletion and the increase in its production cost. The currently known reserves of coal exceed those of crude oil by a factor of 25.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012454617">1</xref></sup> It is a feasible solution to the energy crisis by making full use of the coal resources by using them as an alternative to petroleum. Coal to liquid (CTL) technology is one of the most reasonable approaches for alternative liquid fuels, having already been technically and commercially established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012454617">2</xref></sup> It includes direct coal liquefaction (DCL) and indirect coal liquefaction (ICL) technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012454617">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012454617"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012454617"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012454617"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012454617">7</xref></sup> DCL technology converts solid coal (H/C ratio ≈ 0.8) to liquid fuels (H/C ratio ≈ 2) by adding hydrogen at high temperature and pressure with the aid of a catalyst, which aims to break down the complex coal structure into smaller component molecules. ICL technology firstly transforms solid coal into a synthesis gas via coal gasification, which is then converted into liquid fuel by the Fischer–Tropsch process. DCL technology has a thermal efficiency of 65–70%, which is a significant advantage over that of ICL technology (about 55%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012454617">8</xref></sup> Compared with conventional diesel fuel, the CTL fuel has a cost advantage, especially when the crude oil price rises continuously, and there are likely to be a lot of byproducts from the DCL process. Additionally it can alleviate the burden of the DPF (diesel particulate filter) because particulate matter (PM) emissions of the CTL fuel are less than from diesel fuel. However, the DCL process emits more greenhouse gases without carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology, which may limit the application of the CTL fuel. Combined with the CCS technology, the future DCL technology can accomplish near-zero emission of carbon dioxide. Thus, DCL technology can play an important leading role in changing the traditional coal consumption structure and improving the coal utilization efficiency as well as in environmental protection. The properties and distillation temperatures of diesel and CTL fuel are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012454617">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012454617">Figure 1</xref>. Compared with diesel, CTL fuel has the lower cetane number and distillation temperature, except for the initial boiling point (IBP), which is beneficial for homogeneous mixture formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012454617">9</xref></sup> and the lower contents of sulfur and aromatics, which is beneficial for decreasing the soot emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012454617">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407012454617">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>The diesel engine has been most widely used to power modern transportation vehicles, due to its high combustion efficiency, good fuel economy, high reliability, high durability and low carbon dioxide emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012454617">12</xref></sup> However, in the combustion products from diesel engines, there are oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) and soot, which have adverse effects on the environment and human health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012454617">13</xref></sup> Moreover, automotive pollutants are a major source of atmosphere pollution due to the rapid increase in the number of vehicles. With the increasingly stringent emission regulation, using alternative fuel to reduce emissions has attracted more attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012454617">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012454617">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the rapid development of DCL technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012454617">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407012454617">17</xref></sup> and the increasing consumption of petroleum fuels for transportation, it is imperative to widely apply CTL fuel to substitute petroleum fuels. Furthermore, the lower contents of sulfur and aromatics are beneficial to settling the trade-off relationship between NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407012454617">18</xref></sup> However, there is almost no investigation on the effect of CTL fuel on the combustion and emission of a diesel engine. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of CTL fuel on combustion and emission in a heavy-duty diesel engine, because the wide application of CTL fuel to diesel engines will not only help to settle the problem of the crude oil depletion but also reduce the emissions of heavy-duty diesel engines.</p>

<p>The original test engine was operated with standard diesel fuel which is available in petrol stations in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). No modification was made to the diesel engine when it was fueled with CTL fuel, which was yielded through DCL technology. The properties of the CTL fuel and diesel are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012454617">Table 1</xref>. Although the high sulphur content in the diesel fuel significantly increases the particulate matter emissions, it has little effect on the soot measured. In order to clean the fuel system, the diesel engine was allowed to operate with CTL fuel for 30 minutes after the diesel fuel was replaced by CTL fuel. The fuel consumption was measured by an AVL 735 fuel flow meter. The mass flow rate of intake fresh air was measured by using an ABB SENSYFLOW P air mass flow meter, and the intake air temperature was controlled by an inter-cooler to 45 ±1°C Fuel injection parameters, including injection pressure and injection timing, were controlled by a programmable electronic control unit (ECU).</p>
<p>Soot emissions were measured with an AVL 415S smoke meter, while NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, CO and HC emissions of the exhaust gas were measured with a HORIBA MEXA-7100 gas analyser. A crank angle encoder was employed for the crank angle signal acquisition at a rate of 3600 signals per engine revolution. An AVL 641 combustion analyser can, in real time, show the in-cylinder pressures versus the crank angle, which were acquired by a flush-mounted AVL GH12P pressure transducer in cylinder 1, the data saved into a computer for convenient management.</p>
<p>The experiments were conducted at the operating conditions of 1000 r/min, 275 N.m with various fuel injection timings, injection pressures and EGR. In order to ensure the repeatability and comparability of the measurements, the cooling water temperature was automatically controlled by a temperature controller to 85°C, and held to within ±2°C, while the lubricating oil temperature varied from 90 to 95°C, depending on the engine load. Data were recorded after the engine had reached a steady state, as indicated by the cooling water temperature and the lubricating oil temperature. Moreover, each test was repeated twice to ensure that the results were repeatable within the experimental uncertainties. The standard errors are 3.2 ppm, 0.0011 FSN, 1.6 ppm, 1.8 ppm and 1.3 g/kw.h for NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, smoke, HC, CO and BSFC, respectively.</p>

<title>Effect of CTL fuel on combustion</title>
<p>The measured in-cylinder pressures and calculated rates of heat release of the test engine fueled with CTL fuel and diesel, respectively, averaged over 50 cycles, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454617">Figure 3</xref>. The rate of heat release was calculated through the zero-dimensional thermodynamic model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012454617">Figure 4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012454617">(b)</xref> shows the ignition delay as a function of injection timing and injection pressure, respectively, for CTL fuel and diesel. The ignition delay was defined as the time between the start of fuel injection (SOFI) and the start of combustion (SOC), and the SOFI was determined by the start of the drive current signal plus the lag time of the needle lift, and the SOC was determined by the crank angle corresponding to 10% cumulative rate of heat release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407012454617">19</xref></sup> The ignition delay depends on the physical process, the chemical process, local in-cylinder pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012454617">Figure 4</xref>, the ignition delay of CTL fuel was greater than that of diesel under the same injection conditions. For the CTL fuel and diesel, the same test engine was used with almost the same intake air temperature and injection parameters. Additionally, the lower distillation temperature of CTL fuel than of diesel is beneficial to fuel–air mixing, which may shorten the ignition delay. Thus, the main reason for this result is probably attributed to the different cetane numbers (41.2 for CTL fuel and 47.6 for diesel) as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012454617">Table 1</xref>. This is in good agreement with the previous research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012454617">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407012454617">21</xref></sup></p>

<p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454617">Figure 3</xref>, the combustion of CTL fuel occurred later than diesel under the same injection conditions, especially the injection timing of 4 CAD ATDC in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454617">Figure 3(a)</xref> and injection pressure of 60 MPa in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012454617">Figure 3(b)</xref>. Additionally, the maximum rate of heat release of the CTL fuel was higher than that of diesel. The reasons for this is due to the different chemical characteristics of CTL fuel and diesel. Compared with diesel, the CTL fuel has a lower cetane number, lower content of aromatics and lower distillation temperature. It is widely acknowledged that the lower cetane number can result in a longer ignition delay. Aromatics are known to have higher latent heats of vaporization than alkane,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407012454617">22</xref></sup> which indicates that the CTL fuel can be evaporated more easily than diesel. The lower distillation temperature can improve the evaporation characteristics, which can enhance the fuel–air mixing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407012454617">23</xref></sup> All these factors are beneficial to the formation and homogeneity of the mixture, which can improve the premixed combustion ratio. In the present study, the premixed combustion ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012454617">20</xref></sup> is defined as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012454617">Figure 5</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012454617">Figure 6</xref>, the premixed combustion ratio of CTL fuel was greater than that of diesel.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the effect of CTL fuel on the combustion process, the CA50 was defined as the crank angle corresponding to the 50% cumulative rate of heat release. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012454617">Figure 4</xref>, the CA50 moved further away from TDC for both the CTL fuel and diesel with the increase of injection timing, while it moved nearer to TDC for both the CTL fuel and diesel with the increase of injection pressure. Moreover, the CA50 for CTL fuel occurred slightly later than that for diesel due to the longer ignition delay of CTL than that of diesel. However, the difference in the CA50 between CTL fuel and diesel did not augment the increased disparity of ignition delay between CTL fuel and diesel when the injection timing was retarded from −4 to 4 CAD ATDC, because the higher premixed combustion ratio of CTL fuel compared to that of diesel advanced the CA50.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012454617">Figure 7</xref>, the maximum in-cylinder pressures of CTL fuel with different injection timings (except injection timing of −2 CAD ATDC) and injection pressures were higher than those of diesel. The maximum in-cylinder pressure is mainly determined by the rate of heat release, the heat loss and the piston position. When the injection timing was at −2 CAD ATDC, the ignition delay of CTL fuel and diesel was 6.6 CAD and 6.2 CAD, respectively; when the combustion occurred, the piston position of diesel stayed nearer to TDC than for CTL fuel. At this point, the piston position may play a dominant role in the maximum in-cylinder pressure. Additionally, when the injection timing was retarded from −4 to 4 CAD ATDC, the maximum in-cylinder pressure decreased for both CTL fuel and diesel. This was because the combustion occurred farther from TDC when the injection timing was retarded. Moreover, the maximum in-cylinder pressure increased for both CTL fuel and diesel with the increase in injection pressure, because the combustion occurred nearer to TDC when the injection pressure was raised.</p>

<title>Effect of CTL fuel on emissions</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454617">Figure 8(a)</xref>, with the increase of injection timing, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions for both CTL fuel and diesel decreased due to the decrease of the maximum in-cylinder pressure, and the soot emissions for both CTL fuel and diesel decreased due to the increase of premixed combustion ratio. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012454617">Figure 8b</xref>, with the increase of injection pressure, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions for both CTL fuel and diesel increased due to the increase of the maximum in-cylinder pressure, and the soot emission for diesel decreased due the increase of premixed combustion ratio, while the soot emissions for CTL fuel was basically unchanged. Thus, the injection timing can be used as an important control strategy to improve the trade-off relationship of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions in the compression ignition diesel engine. Additionally, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions of CTL fuel were basically higher than those of diesel, except at the injection timing of −4 and −2 CAD ATDC, due to the higher maximum in-cylinder pressures of CTL fuel than of diesel. The soot emissions of CTL fuel were always lower than those of diesel due to the higher premixed combustion ratio. This illustrates that the CTL fuel has the potential to improve the trade-off relationship between NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions due to the higher vaporization rate and longer ignition delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407012454617">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954407012454617">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454617">Figure 9(a)</xref>, when the injection timing was retarded from −4 to 2 CAD ATDC, there was no obvious variation of the HC and CO emissions for diesel. Moreover, when the injection timing was further retarded from 2 to 4 CAD ATDC, the HC and CO emissions for diesel increased slightly. However, the HC and CO emissions for CTL fuel were more sensitive to the injection timing compared to those for diesel. When the injection timing was retarded from −4 to 2 CAD ATDC, they increased slightly; when the injection timing was further retarded from 2 to 4 CAD ATDC, they increased significantly. It is because there is incomplete combustion resulting from the locally over-lean mixture due to the longer ignition delay when the injection timing was further retarded. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012454617">Figure 9b</xref> shows that the HC emissions decreased slightly and the CO emissions remained unchanged for both CTL fuel and diesel with an increase of injection pressure. Additionally, at the same injection condition, the HC and CO emissions of CTL fuel were higher than those of diesel, especially at further retarded injection timing (i.e. injection timing of 4 CAD ATDC). The main reason for this is that the CTL fuel tended to form a locally over-lean mixture due to the higher vaporization rate and longer ignition delay, which resulted in the incomplete combustion in some parts of the cylinder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012454617">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Effect of CTL fuel on brake specific fuel consumption and brake fuel conversion efficiency</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454617">Figure 10(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012454617">(b)</xref> shows the comparison between the CTL fuel and diesel in terms of the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) and brake fuel conversion efficiency (BFCE) with an increase of injection timing and injection pressure, respectively. BFCE can be used to assess how efficiently the energy in the fuel is converted to mechanical output. The BSFC of CTL fuel and diesel firstly decreased and then increased with the increased injection timing, while the BFCE of CTL fuel and diesel firstly increased and then decreased with the increased injection timing. It is because the SOC of the fuel–air mixture before TDC resulted in the negative work done on the piston, and the SOC of the fuel–air mixture further after TDC resulted in the loss of partial energy used to generate power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954407012454617">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954407012454617">27</xref></sup> The BSFC for both CTL fuel and diesel increased with the increase of injection pressure, while the BFCE for both CTL fuel and diesel decreased with the increase of injection pressure. Additionally, at the same injection condition, the BSFC of CTL fuel was slightly higher than that of diesel, while the BFCE of CTL fuel was slightly lower than that of diesel. This is because the heat loss of CTL fuel was higher than that of diesel due to the drastic heat release during premixed combustion duration. Another possible reason for this is that the prolonged diffusion combustion of diesel provided more work to the piston during the expansion stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954407012454617">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>The improved NO<sub>x</sub>–soot trade-off relationship</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012454617">Figure 11</xref> depicts the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>–soot emissions comparison between CTL fuel and diesel with various EGR (exhaust gas recirculation). The fuel injection pressure and timing were 120 MPa and 2 CAD ATDC respectively. The amount of EGR was calculated from the measured CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the exhaust and intake systems. An obvious trade-off relationship of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>–soot emissions existed when the engine was fueled with diesel, while it was basically settled when fueled with CTL fuel. This can be explained in several ways. Firstly, CTL fuel has a lower cetane number as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407012454617">Table 1</xref>. William et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954407012454617">29</xref></sup> demonstrated that lower fuel cetane number can improve the trade-off relationship of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>–soot emissions across the engine operating loads. Additionally, the distillation temperature, except the initial boiling point, of CTL is lower than that of diesel, which can enhance the fuel–air mixing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407012454617">24</xref></sup> Moreover, the content of aromatics is significantly lower than diesel, contributing to the decrease of soot emissions, because the aromatics are considered as precursors of soot production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954407012454617">30</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The effect of CTL fuel on combustion and emission has been investigated in a heavy-duty diesel engine. And the main conclusions are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0954407012454617" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>With the same injection timing and pressure, the ignition delay of CTL fuel is obviously longer than that of diesel, while the CA50 of CTL fuel is slightly later than that of diesel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The combustion of CTL fuel shows the higher premixed combustion ratio and maximum rate of heat release compared to that of diesel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The CTL fuel has the benefit in soot reduction compared to diesel. However, the HC, CO and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions of CTL fuel are higher than those of diesel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The BSFC of CTL fuel is slightly higher than that of diesel, while the BFCE of CTL fuel is slightly lower than that of diesel. Moreover, this will be improved when the load of the diesel engine increases due to the reduction of locally over-lean fuel–air mixture.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The trade-off of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>–soot emissions in diesel engine has been improved by CTL fuel, due to the predominant evaporation rate, virtually free from sulfur and aromatics, and the longer ignition delay of CTL fuel compared to diesel.</p></list-item>
