<p>This edited volume contains eleven chapters, including the editors’ introductory and concluding chapters, on employer branding. This is an important effort because of the widespread use of branding strategies among today’s organizations. The organizations studied are large and small, private and nonprofit, and span multiple industries; the occupations analyzed include front-line service workers, warehouse workers, professional employees, and managers. The editors and authors are therefore to be commended for their work in opening up this new space both theoretically and qualitatively.</p>
<p>The book opens with the claim that “this volume explores the experience of employer branding, a very concrete and specific employment practice, that has become increasingly popular in recent times” (p. 1). After reading this volume, I think this opening claim is only partially correct. Many of the chapters focus on case studies, and the depth and diversity of these cases certainly delivers a rich exploration of the experience of employer branding while also demonstrating the popularity of employer branding in practice. More problematic is the claim that employer branding is “a very concrete and specific employment practice.” In my view, an important contribution of this volume is a demonstration of the opposite—that is, employer branding is a diverse and somewhat amorphous practice. Some of the chapters highlight organizational communication practices, others human resource management policies, and at least one highlights the importance of physical space. This multidimensional approach to branding is a stimulating aspect of this volume. At the same time, however, the authors tend to take differing approaches to conceptualizing branding, and this leaves the reader, or at least this reader, with a muddied sense of what employer branding is and how it differs from employee branding (another term used in multiple places) and from efforts to create organizational culture more generally.</p>
<p>Based on the volume’s subtitle, I was also expecting a deeper treatment of the types of meanings that employees experience in their work, but this was not a consistent theme in the volume. Rather, the volume is more successful in portraying the multiple ways in which organizations attempt to achieve employer and employee branding and the ways in which organizations are seemingly never able to be completely successful in these pursuits due to employee agency and resistance.</p>
<p>The chapters are theoretically informed and generally employ a critical frame of reference that makes the overall tone of the volume skeptical about the motives, aims, and outcomes of organizations’ branding efforts. This critical approach is important. As just one example, chapter 10 cautions that strategies to create a uniform brand with a unitary set of values and beliefs can contradict the respect for individual differences that should be a part of efforts to promote diversity. Readers who are looking for this type of critical theoretical and methodological approach will likely find many important insights in this volume. Other perspectives, however, are not as well represented.</p>
<p>This volume successfully demonstrates that there are many situations in which “the values, vision and culture of organizations become the core of their unique selling proposition,” and in such situations, “the role played by employees shifts dramatically from providers/sellers of labour to carriers or intermediaries of such corporate values and visions” (p. 193). More importantly, this volume richly develops the resulting implications for the lived experiences of workers and provides the foundation for future research on this phenomenon.</p>
