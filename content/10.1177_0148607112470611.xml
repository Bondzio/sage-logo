<title>✶Vars Research Award Candidate, ✰Abstract of Distinction 1512856—A Probiotic and Butyrate Protect the Intestine During Antibiotic Therapy</title>
<p>G. Cresci<sup>1,2</sup>; L. Nagy<sup>1,2</sup></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Gastroenterology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA; <sup>2</sup>Pathobiology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Antibiotic therapy negatively alters the gut microbiota. Certain probiotics (eg, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> GG [LGG]) are promising in decreasing the duration and severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), but the mechanism remains unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate, are believed responsible for the beneficial effects of gut microbiota on gut health. Ileal and colonic gene expression is altered markedly in germ-free (GF) mice compared with conventional mice. We hypothesized that alterations in gut microbiota by antibiotics reduce butyrate production–altering genes involved with gut barrier integrity and water and electrolyte absorption, lending to AAD. Our aim was to determine the effects of butyrate and/or probiotics provided during antibiotic therapy on genes and proteins involved with gut integrity and water and electrolyte absorption.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: C57BL/6 mice aged 6–8 weeks received a chow diet while divided into 8 treatment groups (± saline, ± LGG [1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU]; ± tributyrin [5 mM]; or ± LGG/tributyrin). Mice received these treatments orally for 7 days. During this time, in addition to sucrose, mice were provided ± antibiotics in their water supply: neomycin (0.5 g/L), vancomycin (1 g/L), and metronidazole (1 g/L). Water intake was recorded daily and body weight and stool samples were obtained on days 0, 3, and 7. Mice were euthanized on day 7, and intestine and liver tissue samples were obtained and analyzed for mRNA and protein expression of genes and proteins involved with water and electrolyte absorption, butyrate transport, inflammation, and gut integrity via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunofluorescence.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Antibiotics significantly decreased the mRNA expression of Slc5a8 (butyrate transporter), GPR109a (butyrate receptor), NHE3 (Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger), and DRA (SLC26A3: Cl<sup>–</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> exchanger) and the protein expression of SLC5A8, NHE3, and ZO-1 and Occludin (tight junction proteins) in the intestinal tract. To examine gut-liver interactions in this model, several factors were examined in whole liver. CD14 (TLR4 cofactor) mRNA and F4/80 (macrophage) immunofluorescence were significantly increased in the antibiotic-saline group. LGG, tributyrin, or both combined maintained intestinal mRNA expression to that of the control animals. Tributyrin maintained intestinal protein expression of SLC5A8, NHE3, ZO-1, and Occludin and liver mRNA expression of CD14 and liver protein expression of F4/80 to that of control animals.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Broad-spectrum antibiotics decrease expression of anion exchangers, butyrate transporter, butyrate receptor, and tight junction proteins in mouse intestine and increase expression of CD14 and F4/80 in the liver. Simultaneous oral supplementation of a probiotic (LGG) and tributyrin maintains mRNA and protein expression to that of control mice. Optimizing intestinal health through maintenance of anion exchangers, butyrate receptor, and transporter expression as well as gut barrier with LGG and/or tributyrin may offer a preventative therapy for AAD.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Food and Nutrition Services, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA; <sup>2</sup>Internal Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA</p>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: Hyperglycemia is a common complication of parenteral nutrition (PN). Achieving optimal glycemic control can take several days as insulin doses are adjusted. The ability to anticipate hyperglycemia and predict the potential for insulin requirements is important when prescribing PN to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia. The objective of the current quality improvement (QI) project was to describe insulin requirements among adult patients receiving PN.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Data were extracted from an ongoing PN QI project in a tertiary care medical center (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>). Patients 18 years and older, admitted to an adult patient care unit and started on PN between January 2011 to August 2012, were included. The following variables were collected: body mass index (BMI), subjective global assessment (SGA; categorized as well vs malnourished), diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM; categorized as yes vs no), serum blood glucose (BG) on day of PN initiation, average serum BG during PN, glycosylated hemoglobin (Hgb A1c) value within 3 months prior to PN start (continuous and categorized as ≥ 5.7% vs &lt;5.7%), average PN dextrose, average glucose infusion rate (GIR), total days PN, and whether or not required PN insulin to control serum BG (categorized as yes vs no). χ<sup>2</sup> and Student <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine the difference between subjects who did and did not require PN insulin. Stepwise forward logistic regression was used to determine the best predictors of PN insulin requirement.</p>

<p><bold>Results</bold>: A total of 574 patients were started on PN during the time period; 166 (29%) required PN insulin to maintain glycemic control &lt;150 mg/dL. A number of differences were detected between subjects who did and did not require insulin. Patients requiring insulin had a higher prevalence of DM (58% vs 9%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), BMI (27.2 ± 7.3 vs 25.1 ± 7.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .007), serum BG on day of PN initiation (138.3 ± 48.3 vs 103.7 ± 30.1 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), average BG during PN (161.4 ± 32.0 vs 123.6 ± 25.5 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and higher Hgb A1c (6.8% ± 1.6% vs 5.5% ± 0.6%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) compared with those who did not require PN insulin. Only 33% of patients had an Hgb A1c measurement available within the 3 months prior to PN initiation. Those who required PN insulin were on PN longer than those who did not (10.5 ± 8.5 vs 7.3 ± 6.6 days, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There were no differences in PN dextrose goal (<italic>P</italic> = .07) or GIR (<italic>P</italic> = .14) between groups. Interestingly, 38% of patients with an Hgb A1c ≥ 5.7% did not have a diagnosis of DM (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Diagnosis of DM (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), initial serum BG (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005), and Hgb A1c ≥ 5.7% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) were predictive of requiring PN insulin.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Determining when to add insulin to PN solutions can be challenging. History of diabetes is the strongest predictor of insulin requirement; however, patients may have undiagnosed diabetes. Assessment of Hgb A1c and serum BG on day of PN initiation in combination with history of DM may lead to better predication of the need for PN insulin.</p>

<title>✶Vars Research Award Candidate, ✰Abstract of Distinction 1520100—Composition of Dietary Fat Source Shapes Gut Microbiota Architecture and Alters Host Inflammatory Mediators in Mouse Adipose Tissue</title>
<p>E. Huang<sup>1</sup>; V. Leone<sup>1</sup>; Y. Wang<sup>1</sup>; M. Brady<sup>1</sup>; E. Chang<sup>1</sup>; S. Devkota<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; <sup>2</sup>Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: A rapidly emerging area of study is the role of the commensal gut microbiota in the progression of obesity and inflammation. The use of germ-free mice has demonstrated a direct link between the consumption of a high-fat diet, the intestinal microbes, and adiposity. Studies have also shown that dietary factors dramatically alter the microbial architecture within the host. Previous work has suggested that mesenteric adipose tissue, due to its close proximity to the portal vein, possesses substantial proinflammatory potential. Moreover, these depots are situated adjacent to the intestine, suggesting an inherent reciprocity between commensal microbes and mesenteric-derived adipokines. However, this relationship has not been well characterized. Since gut microbiota have a direct effect on host metabolism, it is of significant interest to define a precise mechanism linking diet-induced obesity, inflammation, and the gut microbiota. We sought to address 2 key areas of study: (1) how dietary fat consumption and fat source, particularly high saturated (SFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fat, shape the intestinal microbiota and (2) to identify how observed perturbations in the microbiota due to dietary fat source are reflected in host adipose tissue–mediated inflammation.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were fed milk fat–, lard (SFA sources)–, or safflower oil (PUFA)–based high-fat diets for 4 weeks. Body mass, food consumption, and stool samples were collected throughout the study. Bacterial 16S rRNA was isolated and analyzed via terminal restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP); bacterial DNA sequencing libraries were run through massive parallel sequencing (HiSeq). In addition, mesenteric and gonadal adipose depots were excised and analyzed for both lipogenic and inflammatory gene expression via quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Mice fed high-fat diets gained more weight with a concomitant increase in caloric consumption relative to low-fat diet controls. Additionally, consumption of high-fat diets was associated with a dramatic shift in gut microbiota phyla architecture and stratified based on the specific source of dietary fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112470611">Figure 1</xref>). These changes also led to significant differential expression of inflammatory markers (eg, MCP-1, CD192, resistin, LPL) in mesenteric and gonadal fat depots (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: These initial findings support the notion that dietary fat composition can both shape the dynamics of structure of gut microbiota as well as alter host adipose tissue–mediated inflammation. Germ-free studies are currently under way to define the direct and indirect roles of gut microbiota induced by a specific dietary fat source. Collectively, results from this study may delineate a potential mechanism by which dietary fat, inflammation, and the commensal gut microbiota are intertwined.</p>

<title>✶Vars Research Award Candidate, ✰Abstract of Distinction 1520515—Early Parenteral Nutrition Is Associated With Significantly Higher Mortality in Critically Ill Children</title>
<p>P. S. Goday<sup>1</sup>; T. A. Mikhailov<sup>1</sup>; E. M. Kuhn<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA; <sup>2</sup>National Outcomes Center, Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: Early parenteral nutrition (PN) in critically ill adults has been associated with increased morbidity. Similar data are not available in critically ill children. We hypothesized that early PN, which is defined as 25% of goal calories delivered via PN within the first 48 hours of admission, is associated with a higher mortality rate, longer medical length of stay (LOS) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and longer duration of mechanical ventilation (MV).</p>
<p><bold>Aims</bold>: To determine whether early PN is associated with a higher mortality rate, longer PICU LOS, and a longer duration of MV in critically ill children who received no enteral nutrition (EN) in the first 96 hours after admission.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: This was a retrospective chart review of patients from 12 centers, facilitated by affiliation with the National Association of Children’s Hospitals and Related Institutions. All participating sites obtained approval from their local institutional review board. Information relating to demographics and PICU admission was acquired from the Virtual PICU Systems (VPS <sup>LLC</sup> ) clinical database. We obtained weight, sex, Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM-2) score, medical LOS, duration of MV, and mortality data. Data regarding MV were collected only by 9 centers. Nutrition intake data, including route, quantity, and content, were obtained by chart abstraction. Data were collected for all patients aged 1 month to 18 years who had a PICU LOS &gt;96 hours from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2008. Nutrition intake data were gathered on only the first 4 days of PICU admission. Goal calories were determined using the World Health Organization (WHO) equation. The association of early PN with medical LOS and length of MV was analyzed using Mann-Whitney tests (due to the skewed distribution) and regression analysis of log-transformed data. Mortality was compared between the groups using χ<sup>2</sup> tests and logistic regression analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: We identified 5105 patients, of whom 53.8% were male, and mean age was 5.3 years. The overall mortality was 5.3%. Of these, 2069 patients received no EN in the first 4 days and were available for analysis. MV data were analyzed for the 707 mechanically ventilated patients from the 9 centers. Those who received early PN were more likely to die than those who did not, when adjusted for PIM-2 score and center (odds ratio [OR] = 2.11 [1.42–3.14]; <italic>P</italic> = .0002). The unadjusted medical LOS for those who received early PN (16.0 ± 16.5 days, median 9.5) was significantly longer compared with those who did not receive early PN (11.6 ± 17.3 days, median 6.7) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). When adjusted for PIM-2 score and center, the medical LOS remained statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The unadjusted duration of MV for those who received early PN (11.6 ± 17.9 days, median 6.7) was longer compared with those who did not receive early PN (9.9 ± 15.6 days, median 4.9) (<italic>P</italic> = .009). When adjusted for PIM-2 score and center, the duration of MV for those who received early PN was longer than for those who did not (<italic>P</italic> = .013). Trends for medical LOS and duration of MV were similar when deaths were excluded (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>P</italic> = .019 for LOS and MV, respectively) after adjustment for PIM-2 score and center.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Early PN, defined as 25% of goal calories delivered by 48 hours after PICU admission in children who receive no EN for 4 days, is strongly associated with higher mortality even after correction for risk of mortality. The lengths of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation are longer in those patients who receive early PN.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction</bold>: Injectable fat emulsions (FEs) are a clinically dependable source of essential fatty acids. Although ω-6 fatty acids (FAs) are essential, ω-6FAs derived from soybeans have been associated with a heightened inflammatory response via production of 2-series prostaglandins. ω-3FAs, contained in fish oil and, to a lesser degree, in olive oil, are reported to decrease the inflammatory response. Although this anti-inflammatory response has been examined systemically, the effect of these lipids on the gastrointestinal tract has not been well studied. As our mouse model of parenteral nutrition (PN) demonstrates an intestinal proinflammatory response, leading to loss of epithelial cell (EC) proliferation and loss of barrier function, we hypothesized a decrease in inflammatory-linked cytokines would be seen when ω-3FAs were replaced or added to existing soybean lipid emulsions.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Blind experiments were performed for 3 FEs in adult C57BL/6 mice via intravenous cannulation (n = 6–9/group): standard soybean-based FE (SBFE), olive oil–supplemented FE (OOFE), and a combination of short chain, medium chain, olive oil, and fish oil emulsion (SMOF). PN was given for 7 days, comprising an isocaloric and isonitrogenous PN containing varying FEs to deliver 10%, 20%, or 30% of total energy. Mice small bowels were harvested for histology and mucosal scrapings were performed for mRNA expression. Further analysis, including survival rate, EC proliferation (proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA] staining), EC apoptosis (active caspase-3 staining) and epithelial barrier function (Ussing chamber), and proximal intestinal fatty acid content, were measured with fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Statistical analysis used 1-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Change in body weight and small bowel morphology (villus height and crypt depth) was not statistically significant between all FE groups. Survival was significantly improved in the OOFE group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112470611">Figure 1</xref>, only showing 30% FE values, as this approximated that used clinically). There was improved EC proliferation in the OOFE group vs SBFE and SMOF groups in 10% and 30% lipid dosages (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Barrier function was lowered in PN groups but was not significant between FE groups. Further, OOFE mice had the lowest apoptosis index at each dosage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>). Cytokine analysis showed OOFE to have the lowest levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α, interleukin (IL)–6, and IL-1β expression among FE groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>). This trend was seen for all dosages used. TNFR1 expression increased 2-fold in the SBFE group compared with SMOF, OOFE, and sham groups. Finally, tissue was collected to analyze the fatty acid content in proximal intestinal tissue. This showed that higher levels of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid were found in the SMOF group compared with the SBFF and OOFE groups. The OOFE group exhibited the highest percentage of amino acids, irrespective of the dosage level.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Our data suggest that PN containing OOFE fat emulsion has several beneficial effects to small bowel health that have not previously been identified. Further investigation of this lipid may help to enhance bowel integrity and possibly outcomes of patients restricted to PN.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA; <sup>2</sup>Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, Roanoke, VA, USA</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Soy-based intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) has been associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients when used within the first 10 days of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Therefore, the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) clinical guidelines in critically ill adults recommend that soy-based IVFE be withheld during the first week of hospitalization in the ICU.</p>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of IVFE exposure on outcomes in trauma intensive care unit (TICU) patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: A comprehensive database of patient characteristics, events, and outcomes is prospectively captured and maintained for all TICU patients. This database was combined with data from the electronic medical record on type and amount of IVFE infused each day from days −14 to +21 after initial TICU admission following institutional review board approval. The study included all patients admitted between June 2006 and September 2009 who were ≥18 years of age with an initial TICU admission ≥72 hours. Baseline data were reported as median and 25th–75th interquartile range. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate the effect of IVFE on major outcomes adjusting for age, sex, injury severity score (ISS), and University Health Consortium (UHC) expected mortality ratio.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: There were 10,479 patients in the TICU database; 2296 of these patients met inclusion criteria, and 742 patients (32%) were exposed to IVFE (IVFE+). In the IVFE+ group, 82 (11%) were exposed only to parenteral nutrition fat emulsion (PNFE), 625 (84%) were exposed only to propofol fat emulsion (PFE), and 35 (5%) were exposed to both. Analysis of unadjusted variables using Wilcoxon and Pearson tests found the IVFE+ group was younger in age in comparison to the nonexposed group (IVFE–) (36 [25, 51] vs 44 years [28, 59]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), had more males (78% vs 65%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), had a lower body mass index (26 [22, 30] vs 26 [23, 31]; <italic>P</italic> = .013), had a lower TICU admission glucose level (150 [126, 188] vs 165 mg/dL [131, 212]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), had higher ISS scores (27 [19, 35] vs 22 [16, 29]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and had a higher UHC expected mortality ratio (0.11 [0.05, 0.24] vs 0.05 [0.01, 0.15]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). IVFE+ vs IVFE– patients had more infections (23% vs 9%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), had a longer length of stay (LOS) in the hospital (12.9 vs 7.9 days; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and the ICU (8.3 vs 5.4 days; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), had a greater number of total ventilator days (6 vs 4 days; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and had a higher rate of mortality (11% vs 4%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The adverse effect of IVFE+ on outcome measures was not as great for PFE compared with PNFE or both (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Multivariable regression analysis revealed that the IVFE+ group was at a 2.6-fold increased odds of infection (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01–3.37), experienced a 4.67-day longer hospital LOS (95% CI, 3.53–5.81), experienced a 3.48-day longer ICU LOS (95% CI, 2.66–4.3), experienced a 1.32-day longer time spent on the ventilator (95% CI, 0.413–2.23), and were at a 3.13-fold increased odds of death (95% CI, 2.21–4.43).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: We found that the all sources of soy-based IVFE negatively affected outcomes in TICU patients and believe that this should be considered when applying the SCCM and A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines.</p>

<title>✰Abstract of Distinction 1521705—Does a Low-Fructose/Glycemic Index/Glycemic Load Diet Influence Dietary Intake, Body Composition, and Liver Function in Children With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease?</title>
<p>D. Mager<sup>1,2</sup>, I. Rivera<sup>1</sup>, J. Yap<sup>2</sup></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Agricultural Food &amp; Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; <sup>2</sup>Pediatrics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease that manifests as fatty liver with or without inflammation and fibrosis and, in some cases, cirrhosis. The complete etiopathogenesis of NAFLD remains to be elucidated, but diets higher in fructose/glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) have been associated with indices of inflammation and liver function in obese children with NAFLD. Current treatment includes lifestyle modification to promote weight loss, but little is known regarding the efficacy of limiting specific food groups as therapy. We hypothesized that a low-fructose/GI/GL diet over 3 months would result in significant improvements in body composition and liver function tests in children with NAFLD when compared with healthy age-matched children.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Children with NAFLD (baseline, n = 11; follow-up [FU], n = 5) and age-matched healthy lean children (baseline, n = 13; FU, n = 13) were instructed on a low-fructose/GI/GL diet. Fasting blood work, including triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, glucose, insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), body composition (air displacement plethysmography), blood pressure (BP), and intake (3-day food intake records), were measured at baseline and after 3 months.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Children (NAFLD, 13.4 ± 2 years; lean, 11.7 ± 2.6 years) with NAFLD had significantly higher body mass index (BMI) <italic>z</italic> scores (2.6 ± 0.6 vs −0.4 ± 1.3), waist circumference (104.1 ± 11.4 vs 60.3 ± 6.8 cm), % body fat (BF) (36.2% ± 6.8% vs 13.2% ± 5.7%) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and fasting levels of ALT (63 ± 51 vs 16 ± 3 U/L), AST (38 ± 18 vs 26 ± 3 U/L), γ-GT (22 ± 10 vs 5.0 ± 0.2 U/L), TG (1.8 ± 0.2 vs 1.0 ± 0.3 mmol/L), and insulin (46 ± 47.7 vs 7.6 ± 4.3 mU/L) than lean children at study entry (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Baseline diet of children with NAFLD was higher in energy (2023 ± 701 vs 1681 ± 335 kcal/d), protein (89.5 ± 34.7 vs 61.9 ± 14.7 g/d), fat (85.9 ± 44.6 vs 61.2 ± 19.9 g/d), GI (62.7 ± 8.2 vs 45.1 ± 11.4), GL (120.7 ± 41.8 vs 91.3 ± 24.6), and total fructose intake (30.3 ± 18.2 vs 19.2 ± 8.6 g/d) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) than that of lean children. After 3 months on the diet intervention, children with NAFLD experienced a 14.5% reduction in %BF (36.2 ± 6.8 vs 31.8 ± 8.3; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and significant reductions in BP (systolic 125.6 ± 10.4 vs 110 ± 10 mm Hg; diastolic 76.5 ± 20.3 vs 71.8 ± 10.5 mm Hg; <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05) but only nonsignificant reductions in ALT (63 ± 51 vs 38 ± 18 U/L; <italic>P</italic> = .2), TG (1.8 ± 0.9 vs 1.1 ± 0.5 mmol/L; <italic>P</italic> = .2), insulin (45.5 ± 47.7 vs 25.8 ± 11.7 mU/L; <italic>P</italic> = .1), and homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; 11.3 ± 12.9 vs 5.7 ± 2.7; <italic>P</italic> = .2). No changes in body composition and laboratory parameters were observed among the lean group. Children with NAFLD experienced significant reductions in total energy (2020 ± 700 vs 1200 ± 349 kcal/d), saturated fat (27.7 ± 4.2 vs 13.7 ± 5.5 g/d), GI (62.7 ± 8.2 vs 33 ± 15.8), GL (120.7 ± 41.8 vs 45.5 ± 16), and total fructose (30.3 ± 18.2 vs 11.8 ± 5.6 g/d) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) at 3 months but did not experience significant reductions in the percentage of kilocalories from fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Although reductions of GI/GL and fructose were also observed in the lean children, these were not significantly different from baseline. No other changes in macronutrient intake in the children were observed.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Short-term dietary reductions in fructose/GI/GL in children with NAFLD reduced blood pressure and % body fat and were associated with some improvements in fasting blood parameters. Treatment strategies aimed at reductions in dietary fructose/GI and GL in children with NAFLD may contribute to therapy in childhood NAFLD.</p>

<title>✰Abstract of Distinction 1520652—Comparison of Conventional Parenteral Soy-Based Lipid With a New Lipid Emulsion (Combining Soy, Medium-Chain Triglycerides, Olive and Fish Oil)</title>

<p><bold>Introduction</bold>: In North America, the conventional parenteral lipid emulsion is soy-based Intralipid (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany). In neonates, this has been implicated in increased risk of parenteral nutrition–associated liver disease (PNALD). Newer lipid therapies are emerging that combine soybean oil with medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil (SMOFlipid; Fresenius Kabi). The goal of this experiment was to compare conventional lipid with SMOFlipid in an animal model of neonatal-onset PNALD.</p>
<p><bold>Materials and Methods</bold>: Nineteen neonatal piglets, 2–6 days old and weighing 1.8–2.7 kg, underwent a jugular catheter insertion to allow isonitrogenous, isocaloric parenteral nutrition (PN). Piglets were allocated to 2 treatment groups. Group 1 piglets (n = 9) received Intralipid, and group 2 piglets (n = 10) received SMOFlipid, at the same total dose (10 g/kg/d). Piglets were given PN for 14 days; total bilirubin was measured at baseline and end of the trial on day 14. Bile flow was measured at the end of the trial, and tissue samples were collected for fatty acid analysis. A sow-reared control group was also studied. Comparisons were made by 1-way analysis of variance.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Weight gained on trial was not significantly different between PN piglet groups (3.0 kg SMOFlipid vs 2.4 kg Intralipid; <italic>P</italic> = .056). The bilirubin levels at day 14 were similar between SMOFlipid-treated and sow-fed piglets (4.0 µM/L and 8.2 µM/L respectively) while significantly lower in comparison to Intralipid-treated piglets (27.8 µM/L) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Bile flow at termination was significantly higher given SMOFlipid, similar to sow-reared controls (12.2 µg/g liver/10 min and 9.7 µg/g liver/10 min, respectively), compared with piglets given Intralipid (4.1 µg/g liver/10 min) (<italic>P</italic> = .019).</p>
<p><bold>Discussion</bold>: As shown in the results, SMOFlipid did appear to prevent early onset PNALD in neonatal piglets. It is important to note that although other interventions aimed at protecting the liver rely on restriction of soy-based lipid, the use of SMOFlipid provides equivalent nutrition support to vulnerable neonates as conventional parenteral lipid therapy while at the same time preventing liver disease. Direct comparison of these strategies is therefore warranted.</p>

<p><bold>Background</bold>: Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is administered through a central venous catheter (CVC). The most frequently reported complication of HPN is central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Identification of risk factors may reduce CLABSI incidence in an HPN population.</p>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: The aim of this study was to compare risk factors for CLABSI in frequently infected (FI) and rarely infected (RI) HPN patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Catheter infection data were collected from January 2006 to December 2011 by medical record review from 1 home infusion pharmacy. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their individual infection rate/1000 CVC days. Twenty-one patients in the FI group averaged a CLABSI rate of 4.3/1000 days. Twenty-one patients were assigned to the RI group with an average CLABSI rate of 0.04/1000 days. Risk factors for CLABSI were identified by literature review. They included number of handlers, presence of an ostomy or enteric tube, dressing material, hub care antiseptic, use of intravenous (IV) push medications and narcotics, and lab draw method and collection frequency. Age, sex, diagnosis, length of therapy, and CVC type were also analyzed and compared.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Each group was similar for age, sex, presence of an ostomy, and alcohol swab hub care. Diagnosis for the RI group was primarily short bowel syndrome (95%). The FI group was 67% short bowel syndrome and 33% dysmotility. The RI group’s length of therapy was longer, with an average of 23.5 years compared with 15.75 years for the FI group. For CVC type, the RI group had 100% tunneled CVCs, and the FI group had 17 tunneled CVCs, 4 implanted ports, and 1 peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). The FI group had more CVC handlers available, with 48% having a potential of 2–5 CVC caregivers. The largest number of CVC handlers for the RI group was a possibility of 2 in 28% of the patients and only 1 caregiver in 72% of the patients. The FI group had 5 enteric tubes and the RI group only 1. Dressing material also varied between the groups, with the FI group using 90% transparent dressings and the RI group a combination of transparent (62%) and gauze dressings (38%). The FI group used more IV push medications (57% vs 28%) and narcotics (38% vs 0%) than the RI group. The CVC was used for lab draws in the majority of the FI group (71%), and labs were drawn more frequently than once monthly in 57% of the FI group. In contrast, the RI group had labs drawn primarily by peripheral vein (71%), and no patients had labs drawn more frequently than once monthly.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: In this cohort of HPN patients, several risk factors were identified as more prevalent in the FI group. They include more caregivers handling the CVC, presence of an enteric tube, use of IV push medications and narcotics, and frequency of blood sampling from the CVC. Other factors that may increase risk of infection are fewer years on HPN, diagnosis of dysmotility, and implanted port and PICC use rather than a tunneled CVC. HPN patients can maintain a very low CLABSI rate, as demonstrated by the RI group. Recognition and implementation of strategies to reduce risk factors are a priority in the care of HPN patients. More studies need to be conducted to define risk factors for CLABSI in this population.</p>

<title>✰Abstract of Distinction 1506442–Pancreatic Enzyme Preparation for Enteral Feeding Tube Administration</title>

<p><sup>1</sup>University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; <sup>2</sup>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Given varying degrees of pancreatic insufficiency, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) often require pancreatic enzymes (pancrelipase) to aid in the digestion/absorption of nutrients. When receiving enteral nutrition via feeding tube, CF patients may be unable to take pancrelipase by mouth. In the absence of evidence-based recommendations, our institution dispenses doses of pancrelipase capsules intact along with a 20-mL oral syringe containing sodium bicarbonate solution for these inpatients. It remains unclear whether there is an upper dose limit for complete dissolution of capsule contents when the nurse combines them together before administration.</p>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To describe the in vitro dissolution and physicochemical effects—over 30 minutes—of preparing pancrelipase in 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution prior to enteral administration.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Our formulary pancrelipase products (Creon and Zenpep) are delayed-release preparations containing enteric-coated granules/beads in each capsule. Several doses of pancrelipase (Creon, 24,000, 48,000, and 72,000 lipase units; Zenpep, 20,000, 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 lipase units) were studied. The intact contents of pancrelipase capsules were added to 20 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution as the solvent. The bicarbonate was intended to dissolve the enteric coating to liberate the enzymes into solution. In addition to visual observation, we obtained the pH using a pH meter, relative particle count using microplate laser nephelometry, and osmolality using a single-sample osmometer at multiple time points (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes) at room temperature.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The only dose of Creon that was completely dissolved at 30 minutes was the 24,000 lipase unit dose. Zenpep doses of 20,000 and 40,000 lipase units were completely dissolved at 30 minutes. Higher doses of each pancrelipase product did not completely dissolve. The Zenpep product dissolved much more readily, whereas the beads of the Creon product were much more likely to stick to each other. The baseline pH of the solvent (8.2) dropped in the first 5 minutes after pancrelipase was added but returned to a pH of 8 by the end of the 30-minute observation period. The particle count as measured in relative nephelometry units (RNU) increased with the dose and over time. By the end of the 30-minute period, the osmolality of the mixture using Creon remained close to that of the solvent alone (1639 mOsm/kg water), whereas for the mixture using Zenpep, the osmolality increased to 1667 mOsm/kg water.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: At doses up to 24,000 lipase units (Creon) or 40,000 lipase units (Zenpep), there is total dissolution of enzymes in 20 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution. Higher doses do not dissolve sufficiently in this volume of solvent. Physicochemical effects associated with the rapidity of dissolution are reflected in the increasing particle counts and osmolality. A clinical evaluation should be considered to account for additional factors associated with the administration of pancrelipase prepared using this method.</p>

<p><bold>Background</bold>: Orogastric tube feeding is indicated in neonates with impaired ability to ingest food normally and can be administered by intermittent bolus (INT) or continuous (CON) infusion.</p>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To determine the effect of feeding modality on growth and lean tissue accretion.</p>
<p>Design/Methods: Neonatal pigs (n = 6, 6 days old) were fed the same diet in equivalent amounts continuously or intermittently (meal every 4 hours) for 21 days. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements were performed before and 18 days following the initiation of feeding. Plasma glucose, amino acid, and insulin concentrations; fractional tissue protein synthesis rates; and translation initiation factor activation in skeletal muscle were examined on the last day of feeding.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Weight gain was greater for INT than for CON pigs and resulted in heavier body weights from 9 days through the 21 days of feeding (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Food conversion efficiency (kg weight gain/kg food), efficiency of protein deposition (kg gain/kg consumed), and efficiency of energy deposition (Mj retained/Mj consumed) were greater in INT than in CON pigs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Total lean tissue mass and spine length, but not fat mass, were greater in INT than in CON pigs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Amino acid, glucose, and insulin levels were greater for INT after the meal than for CON pigs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Muscle protein synthesis increased by 40% in the longissimus dorsi (LD) and 34% in the gastrocnemius and soleus of the INT as compared with the CON group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). LD, semitendinosus, and soleus muscles were 56%, 42%, and 35% heavier for pigs in the INT as compared with the CON group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Protein synthesis increased by 22%, 18%, and 48% in the liver, jejunum, and ileum, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), for INT compared with CON groups. Liver, jejunum, and ileum weights were 72%, 40%, and 35% higher in pigs receiving the INT compared with the CON treatment. We used the LD muscle as a tissue representative for determining the activation of signaling components toward protein synthesis. The phosphorylation of protein kinase B (PKB), a well-known marker for the activation of the insulin signaling pathway, was higher in the INT as compared with the CON group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Likewise, the phosphorylation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a readout of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, was greater in INT than in CON pigs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G with eIF4E, a crucial step for cap-dependent translation initiation, was higher in INT compared with CON (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Phosphorylation/activation of eIF2α, an inhibitor for eIF2B (promotes translation of all mRNA/global protein synthesis), was less in INT than in CON pigs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 (eEF2) (a crucial factor for the elongation process) was similar in both groups, suggesting that the elongation process is not a limiting factor.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: These results suggest that intermittent bolus feeding enhances lean tissue accretion as compared with continuous feeding in neonates, and this response is likely due to the attainment of higher protein synthesis rates via the increased activation of translation initiation factors.

<title>✰Abstract of Distinction 1512499—Correlation of Zinc Biomarkers With Body Composition in Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants With Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
<p>A. K. Shaikhkhalil<sup>1</sup>; C. J. Valentine<sup>2</sup>; R. DiSilvestro<sup>3</sup></p>
<p><sup>1</sup>Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA; <sup>2</sup>Division of Neonatology and Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA; <sup>3</sup>Department of Human Nutrition, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA</p>
<p><bold>Introduction</bold>: Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants suffer from postnatal growth failure, which is linked to poor developmental outcomes. Many ELBW infants have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which further compromises growth. Lower zinc stores and increased zinc losses during BPD therapy could contribute to poor growth. Zinc deficiency is difficult to diagnose as serum zinc does not represent total body stores. A biomarker that correlates with zinc status is metallothionein. Our hypothesis was that growth and fat-free mass body composition would correlate with zinc or metallothionein status. Understanding this relationship could provide the clinician with a valuable biomarker.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: After institutional review board approval, infants born at or less than 27 weeks of gestation were prospectively enrolled. Blood specimens were obtained in the first 2 weeks of life (point 1) and again between weeks 6 and 8 (point 2). Clinical data, including caloric and protein intake, growth velocity, and linear growth, were recorded. Body composition was analyzed using air displacement plethysmography (PEA POD; COSMED, Rome, Italy). Plasma zinc concentration was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) and plasma metallothionein level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; BlueGene Biotech, Shanghai, China). Spearman correlation coefficient (SAS version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to evaluate the correlation between plasma zinc and growth velocity, plasma zinc and metallothionein, and plasma zinc and fat-free body mass. The paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the <italic>z</italic> score of birth weight to the <italic>z</italic> score of weight on day of life 56 and fat-free mass to term infant normative data.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Eighteen ELBW infants were enrolled; 13 were male. Mean gestational age was 25 ± 1.4 weeks; mean birth weight was 773 ± 158 g. All infants had BPD; 16 infants (89%) had severe BPD. Over the first 8 weeks of life, mean calorie intake was 93 ± 14 kcal/kg/d, and mean protein intake was 3.3 ± 0.3 g/kg/d. Parenteral zinc intake was 548 ± 203 µg/kg/d and enteral zinc intake 1085 ± 506 µg/kg/d. Over the first 8 weeks of life, mean growth velocity was 15.8 ± 3.5 g/kg/d, and mean linear growth was 0.9 ± 0.2 cm/wk. There was a statistically significant decrease from average <italic>z</italic> score of birth weight to <italic>z</italic> score of weight on day of life 56 from 0.09 to −0.7 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Plasma zinc was measured in 13 infants. At point 1, mean plasma zinc was 1.1 µg/mL, and mean plasma metallothionein was 1.16 ng/mL. At point 2, mean plasma zinc was 1.02 µg/mL, and mean plasma metallothionein was 0.92 ng/mL. There were no statistically significant correlations between plasma zinc and plasma metallothionein concentrations or between plasma zinc concentration and growth velocity. Body composition analysis was performed in 9 infants. At the time of body composition analysis, mean corrected age was 47 ± 6 weeks; mean weight was 3.99 ± 1.2 kg. Mean fat-free mass was 3.25 ± 0.94 kg; mean percentage of fat mass was 18.4% ± 4.8%. Compared with term infants of the same corrected age, percentage of body fat was not different, but fat-free mass was significantly reduced (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .005). Plasma zinc and metallothionein concentrations and protein intake did not correlate with fat-free mass.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Biomarkers of zinc did not correlate with growth velocity or body composition in ELBW infants with BPD. These infants exhibited significant deficits in weight and fat-free mass. More research is needed to investigate markers of zinc status and indices of growth and body composition in this population.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; <sup>2</sup>Biostatistics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Recent recognition of the dose-related association between soy-based intravenous lipid emulsions with onset and progression of parenteral nutrition–associated liver disease (PNALD) has prompted the practice of lipid restriction during parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of stepwise restriction of soy-intralipid dose on growth outcomes in infants on chronic PN therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Nutrition support data of infants on PN therapy for ≥ 3 weeks between July 2010 and June 2011 were analyzed. All infants were advanced to standard dose lipids of 2.5–3.0 g/kg/d within 1 week of initiating PN therapy. The onset and frequency of metabolic abnormalities were assessed. PNALD was defined as direct bilirubin (DB) &gt;1.5 mg/dL developing during PN therapy. Infants with PNALD were managed by stepwise reduction of the intralipid dose by 0.5–1.0 g/kg/d/wk to a minimum dose of 1 g/kg × 3 d/wk if DB was &gt;6–10 mg/dL. Infants with weekly DB &lt;1.5 mg/dL continued to receive intralipids dosed at 2.5–3 g/kg/d. Weight for age (WAZ), length for age (LAZ), and head circumference (HCZ) <italic>z</italic> scores were computed using Olsen and World Health Organization (WHO) reference data. Growth outcomes of lipid-restricted vs non–lipid-restricted infants were examined by comparing birth and discharge growth <italic>z</italic> scores.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Eighty-two infants received PN for ≥ 3 weeks, and 38 developed PNALD that was managed by restricting the intralipid dose. Infants who developed PNALD tended to have lower birth WAZ and LAZ compared with those who did not develop PNALD (median [range]; WAZ, –0.65 [–3.17, 2.00] vs −0.14 [–1.91, 2.28], <italic>P</italic> = .068; LAZ, –0.38 [–3.17, –2.00] vs 0.20 [–2.48, 2.55], <italic>P</italic> = .06), had a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal problems (39% vs 20%, <italic>P</italic> = .059), and had a longer duration of hospital stay (17.5 [3.0, 54.0] vs 8.7 [2.9, 33.6] weeks, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). However, growth at discharge did not differ in the lipid-restricted group compared with those who received standard dose lipids: WAZ, –0.78 (–4.53, 3.22) vs −0.77 (–3.64, 1.48), <italic>P</italic> = .68; LAZ, –1.68 (–6.91, 4.86) vs −1.28 (–5.46, 1.36), <italic>P</italic> = 0.513; and HCZ, –0.84 (–3.83, 1.30) vs −0.51 (–4.16, 4.42), <italic>P</italic> = .153.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Infants on chronic PN complicated by PNALD and managed with stepwise lipid restriction had similar growth outcomes as those without PNALD who continued to receive standard dose lipids. Future studies are needed to examine neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Nutrition, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA; <sup>2</sup>Gastroenterology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA; <sup>3</sup>Center for Human Nutrition, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA</p>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is implicated in the pathophysiology of many complications related to home parenteral nutrition (HPN). Potential SIBO contributors include alterations in gastric acid, biliary and pancreatic secretions, gut immunological factors, small bowel motor patterns, an intact ileocecal valve, and altered intestinal anatomy. Standard therapy for intestinal failure patients includes HPN, limited oral intake, treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and/or histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2Bs), and antibiotics due to infections. The study aim was to evaluate the prediction that HPN patients receiving PPIs, H2Bs, antibiotics, and/or suboptimal enteral intake will have associated symptoms of SIBO.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Following institutional review board approval, a retrospective review of the Cleveland Clinic HPN Database from 2005–2011 was performed. Patients receiving HPN for at least 12 months and referred to the Intestinal Rehabilitation and Transplant Program (IRTP) were included. Anthropometric data, underlying disease, gastrointestinal anatomy, HPN start date, and initial visit were identified. The chart was reviewed for symptoms of SIBO. Patients with &lt;2 symptoms were considered controls. HPN formula, stoma output, ability to eat, quantity and type of oral diet, medications, and laboratory values were recorded. Descriptive statistics and <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to assess association between gastric acid suppression medications and SIBO symptoms, medication use, and laboratory tests.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Study criteria were met in 66 patients (49 females), including 21 controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>). Remaining bowel length, colon length, and presence of ileocecal valve varied among both groups. Diarrhea was the most frequent SIBO symptom recorded (88% of patients), followed by nausea (41%), abdominal pain (36%), bloating (29%), fatigue (20%), and vomiting (15%). The majority of patients were prescribed regular foods (76%), but 85% reported minimal oral intake. On average, patients were prescribed 1500 kcal, 100 g protein, and 2555 mL volume per day with HPN. Medications commonly prescribed were antidiarrheals (58% of patients), antibiotics (21%), octreotide (14%), PPI (n = 31 patients; 47%), and H2B (n = 37 patients; 56%). Both a PPI and H2B were prescribed in 21% of patients; 15% of patients received neither. The following laboratory tests were altered: aspartate aminotransferase (AST; 32% of patients), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 30%), and alkaline phosphatase (39%). Comparing gastric acid suppression medications to SIBO symptoms, laboratory values, and medications, H2B vs PPI provision was more often associated with incidence of diarrhea (38% vs 22% of patients), abdominal pain (38% vs 25%), bloating (42% vs 21%), fatigue (54% vs 23%), vomiting (22% vs 55%), antidiarrheal medications (38% vs 27%), octreotide use (33% vs 6%), and elevated AST (42% vs 19%), ALT (35% vs 30%), and alkaline phosphatase (46% vs 23%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148607112470611">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Lack of adequate oral intake and use of H2Bs and PPIs are associated with an increased incidence of SIBO symptoms in HPN patients. H2Bs are associated more so than PPIs with SIBO symptoms, use of antidiarrheal medications, and elevated liver function tests. These data indicate future study is needed regarding routine use of H2Bs compared with PPIs as standard of care in HPN patients to potentially improve outcomes.</p>

<title>✰Poster Abstract of Distinction 1520553—Long-Term Safety and Tolerability of Teduglutide in Patients With Intestinal Failure Associated With Short Bowel Syndrome: Combined Data From Phase III Trials</title>
<p>K. Fujioka<sup>1</sup>; D. L. Seidner<sup>2</sup>; E. Delmaestro<sup>3</sup>; B. Joelsson<sup>3</sup>; S. Krause<sup>4</sup></p>

<p><bold>Objective</bold>: Teduglutide (TED) is a novel therapy in development for the treatment of intestinal failure associated with short bowel syndrome (SBS-IF). In phase III clinical trials, TED reduced weekly parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluid (PN/IV) volume requirements and the number of infusion days in patients (pts) with SBS-IF; a subset of pts achieved complete PN/IV independence. In placebo (PBO)– controlled trials, the most common adverse events (AEs) were abdominal pain (39% TED vs 27% PBO), upper respiratory tract infection (28% vs 14%), nausea (27% vs 20%), injection site reactions (20% vs 12%), and abdominal distension (17% vs 2%). Among pts with stoma, gastrointestinal (GI) stoma complications occurred in 38% of TED and 14% of PBO pts. Combined safety data from TED pts in these trials and their respective open-label extension studies are presented here.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: CL0600-004 and CL0600-020 were 24-week double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, PBO-controlled studies in pts with SBS-IF. CL0600-005 and CL0600-021 are the respective 28-week and the ongoing 2-year open-label (data as of October 31, 2011) extensions of these studies. Combined, 173 pts received subcutaneous injections of TED (0.05 mg/kg/d or 0.10 mg/kg/d).</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Most pts experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent AE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>). The most commonly reported AEs were GI; however, incidence rates decreased over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0148607112470611">Table 2</xref>). Infections, including upper respiratory infection and catheter sepsis, were observed. The most common serious AE in TED-treated pts was catheter sepsis (22%). Others included GI stenosis and obstruction (none required surgery), biliary tract disorder, lower respiratory infection, catheter site–related reaction, and febrile disorder (3.5%−4.6%). GI AEs were the main reason for discontinuation (17%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>). Gallstones and cholecystitis were reported in 11 TED-treated pts; 5 had a history of biliary disease. Pancreatitis was reported in 4 TED-treated pts; 1 pt had a final diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, and 3 had a history of pancreatitis. As previously presented, 3 cases of malignant neoplasms were reported during TED treatment.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: TED was generally well tolerated in adult pts with SBS-IF dependent on PN/IV support. The most frequently reported AEs were GI related, consistent with the underlying disease condition and the known mechanism of action of TED. These tended to occur early and were manageable by the clinician and pt. The safety profile of TED supports short- and long-term treatment.</p>

<p><bold>Objective</bold>: Central venous catheter–related infections (CVCIs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with long-term parental nutrition (PN) needs. Each CVCI generally results in a hospital stay and antibiotic therapy use, both of which have detrimental effects on the patient/family and increase costs of healthcare. There is a lack of information about this topic in cohorts with both pediatric and adult patients, and more research should be done in this area. The purpose of this study was to determine if ethanol lock therapy (compared with alternative therapy) decreased the incidence of CVC total infections per 1000 line days and total line insertions in intestinal rehabilitation patients who have long-term PN needs. In addition, number and types of cultured organisms are examined.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: A retrospective analysis of 25 patients was used to evaluate the rate of CVCI. Subjects served as their own controls, using an equal time period prior to and after 70% ethanol therapy initiation (alternative therapies prior to ethanol therapy included saline, antibiotic, or heparin locks). Subjects were included if they were (a) receiving PN via long-term CVC, (b) enrolled in the University of Nebraska Medical Center intestinal rehabilitation program (IRP), (c) using ethanol locks, and (d) served by home health agencies using a standardized ethanol therapy protocol. No subjects were excluded based on age, sex, disease, or ethnicity. Study variables include patient age, days with CVC, days with ethanol therapy, number of infections, the microbes cultured, new line insertions, and patient anatomy. Statistical analysis was done in SPSS (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL) using paired <italic>t</italic> tests.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The median age of the subjects was 23 months old (range, 6 months to 82 years). The most common underlying cause of intestinal failure was gastroschisis; 44% and 48% of patients had less than 50 cm of small bowel remaining. The mean (SD) number of days on ethanol therapy was 406 (371) days (13.5 months). The mean (SD) number of infections per 1000 line days with alternative therapy was 7.29 (8.74), and ethanol therapy was 1.16 (2.07). Most common organisms cultured in patients during alternative and ethanol therapy were gram-positive (23 and 10, respectively) and gram-negative organisms (15 and 6, respectively). Comparison of total CVCIs per 1000 line days for alternate therapy and ethanol therapy indicates that CVCI per 1000 line days was significantly lower with ethanol therapy use (<italic>P</italic> = .02). Frequency of new line placement per 1000 line days was compared between alternative and ethanol therapy, indicating that there is not a significant difference between the therapies (<italic>P</italic> = .262).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: This is the first known study including both pediatric and adult patients using a standardized ethanol lock protocol, and therefore more research should be done in this area. Compared with various alternative therapies, the use of 70% ethanol lock therapy significantly reduces the rate of CVCI per 1000 line days in IRP patients. Differences between groups for new line placements were not significant. These results indicate that ethanol lock therapy can significantly reduce the number of CVCI in patients with long-term PN needs.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction</bold>: Timeliness of nutrition intervention in the hospital is an essential step in preventing idiopathic malnutrition. Registered dietitians (RDs) are extensively and uniquely trained to identify, assess, and intervene with at-risk patients. RDs traditionally rely on MD orders for the implementation of their recommendations to begin intervention. The aim of this observational study was to explore why physicians were not implementing dietitian recommendations from nutrition consults.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: A 2-phase study was conducted in a 555-bed teaching hospital to evaluate physician behavior and beliefs on nutrition consults. Phase 1 of the study consisted of a retrospective chart review of nutrition consults ordered between January 1, 2011, and March 31, 2011. The aim of the chart review was to (1) quantify total nutrition consults and categorize types of nutrition consults ordered, (2) identify consults where RD recommendations were not implemented, and (3) determine which specific members of the healthcare team (MD, RD, or RN) implement more RD recommendations. Phase 2 of the study consisted of a computer-based survey of a convenience sample administered to active hospital medical staff, including internal medicine and family medicine residents and surgical residents. The purpose of the survey was to identify physician-perceived existing barriers precluding implementation of consult-driven nutrition recommendations by the RD.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: In phase 1, the majority of nutrition consults were ordered by the RN (n = 1240, 72.4%). The MD ordered 332 consults (19.4%), and physician extenders such as nurse practitioners or physician assistants ordered 140 consults (8.2%). Nutrition support accounted for 78% of the physician consults while malnutrition and wound healing accounted for 3% of the consults. No reason was given for 16% of the physician consults. The RD made a total of 154 recommendations in response to the physician-generated consults, and 113 of the recommendations (73%) were implemented. Fifty-eight percent (89/154) of the RD recommendations were suggestions for enteral nutrition (EN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) formulations, of which 77 were implemented (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0148607112470611">Table 1</xref>). Thirty of 77 (39%) of the recommendations for EN and PN were implemented by the MD (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0148607112470611">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In phase 2, MDs were asked to respond to 14 examples of reasons why the MD may not implement RD nutrition recommendations. The primary reason cited in a Likert scale was “I thought the RD implemented the recommendation.”</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: This study identified 3 major themes of why RD consult recommendations were not implemented at this teaching hospital. First, nurses generated the most nutrition consults from nutrition screening. Second, MDs believed that RDs implemented their own recommendations from consult orders. Third, when the consult was ordered by a non-MD health professional, often the RD recommendation was overlooked by the MD in the medical record. Consequently, these identified beliefs and behaviors significantly serve as barriers to the implementation of the RD recommendations. Future studies are needed to investigate expedited implementation of RD nutrition recommendations whether from additional protocols or clinical privileges.</p>
