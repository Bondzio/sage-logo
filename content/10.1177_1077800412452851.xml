<abstract>
<p>Two colleagues, Ann and Jacqui, came together, within the safety of an imagined actors’ studio, to explore the challenges that Ann faced in planning a new graduate program in public health nutrition. They met before, during, and after program implementation to discuss Ann’s experiences, and audio-taped and transcribed the discussions. When all three sessions had concluded, they reviewed the transcripts and discussed their insights further. In doing so, they drew upon the collaborative writing work of Wyatt, Gale, Gannon, and Davies, whose play featuring French theorist Gilles Deleuze, inspired Ann and Jacqui to consider what it meant to work together on this project. Of particular interest was the tension they encountered attempting to tell their stories in the first person narrative voice as well as their differing perspectives on the therapeutic sensibility of the discussions. Through this process, Ann and Jacqui gained insight into their educational practices and came to view dialogue as a valuable method of inquiry.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two colleagues, Ann and Jacqui, came together to explore the challenges that Ann faced as an autonomous program director responsible for planning, implementing, and evaluating a new graduate program in public health nutrition. The resulting dialogue was mutually beneficial and enabled both to consider educational issues in each of their academic cultural contexts. Beyond the dialogical experience, Ann and Jacqui came to understand that they were part of an approach, a nomadic way of being (Gale &amp; Wyatt, 2008b, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt, Gale, Gannon, &amp; Davies, 2011</xref>), that they had not experienced in the past, and that would open new ground for their thinking and writing.</p>
<p>In this article, the authors share their experiences engaging in a process of dialogue that enabled them to explore their practices as educators and nutrition professionals. As a means of establishing the specific context of this inquiry, the authors expand on their positions within the academy and how each of them came to be involved in this project. Further to sharing their experiences, they consider some of the issues that arose during their exploration and reflect on these as they relate to qualitative inquiry within their profession of dietetics. In so doing, they draw upon the collaborative writing of Jonathan Wyatt, Ken Gale, Susanne Gannon, and Bronwyn Davies, who refer to themselves collectively by the initials JKSB, and their work on and with Gilles Deleuze,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800412452851">1</xref></sup> to try to understand the process that transpired.</p>

<title>Coming Together</title>
<p>In the absence of colleagues with both dietetics and adult education experience at her own institution, Ann sought the involvement of Jacqui, a dietetics professor at a neighboring university. In the section that follows, each describes how they “came together.”</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ann:</speaker>
<p>The prospect of implementing a new graduate program in short order was simultaneously exciting and daunting. Having worked with community partners over many months to try to understand student needs and create a relevant program framework, the final approval by the university and provincial governance body came sooner than anticipated. This created an opportunity to get the program up and running for the next academic year, one month away, and one year sooner than expected. The challenge was exciting because the unique structure of the program combined campus-based learning with online courses and worksite projects. This would make graduate education more accessible to nutrition professionals living in northern and rural communities. The challenge was daunting because the implementation would have to be planned, coordinated, and evaluated by me alone within a very short time frame.</p>
<p>As a program coordinator for academic public health nutrition programs, I was accustomed to working with other people to achieve common goals. All of my previous work experience had been team-oriented: large-scale food service operations, clinical care in hospital settings, program planning in community health centers, program evaluation in public health departments. Due to transition issues at the university, however, the responsibility for implementing this program would rest solely with me. The thought of having to do this without anyone to share ideas and concerns with was unsettling. In addition to feeling an added sense of accountability for the success of the new program, I wondered how the process of operating as a team of one, would differ from the collaborative efforts I was accustomed to. At the same time, I was intrigued by the prospect of working my way through a different approach. I saw my role and my challenge as an area for exploration.</p>
<p>I brainstormed ways of pursuing this exploration and what I increasingly perceived as working in isolation. I considered journaling and other reflective practices, but these reinforced my solitude. I thought about joining a blog or educator support group but (selfishly) felt I needed to engage with someone/others who were willing to listen and actively engage with me around the specifics of this particular program challenge. I thought of my colleague Jacqui and her deep appreciation for educational experiences. I suspected that she would understand my needs and wondered if she would meet with me periodically to discuss the challenges I was facing. Perhaps she could interview me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jacqui:</speaker>
<p>It was the fall 2007. We met at a local cafe to discuss the possibility of collaborating on an inquiry that Ann was considering related to the new master’s program that she was planning. Ann explained her idea and described the inquiry process as open and fluid, which was appealing to me. I welcomed the open space, the new and the unscripted. We agreed that our conversations would proceed with variable boundaries such that issues would be explored as they emerged in dialogue. I accepted her invitation.</p>
<p>Although we work at different institutions that provide different undergraduate and graduate programs in nutrition, we both belong to the profession of dietetics. I am relatively new to the academy, whereas Ann has been a program director at another university within the same city for several years. We share similar experiences of both frustration and celebration with the dietetics professions. We are passionate about dietetic scholarship in education and the arts. We review each other’s work in order to push discursive limits imposed by existing dietetic knowledge repositories. This project provided an opportunity to come to know anew of each other’s work in a manner that disrupted the taken for granted notions of “who” a dietetic scholar is and “what” she does. Ann’s invitation offered a fresh take on what I had come to know as a stylized and repetitive dietitian performativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800412452851">Butler, 1990</xref>) or what it is that dietitians do and how this doing constitutes a particular dietetic culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800412452851">Gingras, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800412452851">2009b</xref>).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ann:</speaker>
<p>We agreed to hold three interviews. The first was planned for just prior to the initial program launch (August 2007). The second would take place once the program was underway (October 2007) and the third would be held after the first semester of implementation was complete (January 2008). These seemed like logical points within the program implementation process to meet and were workable within both of our schedules. Two meetings were held in my office and one in Jacqui’s office. We agreed to audio-tape the conversations and have them transcribed by a professional transcriptionist so that we could “capture” our ideas without having to worry about documenting them during the process.</p>
<p>For the initial interview, I asked Jacqui to pose questions that she felt were relevant to the project and I requested that she comment freely, reply, or challenge me as she felt appropriate. For the subsequent two interviews, we decided to have more of a dialogue in which we discussed the challenges and opportunities we were both facing in implementing new programs. The interviews emerged more aptly as discussions or conversations. Following the three discussions, we wrote notes on our thoughts that arose during and after the sessions, and shared these with each other.</p>
</speech>

<title>Inside the Actors’ Studio</title>
<p>What follows are summaries of each of the three discussions and our personal responses to these. We offered the responses retrospectively to each other after the completion and transcription of all three discussions, and we note that our thinking, writing, and sharing remains a work in progress. Throughout this experience, we apply the notion of the Actors’ Studio as a metaphor for our exploration. The Actors’ Studio is an experimental place where actors can work together to develop their skills and take risks without the pressure of a formal role (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theater-dictionary.com/definition/Actors-Studio.html">http://www.theater-dictionary.com/definition/Actors-Studio.html</ext-link>). In this context, we see ourselves as academic actors, taking risks with methods and analysis, in the absence of the disciplinary pressures that normally require our work to be objective, quantifiable, and generalizable. We suspect that the Actors’ Studio provided for us, some of what collaborative writing with Deleuze provided for JKSB. We identify in particular with Bronwyn Davies’ poem about JKSB’s engagement with Deleuze, as it describes processes similar to ours.</p>

<p>Our geography is miles apart and our shoulder bags are backpacks, but we listened with all of our senses, spilled coffee, trembled, shivered, stuttered, and peeled off the taken-for-granted. In presenting our discussion summaries and responses to them, we include stanzas from this poem (though not in the original sequence), that speak to some of our experiences and insights. It seems that the Actors’ Studio, with its permeable walls and ceilingless access to sky, is also a space for collaborative writing. The italicized square bracketing of <italic>[Being in the Actors’ Studio]</italic> within the verses is our self-reminder of this metaphor. We do this with highest regard for the poet who we hope sees this as a tribute to her work and not interference with it.</p>

<title>Summary of Discussion 1 (D1)</title>
<p>During the first discussion, Jacqui asked questions about the program itself, how Ann had developed it and what Ann’s approach to planning had been. They also discussed teaching philosophies and different ways of involving students in planning. A predominant theme was Ann’s anxiety around being solely responsible for the outcome of the program. Ann speculated that perhaps her angst was in part due to the fact that she generally has strong “gut responses” but felt that she needed a better political sensibility about this program in order to develop intuitive responses. They also discussed risk-taking in education and in their careers. They expressed their mutual desire to embark in a “living” curriculum in which the evolving learning desires of students would direct the topics, methods, and sequencing of study without the prescribed approaches imposed by conventional course outlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800412452851">Bruce, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Ann’s Response:
<disp-quote>
<p>This discussion seemed to reflect my focus on the risks associated with implementing the new program. The “what ifs” as I referred to them, dominated so much of the conversation. For example, I wondered aloud:</p>
<p>What if no one applies? What if they find that they hate it? What if no one makes it through? What if What if What if? (D1 transcript, p. 21).</p>
<p>Jacqui’s efforts to understand both the program itself and the planning process that I was going through, enabled me, through my responses to her questions, to identify and name some of the things that I was anxious about. Her comments also helped me recognize that plans were in place to address many of my own concerns. At one point, she noted that in the face of this challenge, I seemed <italic>“too calm and so relaxed”</italic> (D1 transcript, p. 3). I was comforted by that remark. At least on the outside, I appeared to “have it together.” I went on to describe some of the steps I’d taken to avert the what-if scenarios, revealing to Jacqui and to myself, that in fact contingency plans had been considered.</p>
<p>Intriguing to me was our discussion about a living curriculum. The idea that students themselves <italic>“know what they need to learn about and are able to weave it into the curriculum”</italic> (D1 transcript, p. 7) as Jacqui described it, reinforced a longstanding desire to do away with course outlines for some of the curriculum and let students direct their own learning. Our shared understanding of the realities of current dietetic education allowed us to feed off of each other’s ideas for different ways of teaching and learning. My “problem” of autonomy might offer the freedom to try out some of these alternative approaches.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jacqui’s Response:
<disp-quote>
<p>In reflecting on our first discussion, I am made aware of the emotional dimension in our teaching and researching lives. I read of our passion, anxiety, excitement, and fear. I see the connections between these emotions and the act of trying something new and of moving from the status quo. I am also seeing that Ann defines programmatic success in terms of students’ relations with each other and with her, when she responds,</p>
<p>What would really inspire me and motivate me to keep going with this and make it better would be for that first group of students to . . . to really connect with each other, to be supportive of each other and to connect with me, to feel they have lots of support, and to feel that it was really worthwhile for them.</p>
<attrib>(D1 transcript, p. 12).</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I am intrigued by the connections between the emotional and the relational aspects of our dialogic inquiry.</p>

<title>Summary of Discussion 2 (D2)</title>
<p>This session took place in the thick of initial program implementation and the discussion captured the excitement and energy that Ann was experiencing. The students had provided much positive feedback and Ann was beginning to feel that the new graduate program might just work. This enthusiasm fueled Jacqui and Ann to “dream” about some of the changes they would like to see in dietetics education and how they could offer that education differently. They discussed some of the ways in which they had both incorporated content not deemed to be “required” for dietetics into their teaching, such as the ways in which the arts may be part of community dietetics practice. They noted that this sometimes necessitated disguising the content or not revealing that the material was being included, to avoid professional scrutiny. These kinds of subversive teaching strategies seemed to fuel their efforts to stimulate change within dietetics education.</p>
<p>Ann and Jacqui both noted that this conversation “felt better” than the first one because it was more like a discussion than an interview. Ann shared that the format of the first interview seemed like therapy. They then discussed the meaning of therapy and why it may or may not be helpful to this process.</p>
<p>Ann’s Response:
<disp-quote>
<p>I did not want this process to feel like therapy. I viewed therapy as a technique in which the therapist (interviewer) focused on the needs of the “client” (interviewee) and I wanted our conversations to reflect both of our needs and interests. I preferred to frame my interaction with Jacqui as a research interview, concerned with obtaining knowledge about the phenomenon of planning and implementing a new graduate program, not about bringing about changes in me. Perhaps my unease reflected my personal struggle to ensure that this process was rigorous by academic standards and not merely soul searching for answers to my own day-to-day problems. The notion of therapy challenged the concept I had of myself as an academic and as a researcher. I wondered if I was resisting my stated commitment to forms of research that in dietetics are considered unconventional (EG. narrative, autoethnography, storytelling) due to a buried allegiance to scientific paradigms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jacqui’s Response:
<disp-quote>
<p>In reflecting on the issue of therapy, I recall how we decided that initially Ann’s desire was to find someone to share some of her inner struggles with in a safe and confidential manner. We both agreed that the underpinning goal sounded like something one would find in therapy. I “jumped on” the idea that our discussions were like therapy since I place a very high regard on therapy and do not want to engage in reinforcing an antitherapy view. I recall sharing explicitly that it did feel like therapy to me since I viewed our relationship as the central feature in the learning that I enjoyed. In our relationship, I am learning about Ann and inevitably, I am learning about myself as a person-in-relation with Ann. I feel strongly in saying that our discussions were indeed therapeutic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800412452851">Robb, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800412452851">Walker &amp; Rosen, 2004</xref>) and ideally, mutually beneficial.</p>

<title>Summary of Discussion 3 (D3)</title>
<p>The initial angst of Discussion 1 seemed to be a feature of the distant past. The first phase of implementation was complete and Ann felt it was successful. Ann and Jacqui spent most of the time talking about how useful it had been to engage in these discussions. Setting aside a two-hour time period for focused discussion was enriching to both of them. They agreed that audio-taping the discussion kept them on a track of meaningful dialogue. They had a lengthy discussion about an insight Ann had from the second interview. When Jacqui had described her envy that Ann did not have to vet her plans for the program through an entire department infrastructure, Ann realized that that was an important element of working solo that concerned her. While the freedom was appreciated, Ann worried that by not having to defend her new program, she might be missing something or heading in the wrong direction. They were then able to discuss the value of dissenting opinions, of the process of validating one’s work, and the positive tension posed by alternative viewpoints. This was a major insight for Ann and enabled her to create some opportunities along the way to justify, to herself and others, that she was on the right track.</p>
<p>Ann’s Response:
<disp-quote>
<p>Jacqui’s expressed envy that I did not have to vet my program plans through other individuals or committees, while she was struggling in her own program to introduce curriculum changes, allowed me to recognize that this was a process that I was actually seeking. I have been in Jacqui’s situation of trying to usher educational change through administrative structures only to experience, as Jacqui seemed to be, the frustration of having to explain, defend, and convince decision makers of the merits of new ideas. Only now did it occur to me that this process of defense, and its inherent tension, was productive in not only persuading others of desired program benefits but also in reinforcing my own confidence in their merits. I responded to Jacqui:</p>
<p>I think that the tension, as bad as it might be, at least provides opportunities for other viewpoints and for some kind of balance so it’s not just the Jacqui master’s program as this is the Ann master’s program. I’m going to have to find some ways to get those kinds of dissenting opinions; so yeah, I’m a little envious that you have at least the opportunity to disagree about stuff because it means there’s other people working with you that care about it.</p>
<attrib>(D3 transcript page 11)</attrib>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>It seemed ironic that for me, dissenting opinions offered forward momentum. While Jacqui struggled to gain the support of her colleagues, I viewed their questioning and critique, as a sign of engagement, interest, and overall worth of the effort. This insight led me to actively create opportunities to seek external opinions, and “try out” my ideas on others. By engaging an external advisory committee in decision making and requesting external reviews from colleagues who I knew would challenge my thinking, I established my own process of validation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jacqui’s Response:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember vividly the feeling of envy that emerged in this last discussion. I was at the time mired in a stalled process where change was bedeviled and I was feeling frustrated by having too many people in the way of what I saw as transformative progress. I yearned to be solitary in this academic endeavor. As I sat with Ann and listened to her trepidation in being a lone voice, I came to experience greater compassion and patience for myself through my feeling empathy with her; a mutual empathy constituted by my feeling <italic>with</italic> her, not <italic>for</italic> her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800412452851">Jordan, 2000</xref>). I was reminded of the space between connection and disconnection and the struggle to accept and trust what had emerged and who I was becoming as an academic.</p>

</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the moments when I surrendered to my own authentic questions of Ann and her work, I found a synergy, a rhythm that was absent when I was more prescriptive (as I was in our first discussion); asking something to fill the space and trying too hard to sound sagacious (an “expert” performativity, no less). At the beginning of the third session, I admitted to the stiltedness I had brought to the first session, which I had perceived interfered with our discussion. I recall being very hesitant about disclosing this to Ann because I was worried that she would take her project elsewhere due to my inadequacies as a research partner. I realized that my anxiety (and my attempt at being the “wise expert”) was a marker for how connected I was to our research process and to our growing relationship. This way of acting inauthentic as a means for seeking greater connection is known as the relational paradox in relational-cultural theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800412452851">Walker, 2011</xref>). Likely, because of my understanding of the relational paradox, how this paradox functions in relationships that matter, and my trust of Ann, I took the risk to admit my disconnection and we started again from there with a renewed intrigue and energy for our method and enhanced trust towards each other.</p>

<title>Questions Encountered in the Actors’ Studio</title>
<p>We have endeavored to describe some of the insights we acquired about our own roles and practices as a result of this exploration. The opportunity to share our individual experiences and “unearth” some of the attributes and tensions inherent in both autonomous and team-base practice was valuable to us. We sense deeply that our work has taken us beyond our individual insights, however, and we revel in the freedom provided within the Actors’ Studio, to consider this further.</p>
<p>In <italic>Deleuze and Collaborative Writing : In Immanent Plane of Composition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>), JKSB present a play they created from a series of emails, written to each other over a period of many months as well as some of their thinking and writing that followed. The play is particularly thought provoking as it features French theorist Gilles Deleuze as a main character whose philosophies frame the group’s perspectives on collaborative writing. These perspectives have intrigued, challenged, and inspired us and we draw upon JKSB and their work with Deleuze to try to understand our own collaborative process. Participating in conversation about Ann’s new program permitted spontaneous questions and responses that brought about new insights for both Ann and Jacqui. Re-creating the dialogue in a textual format, and the written re-consideration of what was said, allowed both of us (Ann and Jacqui) to reflect upon and respond to our own and each-other’s comments. The strands of one response gradually became entwined with that of the other, raising new issues and provoking more discussion such that the elements of each person’s past experiences and present contributions to the dialogue were simultaneously distinct and blurred. In explaining the research strategy Collective Biography developed by Davies and Gannon (2006, 2009 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>), JKSB describe the situation in which listeners tell some of their own stories as a “way in” to the story being told by another. They suggest that the listener’s memory helps “tease out” the moment so it can be known both collectively and internally by both the listener and the storyteller. They explain that
<disp-quote>
<p>each storyteller knows their story differently, registering the multiple intensities, their own and others’, that make this moment live. Each listener in registering those multiple intensities, now closely linked and overlapping with their own intensities, their own memories, has become someone other than themselves, whose co-implication in the lives of others has become visible.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>In telling, listening, re-reading, and re-telling our stories, our co-implication in the lives of each-other is becoming visible. We borrow this idea from JKSB to suggest that what began as one colleague interviewing another about a professional experience, emerged as a collaborative story, told by both, as subjects of our own inquiry: a story that began long before this project as our education paths gradually brought us together, and one that remains unfinished, as our learning trajectories continue.</p>

<title>First Person Storytelling: How Do We Tell Our Story?</title>
<p>Much has been written about both the merits of storytelling as a method of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800412452851">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800412452851">Ellis &amp; Bochner, 2000</xref>; Manning &amp; Cullum-Swan, 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800412452851">Mishler, 1986</xref>), and more specifically, the value of writing from a first person perspective with narrative accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412452851">Ellis, 2000</xref>). In her efforts to describe the steps she takes to evaluate narrative ethnographies, Carolyn Ellis employs the first person to explain the questions she asks of a work under review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800412452851">Ellis, 2000</xref>) and, in so doing, highlights both her desire to encounter and her ability to present compelling stories and engaging characters. At the same time, use of the first person and the active voice have been criticized as efforts to dramatize texts (Tierney in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452851">Reed-Danahay, 2002</xref>), and reflexive disclosure by writers of their contextual connections to their work has been seen by some as a crisis of representation (Tierney in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800412452851">Reed-Danahay, 2002</xref>). The profession of dietetics has worked hard to position itself as a scientific endeavor. With its roots in nursing and home-economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800412452851">Cassell, 1990</xref>), dietetics as a female-dominated profession has actively employed the language, protocols, and practices of biomedicine in order to acquire the recognition and status associated with “legitimate” health professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800412452851">Liquori, 2001</xref>). Inherent in this quest is the unquestioned adoption of the scientific method, which ensures that the findings of experimental studies are generalizable across settings, are the result of the intervention being studied (as opposed to chance), and are free from bias, particularly those imposed by researchers and other confounding variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800412452851">Bauer, 1992</xref>). As such, scientific writing requires the author to write herself out of the text, implying that what is being described, through use of passive sentence structure, was not the result of human influence but rather of the scientific phenomenon being studied. The writing itself is put forward for review so that peers may replicate the work and validate its worth.</p>
<p>Human beings, however, create science; experiments do not spontaneously conduct themselves. We suggest that with the expulsion of the researcher, and in particular the first person, from our professional texts, comes the loss of relevant experience and context that reflect and contain the potential to impact the way we work and interpret our work. For example, first person accounts of dietitians’ experiences with community groups to address issues such as food security, maternal and child health, and living with chronic disease provide important insights that enable dietitians to develop the skills they need to be effective and compassionate practitioners. Our use of a combination of first person and third person narrative is therefore an explicit attempt to (re)position the human experience, our experiences, expressed through our telling and writing, at the core of the experimental paradigm. Ways of knowing that marginalize “the subject” have had such a powerful hold in dietetics traditionally and we recognize the limits that these empiricist approaches have on growing our body of knowledge. JKSB remind us:
<disp-quote>
<p>In telling, listening, questioning, writing, reading and rewriting our stories, a shift takes place. The memories are no longer told and heard as just autobiographical . . . but as opening up for, and in, each other, knowledges of being that previously belonged only to the other, as that other’s (often illegible) marks of identity. In working collectively with memories, we live intimately within our own bodies, and our bodies take on the intimate knowledge of each other’s being. Each subject’s specificity in its very particularity, in its sensory detail, becomes, through this process, the collectively imagined detail through which we know ourselves as human, even as more human- as human-in-relation, humans who are immersed in and emerge from the clamour of Being.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>, p. 11)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion of “human-in-relation” is also a prominent feature of Arthur Frank’s dialogical approach to qualitative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452851">Frank, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452851">Frank (2005)</xref> invokes the work of Russian literary philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin in defining dialogical research as offering “an account of how researcher and participant [come] together in some shared time and space and [have] diverse effects on each other” (p. 968.) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452851">Frank (2005)</xref> cautions against the danger of “finalizing” participants by describing them in definitive terms, which allow no room for change or growth. This tendency among researchers, he claims, sets up a monologue in which the researcher utters the last word about whom or what one has become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452851">Frank, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In JSKB’s play, Deleuze suggests that “in the act of writing there’s an attempt to make something more than personal, to free life from what imprisons it” (Deleuze, 1995, p.143 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>, p. 46). Rather than writing chapters, JKSB create a series of what Deleuze refers to as “plateaus.” “Deleuze and Guattari define these as “always in the middle, not at the beginning or the end. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800412452851">Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 1987</xref>, p. 25). JKSB explain that rather than producing “cumulative arguments and coherent conclusions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>, p. 15) their writing “invites lines of flight between its sections, between its writers and between its readers, that opens toward settlements and understandings that are merely momentary and always provisional” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>, p. 15), or as Frank would suggest, they are “unfinalized.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452851">Frank’s (2005)</xref> approach posits that research is one person’s representation of another and the voice of any character is formed in an ongoing process of anticipation and response to other voices. “Each voice always <italic>contains</italic> [emphasis in original] the voices of others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452851">Frank, 2005</xref>, p. 966). In dietetics, regrettably, we often perceive that in order to be recognized as credible and “to sustain the privilege of the profession, [we] must utter the definitive, finalizing word, about those who fall within [our] purview, whether these are patients, students, clients, or research participants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800412452851">Frank, 2005</xref>, p. 967). We think we must produce sequential arguments and evidence-based conclusions that leave little room for ambiguity, let alone the lines of flight sought by JKSB.</p>
<p>In contrast, this project allowed us (Ann and Jacqui) to “wander in imagination and thought” (Deleuze in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>, p. 17), anticipating and responding to each other’s voice, and analysing oneself and the other to generate responses. We have tried to understand each other’s current context and challenges without finalizing who we are or what we might do next. This has raised questions for us as we try to make sense of the therapeutic qualities of our project.</p>
<p>We do not seem to be alone in this regard. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412452851">Atkinson (1997)</xref>, in his critique of the “Narrative Turn” in qualitative research, notes that the interview as a device, lends itself to “preoccupations with the revelation of personal experience through confession and therapeutic discourse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412452851">Atkinson, 1997</xref>, p. 327). He suggests that the very notion of “in-depth interviews” often implies the ability to probe the surface of participants’ lives to make visible personal and private aspects of “experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412452851">Atkinson, 1997</xref>). He adds that the focus in some studies on empowerment and on promoting respondents’ insight into their own problems and experiences, suggests a “therapeutic and emancipatory” agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800412452851">Atkinson, 1997</xref>), rather than a purely methodological one. The therapeutic outcomes of this study however cannot be ignored. While Ann framed her original proposal to Jacqui in terms of academic inquiry, she also emphasized her need to better understand her current situation, and seek an opportunity for dialogue in a safe environment. These are goals often associated with therapeutic encounters. Perhaps, as Jacqui suggests in one of her responses, this is not an aspect to be disregarded, and she goes on to assert the value she ascribes to therapy, framed by relational-cultural theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800412452851">Walker &amp; Rosen, 2004</xref>). Perhaps this is an example of how dialogical research can, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800412452851">Tangaard (2009)</xref> suggests, allow for dissenting discourses to be made visible and relatable and be taken up in more academic contexts.</p>
<p>This example also reveals the presence, not only of our voices in the narratives, but of the institutions, colleagues, and people who surround us, interact with us and shape our day-to-day being. JKSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>, pp. 10-11), and Davies in particular (2000a and 2000b in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>), invoke Foucault’s notion of “savoir” to suggest that this kind of work goes beyond the phenomenological, or every day discourses to generate “thinking in order to know differently and in the process, being modified through what one comes to know” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800412452851">Wyatt et al., 2011</xref>, p. 11). Its focus is not so much therapeutic as it is discovering how we become and go on becoming subjects. Ann’s desire to situate this work within the rigors of the academy, reflect not only her position within the university where she works but also within a profession struggling to legitimize itself as a scientific enterprise. Jacqui’s desire to acknowledge and pay tribute to the therapeutic elements of the discussion reflects her commitment to representing alternative approaches to this research process, and those with whom she works toward this end. We have yet to resolve this issue, preferring instead to leave it unfinalized.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Being the subjects of our own inquiry has raised questions about research methods within our field of dietetics and the therapeutic effects of dialogical inquiry. Engaging in this exploration was a subversive and liberating turn from the usual confines imposed by the biomedical and administrative contexts within which we work. In this way, we moved from a systematic method of validation to an improvisational one. Our story(ies) began before our project started with our multiplicity of individual and collective experiences and with the various discourses in the academy, in the dietetics profession, and in our day-to-day being that brought us to know what we know. We created a plateau upon which we composed several storylines that took flight as we explored them further. This approach has offered a fertile and generative space for reflexivity and a different understanding of what it means to be engaged in research. Many questions remain as we linger in this studio space, unfinalized, energized, and yearning for the next act from which to take to take flight.</p>
