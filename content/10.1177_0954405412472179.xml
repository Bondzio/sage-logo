<abstract>
<p>The hardening of rivet hole is a mechanical process used to reduce the level of the resulting stresses due to loading in order to delay the crack initiation and propagation. This technique is used to improve fatigue life and to increase the intervals between structural inspections. The experimental tests have shown that the low residual stresses resulting from cold expansion and the first fatigue cracks are located at the entrance face used for hardening. To solve this problem, a double cold expansion of rivet hole in the opposite direction is proposed. This article presents the results of three-dimensional finite element simulation of double cold expansion process in the opposite direction using Abaqus software. The residual stress distribution in rivet hole of aluminum alloy Al2024-T3 induced by tapered pin was analyzed. The obtained results show that the residual stresses vary through the material depth, are maximal in mid-depth and are strong at the exit face and moderate at the entrance face. They also show that the double cold expansion in the opposite direction increases the residual stresses at the entrance face of the pin, and these stresses reached the values of those generated on the exit face, enhancing the fatigue life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cold working of a rivet hole is a mechanical technique; an oversized ball or a tapered pin can be forced through the hole locally yielding the material to create a plastic region. The resulting compressive residual stresses around the edges of the hole are very beneficial at resisting fatigue; it can delay crack initiation and slow their propagation. The X-ray diffraction measurements of the residual stresses showed that these stresses were low at the entrance face of the pin and maximum at the exit face.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954405412472179">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954405412472179"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954405412472179">3</xref></sup> Fatigue tests of specimens with cold-worked hole have shown the beneficial effects of residual stresses in decreasing the velocity of crack propagation and improving the fatigue life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954405412472179">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954405412472179">3</xref></sup> and they also showed that the primary cracks were initiated at the entrance face of the pin where the residual stresses are low compared to those at the exit face.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954405412472179">4</xref></sup> For these reasons, and to solve this problem, we proposed in this article a solution of double cold expansion in the opposite direction to the first one to further enhance the level of residual stresses at the entrance face and to improve again the fatigue life. Three-dimensional (3D) model was used for simulating the cold working process using the finite element code Abaqus. The analysis of residual stress distribution was carried out in both entrance and exit faces and in mid-depth of hardened material. The simulation results were compared with those obtained experimentally using X-ray diffraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954405412472179">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Numerical simulation</title>
<p>A 3D model was used for simulating the cold expansion process using tapered pin. The geometry of this model is a rectangular plate (150 mm × 50 mm × 5 mm) with a central hole. The Abaqus finite element code was used to carry out the analysis. We chose an elastoplastic model where the pin is supposed infinitely rigid.</p>
<p>The 3D model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954405412472179">Figure 3</xref> and consists of one set of elements for the plate and another set of elements for the pin. In this study, eight-node linear isoparametric cubic elements were used. This type of element is adapted in the case of elastoplastic calculations.</p>
<p>Only a quarter of the plate and pin were modeled due to their double symmetry with respect to the <italic>X</italic>–<italic>Z</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>–<italic>Z</italic> planes. The model is immobilized in translation along the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic> axes. It is also immobilized in translation along the <italic>y</italic> axis and in rotation about the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>z</italic> axes. To avoid singularity, the model is finally fixed by <italic>z</italic> on both sides of the hole on the underside. The mesh is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954405412472179">Figure 2</xref>; the pin is initially put in contact with the hole at the entrance face of the specimen. The interaction between the surface of the hole and the tapered pin is modeled in three dimensions using a small sliding formulation in which the contacting surfaces can only undergo relatively small sliding relative to each other. With this approach, one surface definition provides the master surface and the other surface definition provides the slave surface. A kinematic constraint that the slave surface nodes do not penetrate the master surface is then enforced. In order to simulate the expansion process, a displacement in the <italic>z</italic> direction is applied to the pin from the entrance face to the exit face; for this, a load of 10 kN is used. A total displacement of 12 mm of the pin was modeled by 10 successive steps. This displacement is selected to ensure a complete passage of the pin (7 mm in length) through the hole (5 mm in length) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954405412472179">Figure 1</xref>). For convergence, each time it is automatically divided into several increments.</p>

<title>Effect of friction coefficient on the variation of residual stresses</title>
<p>To illustrate the effect of friction coefficient between the pin and the hole surface, cold expansion process has been simulated with and without friction coefficient. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954405412472179">Figure 3</xref> shows the effect of friction on the variation of residual stresses; a friction coefficient of 0.17 was used.

Residual stresses at the entrance face are always lower than those at the exit face, and it has been concluded that the increase in the DCE from 2% to 4.5% increases the level of residual stress about 30% and an increase from 4.5% to 6% increases residual stresses about 10%.

Hence, enhancing the level of residual stresses at the entrance face can delay the crack initiation and propagation. To have an idea of the effect of double cold expansion on residual stress distribution, we have simulated again a new process of cold expansion in the opposite direction to the first one for the three degrees (2%, 4.5% and 6%). The residual stresses resulting in the first cold expansion have been maintained.

We can clearly see the beneficial effect of a second cold expansion in enhancing the compressive residual stresses level on the entrance face used for the first cold expansion. This finding allowed us to delay the crack initiation and propagation first detected (experimentally) on the entrance face used for the first cold expansion process, which can enhance the fatigue life of rivet holes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Experimentally, by the X-ray diffraction measurements, it has been found that residual stresses are low at the entrance face of the pin and maximum at the exit face. Fatigue tests have also shown the beneficial effects of compressive residual stresses and that cracks are first initiated on the entrance face where the residual stresses are low compared to those at the exit face. For these reasons, the purpose of this work was to study the effect of the double expansion of rivet hole on residual stress distribution in aluminum alloy 2024-T3 using the Abaqus code. The obtained results have shown that we can enhance the level of residual stresses at the entrance face by double cold expansion process in the opposite direction, which can delay the crack initiation and propagation at this face. Low error rate has been recorded in comparison between experimental results and our finite element simulation for DCE of 5%. In summary, this work allowed us to identify the following deductions and conclusions:</p>
<list id="list1-0954405412472179" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The friction between the contact surfaces (pin–hole) increases the values of the compressive residual stresses.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Residual stresses are not constant; they vary through the depth of the plate.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The area of maximum stresses is located between the mid-depth and the exit face of the plate.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Residual stresses at the entrance face are consistently lower compared to those at the exit face.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Residual stress distribution shows that they are maximal around the hole and minimal away from the hole.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The increase of the DCE from 2% to 4.5% increases the residual stress level about 30%.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The increase of the DCE from 4.5% to 6% increases the residual stress level about 10%.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The optimum DCE is probably between 4% and 5%.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>At 20% of the cold expansion process, the stresses are tensile.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>At 60% of the cold expansion process, the stresses reached maximum values in tension.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>At 100% of the cold expansion process, stresses are compression and to about −300 MPa at the exit face.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To solve the problem of the beginning of crack initiation at the entrance face (observed experimentally), a double cold expansion in the opposite direction to the first one is proposed.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The numerical model was validated by a comparison with experimental results (low error rate).</p>
