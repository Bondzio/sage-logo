         <title>Recognition of an Indian adoption</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Re R (A Child) [2012]</italic>
         </p>
         <p>High Court Family Division Hedley J</p>
         <p>24 October 2012 [2012] EWHC 2956 (Fam)</p>
         <p>R was a four-year-old child, born and living in India. His parents could not care for him and the plan was for him to be placed within the extended family. KK and KL were a married couple living in England, part of the family network, who were unable to have children and offered to adopt R. Although India is a signatory to the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, it does not allow private adoptions to be made under the Convention. In 2009 the couple went through a religious adoption ceremony in India and registered the adoption by deed in a local court. This was a valid adoption under Indian law. They were later advised that this was unlikely to be recognised by the English courts and they made a further application for an adoption under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956. This involves a home study report and prioritises the welfare of the child. After the Indian adoption KL spent much of her time in India caring for the child; the UK immigration authorities would not recognise the Indian adoption in order to allow R to be brought to the UK.</p>

            <title>Held</title>
            <p>The court would recognise the Indian adoption so long as it would have fulfilled the requirements of a domestic adoption. This meant that the advice that the religious adoption was insufficient was almost certainly right, but the second adoption, requiring a rigorous home study, could be recognised. The court also considered the requirement that at least one of the adopting couple would have had to be domiciled in the country when the adoption took place, or both would have had to be habitually resident for at least a year. The court found that the husband had retained his domicile of origin in India and was therefore willing to recognise the adoption as valid in England.</p>

            <title>Comment</title>
            <p>The judge recognised that this was not likely to be an unusual situation and offered this case as guidance for how similar situations should be approached. The difficulties in adopting a family member from India should not be underestimated. The UK Border Agency will not issue a dependant’s visa for a child found to have been ‘gifted’ by a family member and so the application has to be made in the UK while the child remains in India. The child will need, therefore, to have the adoption recognised and for one of the adopters to be a UK citizen and able to confer British citizenship on the child (obviating the need for a visa). This may not always be compatible with the need to prove domicile in India. Adopters must also remember that even where an adoption is recognised under English law, it is an offence under section 83 of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 to bring a child into the country within 12 months of an external adoption unless they have complied with the Adoption with a Foreign Element Regulations 2005.</p>

         <title>Special guardianship support: responsible authority</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Suffolk CC v Nottinghamshire CC</italic>
         </p>
         <p>Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Thorpe &amp; Black LJJ, Hedley J</p>
         <p>11 December 2012 [2012] EWCA Civ 1640</p>
         <p>CS and KS were born in March 2010 and March 2011 respectively to young and vulnerable parents. Nottinghamshire County Council issued care proceedings and CS was placed in foster care by consent, in July 2010, after a residential assessment ended. Family members HB and CY were identified as potential carers for CS and he was placed with them under a residence order in October 2011. When KS was born he stayed with his mother in various placements for nine months, then moved with her agreement to live with HB and CY. The agreed plan was for HB and CY to become special guardians to both children. Nottinghamshire carried out the assessments of the couple and drew up a support plan involving both services and financial support.</p>
         <p>HB and CY lived in Suffolk, and Nottinghamshire passed their support plan to Suffolk with the intention that Suffolk should provide the services as the responsible authority. Suffolk refused on the basis that they had not carried out their own assessment and that they took the view that the couple may not qualify for financial support under Suffolk’s criteria. The County Court ordered that Suffolk be responsible for providing the services and financial support to HB and CY. Suffolk appealed.</p>
         <sec id="sec5-0308575913478782">
            <title>Held</title>
            <p>The Court of Appeal held that the key question in deciding the responsible authority is whether the child is looked after by a local authority. CS had been accommodated under section 20 by Nottinghamshire, but had been placed with HB and CY on the making of an interim residence order. KS had never been accommodated and had been placed with HB and CY by his mother. It was clear that in these circumstances the responsible authority was Suffolk, where the children and prospective special guardians now lived.</p>

            <title>Comment</title>
            <p>The court observed that this situation was not uncommon, and made additional comments to assist future cases. It is of critical importance that proper consideration be given to whether a child placed out of area should remain looked after or be made the subject of a residence order. The local authorities involved should co-operate from the earliest stage and have the power to make sensible arrangements between themselves wherever legal responsibility actually lies. The Court of Appeal also reiterated that the court has no power to make directions about payment of money or provision of services in special guardianship, although they may express opinions and of course the ultimate decision about whether to make the order rests with the judge.</p>

            <italic>N (A Child) [2012]</italic>
         </p>
         <p>Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Hallett &amp; McFarlane LLJ</p>
         <p>31 October 2012 [2012] EWCA Civ 1563</p>
         <p>N was born in April 2011, to a mother who had previously had two children removed into care. The parents had failed to file their final evidence as directed but had attended their solicitors’ office a few days before the issue resolution hearing and had given instructions to draw up statements. The judge did not accept that there were sufficient reasons for the failure to file evidence and decided that the threshold criteria had been made out on the evidence filed in previous proceedings and by the local authority. She found that it would not be in the child’s interests to delay matters any further and proceeded to make care and placement orders, dispensing with the parents’ consent to adoption. The parents appealed.</p>
         <sec id="sec8-0308575913478782">
            <title>Held</title>
            <p>While the court accepted that it was not impossible that a final order could be made at an issues resolution hearing, the judge had been too robust in not even allowing the parents to make representations about whether she should make final orders. Counsel for the child had put forward several possible ways in which the parents’ right to a fair trial could have been respected without significant delay for the child.</p>
            <p>The appeal was granted and remitted for a further issues resolution hearing.</p>

            <p>Court of Appeal (Civil Division) Thorpe, Hallett and McFarlane LLJ</p>
            <p>[2012] EWCA Civ 1281</p>
            <p>The judge at first instance made care and placement orders, and after giving judgment was reminded that there was an outstanding application for the annual provision of a passport-sized photograph of the child to the father. He granted the application without hearing the local authority’s objections.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="sec9-0308575913478782">
            <title>Held</title>
            <p>The Court of Appeal adjourned to request reasons from the judge, but those received were challenged by the local authority as not properly representing the psychological evidence received. The court noted that although it appeared to be a very small issue, it still merited proper consideration of the welfare of the child. She derived no benefit from the provision of the photograph and may find it impossible to understand why she has been put in the position of participating in the process.</p>
            <p>The court found that the judge had given insufficient or erroneous reasons for making the order for a photograph and set it aside.</p>
