<abstract>
<p>Older adults who live alone are at risk for problems (e.g., falling, sudden illness). To maintain themselves safely at home they may benefit from planning to prevent problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an intervention designed to train family members or friends as to how to help older adults who were living alone make plans to maintain independence safely in their homes and to make behavioral and household changes to enhance safety. Support network members of 19 older adults randomly assigned to the intervention group were taught to use multiple segment vignettes to assist the older adults in creating plans for living safely. Older adults in the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 21) were asked to engage in an unstructured discussion about home safety with their network members. Older adults in the intervention group developed safer plans and made more household and behavioral changes than did control group adults.</p>

<p>An estimated 11.3 million adults aged 65 years or older live alone in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1074840712471900">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Aging, 2011</xref>). To do so, older people rely on support networks of helpers including family, friends, and neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840712471900">Porter, Ganong, Drew, &amp; Lanes, 2004</xref>). With the aid and support of these networks, older adults often remain at home with some degree of safety and comfort. Older rural adults are as likely to have such support networks as urban-dwelling elders. However, rural elders face health-care accessibility disparities, including a lack of chronic illness care and end-of-life care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840712471900">Artnak, McGraw, &amp; Stanley, 2011</xref>). Moreover, critical emergency care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712471900">McSwain, Rotando, Meade, &amp; Dochesne, 2012</xref>), pre-hospital care, and decisions to transfer to resource-abundant trauma centers are important to the survival of older adults following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712471900">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, access problems remain for rural residents even after the establishment of the critical access hospital network in these areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712471900">Lipsky &amp; Glasser, 2011</xref>). Consequently, older rural adults might rely more on informal support networks than do urban dwellers. Support networks of rural elders, however, may be stressed by the responsibility and have fears that something could happen to the older adult when they are not available to help. Such concerns may lead network members to pressure older adults to acquire more in-home help or to move to a more supervised living situation—options that are potentially expensive and disruptive to privacy and autonomy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most older rural adults want to live independently as long as they can, despite the potential risks such as falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712471900">McMahon &amp; Fleury, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712471900">Rubenstein &amp; Josephson, 2002</xref>) or sudden health problems (e.g., strokes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840712471900">Srikanth et al., 2009</xref>] and vertigo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712471900">Deandrea et al., 2010</xref>]). Every year about 300,000 adults over age 65 years who live alone are unable to reach help after a fall or sudden illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712471900">Campion, 1996</xref>), albeit some older people handle emergencies successfully while living alone without reaching help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712471900">Porter &amp; Markham, 2012</xref>). The problem of not being able to reach help led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712471900">Nehmer, Becker, Kleinberger, and Prückner (2010)</xref> to investigate the utility of electronic sensors to detect and alert Emergency Medical Services (EMS) of an elder’s fall or other health emergency. Although recent estimates of the number of falls are not available, demographic changes and the tendency for elders to age in place have likely increased the number of older adults who are unable to reach help. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840712471900">Tierney et al.’s (2004)</xref> study, cognitive impairment exacerbated the risk of experiencing a harmful event while living alone. Nearly 22% of their sample (<italic>n</italic> = 139) experienced some harm while living alone.</p>
<p>Some older adults who live alone subscribe to personal emergency response systems (PERS) or have other electronic communication devices (e.g., portable phones or cell phones) that can enhance a sense of security for them and members of their support networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712471900">Porter, 2005</xref>). Unfortunately, buying a PERS or other assistive mechanism is not sufficient to ensure that older adults can reach help quickly in an emergency—they do not always wear the devices, forget they have them, or forget how to use them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712471900">Porter, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712471900">2008</xref>). Moreover, the expenses related to assistive devices may discourage some older adults from obtaining them, and there is stigma associated with the use of PERS, at least for some older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840712471900">Porter &amp; Ganong, 2002</xref>). Even older adults who have assistive technology devices and know how to use them may benefit from a “planning coach” to provide instruction on how to live alone safely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712471900">Porter, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Members of an older adult’s support network have advantages as “planning coaches” because (a) they are trusted by older adults, (b) they know the older adults well and so can anticipate potential difficulties in developing plans to safely live alone, and (c) they live nearby and may have regular contact so that they can help older adults recall their plans to maintain independence safely or to help develop new plans when circumstances change. Furthermore, older persons are not necessarily responsive to advice offered by strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840712471900">McNulty, Johnson, Poole, &amp; Winkle, 2003</xref>), and instead tend to consult with their children and sometimes other support network members about strategies to maintain themselves safely in their homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712471900">Porter, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate two outcomes of an intervention designed to train support network members (i.e., family members, close friends) how to help older rural adults maintain independence safely in their homes: (a) developing plans to avoid problems and reach help quickly in emergencies, and (b) making household and behavioral changes. Older adults and a support network member of their choosing were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Support network members in the intervention group were taught how to use multiple segment factorial vignettes (MSFV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712471900">Ganong &amp; Coleman, 2006</xref>) to help older adults create plans to prevent household emergencies and to seek help in a home emergency. MSFVs are stories about hypothetical characters that are presented in separate segments. Vignette approaches have long been used in the training of health-care professionals and health-care quality evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712471900">Peabody, Luck, Glassman, Presselhaus, &amp; Lee, 2000</xref>). More recently, vignettes have been used to evaluate practitioners’ attitudes toward various health-care issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712471900">Schwappach, Frank, &amp; Davis, in press</xref>). Traditionally, vignettes have been used by health-care researchers to focus on the health-care <italic>provider</italic>, whereas their use in this intervention would be akin to the patient’s support network administering vignettes to the patient to encourage behavior or attitude change. Support network members in the control group were asked to discuss household safety with the older adult. We hypothesized that older adults in the intervention group would create more effective plans to maintain themselves safely in their homes than would control group older adults. We also hypothesized that intervention group older adults would make more changes to either their households or their behaviors than control group adults would.</p>

<title>Recruiting Older Adults and Support Network Members</title>
<p>The study was approved by the University of Missouri IRB (#144538). Older adults were recruited in several ways. Advertisements were placed in local newspapers; volunteers were asked to call the project office. Project brochures and posters with detachable cards with the project phone number were displayed at senior centers, physicians’ offices, and congregate meal sites. Snowball sampling also was used. To be eligible, older adults had to (a) be age 75 or older, (b) live alone, (c) be cognitively capable of participating in the project, and (d) have a support network member living close enough to them to participate in the project. In lieu of an honorarium, older adults were offered inexpensive items related to household safety (e.g., flashlights, first-aid kits).</p>
<p>When older adults called to volunteer, we briefly explained the project and asked them to identify a member of their support network who would be willing to talk with them about ways to maintain themselves safely at home. Support network members had to (a) be at least 18 years of age, (b) live close enough to be trained by project staff, and (c) be able to visit the older adult. The older adults asked their support network member to contact the project office or they obtained permission to allow project staff to contact the network member. Once a support network member volunteered to participate, a research assistant met separately with both the older adult and network member, either in their homes or in a public location such as a library, to complete informed consent documents and to gather demographic data. The assessment of older adults’ cognitive capacity was pragmatic; if they understood directions at the initial meeting and were not confused about the project, we considered them cognitively capable to participate.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Older adult-support network member dyads were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control groups. In both groups the support network members were the focus of the training (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840712471900">Figure 1</xref>). After the initial meeting, older adults were not contacted again until posttest data collection. All meetings with participants, support network member training sessions, and posttest data collection sessions were recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>

<title>Intervention</title>
<p>MSFVs have previously been used only in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712471900">Ganong &amp; Coleman, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712471900">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712471900">2006c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712471900">Ganong, Coleman, &amp; Rothrauff, 2009</xref>), but were adapted in this project as teaching tools with support network members who were randomly assigned to the intervention group. MSFVs are stories about hypothetical characters that are presented in separate segments. After each segment, participants are asked a series of questions about the characters portrayed in the vignette. In this project, the research team devised MSFVs portraying older adults living alone who experienced various emergencies, such as falling, facing a natural disaster (e.g., ice storm, flood), suddenly becoming ill (e.g., flu-like symptoms, a stroke), forgetting medications, causing a fire, and encountering an unwanted stranger. The emergency topics and health issues were chosen based on findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712471900">Porter and Markham’s (2012)</xref> previous work regarding the vulnerabilities of rural older adults and their concerns about reaching help quickly during an emergency. The emergency concerns specific to natural disasters were chosen based on the prevailing weather patterns and environmental threats (e.g., tornados, ice storms, flooding) of the geographic region in which the study took place. The research team consisted of three gerontologists, one of whom was a registered nurse specializing in geriatric care, and three advanced gerontology doctoral students who served as research assistants. Each MSFV was edited and reviewed by all members of the research team to ensure content validity among the MSFVs. The MSFVs were additionally pilot tested with two older adult volunteers from the community. The pilot testing session served two purposes: (a) it offered further validation testing of the MSFVs by allowing the older adult volunteers to provide feedback regarding the concepts being measured, and the readability/clarity of the MSFVs, and (b) it served as a training session for the research assistants who would be administering the intervention and posttesting. The pilot testing session was videotaped so that the research team could later review the tape and make suggestions for adjusting facilitation and interviewing styles accordingly.</p>
<p>The MSFVs were intended to introduce in a nonconfrontational, nonpatronizing, and nonthreatening manner the difficult issues of planning how to prevent household problems and how to reach help quickly in emergencies. We expected that exposure to these hypothetical situations would enable older adults to consider their own potential risks for such situations with less defensiveness than if they were asked directly to consider their personal safety. The following is an example vignette:</p>
<list id="list1-1074840712471900" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Segment 1: Mrs. Smith lives alone on the farm she and her deceased husband worked for 35 years. She is about 80 and gets around well, but she has been bothered by arthritis in her legs and hands for several years, so she recently started using a cane. Twice in the last few months Mrs. Smith has fallen when she went to the bathroom at night, but both times she was able to get up and was not badly hurt. She wants to stay in her home as long as she can, but she has wondered how she would reach help if she fell again and could not get to the telephone.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Support network members were taught to ask the older adults after each segment: “What would you advise her to do?”; “What would you want to know about if you were her?” and “What would you do if you were in Mrs. Smith’s situation?” These questions were developed based on prior MSFV instruments used in research with established reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712471900">Ganong &amp; Coleman, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712471900">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712471900">2006c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712471900">Ganong, Coleman, &amp; Rothrauff, 2009</xref>). A series of probing questions (e.g., Can you tell me more about that? Is there anything else?) also were taught to the support network members to help them elicit responses to the initial questions. Here is segment 2:</p>
<list id="list2-1074840712471900" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Segment 2: Mrs. Smith’s son, Ray, lives several miles away in the next town, but makes a point to call her often and stop by when he can after work. Ray also is concerned about his mother’s falls, and wants to help her do whatever it takes to keep her safely in her home. One evening, Ray suggests to Mrs. Smith that she might want to get one of those “emergency buttons” that he read about in a brochure. Mrs. Smith has some friends who wear a special emergency button so they can contact help right away, but she does not have the health problems those people have. She thinks she can get along fine without a button; she has a phone in her living room. Mrs. Smith has some questions about those buttons.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As after segment 1, support network members were taught to ask: “What would you advise her to do?”; “What would you want to know about if you were her?” and “What would you do if you were in Mrs. Smith’s situation?” They were instructed to use probing questions to follow-up.</p>
<list id="list3-1074840712471900" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Segment 3: Mrs. Smith wonders if she can figure out a way to rely on help from her friends, neighbors, and family if she needs to reach help quickly if she falls.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This was followed by more questions and probes to stimulate thinking.</p>
<p>The intervention group support network members had two training sessions with research assistants about how to use the vignettes in collaboration with the older adults. In the first training session, which lasted a mean of 1.5 hr, support network members were given three MSFVs to use with older adults and instructions on how to use them. Support network members and research assistants then role-played using the MSFVs, with the research assistant modeling how to use them and answering questions.</p>
<p>Following practice with the MSFVs, research assistants helped network members create an “individualized” MSFV involving a fictional character facing problems similar to those the older adult had encountered or might encounter. The goal was to create a MSFV with which the older adult could strongly identify. The individualized MSFV took into account older adults’ needs: personal resources, daily household activities, structural household features, availability of a support network, and their attitudes about using technology (i.e., PERS, computers). This MSFV was designed to be used when network members met with their older adults.</p>
<p>At the second and final training session, which lasted a mean of one hour, network members were asked again to role play: (a) a sample MSFV and (b) the individualized MSFV created in session 1. Throughout training, support network members were encouraged to ask questions about probes they might use with the older adults. After session 2, the network member was asked to schedule a 1-hr meeting with the older adult for the purpose of helping the older adult develop an individualized plan for maintaining household safety and reaching help quickly in an emergency. To facilitate the meeting, the network member used the three training MSFVs plus the individualized MSFV that was developed during the second training session. We asked support network members to meet with their older adults within 2 weeks of the final training session, and to call the project office afterwards. Support network members reported later that sessions with the older adults lasted between 23 and 150 min, with most being about an hour (mean meeting time = 62.46 min).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1074840712471900">
<title>Control</title>
<p>Support network members assigned to the control group met once with a research assistant in a private location of their choice. Unlike the intervention group, the control group network members were not trained to use the MSFVs. They were given one page of information about the importance of planning for household emergencies that older adults could face and a list of typical emergencies (e.g., medication issues, falls). The purpose of this information was to give the control group support network members some talking points to emulate a typical conversation that would occur between an older adult and a family member about the topic of maintaining household safety while living alone. Control group network members were asked to have a 1-hr conversation with the older adults about how they might prevent emergencies at home and reach help quickly if necessary. The range of time of actual meetings between control group support network members and older adults was 40 to 90 min, with a mean of 63.33 min per meeting. The goal of the conversation was to help the older adult develop an individualized plan for reaching help quickly and maintaining household safety. Support network members were asked to call the research office after they had met with the older adults. If they had not called within 2 weeks, we called to remind them to have the conversation within the next week.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Participants in this project were 40 dyads consisting of older adults ranging in age from 75 to 97 years, living alone in one of seven counties in a Midwestern state and a support network member of their choosing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712471900">Table 1</xref>). The majority of the older participants were female, identified themselves as White, were retired, and considered themselves to be in good to excellent health. Most were widowed; the remaining participants were either divorced or separated (15%), never married (10%), or were married and living apart from their spouses (5%). The majority of older adults had at least one living child (78%), with a mean distance between the older adults and their closest child of 351.81 miles (<italic>SD</italic> = 1004.16, range: “less than a mile” to 5,000 miles). The time they had lived alone ranged from 2 months to 50 years and the range of time living in the current residence was 3 months to 56 years. These older adults generally were well educated, with 20% having high school diplomas, 13% having had some college, 23% having 2- or 4-year college degrees, and 28% with postgraduate training.</p>

<p>Of the 40 older adults, 25 (63%) indicated that they had experienced at least one situation that could have required them to reach help quickly since living alone; some participants indicated multiple situations. The most common reasons participants noted for needing help quickly were falls and illness, with other reasons including cuts/injuries, house or cooking fires, and home emergencies (e.g., furnace problems). At the time of the study, all older adults in both the control and intervention groups owned at least one communication device but they did not all use them to seek help. These communication devices included landline telephones (95%), cell phones (70%), computers with Internet access (57.5%), and personal emergency response systems (e.g., Lifeline, Life Alert; 35%). Seven older adults had all four devices.</p>
<p>Most support network members were White (95%), female (78%), currently employed part-time or full-time (63%), and lived an average of 7.65 miles from the older adult (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.76, range: “less than a mile” to 35 miles). Forty-eight percent of the support network members were married; the rest were widowed (20%), divorced (18%), never married (13%; includes one cohabiting network member), or separated (3%). The support network members (<italic>M</italic><sub>age</sub> = 61.05 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.01, range: 35 to 86 years) included: 13 friends, 14 daughters, 5 sons, 12 daughters-in-law, 2 sisters, 2 sisters-in-law, 1 niece, and 1 ex-husband. These support network members were well educated, with 15% having high school diplomas, 15% having had some college, 38% having 2- or 4-year college degrees, and 28% with postgraduate training.</p>

<title>Posttest Data Collection With Older Adults</title>
<p>Older adults in both control and intervention groups were interviewed within 4 weeks after support network members and older adults met with each other. The older adult was first asked if he or she had a plan to maintain themselves safely at home (e.g., “Do you have a plan to reach help in the case of a household emergency”), and if so, to describe the plan in as much detail as possible. Following this, two hypothetical MSFVs in which an older adult was portrayed as needing help were read aloud. After each segment of the vignettes, older adults were asked what the vignette character should do: (a) “What would you recommend Mr. Brown [the character] do in the emergency situation?”; and (b) “How would you respond if you were in the situation?” These vignettes were designed to stimulate thinking about handling emergencies and about preventing problems. To maintain consistency, posttest interviewers were asked to probe only once after each question. Two posttest vignettes were randomly selected. Every participant heard a vignette about a fall and a vignette about another household emergency. Posttest vignettes were not the same as the training vignettes.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section9-1074840712471900">
<title>Plans to maintain safety</title>
<p>The research assistants asked the older adults in both the control and intervention groups about their plans at postproject only because we were concerned that preproject testing would condition them to the task and perhaps result in preemptive planning that might reduce the effectiveness of the intervention. At the posttest, older adults in both groups responded to open-ended questions about their plans to maintain themselves safely in their homes. They were then presented with two randomly selected MSFVs created for the posttest and asked open-ended questions about (a) how the vignette characters should respond to the portrayed emergencies, and (b) what they would do if faced with the same emergencies as in the vignettes. The length of posttest interviews averaged 1 hr.</p>
<p>The original analytic plan was to separately rate older adults’ personal safety plans, their suggestions for the vignette characters’ safety, and their speculations about what they would do in the vignette emergencies. It was impossible, however, to distinguish these as independent answers; the older adults usually responded to questions about vignette characters by answering what <italic>they</italic> would do if they found themselves in the vignette situations. When they offered suggestions for what the vignette character should do, they usually indicated they would take the same actions in that situation.</p>
<p>Consequently, in order to evaluate the intervention with respect to the older adults’ plans to reach help in the event of an emergency, a single Safety, Feasibility, and Thoroughness Rating Rubric (SFTRR; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1074840712471900">Table 2</xref>) was developed for this study to assess the safety, feasibility, and thoroughness of older adults’ qualitative responses to posttest interviews. The SFTRR was based on the principles that a plan would allow the older adult to reach help quickly without being placed in additional danger, would be realistic for the older adult to implement, and would contain multiple strategies to reach help. Using these standards, the research team developed and revised the criteria for each score in the SFTRR after reaching consensus about the common elements in plans for each score. For example, the researchers made judgments about the use of both human helpers and technology to seek help safely and the recognition of potential flaws in plans that warranted additional steps in order to reach help or maintain safety. Each posttest interview was read by at least four members of the research team and rated by at least three of them. Differences in ratings were settled by discussion and final scores represent consensus.</p>

<p>The range of possible scores was 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicated that the older adult had <italic>No Plan</italic>, while a 1 indicated an <italic>Unsafe Plan</italic> that was generally simple, with no consideration of potential barriers to carrying out the plan, limited or no use of technological devices or support network members as helpers, and contained unrealistic elements (e.g., the older adult plans to phone for help, yet only one phone exists in the entire home). A score of 2 on the rubric indicated a <italic>Minimally Safe Plan</italic>; some awareness of possible barriers to the plan were presented, there were mentions of either technological devices or network members as aids, and some contingencies were included if an accident or emergency occurred. A score of 3 meant that the plan was an <italic>Extremely Safe Plan</italic>, had few flaws, and that contingencies and redundancies were presented. Extremely Safe Plans included back-up systems, contacts with multiple network members, and alternatives if something went wrong with the original plan for reaching help or maintaining safety.</p>

<title>Household and behavioral changes</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the intervention with respect to changes made by the older adults after their involvement in the study, older adults’ behavioral and household changes were coded from postproject interviews with older adults. Behavioral changes were defined as actions taken by the older adult due to the project to increase their safety by either reducing the likelihood of encountering problems or increasing the likelihood they could reach helpers quickly in case of an emergency. Household changes included modifications to their dwellings or furnishings that enhanced household safety. Changes were coded by two of the research team members independently and final codes were based on agreement among the coders.</p>

<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>Although dyads were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups, the nature of the qualitative posttest data collection led us to examine data for inconsistencies before we compared the groups. Because some randomly selected vignettes in the posttest might have elicited more complex responses than others, we compared length of the interviews (number of transcript pages) and SFTRR scores. There was no evidence that specific pairs of vignettes stimulated longer, more complex responses, nor was there evidence that specific pairs of vignettes encouraged safer, more effective plans.</p>
<p>Statistical tests (i.e., χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>t</italic> tests) were run to examine if the two groups of older adults and support network members were different on demographic characteristics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712471900">Table 1</xref>). There were no significant differences between the intervention and control group older adults on gender, race, employment status, marital status (widowed vs. some other marital status), age, and time lived at their current residence. There also was no difference between intervention and control groups in having previous experiences in needing to reach help quickly at home. Older adults in the control group, however, had lived alone significantly longer than older adults in the intervention group. There were no differences between intervention and control group support network members on gender, race, marital status (married vs. some other marital status), and age, but control group network members were more likely to be retired than were intervention group network members. The relationship between older adults and network members and distance between their residences did not differ between groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1074840712471900">
<title>Safety Plans</title>
<p>Because of low statistical power due to the small sample size, we used a α = 0.10 level in our χ<sup>2</sup> analysis in order to evaluate the intervention with respect to the older adults’ plans to reach help in the event of an emergency. This more liberal α level also is warranted because this is a new intervention that has not been used before so we wanted to give it every possibility of demonstrating potential benefits in this exploratory study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712471900">Cohen, 1992</xref>). Results with this α level must be interpreted cautiously, however. There was a significant difference between control and MSFV groups when SFTRR responses were divided into three groups: Unsafe (scores of 0 and 1), Minimally Safe (score of 2), and Extremely Safe (score of 3; χ<sup>2</sup>[2, <italic>n</italic> = 40] <italic>=</italic> 5.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). The effect size was 0.27 (Cramer’s <italic>V</italic>), which indicates a small effect, but one that approached the standard for a medium effect size (0.30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712471900">Cohen, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The SFTRR results indicated that the intervention group performed better in developing Extremely Safe plans to maintain themselves in their homes than the control group. In the intervention group, 10 of the 19 older adults (53%) presented Extremely Safe plans that included extensive elaborations, contingencies and redundancies, and mentions of both human and technological resources to maintain safety. In contrast, only 6 of 21 (29%) older adults in the control group presented Extremely Safe plans; these plans included technological aids to reach help when needed, such as cell phones and PERS. Older adults saw these two devices as potentially redundant, but nice to have in case one or the other was not available or was unusable for some reason. Often, older adults with Extremely Safe plans used the Internet to either contact children via e-mail or to seek answers to questions relevant to home safety. These plans also included human helpers. For instance, almost every older adult with Extremely Safe plans exchanged daily calls and e-mails with support network members or had regularly scheduled household visits from them. In addition, they asked network members to come over if they were going to engage in potentially risky activities (e.g., bathing, doing laundry in the basement). These older adults also shared keys or door pass codes with neighbors and other network members so that someone could enter their homes in an emergency. Some older adults with Extremely Safe plans had created strategies to signal network members that things were fine. For instance, one person raised her window blinds every morning to let neighbors know she was up and well; another turned on her porch light to signal her son that she was fine as he drove past her house after work.</p>
<p>These older adults with Extremely Safe plans had thought about their regular schedules, and about who they could rely on to notice changes in their daily or weekly activities. Most of these older adults had thought about their support network of potential helpers and who could help with what, and they also had carefully thought about who was available to help them at different times of the day and night, and who they would contact in an emergency. For instance, they might not call 911 or use their PERS during the day if they had a neighbor, friend, or family member that they could reach easily. They would, however, make 911 calls or hit the PERS button at night to avoid disturbing support network members. Or, at night they might call a neighbor who works during the day, but during the day they would call 911 or a nearby friend. In short, they had calculated the odds of someone in their support network being available, being willing, and not being burdened by a call for help, and they had considered many alternatives in the event that a support network member was unreachable or unavailable. For instance, although an adult child would be willing to help quickly, the older adult might not want to bother them at work or if they were sleeping. Community groups (e.g., churches, fire departments, Meals on Wheels) also were included in Extremely Safe plans.</p>
<p>Conversely, 6 (31%) of the older adults in the intervention group did not have safe plans (0 and 1 on the SFTRR), compared to 10 (48%) of the older adults in the control group who did not have safe plans. These older adults had simple strategies for maintaining themselves and reaching help if necessary. For instance, they vowed to be careful. They also expected someone to help them when they needed it, but they expected this without prior planning for helpers to be available or to know when help was needed. One third of the intervention group and nearly half of the control group ended the project with nonexistent or unsafe plans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1074840712471900">
<title>Behavioral and Household Changes</title>
<p>We also conducted a quantitative analysis of qualitative data in order to evaluate the intervention with respect to older adults’ behavioral and household changes after their involvement in the study. First, we engaged in a content analysis of the older adults’ postintervention interview transcripts, a research method that involves a systematic reading of text with the aim of organizing it into meaningful categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840712471900">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>). After coding the types of behavioral and household changes made by the adults, a χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was conducted in order to determine if the older adults in the intervention and control groups significantly differed in making at least one change and in the number of changes made. Significantly more intervention group older adults made behavioral and household changes due to the project than did control group older adults. Over half (11 of 19) of the intervention group (58%) made changes in their households or their behaviors, compared to 4 of 21 older adults (19%) in the control group (χ<sup>2</sup>[2, <italic>N</italic> = 40 = 10.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The effect size for these behavioral and household changes was 0.51 (Cohen’s <italic>w</italic>), indicating a large effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712471900">Cohen, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, older adults in the intervention group made more changes per person (<italic>M</italic> = 1.32) than did the control group (<italic>M</italic> = 0.19). Changes included daily calling plans (<italic>n</italic> = 5), getting a PERS (<italic>n</italic> = 3), purchasing a fire escape ladder, and removing throw rugs (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Other examples included purchasing a fire extinguisher, showing neighbors where outside keys were hidden, arranging to share a neighbor’s basement in case of tornadoes, changing trash removal, learning how to use phone speed dialing, and buying a cell phone.</p>

<sec id="section15-1074840712471900" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Brief exposure to MSFVs designed to raise awareness of potential safety problems and to generate ideas about possible ways to prevent problems or to reach help quickly if they occurred resulted in older adults in the intervention group being more likely to create safer plans for reaching help and maintaining themselves in their homes than did control group older adults who had a brief conversation with a support network member about living alone safely. Moreover, older adults in the intervention group made a greater number of behavioral and household changes to enhance their safety than did the control group. One way to consider these finding is from the perspective of how long the older adults had been living alone when they participated in the study. Older adults in the control group had been living alone for a significantly longer duration than their peers in the intervention group, so they could have been more set in their daily routines and views related to safety while living independently and therefore resistant to making changes to plans or their actions. However, the older adults’ overall enjoyment of the intervention and the evidence of positive changes support further consideration of the MSFV intervention. The differences in plans were moderate, but household and behavioral changes between intervention and control groups were large. These results are promising in light of the brevity of the intervention.</p>
<p>We wanted the intervention to be systematic and purposeful but to seem like a typical intimate conversation to the older adults. Older adults enjoyed the collaborative process: “It is a collaboration and it requires input from both people, and I think that is the thing that makes the difference” [0731].</p>
<p>For the most part older adults quickly and easily identified with the dilemmas in the vignettes. For instance, a 97-year-old woman who did not think she could identify with a story about a man falling in his garden, did so within 10 seconds:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I don’t know if I can identify with a guy or not. [Interviewer: Maybe the situation will still . . .]. Well, they like to be outdoors. Yeah, I, I was trimming a tree out front and I have bricks around the edge of it, and I was not watching what I was doing and I fell and . . . I laid there thinking, you know, “How am I getting up out here?”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Identification with the older adults in the vignettes was so strong that we had to abandon our plans to assess their home safety plans separately from their advice to the vignette characters about what they should do because the older adults’ responses randomly varied between what they would do, what they had done in the past in similar situations, and what the vignette characters should do. The hope that the use of hypothetical situations in the vignettes would stimulate thinking about living safely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712471900">Ganong &amp; Coleman, 2006</xref>) was borne out in nearly every interview. Comments by network members such as, “[It] gave us both a chance to be reflective” [0181]; “I think the process and the opportunity to sit and ponder some important issues is very helpful” [0201]; “Mona [a pseudonym] was really thoughtful. I mean, she, she gave the questions a lot of thought” [0211].</p>
<p>The older adults seemed to enjoy the vignettes and problem-solving about what the older adult should do. They generally were not shy about offering advice and suggestions. The MSFV intervention was effective regardless of older adults’ prior experiences of having incidents of needing help quickly, self-perceived health quality, and whether or not the older adult owned PERS, cell phones, or computers. This suggests that MSFVs may be used with a wide variety of older adults. We also did not find that specific types of network members were more effective than others, although we did observe that some network members who were also older adults struggled at times to set boundaries between themselves, the older adults they were helping, and the vignette characters because they also identified with the problems portrayed in the vignettes. This may have adversely affected their performance as trainers, but we are unsure if this affected what the target older adults were able to learn from the MSFV process. We did have evidence that some older network members changed their behaviors as a result of the intervention: “It was helpful for both of us ‘cause he gave me some ideas and I gave him some ideas” [0451].</p>
<p>Not every older adult enjoyed the vignette approach. One or two (5%) may have felt threatened by addressing issues of safety, particularly when those scenarios reflected, somewhat closely, their own situations. The support network members of these older adults thought that they were not ready to admit they were in possible need of assistance, or might be in the future. One network member thought her aunt appeared defensive when asked to relate the MSFV stories to her own life. In describing the older adult’s demeanor she said, “I kind of got the feeling that she felt the scenarios were kind of a back handed way to probe.” It is possible to resist active participation in vignette problem-solving, although even in these isolated cases network members thought awareness had been raised and that some good had been accomplished by considering the vignette dilemmas together.</p>
<sec id="section16-1074840712471900">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>Overall, the sample of older adults in this study were well educated, and economically comfortable, and in good health. A few of them had a PERS, cell phones, and landlines, and had access to the Internet in their homes. They also had a family member or friend nearby. A larger, more diverse sample might have afforded a better, perhaps less conservative, test of the intervention. Compared to the general older adult population, this sample probably was more prepared to live alone safely. They probably also were motivated to learn more about maintaining independence safely or they would not have volunteered themselves and a support network member. In fact, many of them probably thought they were doing well personally and volunteered in order to help us learn how to help other older adults. In light of the above, this pool of older adults may not have been the best group in which to assess the utility of using MSFVs in training, since many of them likely had spent a great deal of time thinking about how they could maintain their independence safely in their own homes prior to the project. As one woman (Mrs. 0182) stated, “The problem is that you may be preaching to the converted and so that the people who really need help in working through this and thinking about it probably won’t be reached.”</p>
<p>Another limitation has to do with the intervention, which was quite brief. There were only two training sessions for network members, and conversations with the older adults were generally short. If we had spent more time training the network members in the MSFV method and if the network member–older adult sessions had been more frequent in number or longer, the positive effects of the intervention may have been larger.</p>
<p>The measurement approach of the project outcomes was new, and conducting the postproject assessment interview in a consistent and uniform manner was challenging. We wanted to allow the older adults ample opportunities to respond about maintaining themselves safely in their homes, but we also did not want to probe so much that we biased their responses. We are confident that the postproject assessment interviews of the 40 dyads were done consistently, and that the SFTRR scores represent consensus, but qualitative responses are more challenging than strictly quantitative measures using instruments with known psychometric properties. Such instruments did not exist, however, for the outcomes of this study.</p>
<p>It also is important to consider that evaluations of the intervention are based on the research team’s consensus on what signifies a safe plan to maintain independent living and reach help, as well as what constitutes a positive behavioral or household change. For example, including the use of a cell phone in a plan or purchasing a PERS after the intervention does not mean that the older adult consistently carries the cell phone or PERS or plans to in order to guard against falling without being able to seek help. Therefore, it would be important to use multiple methods and measurements to assess the intervention in future studies.</p>
<p>A final limitation had to do with the fact that this project was limited to older adults who had a network member they felt they could ask to work with them. A few older adults contacted us about the project, but did not have anyone they felt would be willing to help them or lived close to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1074840712471900">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Although we trained support network member to use MSFVs in helping older adults create plans to maintain their independence safely, trained professionals also may be effective in the event that an older adult is lacking a support network. The method may be employed in brief, short-term interventions, so using trained professionals as facilitators would not be expensive. Studies using MSFVs with longer follow-ups would be useful in assessing how long-term the effects were of these vignette interventions. Future evaluations of the use of MSFVs as intervention tools could examine the benefits of additional sessions with support network members, or whether or not more vignettes with more and varied scenarios would be helpful.</p>
<p>There are financial, psychological, and interpersonal benefits for older adults, their extended families, and their support networks of friends if older adults can live safely in their own homes. Developing plans for safe, independent living potentially can contribute to fewer hospitalizations of older adults, reductions in the number of deaths among older persons due to unintentional injuries, and less stress for older adults and for members of their support networks.</p>
<p>Most rural areas of the United States lack adequate numbers of health-care providers. Therefore, <italic>prevention</italic> of health problems is a priority in rural America. This is one reason why health-care providers emphasize fall prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712471900">Tinetti, Gordon, Sogolow, Lapin, &amp; Bradley, 2006</xref>). Despite efforts to prevent health-care problems for older adults, some will fall and hurt themselves and others will need to reach help for a variety of reasons. Therefore, promoting the importance of thinking about how to maintain safe living alone is vital and should be seen as part of preventive health care in rural America. Enabling older adults to consider their situations and create plans for living safely and for getting help quickly in emergencies promotes older adults’ dignity and safety. Projects like this can foster the receptivity of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to adding “new cost-effective interventions, including those designed to prevent adverse functional outcomes, as covered benefits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840712471900">Gill, 2005</xref>, p. 725). Clearly, given the small, educated sample, this intervention needs to be replicated, but there is evidence that using MSFVs is a low-cost, low-tech intervention that could be used by many agencies that work with older adults.</p>

<p><bold>Eileen J. Porter</bold>, PhD, RN, FGSA, is a professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Professor Emerita, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. Dr. Porter’s research program is focused on describing the health-related experiences of older women who live alone at home, particularly experiences associated with risks they associate with living alone (such as falling, being unable to reach help quickly, intrusion of unwanted visitors, and causing helpers to worry). Dr. Porter developed a descriptive phenomenological method that she has used in a series of NIH-funded longitudinal studies. The overall aims of these studies are to grasp the essence of the health-related intentions of older women and to set that awareness in personal–social-environmental context. Her recent publications include, “Older Homebound Women’s Perceived Risk of Being Unable to Reach Help Quickly: Influence of Situations Involving Age-Peers” in <italic>Research in Nursing &amp; Health</italic> (2012, with S. Lasiter), “Incidents When Older Homebound Women Tried to Reach Help Quickly” in <italic>Research in Gerontological Nursing</italic> (in press, with M. S. Markham and L. H. Ganong), and “Intentions of Older Homebound Women With Regard to Reaching Help Quickly” in <italic>Western Journal of Nursing Research</italic> (in press, with L. H. Ganong and S. Matsuda).</p>
