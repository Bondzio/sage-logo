<abstract>
<p>The article offers an example of using a mixed methods design that was implemented when investigating depression among Chinese older persons in Macau. A challenge in designing the study was that in light of literature on Chinese culture and somatization theory, the acceptability of the methodology was uncertain. Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 31) were purposively selected and quantitative data were collected using multiple standardized measures. Questions raised by the quantitative approach were then reflected through in-depth interviews. Four dominant categories emerged: (a) negative thinking, (b) physical limitations and complaints, (c) present living conditions and social support, and (d) the lives participants have lived. There was a high level of congruence between quantitative scores and narratives. The research approach was acceptable to the participants, and the findings contributed to an understanding of depression and therapeutic interventions for that population within Chinese culture.</p>

<body>
<p>Depression has been described as the commonest mental health problem in old age and contributes to high rates of mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689811419513">Abbott, Wong, Giles, Young, &amp; Au, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689811419513">Lai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689811419513">Mui &amp; Kang, 2006</xref>), and it is the commonest psychological problem among Chinese older persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689811419513">Chen &amp; Jiang, 2000</xref>). The incidence rate of depression among the Chinese populations across the world appears to be variable: In the United States, 45% among migrant Chinese communities were reported to be suffering from depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689811419513">Mui &amp; Kang, 2006</xref>), compared with almost one quarter in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689811419513">Lai, 2004</xref>) and a similar 26% in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689811419513">Abbott et al., 2003</xref>). In Chinese societies also, the prevalence of depression was found to be high: 43.4% in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1558689811419513">Tsai, Chung, Wong, &amp; Huang, 2005</xref>) and 19.1% in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811419513">Chou &amp; Chi, 2005</xref>). Differences in prevalence may reflect different instruments used and different cutoff points; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811419513">Chou and Chi (2005)</xref> used eight as the cutoff point for the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15), whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689811419513">Mui and Kang (2006)</xref> used the Geriatric Depression Scale-30 (GDS-30) with a cutoff point of 11, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1558689811419513">Tsai et al. (2005)</xref> used a modified, seven-item version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.</p>
<p>Depression has also been reported in Macau’s older population. The present study followed two previous studies in Macau that produced information on the burden of depression, largely untreated, in the older population. In 2003, 53.1% of 367 community-dwelling older persons in Macau attending day centers (a support service used by approximately 70% of Macau’s older population) were found to be suffering from depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689811419513">Li, Li, Liu, Qiu, &amp; Zeng, 2003</xref>). A subsequent study in 2004 of a much larger sample of 2,039 community-dwelling older persons in Macau found that 10.4% suffered from depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689811419513">Macau Social Welfare Bureau, 2006</xref>). Differences between the rates of depression found could be related to the characteristics of those attending care centers. In light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689811419513">Li et al.’s (2003)</xref> findings that more than half of the attendees of day centers were found to be suffering from depression, the original intention of the present study was to develop and trial an intervention, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, for older persons with depression. Before such an intervention could be developed, it became clear that first we needed to better understand factors in the lives of these older persons that might contribute to their dysphoria and thus should be addressed in a therapeutic program planning.</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned studies on the Chinese older populations adopted a quantitative approach using either the GDS or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to determine depression rates. Although the scores of the scales used to indicate depression reported in the above-mentioned studies facilitated comparison and statistical aggregation of the data, comparisons were limited by the use of different scales and different cutoff points. A more important limitation of these studies was that reasons behind the responses were not known, and so such methods did not explain why the Chinese older persons suffered from depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689811419513">Patton, 2002</xref>). Derived from research conducted mainly in Western societies, dominant psychosocial theories of influences on the development of depression included health and disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689811419513">Cuijpers, Beekman, Smit, &amp; Deeg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1558689811419513">Rovner &amp; Casten, 2002</xref>), psychological perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689811419513">Ayalon &amp; Young, 2003</xref>), and social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689811419513">Harris, Cook, Victor, DeWilde, &amp; Beighton, 2006</xref>) determinants. Similar research among Chinese populations is scant, and therefore, we have limited understanding of whether those theories hold true in Chinese society. It was this gap in understanding and knowledge that the present study seeks to address and to do so a mixed method design was used. The present study, therefore, aims to identify the principal influences on depression among Chinese older persons in Macau.</p>
<p>The two earlier studies in Macau left many unanswered questions including why these older persons scored so negatively. In response to a lack of information about and understanding of Macau’s older persons’ lives contributing to and sustaining dysphoria, it became clear that a number of questions needed to be answered to provide data that could then be used to develop culturally appropriate mental health services and teaching. These questions include the following: What are the lived experiences of older persons with depression in Macau? What are the principal influences on depression among older persons in Macau? How can this information be used to inform health care and teaching to help prevent and protect older persons from depression in Macau? These questions helped the development of the research design.</p>
<p>Probing the phenomenon of depression among Chinese older persons was an unknown territory. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and contributions of a mixed methods research design that, as far as we know, is the first experience of using such a methodology when investigating depression among Chinese older persons and to discuss the acceptability of the approach to the participants.</p>
<sec id="section1-1558689811419513">
<title>Background to the Study</title>
<p>Macau is an advanced Chinese city with a population of 502,113 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1558689811419513">Macau Statistics and Census Bureau, 2007</xref>). In Chinese culture, an individual is an inherent part of the family and one’s failure to fulfill his or her duty and obligations often leads to feelings of guilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689811419513">Bedford &amp; Hwang, 2003</xref>). Taking care of older persons is strongly advocated by Confucian philosophy and traditional culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1558689811419513">Whyte, 2003</xref>). However, in reality, not all older persons have family in a position to provide that support: Because of recent rapid socioeconomic developments in Macau, Chinese family support systems have changed. Nuclear families, in which family members are more independent and maintain less contact, have become much more widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689811419513">Chan, Chiu, Chien, Thompson, &amp; Lam, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689811419513">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1558689811419513">Ning, Esteves, Lin, &amp; Qu, 2001</xref>). The younger generations tend to have developed an outlook that is more self-centered. As a consequence, older persons may not be able to get the kind of respect that they would expect from the younger generations and may find it difficult to adapt to these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1558689811419513">Yip, Chi, &amp; Chiu, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we seek to illuminate the lived experiences of depressed older people and the meanings they attribute to their experiences and to their inner and outer lives. At the outset of the study, we were not sure whether older persons would be willing to talk about their lives and experiences: Would they defend themselves against their unhappiness? Would shame about their circumstances limit their willingness to share their stories with an outsider? Would a research strategy developed in Western societies be acceptable in Chinese society and deliver the desired data and conclusions?</p>

<sec id="section2-1558689811419513">
<title>Chinese Cultural Patterning of Depression and Somatization</title>
<p>The idea of culture is central to the exploration of interpretations of depression since culture shapes how one interprets and responds to the implicit rules governing any cultural entity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689811419513">Kleinman &amp; Good, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1558689811419513">Stoppard, 2000</xref>). In Chinese culture, tremendous social stigma is attached to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689811419513">Kleinman, 2004</xref>). Consequently, the Chinese are said to minimize the intensity of depressive feelings and keep them undifferentiated, which helps them distance the feelings and focus concern elsewhere. It is noted that in many Chinese societies the expression of depression is physical rather than psychological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689811419513">Kleinman &amp; Good, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1558689811419513">Stoppard, 2000</xref>) and is known as somatization of mental distress. Many depressed Chinese people do not report feeling sad but rather express boredom, discomfort, symptoms of pain, dizziness, and fatigue. The Chinese characteristics for “depression” are employed in medical settings but not in popular usage. These illnesses represent the patterning of the underlying disease by cultural determinants that yield characteristic types of somatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689811419513">Kleinman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A challenge in designing the present study was that in light of somatization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689811419513">Kleinman, 2004</xref>), we did not know whether a qualitative approach would be acceptable to participants or whether an effective method of capturing the experiences of older persons’ present and past lives that contributed to depression. Assuming that our participants shared the view that depression (and mental illness generally) was highly stigmatizing, it was possible that they would seek to minimize the intensity of depressive feelings and avoid reflecting on their state of mind. Would they focus rather on physical ills? Would our probing of their backgrounds, circumstances, and life stories be distressing? Compounding our uncertainty, our sample of older Chinese was particularly from Macau, which had a long history of colonization by Portuguese and was handed back to China only as recently as December 20, 1999. There had been cultural exchange between the Chinese and the Western world for more than 400 years. However, many residents of Macau had no such personal contact as many had settled in their lifetimes from mainland China and Southeast Asian countries.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1558689811419513">
<title>Theoretical Basis</title>
<p>A mixed methods design using quantitative and qualitative approaches was used in the study, reflecting methodological and data triangulation to robustly investigate the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1558689811419513">Thurmond, 2001</xref>). A mixed methods design is the research strategy of choice because it can compensate for the weaknesses of a single strategy and contribute toward completeness or confirmation of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1558689811419513">Ramprogus, 2005</xref>). In addition, it allows a wider and more complete picture to emerge than that presented by a single method work and increases the ability to interpret findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1558689811419513">Thurmond, 2001</xref>). The primary assumption of mixed methods is that any bias inherent in particular data sources and methods would be neutralized when used in conjunction with other data sources and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1558689811419513">Yin, 2006</xref>). As advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689811419513">Clamp and Gough (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1558689811419513">Waltz, Strickland, and Lenz (1991)</xref>, different sources of data were included within the present study, specifically a series of quantitative measures (validated for the population of older persons including Chinese populations) and open-ended semistructured interviews, to obtain diverse material that would provide a more complete picture of the topic under investigation.</p>
<p>The combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches in a single study has been extensively debated because the two main theoretical perspectives reflect a dichotomy in research. In this study, even though our sample size was smaller than desired for a quantitative study, the advantage of using a series of quantitative measures was that it facilitated statistical aggregation of the data and comparison of the study sample with other similar study populations. The advantages of qualitative methods that typically produce a wealth of detailed information about a much smaller number of people and cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689811419513">Patton, 2002</xref>) were fully used in our research, and we were able to demonstrate that scores on statistical measures reflected the narratives of our participants on related themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1558689811419513">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>A mixed methods research strategy was used. In the present study, a range of standardized and validated scales widely used clinically and in research with older persons was used to quantitatively examine mental and physical health, functioning, and social networks. These quantitative data were used to quantify a variety of psychosocial factors that might be associated with the experiences of older persons with depression in Macau, via descriptive and inferential statistics. The quantitative data collected allowed us to compare the participant groups with the general Macau population and with other Chinese populations in comparable studies. In addition, these quantitative analyses raised questions that informed the interviews and data analysis for the next qualitative phase. This happened as the results from the quantitative phase were reflected on and expanded through the narratives of the participants.</p>
<p>The qualitative phase of the study was conducted to confirm or reject the inferences of the quantitative phase and to expand on findings from the quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1558689811419513">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003</xref>). The collection of narratives through in-depth interviewing provided rich qualitative data that illuminated the dysphoria of the participants and illustrated the details of the participants’ circumstances that they related to their thoughts and mood.</p>
<p>Quantitative and qualitative data were combined to create consolidated data sets and integrated into a coherent whole in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1558689811419513">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>). In the case of the present study, the final inferences were based on the results of both phases of the study. The mixed methods analysis followed a dominant to less dominant and sequential mixed designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1558689811419513">Tashakkori &amp; Teddlie, 2003</xref>) in which there were two phases that occurred chronologically: quantitative analysis (low priority) → QUALITATIVE analysis (high priority).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1558689811419513">
<title>Ethical Procedures</title>
<p>Permission was sought from both the Research Ethics Committee of Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau and the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee prior to undertaking the study. Permission to access the older persons referred by the day centers for the elderly was obtained from the managers of the centers. A consent form along with information about the study was distributed to each person deemed eligible for inclusion in the study. If consent was given, the consent form was signed by participants, their finger stamped in the case of illiterate persons, or permission was tape-recorded. Consent forms and data were stored separately and are secure for 6 years after the completion of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1558689811419513">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-one participants met the inclusion criteria: residents of Macau who were aged 65 years and older, presence of depression (GDS-15 score of 8 or more, with no suicide attempt, and no preexisting and nonaffective psychiatric disorder), and not cognitively impaired (Mental Status Questionnaire [MSQ] score of 6 or more). A purposive sampling approach was used to ensure selection of characteristics of key groups of interest (e.g., a mix of gender and living circumstances), major variations, and “information-rich cases” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689811419513">Patton, 2002</xref>) to facilitate in-depth study of phenomena and identification of the important issues.</p>
<p>To access participants, managers of day centers for the elderly, where a majority of older persons spend some of their days, were contacted by the researcher to identify older persons believed to be depressed. Reflecting inclusion criteria, the researcher first screened the older person for eligibility. Using this approach, a pool of older persons believed to be suffering from depression was referred from eight day centers. Of this pool, 22 were excluded (not depressed or they were cognitively impaired) and their GDS-15 and MSQ results destroyed. Once eligibility was confirmed, the older person with depression was given written and verbal information about the study and was asked by the researcher to participate in the study. The process of referral and screening continued, and participants continued to be enrolled until repetition of the salient points (themes) was reached; this was the point at which saturation was deemed achieved, providing a final sample of 31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689811419513">Green &amp; Thorogood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811419513">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1558689811419513">
<title>Research Procedures</title>
<p>A range of standardized and validated scales for the Chinese population were used in the quantitative phase, including the MSQ, GDS-15, Reduced Item Barthel Index (BI), Lawton Instrument of Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale, Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS), and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey of Quality of Life (SF-36QOL). These were selected because the instruments had been translated and validated for a Chinese older population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689811419513">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689811419513">C. J. Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689811419513">Macau Social Welfare Bureau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1558689811419513">Ngan, Leung, Kwan, &amp; Yeung, 1996</xref>). The purposes of the quantitative tools were twofold: (a) to determine eligibility of older persons to participate (MSQ and GDS-15) and (b) to quantify a variety of psychosocial factors that might be associated with the experiences of the participants that could then be compared with data from other similar populations in previous studies.</p>
<p>These data were entered into SPSS for Windows 15.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689811419513">D. H. Liu, Li, &amp; Yao, 2008</xref>) and analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range, frequency, and percentage) and inferential statistics (<italic>t</italic> test, <italic>z</italic> test, goodness-of-fit test, Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>, and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). The first part of the analysis (based on data from MSQ, GDS-15, BI, Lawton IADL, LSNS, and SF-36QOL) was used to quantify a variety of psychosocial factors via descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.</p>
<p>The results from the quantitative analyses raised questions that helped the analysis of data collected through interviews in the next qualitative analysis phase. A general qualitative research orientation using in-depth interviews, with minimal structure, was used to illuminate factors that contributed to dysphoria among the participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1558689811419513">Van Manen’s (1984)</xref> phenomenological method, reflecting a dynamic interplay among six research activities, offers an appropriate scientific and rigorous method, and it was for this reason that it was used in this study. The six research activities are as follows: (a) turning to a phenomenon of serious interest, (b) investigating the phenomenon as we live it rather than as we conceptualize it, (c) reflecting on the essential themes that characterize the phenomenon, (d) describing the phenomenon through the art of writing and rewriting, (e) maintaining a strong and oriented relation to the phenomenon, and (f) balancing the research context by considering parts and whole.</p>
<p>The choice of this phenomenological method over others was influenced by the phenomenon of interest and that it required the researcher, a nurse, to attend to his own experiences and presuppositions, in this case an extensive knowledge base developed through involvement in the care of older persons and community, with more than 15 years of teaching and practical experience. Philosophical belief about humans and holistic nature of professional nursing encourages detailed attention to care of persons and grounds its practice in a holistic belief system guiding nurses to care for the mind, body, and spirit. This holistic perspective helps form the foundation for phenomenological inquiry, which brings everyday knowledge to conscious awareness for understanding and interpretation and attempts to interpret human experience in its context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1558689811419513">Wilde, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The researcher (as principal instrument) conducted all interviews in a venue chosen by the participants (in all cases either the day center or in their own homes), to identify the life events, issues, and common thoughts reported by the older persons. Data were collected through audiotaped face-to-face interviews with participants. To facilitate the in-depth interviewing, an open-ended interview guide with 10 prompt questions, each with additional prompts, was developed that reflected literature on depression among older persons and Chinese societies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1558689811419513">Table 1</xref>). The questions were designed to encourage the participant to reflect on a range of key factors in his or her circumstances (associated in literature with dysphoria) but were phrased in such a way that the participant could also avoid giving detailed and emotional responses if he or she preferred not to reflect deeply on issues.</p>

<p>Recorded interviews were first transcribed verbatim by the researcher and the text was then coded reflecting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1558689811419513">Van Manen’s (1997)</xref> approach for the purpose of uncovering or isolating themes from participants’ descriptions of an experience. Three different approaches were used. First was a holistic approach, whereby the researcher viewed the text as a whole and tried to capture its meanings. Next, a selective or highlighting approach was used where the researcher underlined, highlighted, or pulled out statements or phrases that seem essential to the experience under study. Finally, a detailed line-by-line approach was used whereby the researcher analyzed every sentence. Themes that were identified became the objects of further reflection as the lived experiences of participants were interpreted.</p>
<p>Using the approaches outlined, by mapping the dominant phenomenological categories against the quantitative results collected through standardized scales, a high level of agreement between quantitative and qualitative data was found. To demonstrate this, key findings are now presented in brief and discussed.</p>

<title>Profile of Participants</title>
<p>Quantitative measures demonstrated the presence of depression, physical impairment, limitations in daily living, social networks, and social functioning. Many of the 31 participants were widowed (64.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 20), 9.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were divorced, and 12.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) had never married. Most of the participants (71.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 22) were illiterate. More than half of the participants (54.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 17) were living alone, 48.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 15) depended on a subsidy, and 22.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) received no income (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1558689811419513">Table 2</xref>). The quantitative findings revealed that the sample of 31 participants was not representative of the general population. Both females and persons without spouses or partners were overrepresented in the study, and other data indicated that the participants suffered from inferior living conditions and social support than did the general population of older persons in Macau.</p>

<p>The main reason the study sample was not representative of the general population was that participants were purposively selected for the presence of depression, as measured by GDS-15 with a cutoff point of 8. The mean of 11.5 for participants was much higher than the cutoff point, indicating that all the 31 older persons were seriously depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689811419513">Chiu &amp; Lee, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1558689811419513">Lee &amp; Chiu, 1994</xref>). Further evidence of poor mental health scores was indicated in the SF-36QOL psychological aspects: role-emotional had a mean of 7.53, social functioning showed a mean of 22.18, mental health had a mean of 25.16, vitality showed a mean of 25.81, and general health had a mean of 26.97. When these results were compared with results of studies of community-dwelling populations of older persons in Macau and in Hong Kong, the scores of the 31 participants showed that they suffered from worse mental states than the general population of older persons, an outcome of the inclusion criteria and recruitment process used.</p>
<p>All participants suffered from physical disorders. Almost all the participants (90.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 28) self-reported at least three physical disorders. Nearly half of the participants (45.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 14) had BI scores less than 100, which indicated that the participants suffered from varying degrees of physical impairment in activities of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1558689811419513">Wang, 2000</xref>), and 61.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 19) felt unable to undertake instrumental activities of daily living or could do so only with difficulty and with help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689811419513">Lawton &amp; Brody, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1558689811419513">Spector, 1990</xref>). SF-36QOL physical aspects consisted of physical functioning with a mean of 40.16, role-physical with a mean of 12.10, bodily pain with a mean of 40.58, vitality with a mean of 25.81, and general health with a mean of 26.97. These data were compared with the total population norm and the general population of older persons norm in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689811419513">Lam &amp; Lauder, 1999</xref>). The results showed that the 31 older persons with depression had worse physical conditions than both the total population and the general population of older persons in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the results showed that high GDS-15 scores (indicating depression) were correlated with low BI, IADL, and SF-36QOL physical aspects scores (indicating poor physical function).</p>
<p>All except one of the participants had an LSNS score less than 20, indicating that most participants tended to reach an extreme risk for limited social networks. SF-36QOL social functioning aspect had a mean of 22.18. The results showed that the participants had worse social functioning than the total older persons’ population in Macau and the general population of older persons in Hong Kong, both comparable populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689811419513">Lam &amp; Lauder, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the results showed that high GDS-15 scores (indicating depression) were correlated with low LSNS and SF-36QOL social functioning scores (indicating poor social function).</p>
<p>To summarize, the quantitative data consistently showed that the participants had worse scores than comparable populations previously studied in Macau or Hong Kong. Why this was so was revealed in the narratives collected through in-depth interviewing.</p>

<sec id="section11-1558689811419513">
<title>Dominant Categories Found</title>
<p>Against a background of negative scores for physical and mental health and for family and social networks, the qualitative findings identified some of the factors in the lives of the study population that might explain the scores, in particular high depression scores. Using the iterative approaches described above, the data from the study clustered into four dominant categories: (a) negative thinking, (b) physical limitations and complaints, (c) present living conditions and social support, and (d) the lives that participants have lived.</p>
<p>The first dominant category, “negative thinking,” was key to the lived experiences of the 31 depressed older persons since all participants had negative views of themselves. This dominant category consisted of the following themes: feelings of uselessness, hopelessness, sadness, and helplessness. The theory of somatization based on a view that Chinese people are disinclined to acknowledge mental suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689811419513">Kleinman, 1980</xref>) led us to anticipate reticence among participants to articulate their dysphoria. Contrary to this expectation, the participants talked about their negative feelings openly and eloquently. One possible explanation for this could be that these Chinese patients consulted Kleinman, a psychiatrist, wherein physical symptoms but no physical abnormalities were detected, leading to the explanation of somatization of depression. In the present study, in contrast, participants were recruited because depression was detected using GDS-15. A second possible explanation was that the Chinese older persons in Macau, which had a mix of Chinese and Western cultures for more than 400 years, experienced depression more cognitively.</p>
<p>The second dominant category, “physical limitations and complaints,” was strongly linked with the lived experiences of participants, and the increased dependency that they were confronted with was likely to strengthen their feelings of uselessness and hopelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689811419513">Li et al., 2003</xref>). It covered the following themes: limited mobility, dependence on others, chronic joint pain, inability to sleep, poor appetite, poor memory, complex medication regimens, and difficulties in getting to hospital. All participants suffered from several illnesses and diseases and associated symptoms that contributed to their misery; many described barriers in accessing the treatment they needed.</p>
<p>The third dominant category, “present living conditions and social support,” played an important role in the lived experiences of participants in a cultural context where filial responsibilities are highly valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689811419513">Hwang, 2001</xref>). All the participants expressed great concern about this aspect of life. It consisted of the following themes: being poor, being illiterate, victim of injustice, being widowed, living alone, conflict with adult children, being neglected by children, being looked down upon by others, and lack of social contact. Participants eloquently conveyed being caught between a government policy (where children are responsible for their parents) and a reality where adult children lacked the means and will to provide that support.</p>
<p>The final dominant category, “the lives that participants have lived,” reflected the poverty of participants and their difficult experiences from early in life and included the following themes: hard labor with low reward, having lost a father, having a bad marriage, and trauma from wars and revolutions. Emerging from these narratives was the notion that where there was lifelong hardship and poverty, family tensions appeared to be more pronounced and reduced personal resources (psychological, emotional, and economic).</p>
<p>As a Chinese saying goes, suffering is like being “burned by hot flame and sunk by deep sea.” The participants’ narratives revealed that they were burned by negative thinking, physical limitations and complaints, present living conditions and social support, and the lives that they have lived and that they could see no way out of their suffering. These four dominant categories were not independent but interacted with and were compounded by other dominant categories.</p>

<sec id="section12-1558689811419513">
<title>Mapping Quantitative and Qualitative Data</title>
<p>Quantitative and qualitative data facilitated the interpretation and illumination of the lived experiences of the participants. Quantitative data generated by standardized scales were mapped against the four dominant categories that emerged from the narratives. The relationships among the four dominant categories and quantitative indicators are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689811419513">Table 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1558689811419513">Table 3</xref> shows a high level of congruence between scores on standardized quantitative scales (validated for use in research with older persons including Chinese older persons) and the narratives pertaining to the respective dominant categories. Qualitative accounts about social networks, for example, were consistent with scores on the LSNS, and so on. This level of congruence held true for all measures used in the study. The narrative accounts thus confirmed that the scales were valid, and went further, through the generation of thick data, to describe what the day-to-day lives that contributed to their dysphoria were like for these depressed older persons.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study illustrated the strengths of mixed methods for use in research among Chinese. The mixed methods strategy allowed a wider and more complete picture to emerge. Furthermore, the experiences of the study demonstrated that the qualitative approach was acceptable to older Chinese persons. Our participants were well able to respond to open-ended questions probing many aspects of their present and past lives. They described their moods and also told their life stories freely and without reserve, including those aspects of their lives about which we anticipated that they would be ashamed of or embarrassed because of Chinese cultural values (e.g., the neglect of their adult children in attending to their needs and broken marriages). Indeed, the participants seemed to welcome the opportunity to share with us the difficult aspects of their lives. If this conclusion is correct, then the findings of this study have particular implications for the large Chinese populations in Western countries.</p>
<p>A second important implication of our findings was that intervention in depression among Macau’s older persons required a much broader approach than clinical treatment alone. The presence of multiple self-reported conditions and aggravating symptoms, physical impairments, and limited functioning highlighted the need for a holistic approach to health care.</p>
