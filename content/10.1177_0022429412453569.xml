<p>Pat Flowers has been a professor of music education at The Ohio State University since 1985. She previously taught at the University of Texas at San Antonio. She studied at West Virginia University and Kent State University and completed her PhD at the Florida State University, where she later returned to obtain a certificate in special education. She taught vocal and general music at public schools in Ohio in the ’70s and again in 2005 during a sabbatical. She has received many awards, including a Distinguished Scholar Award at Ohio State University, alumni awards at Kent State University, and a Faculty Citation for Graduate Alumnae at Florida State University. Although her achievements as a teacher and administrator are numerous (including being the chair of graduate studies at Ohio State for 15 years), today we are recognizing her research achievements, so I will try to stick just to these.</p>
<p>Dr. Flowers has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals, including the <italic>Journal of Music Teacher Education, Update, the Journal of Research in Music Education, the International Journal of Music Education, Bulletin of the Council for Research in the Music Education, the Journal of Music Therapy, the Journal of Band Research, the Music Educators Journal, Contribution to Music Education, Music Therapy Perspectives</italic>, and <italic>Psychology of Music</italic>. Additionally, she has been invited to write articles and chapters in edited books. Her list of research presentations is endless, so I will just say that she has presented her work at many conferences, in many disciplines, in many countries and that she has shared her research with the Society for Research in Music Education (SRME) community at 17 MENC/NAfME biennial national conferences.</p>
<p>Dr. Flowers has been a strong supporter of research in music education and has served SRME generously—very generously, very kindly, and very wisely. She has shaped and guided the research work of our organization by working relentlessly on behalf of its members. She was a reviewer for the society’s journals, a member of its executive committee, and the chair of the Music Education Research Council. She contributed to the research efforts of MENC as a participant in the Research Task Force in 1997–1998, She was involved in the drafting of landmark documents, such as the 1998 <italic>Thinking Ahead: A Research Agenda for Music Education</italic>, sponsored by MENC/NAfME, and <italic>The Arts in American Schools: Setting a Research Agenda for the ’90s</italic>, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts and the U.S. Department of Education. She served on the editorial committee of <italic>JRME</italic> twice for a total of 12 years. The contribution that Dr. Flowers has made to our society is indeed remarkable.</p>
<p>Dr. Flowers also served on the editorial boards of the <italic>Journal of Music Therapy</italic> and <italic>Contributions to Music Education</italic>. The broadness of her research expertise is reflected in the diversity of journals that have sought her as a reviewer: <italic>Psychology of Music, Psychomusicology, Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education, the Journal of the American Statistical Association</italic>, and <italic>Behavioral and Brain Sciences</italic>. She has served as a research consultant or team member of grant projects supported by federal agencies and private foundations (U.S. Department of Education, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, National Piano Foundation, Yamaha, and the Grammy Foundation).</p>
<p>Another way in which Dr. Flowers has contributed to the advancement of research in music education is by training dozens of graduate students and supporting hundreds of graduate students through her job as director of graduate studies. She has helped students access funding for research, read and edited their proposals, supervised their theses and dissertations, and continued to collaborate with them after they had graduated. She has instilled not only a love for research in her students but also a sense of responsibility for conducting research—good research. She has taught them to be generous in sharing their ideas and careful in finding evidence to support them. She has taught them to do lots of good research and publish it and to identify their not-so-good research and keep it safely stored in a locked cabinet. She has been a fantastic role model of a successful teacher, accomplished professor, productive and conscientious researcher, efficient administrator, and a powerful woman. I know all this not only because her letters of nomination and recommendation say so but also because I was incredibly fortunate to have her as a teacher.</p>
<p>Dr. Flowers’s research has focused on music listening, musical development, and musical behavior. Her studies on how children talk about music, the effects of music training on children’s and adults’ use of vocabulary, and descriptions of music by special populations have resulted in a comprehensive, systematic, and enlightening analysis of music listening, particularly in the area of focus of attention. This research has become the basis for the work of many other researchers and the groundwork for our understanding of listening behaviors throughout the life span. This research has made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education. And it has made a significant contribution to the professional development of many students who had the honor of publishing with her. In fact, if it were not for the studies she published in the 1980s, I would not be here today. Let me tell you how this is so.</p>
<p>After I arrived to the United States from my native Argentina to study performance at Indiana University, I took a course with Dr. Charles Schmidt, now retired. The course was Psychology of Music. In this class I was introduced to research in music education and Dr. Flowers’s work. One day, one of the assigned readings was a paper she had written titled “Attention to Elements of Music and Effect of Instruction in Vocabulary and Written Descriptions of Music by Children and Undergraduates.” The discussion of that article truly changed the course of my career. After reading and rereading that article, I knew that what I wanted to do during my professional life was to be not a performer but a researcher. What I wanted to do was Pat’s research. I wanted to study exactly what she was studying. I switched out of performance and into music education and later left Indiana to go study at Ohio State with her. We completed what was my very first research study soon after I arrived. And this study was published. And three other cross-cultural studies followed. And my dissertation and two additional publications using the methodology of that initial project were published as well. That first study we did together (actually she did most of the work but let me help a little) became the basis of my own work as a researcher and the model that I followed for many years. Many of her former students who are now active researchers themselves have had similar experiences studying with Dr. Flowers. By educating and mentoring them, she has allowed her contribution to research to grow exponentially over the years.</p>
<p>Colleagues, I have the honor to introduce to you the 2012 Senior Researcher Award recipient, Dr. Patricia Flowers.</p>
