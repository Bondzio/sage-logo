<p>Altered elastin metabolism has been documented in pelvic tissues from women with pelvic floor dysfunction. This study was conducted to quantify the expression of elastolytic enzymes in uterine cervix and uterosacral ligaments from women with uterine prolapse compared to asymptomatic normal controls. Paired tissues of uterosacral ligament and cervical tissues were obtained from 27 women with uterine prolapse and 14 normal controls. Steady state of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2), neutrophil elastase, α-1 antitrypsin immunoreactivity, and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. When compared with controls, women with uterine prolapse had a significantly greater level of MMP-2 immunoreactivity and mRNA expression, but less TIMP-2 and α-1 antitrypsin immunoreactivity and mRNA expression in their uterosacral ligaments. However, neutrophil elastase mRNA expression was similar between uterine prolapse and control tissue. Our results showed that there was a close relationship between expressions of MMP-2, TIMP-2, and α-1 antitrypsin in uterosacral ligament and the occurrence of uterine prolapse.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common condition which can disturb a woman’s quality of life, its etiology is still unclear. The pelvic organs are supported by the muscles of the pelvic floor and the fibromuscular wall of the vagina. Along with its ligaments, fibromuscular wall of the vagina is a mesh-like group of collagen fibers interlaced with elastin, smooth muscle, and vascular structures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111424443">1</xref>
</sup> Elastin plays an important role in providing the elasticity and resilience of some tissues such as skin, large arteries, and certain ligaments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111424443">2</xref>
</sup> Altered elastin metabolism has been documented in pelvic tissues from women with pelvic floor dysfunction.<sup>

</sup> Many proteolytic enzymes such as neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) are capable of degrading elastin have been studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111424443">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111424443"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424443">7</xref></sup> Chen et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424443">7</xref>
</sup> reported that elastolytic activity is increased in pelvic tissues from women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) compared to asymptomatic controls, through an increase in neutrophil elastase activity and a concurrent decrease in α-1 antitrypsin expression. In addition, they<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424443">7</xref>
</sup> also demonstrated that neutrophil elastase appears to be a more significant modulator of elastase activity compared to MMP-2. To date, information on elastin and its proteolytic enzymes in women with uterine prolapse is rare. The purposes of this study was to quantify protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of MMP-2, its inhibitor that is tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2), neutrophil elastase as well as α-1 antitrypsin, in uterosacral ligaments and cervical tissues from women with uterine prolapse compared to asymptomatic normal controls.</p>

<sec id="section2-1933719111424443">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>From September 2007 to August 2008, a total of 27 patients with severe uterine prolapse referred to our urogynecologic center for surgery were invited to participate in this study after informed consent, which was approved by Institutional Review Board in our university (No. 95-1149B).</p>
<p>Before hysterectomy, all patients underwent meticulous evaluations which included a detailed medical history, pelvic examination, urogynecological questionnaire, urinalysis and/or urine culture, micturition diary, and urodynamic studies. All of these patients met uterine prolapse greater than stage 2 by the POP quantification (POPQ) scoring system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111424443">8</xref>
</sup> An urodynamic testing and pessary test were performed in all patients to exclude occult SUI before surgery, thereby eliminating patients with clinical or urodynamic findings of urinary incontinence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111424443">9</xref>
</sup> The control group included those age-matched patients without symptoms of urinary incontinence or uterine prolapse undergoing laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy during the same period for benign gynecological disorders including uterine fibroids, ovarian tumors, and menorrhagia.</p>
<p>Patients with a history of endometriosis, gynecologic malignancies, pelvic inflammatory conditions, connective tissues disorders, hormone therapy within 1 year, and previous pelvic surgery were excluded, for the concern of altering the expression of MMP and TIMP.</p>
<sec id="section3-1933719111424443">
<title>Tissue Collection</title>
<p>A total of 41 (27 prolapsed patients and 14 normal controls) paired tissues (5-10 mm) were taken from uterine cervix 1 cm apart from the upper lip of the cervical orifice as nonsupport tissue and from the uterosacral ligament as support tissue, respectively. Half of the biopsy specimens were processed for RNA extraction and another half of the specimen was fixed in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) for immunohistochemistry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719111424443">
<title>Reverse Transcription</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from the tissue samples using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method (RNAzol; Tel-Test, Friendswood, Texas). RNA was diluted to 1 μg/μL for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Total RNA was reversed transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) amplified by PCR using specific primers referenced from previous studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111424443">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111424443">10</xref>
</sup> for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; 73 bp), MMP-2 (448 bp), TIMP-2 (585 bp), neutrophil elastase (580 bp), and α-1 antitrypsin (647 bp) target cDNA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719111424443">
<title>Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR</title>
<p>TaqMan real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA isolation of pelvic tissues of each woman was done by mincing in Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York) and homogenized completely on ice. Total RNA was extracted by chloroform and purified twice through RNeasy minicolumns. Transcripts encoding for MMP-2 (Assay ID: Hs01548733-m1), TIMP-2 (Assay ID: Hs01091319-m1), neutrophil elastase (Assay ID: Hs00975994-g1), and α-1 antitrypsin (Assay ID: Hs01097800-m1) were measured by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR with the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) and the ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 50°C for 2 minutes, 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds, and 60°C for 1 minutes. The 18S ribosomal RNA ([rRNA]; Assay ID: Hs99999901-s1) transcript was used as internal control gene and was amplified in a separate tube to normalize for variance in input RNA. The level of target mRNA in various samples was estimated by the 2[–Delta Delta C(T)] relative quantification method.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111424443">11</xref>
</sup> For each reaction, relative mRNA copies were expressed as the relative expression rate 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> where ΔΔCt = ΔCt (observed) − ΔCt (18S rRNA). Ct stands for the number of cycles when the fluorescent signal reached the upper threshold in each reaction tube. ΔCt was applied to calculate the differences between observed and control groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111424443">12</xref>
</sup> Data were summarized as the mean ± standard deviation or percentage, as appropriate. Differences in the mean values between the 2 groups were analyzed by the unpaired Student <italic>t</italic> test. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1933719111424443">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The biopsy specimens were sectioned at 5-μm thickness and collected on slide glass by 4% paraformaldehyde fixation. After blocking for 10 minutes, the sections were incubated for 16 hours at 4°C with mouse monoclonal antibody against activated MMP-2 (diluted 1/50; NeoMarkers, Fremont, California), or mouse monoclonal antibody against activated TIMP-2 (1/50; NeoMarkers) or rabbit monoclonal antibody against activated α-1 antitrypsin (1/70; Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri). Because of nonsignificant change in its mRNA expression and not enough biopsy specimens, the immunoreactivity of neutrophil elastase was not done. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked for 10 minutes with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Then the sections were washed and incubated for 10 minutes with SuperPicTure kits (Invitrogen Corpration, Carlsbad, California). Staining was developed using 3-3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate kit (Bio Genex San Ramon, California). The positive control slides were prepared from ovarian cancer tissue for MMP-2<bold>,</bold> colon cancer tissue for TIMP-2, and tonsil cancer tissue for α-1 antitrypsin known to express the targets. The negative control slides were prepared from the same tissue blocks of omitting specific primary antibodies instead of normal, nonimmune serum supernatant from the same sources.</p>
<p>For calculating the immunoreactive cell densities of MMP-2, TIMP-2, and α-1 antitrypsin, every third section of biopsy specimen was collected and a total of 4 sections from each patient were immunostained.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111424443">13</xref>
</sup> The number of immunoreactive cells in each section of pelvic tissue (number/mm<sup>2</sup> = immunoreactive cell density) was calculated by counting 10 randomly chosen fields under a magnification of ×400. The area of pelvic tissue was mapped on a scale diagram and measured by a computerized graphic system (Image-Pro Plus, version 1.3, Silver Springs, Maryland). The measurements were conducted by an observer who was blind to the experiment. The average immunoreactive cell densities of the 4 sections in each patient was measured and expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. The unpaired Student <italic>t </italic>test was used to compare the mean density of immunoreactive cell of MMP-2, TIMP-2, and α-1 antitrypsin between the groups of prolapse and control. Parity was expressed as median ± quartiles. <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty-seven (average age: 59.0 ± 10.5) women with severe uterine prolapse, as well as 14 normal controls (the average age: 57.6 ± 8.6) were included. There was no significant difference in parity (3 ± 1 vs 3 ± 1) and in body mass index (25.3 ± 2.6 vs 25.6 ± 3.1) among these 2 groups. Compared with normal controls, tissue from women with POP had a significantly greater level of MMP-2 mRNA expression, but less TIMP-2 and α-1 antitrypsin mRNA expression in their uterosacral ligaments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719111424443">Table 1</xref>). However, neutrophil elastase mRNA expression was similar between uterine prolapse and control tissue. With regard to their immunoreactivity, MMP-2 was higher; while TIMP-2 and α-1 antitrypsin were lower in the uterosacral ligaments of women with POP than those in normal controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111424443">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719111424443">2</xref>). Setting the average level of MMP-2 immunoreactive cell density (equal to 353) in the uterosacral ligament of the normal controls as a standard reference, we further divided the POP group into 2 subgroups, those with MMP-2 higher than standard (n = 19) and those lower (n = 8), then compared them in terms of their age, parity, body mass index, severity of prolapse, duration of prolapse, smoking, menopause, and diabetes mellitus; the result showed no significant difference among all these parameters between these 2 subgroups of POP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719111424443">Table 2</xref>). There was no difference in MMP-2, α-1 antitrypsin, and TIMP-2 immunoreactivity and mRNA expression in cervical tissues from patients with uterine prolapse and control group.</p>

<p>Clinically many women with POP have coexistent SUI; on the contrary, many women with SUI have no complaint of POP, so we supposed there could be different pathophysiology causing prolapse and urinary incontinence. For investigating the effect of degradation of elastin on uterine prolapse, patients with clinical or occult urinary incontinence were excluded from our study for preventing confounding factors from urinary incontinence to distort the interpretation of results. In addition, although some authors observed strong correlations among all markers of collagen metabolism between vaginal skin and uterosacral ligaments,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111424443">15</xref>
</sup> we chose a support pelvic tissue from uterosacral ligament and a nonsupport tissue from cervical tissue for elastolytic enzymes expression study because different tissues analyzed in collagen or elastin degradation might get converse results. Furthermore, in order to mimic the procedure of vaginal hysterectomy, we enrolled those women receiving laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy for treating benign gynecological diseases as control participants. Our results suggested that uterine prolapse is related to obvious changes in protein and mRNA expression of elastolytic enzymes in the uterosacral ligament but not in the cervical tissue.</p>
<p>Chen et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111424443">4</xref>
</sup> reported that α-1 antitrypsin mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in vaginal wall tissues from women with SUI in the proliferative phase of menses, but neither neutrophil elastase nor cathepsin K differed between women with SUI and asymptomatic controls. In another study, Chen et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424443">7</xref>
</sup> found that during the secretory phase, elastolytic activity is increased in pelvic tissue from premenopausal women with SUI, through an increase in neutrophil elastase activity and a concurrent decrease in α-1 antitrypsin expression. However, neutrophil elastase mRNA and protein expressions were similar between SUI and control tissue. Our data were alike previous reports that a significant decrease in α-1 antitrypsin mRNA expression and no difference in neutrophil elastase mRNA expression were demonstrated in uterosacral ligament from women with uterine prolapse, in comparison to normal controls. Chen et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111424443">7</xref>
</sup> measured the effect of antineutrophil elastase and anti-MMP-2 antibodies on vaginal fibroblast elastase activity in premenopausal women with SUI and found neutrophil elastase appears to be a more significant modulator of elastase activity compared to MMP2. To the contrary, we observed a different result that significant increase in MMP-2 mRNA expression and decrease in the expression of TIMP-2mRNA. All of our patients with POP had no SUI and most of them were going through menopausal, which could be the reason for such a different result. One previous study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111424443">16</xref>
</sup> had found mRNA levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in vaginal musculature from women with POP significantly increased, and suggested that POP was an acquired disorder of exacellular matrix. In mice, Budatha et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111424443">16</xref>
</sup> had reported that fibulin 5, an integrin-binding matricellular protein, regulated the activity of MMP-9 to maintain the integrity of the vaginal wall and consequently prevented the development of POP; thus, deletion of MMP-9 in fibulin 5 knockout mice significantly decreased the severity of POP by increasing elastic fiber density and improving collagen fibrils. Gabriel et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111424443">17</xref>
</sup> for collagen in POP reported that increased MMP-2 expression in uterosacral ligament is associated with POP between women with POP and those without.</p>
<p>In this study, we assessed the immunoreactivity of MMP-2, α-1 antitrypsin, and TIMP-2 by immunohistochemistry and found these elastolytic enzymes expressed significantly differently between women with uterine prolapse and controls in their uterosacral ligaments. Our data have shown that the immunoreactivity of MMP-2 significantly is increased; TIMP-2 and α-1 antitrypsin decreased significantly in uterosacral ligaments in women with uterine prolapse. In an immunohistochemical study of elastin abnormalities in the cardinal ligaments, Ewies et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111424443">18</xref>
</sup> found that elastin expression was 3 to 4 times lower in women with prolapse when compared with those without prolapse. This association was more pronounced in postmenopausal compared with premenopausal women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111424443">18</xref>
</sup> Karam et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111424443">19</xref>
</sup> used immunohistochemical staining and morphometric analysis to discover that elastin expression and fiber width are significantly lower in the anterior vaginal wall of postmenopausal women with a large cystocele than in controls of a similar age. Lin et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111424443">20</xref>
</sup> used immunohistochemical method to investigate the changes in elastin in the anterior vaginal wall and got converse results that elastin expression increases in women with prolapse, but elastin expression is not different between groups after multivariable regression analysis. Klutke et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719111424443">21</xref>
</sup> assessed elastin content in uterosacral ligament biopsies by measuring desmosine and found less elastin content in women with genital prolapse than in controls.</p>
<p>There were limitations for this study, including a relatively small patient number and not enough pelvic tissues for desmosine assays. With a larger population, perhaps more statistically significant results might have shown up in the cervical tissue. As a matter of fact, research in elastin or collagen expression of the pelvic floor has been difficult, in part due to the scant availability of tissue for analysis. Not only are these pelvic areas difficult to sample, but to remove healthy supportive tissues from the control women may result in their pelvic floor dysfunction. This was also limited by the size of tissue sampled (5-10 mm), so small that we did not have enough specimen to conduct assays on desmosine, a cross-link that is unique to elastin. Finally, because almost all the recruited patients were in the postmenopausal status, and although our results demonstrated significant differences in MMP-2 and in the expression of its inhibitors between women of POP and the controls, we were, however, incapable of showing the relationship of age with the presence of POP.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results showed that women with uterine prolapse had a higher MMP-2 and a lower α-1 antitrypsin mRNA and protein expression in uterosacral ligaments than asymptomatic controls, suggesting the involvement of an altered elastolytic process in women with uterine prolapse. So, with these different test levels of MMP-2, TIMP-2, and α-1 antitrypsin in uterosacral ligament, our study succeeded in proving their link to the occurrence of uterine prolapse.</p>
