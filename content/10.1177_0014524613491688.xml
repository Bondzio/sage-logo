<title>Proper 17: September 1</title>
<p>Call to prayer: ‘The beginning of human pride is to forsake the Lord; the heart has withdrawn from its Maker.’ (Sirach 10:12)
<disp-quote>
<p>Humble God,</p>
<p>We come before you, ashamed of our pride.</p>
<p>We have forsaken you to strive and grasp after</p>
<p>All manner of things</p>
<p>for our own self-importance,</p>
<p>our own satisfaction.</p>
<p>Yet you are the fount of living water.</p>
<p>You are the source of life.</p>
<p>Forgive us when we puff ourselves up</p>
<p>in relation to others</p>
<p>and miss the point</p>
<p>that our significance is in</p>
<p>relation to you.</p>
<p>Our honour consists in being your children,</p>
<p>Created, redeemed and loved by you.</p>
<p>We thank you for pursuing us through history</p>
<p>That we might delight in you,</p>
<p>And find room to honour others,</p>
<p>our fellow human beings,</p>
<p>Your children, our brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>We thank you that you came among us</p>
<p>As one of us, in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p>Who was born in a stable,</p>
<p>Lived among us in simplicity,</p>
<p>A king with no palace,</p>
<p>His only crown a crown of thorns.</p>
<p>He befriended the low-esteemed and the hated,</p>
<p>Stood in solidarity with the broken-hearted and oppressed,</p>
<p>Offered hospitality to friends and strangers,</p>
<p>And on the night he was betrayed, offered communion to his betrayer.</p>
<p>Who are we, then, to puff ourselves up?</p>
<p>On what grounds are we self-important?</p>
<p>Humble God,</p>
<p>Forgive us when we forget</p>
<p>That you are our Maker</p>
<p>our source of life.</p>
<p>Our honour is in being yours</p>
<p>Our calling is to be like you</p>
<p>With delight and in all humility.</p>
<p>Amen</p>

<title>Proper 19: September 15</title>
<p>Call to prayer: ‘To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.’ (1 Tim 1:17)
<disp-quote>
<p>Merciful God,</p>
<p>Your love and faithfulness draw praise from our lips.</p>
<p>You have never given up on us</p>
<p>Though we have turned from you,</p>
<p>Have been faithless, ignorant, distracted,</p>
<p>Neglectful, oppressive and violent.</p>
<p>We have caused you anger and grief.</p>
<p>We are truly sorry.</p>
<p>We praise you for your faithfulness.</p>
<p>You have pursued us like a shepherd</p>
<p>Searching for a lost sheep,</p>
<p>A woman for a lost coin.</p>
<p>You have a cheer squad in heaven, ready,</p>
<p>For when even one of us returns to you</p>
<p>in repentance and humility.</p>
<p>Your mercy draws our praise.</p>
<p>We thank you that your delight is our restoration,</p>
<p>The cleansing of our hearts and spirits,</p>
<p>Our returning home to you.</p>
<p>May we grieve you no more.</p>
<p>Praise to you, the immortal, invisible, only God. To you be honour and glory for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Amen</p>

<title>Proper 20: September 22</title>
<p><bold>Call to Prayer: “</bold>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone.” (1 Timothy 2:1-7)
<disp-quote>
<p>Compassionate God,</p>
<p>You desire all to be saved and to live in your truth.</p>
<p>As your people, draw us out of ourselves and towards others, in our lives and in our prayers.</p>
<p>We pray for those in grief, whose joy has left them.</p>
<p>For those who mourn the loss of a loved one who has moved away or died, be their comforter.</p>
<p>For those who grieve the loss of innocence, the lack of respect or dignity, be their hope.</p>
<p>For those suffering injustice or war, stir our leaders to act for justice and peace.</p>
<p>Give us the courage to grieve with those who suffer, and to act with your compassion in this crying world. Move us with your Spirit to renounce our own comforts,</p>
<p>to sigh and groan to you on their behalf,</p>
<p>and to accept the ministry of others</p>
<p>when we are full of sorrow.</p>
<p>For you lived among us and shared our suffering.</p>
<p>You gave from your true wealth,</p>
<p>that we might have life in abundance.</p>
<p>Teach us the meaning of true wealth,</p>
<p>Of what an honour it is to serve and be served</p>
<p>Beyond all pretensions and falsities,</p>
<p>Human beings together, all of whom you desire to save</p>
<p>and to be true.</p>
<p>We thank you for those who live from</p>
<p>your humble love and care,</p>
<p>who are moved by the needs of others</p>
<p>who mediate on their behalf.</p>
<p>We offer our supplications and prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings for others, in the name of Christ who mediated between God and humankind.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
