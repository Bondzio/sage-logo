<p>This first issue of volume 17, 2013 reflects global interest in student issues with articles focussed on the needs of British students studying abroad (Brenda Bartram), American students when they return home from a period of study abroad (David Haines), international students studying in an Indian technical university (Nandini Karky) and the needs and experiences of undergraduate transnational medical students (Jennifer Lindley, Louise McCall and Adela Abu-Arab). Yuzhuo Cai and Jussi Kivistö discuss the issue of tuition fees for international students in Finland.</p>
<p>These articles reflect growing global interest in themes and topics related to international education. Every year more articles are submitted to the <italic>Journal of Studies in International Education</italic> for peer review. In 2012 there were well over 200 submissions covering a broad range of topics, more than ever before. This alone demonstrates that there is ever increasing interest in engaging in scholarly activity on the internationalisation of higher education, and in publishing the outcomes of that activity. Other developments in the field also support this proposition. For example, in 2012 the <italic>Centre for Higher Education Internationalisation</italic> (CHEI) was established at the Università Cattolica Sacro Cuore in Milan, Italy. Both of us are actively involved in the Centre which stimulates and supports research through activities such as a doctoral programme, seminars, publications and policy studies on international education. In November 2012, in cooperation with the <italic>European Association for International Education</italic> (EAIE), CHEI organised its first Research Seminar for current and aspirant doctoral students on the internationalisation of higher education. The fact that the Centre was able to attract 20 participants from Northern America, Africa, Australia and Europe to this seminar, is further evidence of the increased interest across the world on research in international education. This interest also manifests itself in the emergence of much-needed new journals.</p>
<p>In 2011 a new journal entered the field, the <italic>Journal of International Students</italic>, based at Arkansas State University in the US (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jistudents.org">http://jistudents.org</ext-link>). It is published twice a year, online and in print. It accepts narrative, theoretical and empirically-based research articles, student reflections, and book reviews relevant to international students and their cross-cultural experiences and understanding. After four issues in two years it is clear that this journal is establishing itself as a valuable avenue for the dissemination of studies focussed on international students. More recently, the Agence Europe Education Formation (2e2f) France, an ACA member organisation, launched a call for submissions to prepare the first edition of the <italic>Journal of International Mobility</italic> focused on all dimensions of international mobility within the framework of lifelong learning, both in Europe and worldwide. These journals complement the work of journals like the <italic>Journal of Studies in International Education</italic>, as well as others including <italic>Frontiers</italic>, which is focussed on Study Abroad and linked to the Forum on Education Abroad based in the US (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.forumea.org">www.forumea.org</ext-link>). Other examples of established journals in the field include the Handbook on Internationalisation of European Higher Education, published by the <italic>European Association for International Education (EAIE</italic>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eaie.org">www.eaie.org</ext-link>) in cooperation with Raabe Publishers and free for EAIE members, and Educación Global, published once a year by the <italic>Mexican Association for International Education AMPEI</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ampei.org.mx">www.ampei.org.mx</ext-link>).</p>
<p>As editors of this journal, which covers the broad field, we are pleased to contribute to the dissemination of the outcomes of research into the practice and theory of international education and welcome any initiatives providing much-needed avenues for scholarly conversation through publication.</p>
