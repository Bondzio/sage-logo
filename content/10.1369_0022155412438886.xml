<abstract>
<p>The current study examined the role of PLD2 in the maintenance of mast cell structure. Phospholipase D (PLD) catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to produce choline and phosphatidic acid (PA). PLD has two isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, which vary in expression and localization depending on the cell type. The mast cell line RBL-2H3 was transfected to overexpress catalytically active (PLD2CA) and inactive (PLD2CI) forms of PLD2. The results of this study show that PLD2CI cells have a distinct star-shaped morphology, whereas PLD2CA and RBL-2H3 cells are spindle shaped. In PLD2CI cells, the Golgi complex was also disorganized with dilated cisternae, and more Golgi-associated vesicles were present as compared with the PLD2CA and RBL-2H3 cells. Treatment with exogenous PA led to the restoration of the wild-type Golgi complex phenotype in PLD2CI cells. Conversely, treatment of RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells with 1% 1-Butanol led to a disruption of the Golgi complex. The distribution of acidic compartments, including secretory granules and lysosomes, was also modified in PLD2CI cells, where they concentrated in the perinuclear region. These results suggest that the PA produced by PLD2 plays an important role in regulating cell morphology in mast cells.</p>

<body>
<p>Phospholipase D (PLD) is a phospholipid-modifying enzyme that plays a pivotal role in many cellular functions, such as rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, vesicle trafficking, mitogenesis, and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155412438886">Fang et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155412438886">Kam and Exton 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412438886">Cazzolli et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022155412438886">Oude Weernink et al. 2007</xref>). Two major mammalian isoforms of PLD have been identified, PLD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412438886">Hammond et al. 1995</xref>) and PLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412438886">Colley, Sung, et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Both isoforms are widely expressed in a variety of tissues and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155412438886">Gibbs and Meier 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022155412438886">Vorland et al. 2008</xref>). PLD1 and PLD2 share approximately 50% homology in the conserved catalytic core and are more variable at the N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155412438886">Liscovitch et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412438886">Exton 2002</xref>). PLD2 has a higher basal activity than PLD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155412438886">Chen and Exton 2004</xref>). PLD hydrolyzes the terminal phosphodiester bond of phosphatidylcholine, the predominant membrane phospholipid, to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline. The production of PA is highly regulated by a number of intracellular factors, including phosphoinositides, Rho, Arf, and a variety of GTPases. Furthermore, PA can be converted to other potentially bioactive lipids, such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which act as second messengers in many cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412438886">Jenkins and Frohman 2005</xref>). PLD2 is reported to localize to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412438886">Colley, Altshuller, et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155412438886">Du et al. 2004</xref>) and to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412438886">Freyberg et al. 2002</xref>) and to be associated with β-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412438886">Lee et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Mast cells are involved in a variety of allergic and inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412438886">Galli et al. 2008</xref>). These cells bind IgE to the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcϵRI) on the cell surface. In the presence of specific antigen, FcϵRI is cross-linked, thus activating the cell and releasing the preformed inflammatory mediators contained in secretory granules and generating other inflammatory lipids and cytokines. PLD is thought to play an essential role in mast cell degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155412438886">Dinh and Kennerly 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022155412438886">Way et al. 2000</xref>) and can be activated in isolated mast cells as well as in cultured RBL-2H3 mast cells by a variety of stimulants, including antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155412438886">Lin and Gilfillan 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412438886">Kumada et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412438886">Hitomi et al. 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Most previous investigations on PLD in mast cells have focused on its role in signal transduction via FcϵRI. Previous studies have shown that PLD1, but not PLD2, is a negative regulator of mast cell degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412438886">Hitomi et al. 2004</xref>). PLD2 had a higher basal activity than PLD1 but did not respond to antigenic stimulation. During the course of the previous investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412438886">Hitomi et al. 2004</xref>), it was noted that there were morphological changes in the cells that overexpressed the dominant-negative catalytically inactive form of PLD1b. Therefore, it was of interest to determine if PLD2 also plays a role in maintaining the structure of RBL-2H3 mast cells. Cell lines overexpressing catalytically active and catalytically inactive forms of PLD2 showed increases in both forms of PLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412438886">Hitomi et al. 2004</xref>). The results of the present study indicate that the production of PA by PLD2 contributes to the basic cell morphology, maintenance of the Golgi complex, and distribution of lysosomes and secretory granules in mast cells.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The expression and distribution of PLD2 varied among the three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412438886">Fig. 1</xref>). PLD2 mRNA was quantified by real-time qPCR, and the total amount of transcripts was significantly higher in PLD2CA and PLD2CI cells when compared with RBL-2H3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412438886">Fig. 1A</xref>). The protein expression of PLD2 among the three cell lines generally reflected the levels of the transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412438886">Fig. 1B</xref>). The expression of PLD2 was significantly higher in PLD2CI cells as compared with RBL-2H3 cells, whereas PLD2CA cells expressed only slightly more PLD2 than did the wild-type cells. The differences in expression may be a reflection of turnover rates. The three cell lines also showed differences in the distribution of PLD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412438886">Fig. 1C</xref>). In RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells, PLD2 was dispersed in a punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm and followed the outline of the plasma membrane. In contrast, in PLD2CI cells, PLD2 was concentrated in the cell body. The normalized fluorescence intensity showed that PLD2CA and PLD2CI cells both had similar levels of fluorescence that were significantly higher than in the RBL-2H3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412438886">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>It then became of interest to examine if the differences in PLD2 expression were reflected in alterations in the morphology of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412438886">Fig. 2</xref>). Wild-type RBL-2H3, PLD2CA, and PLD2CI cells were initially characterized by SEM. RBL-2H3 cells were fusiform (spindle shaped), and by SEM, it could be seen that the surface was covered with fine microvilli. The PLD2CA cells were also fusiform but with long cytoplasmatic extensions. By SEM, the PLD2CA cells showed the same fusiform morphology as the RBL-2H3 cells. In contrast, the PLD2CI cells differed from the other cell lines due to the presence of numerous cytoplasmatic extensions resulting in a characteristic star-shaped morphology. The distribution of cytoskeletal components in these cell lines was also examined. In RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells, the actin filaments followed the plasma membrane and the microvilli on the cell surface. In the PLD2CI cells, the actin filaments were also found under the plasma membrane, following the star-shaped form of the cell and in the microvilli. The microtubules in RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells were organized into long, straight bundles, giving the cell its fusiform shape. The microtubule distribution in the PLD2CI cells was altered when compared with the other cell lines. In PLD2CI cells, the microtubules were arranged in a basket-like form in the cell body and radiated throughout the numerous cytoplasmatic extensions in these star-shaped cells. Thus, overexpression of the catalytically inactive form of PLD2 appears to have a dramatic effect on the morphology of these cells.</p>

<p>PLD2 is important for maintaining cell structure and organization. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), RBL-2H3 cells were spindle shaped and their surface was covered with short microvilli. PLD2CA cells had morphology similar to that of RBL-2H3 cells. The majority of PLD2CI cells were star shaped with multiple cytoplasmic extensions (arrows), and their surface was also covered with short microvilli. Analysis of the cytoskeleton following 3D reconstruction of fluorescent images showed that there were differences in the distribution of the cytoskeleton in the PLD2CI cells when compared with the RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells. Actin filaments in RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells were under the plasma membrane following the spindle shape of the cells and in association with microvilli. Actin filaments were also seen in occasional ruffles. In PLD2CI cells, actin filaments followed the star shape of the cells and extended through the cytoplasmic projections. There were also numerous small actin containing projections on the surface of these cells. In RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells, microtubules (arrows) were organized into bundles that followed the fusiform shape of the cells, whereas in PLD2CI cells, the microtubules (arrows) in the cell body were more disorganized and appeared basket-like in the cell body.</p>

<p>Because the organization of the Golgi complex is dependent on the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022155412438886">Thyberg and Moskalewski 1999</xref>), the Golgi complex was also analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412438886">Fig. 3A</xref>). In the RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells, the Golgi complex was compact and juxtanuclear in location. In PLD2CI cells, the Golgi complex was disorganized and dispersed. Volume rendering of the Golgi complex verified the observations made by fluorescence microscopy. This observation was further confirmed by quantifying the area of the Golgi complex in the various cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412438886">Fig. 3B</xref>). The area occupied by the Golgi complex in the PLD2CA cells was significantly less than the RBL-2H3 cells, whereas the area occupied by the Golgi complex in the PLD2CI cells was significantly greater than the other two cell lines.</p>

<p>By TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412438886">Fig. 4</xref>), the Golgi complex in RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells was seen to be compact and close to the nucleus, with thin parallel cisternae. In PLD2CI cells, the Golgi complex was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, with dilated cisternae and numerous dilated Golgi-associated vesicles that were absent in the other cell lines. Because of the differences seen in the morphology of the Golgi complex in the PLD2CI cells, it was of interest to investigate whether PA produced by PLD was involved in maintaining the structure of the Golgi complex. By TEM, it was possible to characterize the effects of treatment with PA or 1% 1-Butanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412438886">Fig. 4</xref>). Treatment with PA in RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells did not alter the organization of the Golgi complex. The Golgi complex in these cell lines remained well organized, with thin and flattened cisternae, whereas in PLD2CI cells, the treatment with PA led to a more organized Golgi complex. The Golgi complex recovered its structural organization with parallel cisternae, and the number of Golgi-associated vesicles was reduced. To confirm that the lack of PA was responsible for the effects seen in the Golgi complex of the PLD2CI cells, the cell lines were treated with 1% 1-Butanol, which blocks the production of PA synthesized from PLD. In RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells, the treatment with 1% 1-Butanol led to the dispersion of the Golgi complex and the Golgi cisternae, and some vesicles were dilated. It was also observed that the cisternae were no longer parallel in the PLD2CA cells but were curved in a horseshoe shape. The treatment of PLD2CI cells with 1% 1-Butanol led to dilation of the Golgi cisternae and an increase in the number of vesicles.</p>

There was also an increase in the number of Golgi-associated vesicles in the PLD2CI cells. By TEM, treatment of RBL-2H3 cells with 10 mg/ml PA for 24 hr did not alter the morphology of Golgi complex. However, treatment with 1% 1-Butanol for 20 min led to the disorganization of the Golgi complex and dilated cisternae. Treatment of PLD2CA cells with phosphatidic acid (PA) did not alter the organization of the Golgi complex. In these cells, treatment with1% 1-Butanol also resulted in the disorganization of the Golgi complex and dilation of the cisternae. Treatment with PA in PLD2CI cells led to a decrease in the size of the Golgi complex cisternae and number of Golgi-associated vesicles (arrows), but treatment with 1% 1-Butanol did not alter the structure of the Golgi complex (arrows).

<p>Because the Golgi complex is responsible for the production of lysosomes, secretory granules, and their contents, the distribution and morphology of acidic compartments, including secretory granules and lysosomes, were evaluated with LysoTracker. RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells presented numerous acidic vesicles spread throughout the cytoplasm and cell projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412438886">Fig. 5</xref>). In PLD2CI cells, the acidic vesicles were concentrated in the perinuclear region with few vesicles in the cell extensions. Staining with Alcian blue, which stains the glycosaminoglycans present in the granules, showed that, in RBL-2H3 cells, the granules are present throughout the cytoplasm. In PLD2CA cells, the granules had the same distribution but appeared larger. The PLD2CI cells appear to have fewer, smaller granules that are concentrated near the nucleus. The morphology of the secretory granules was further characterized by TEM. In RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells, the secretory granules were heterogeneous, whereas in PLD2CI cells, the granules had an electron lucid content. Quantification of granule diameter and area showed that cytoplamatic granules in the RBL-2H3 and PLD2CA cells had the same overall size, whereas PLD2CI cells had significantly smaller granules when compared with the other cell lines.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, the importance of PLD2 in maintaining cell structure and function was examined in stable mast cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412438886">Hitomi et al. 2004</xref>) that overexpress the wild-type or a dominant-negative form of PLD2. Overexpression of the catalytically inactive form of PLD2 appears to have a dramatic effect on the morphology of these cells, suggesting that the production of PA by PLD2 contributes to structural maintenance of the cytoskeleton and the Golgi complex as well as influencing the distribution of lysosomes and secretory granules in mast cells. The morphological changes observed in the present study are most likely the result of low levels of PA in the PLD2CI cells as well as the interaction of PLD2 with the cytoskeleton.</p>
<p>One of the striking features of the PLD2CI cells was the alteration in their shape. In contrast to the fusiform shape of the wild-type RBL-2H3 cells and the PLD2CA cells, most of the PLD2CI cells were star shaped with long cytoplasmic extensions. The shape of the cells correlated with the distribution of actin fibers and microtubules. Rat embryo fibroblasts overexpressing PLD2 also exhibited numerous cell projections and filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412438886">Colley, Sung, et al. 1997</xref>). PLD2 is also known to contribute to stimulus-induced cytoskeletal reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155412438886">Iyer and Kusner 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155412438886">Liscovitch et al. 1999</xref>). In RBL-2H3 cells, activation of ARF6 by antigen and continual PLD2 activity were both necessary for actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022155412438886">O’Luanaigh et al. 2002</xref>). The reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton following PLD stimulation was first demonstrated in cultured fibroblasts stimulated by LPA or by the addition of exogenous PA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155412438886">Ha and Exton 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155412438886">Ha et al. 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the roles of PLD in general and PLD1 specifically in cytoskeletal reorganization have been extensively studied, little is known about the specific role of PLD2 in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155412438886">McDermott 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022155412438886">Morris 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022155412438886">Oude Weernink et al. 2007</xref>). In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUV-EC), PLD2 has recently been shown to have an important role in stress fiber formation and in the permeability of endothelial cell layers. This change in endothelial permeability appears to be linked to PA-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement as well as activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Activation of this pathway then downregulates the expression of occludin, a tight junction structural protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022155412438886">Zeiller et al. 2009</xref>). The activity of PLD2 itself may be controlled by binding to cytoskeletal components. β-Actin binds directly to PLD2 at amino acids 613 to 723 and inhibits its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412438886">Lee et al. 2001</xref>). PLD2 also directly interacts with tubulin by binding PLD2 at amino acids 476 to 612. Binding of tubulin to PLD2 also inhibits PLD2 activity, and this activity is inversely proportional to the concentration of monomeric tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412438886">Chae et al. 2005</xref>). Thus, the cytoskeleton itself can regulate the production of PA by PLD, controlling the level and the cellular location of PA necessary to modify cytoskeleton organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412438886">Exton 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022155412438886">Rudge and Wakelam 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current study, it was observed that the presence of the catalytically inactive form of PLD2 also resulted in changes in the Golgi complex, which can be explained by the low level of PA in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412438886">Hitomi et al. 2004</xref>). PLD is known to be associated with the Golgi complex in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412438886">Freyberg et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022155412438886">McDermott et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022155412438886">Riebeling et al. 2009</xref>) and is involved with the transport of Golgi-associated vesicles. The results of the present study agree with previous studies showing that PA and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate are required to maintain the structural integrity of the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022155412438886">Siddhanta et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022155412438886">Sweeney et al. 2002</xref>). In rat pituitary GH3 cells, &gt;90% of the Golgi-associated PLD2 is localized to the rims of the Golgi cisternae and to Golgi-associated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412438886">Freyberg et al. 2002</xref>). The budding of COPI vesicles from the Golgi complex depends on PA produced by PLD2. PA is known to play a critical role in vesicle formation. Activation of PLD and the resultant PA production promotes a negative curvature of membranes, facilitating vesicle fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022155412438886">McMahon and Gallop 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412438886">Cazzolli et al. 2006</xref>). In PLD2-depleted cells, budding COPI vesicles accumulate at the lateral rims of the Golgi cisternae, and the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi is reduced and disorganized. COPI vesicle fission can be divided into two stages. In the early stage BARS (Brefeldin-A ADP-ribosylated substrate), PA and other COPI components are required for bud-neck constriction. The second step, in which the bud neck is cut, is dependent on PA generated by PLD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022155412438886">Yang et al. 2008</xref>). Inhibition of PLD2 also results in a mild disruption in the Golgi complex, similar to that reported in the current study.</p>
<p>PLD is an important regulator of secretion in mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412438886">Choi, Chahdi, et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412438886">Choi, Kim, et al. 2002</xref>). The distribution and morphology of lysosomes and secretory granules in the various cell lines can be related to the basal levels of PA produced in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412438886">Hitomi et al. 2004</xref>). The low levels of PA in the PLD2CI cells affect the distribution of secretory granules and lysosomes. One possible explanation for this change in distribution may be the effect of the catalytically inactive form of PLD2 on the actin cytoskeleton, as the actin cytoskeleton is known to play a role in vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022155412438886">Pfeiffer et al. 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155412438886">Kuznetsov et al. 1992</xref>). In mast cells, activation via FcϵRI stimulates actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022155412438886">Sahara et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022155412438886">Oka et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155412438886">Farquhar et al. 2007</xref>) and subsequent fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane and mediator release.</p>
<p>Another explanation for the change in distribution of acidic compartments seen in the PLD2CI cells may relate to the requirement for PA in vesicle formation. PLD2 has been shown to regulate the transport of vesicles between the trans Golgi network and the apical plasma membrane in human intestinal HT29-c119A cells. Although the exact mechanism of action is unclear, it is most likely related to the ability of PA to influence membrane curvature. Therefore, PLD2 may be controlling secretory vesicle formation at the Trans Golgi Network (TGN) level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155412438886">Denmat-Ouisse et al. 2001</xref>) in a manner similar to that seen for COPI vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022155412438886">Yang et al. 2008</xref>). PA is considered a fusogenic lipid that participates in membrane fission and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155412438886">Kooijman et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412438886">Cazzolli et al. 2006</xref>). These processes require a transitory reorganization of bilipid membranes that do not occur spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155412438886">Lentz et al. 2000</xref>). Therefore, the local concentration of PA produced by PLD2 may be the determining factor in vesicle formation. The present study shows that the production of PA by PLD2 is essential for the regulation of the structure and organization of RBL-2H3 mast cells. The exact mechanism by which PLD2 exerts its effects is not clearly understood but seems to be related, at least in part, to intracellular PA levels.</p>
