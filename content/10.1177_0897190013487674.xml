<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The serotonin transporter (5HTT) promoter (5HTTLPR) insertion/deletion polymorphism results in long (L) and short (S) alleles including subtypes with higher (LA allele) and lower (non-LA alleles) activities. The LA variant is associated with increased expression, serotonin reuptake and prefrontal connectivity. We characterized relationships between 5HTTLPR and clinical and neurocognitive outcomes in lithium-treated individuals with pediatric and adolescent bipolar disorder (PBD). <bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-eight untreated outpatients aged 8-18 years meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for bipolar-I (currently manic; moderate severity) were characterized before and after eight weeks of lithium therapy. Fifty-seven healthy controls (HC) matched on age, sex, parental SES, and IQ were followed in parallel. Cognitive assessments included the Trails Making Tests (TrailsA/B), Spatial and Digit Span (DigitFWD/BWD, SpatialFWD/BWD), Symbol Coding (SymbolCoding), the California Verbal Learning Test–Child Version (CVLT-C), and Token Motor Task (TknMtr). Symptom ratings included the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and Child Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R). Primary genetic analyses compared homozygous LALA participants to non-LALA participants using repeated measures ANOVA for clinical ratings and cognitive tasks with genotype, race, and patient/control status as variables. <bold>Results:</bold> Genotypes did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and did not differ between PBD and HC. Demographic characteristics did not differ between genotype groups. Individuals with PBD showed pre-treatment deficits in executive function as measured by DigitFWD, SpatialBWD, TknMtr and SymbolCoding (all p&lt;0.04) compared to HC. Baseline cognitive scores did not differ across genotype groups in PBD or the combined PBD/HC sample. Participants improved clinically (p&lt;0.001 for YMRS and CDRS-R) after lithium treatment (mean 0.65 mEq/L). Clinical improvement was not associated with genotype. PBD LALA participants showed greater improvements on executive function tasks (DigitBWD, SpatialFWD, SpatialBWD; all time*genotype interaction p&lt;0.05) and verbal learning (CVLT, p = 0.04). After treatment, cognitive performance in LALA PBD only differed from controls in SymbolCoding (p&lt;0.04). Deficits remained in non-LALA PBD for all tests (all p&lt;0.02) except DigitFWD/BWD. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Manic children and adolescents with the LALA 5HTTLPR genotype had better cognitive outcomes than non-LALA participants after lithium therapy. Positive cognitive effects from lithium may be dependent on genetic variants with higher 5HTT activity or greater prefrontal connectivity.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objective:</bold> A symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal protocol has been recently instilled at a veteran's hospital. This retrospective chart review was done to evaluate the outcomes of the symptom-triggered protocol compared to the previous standard of care. <bold>Research Design:</bold> Retrospective chart review of patients admitted for alcohol withdrawal at a veteran’s hospital. All results were determined exclusively through electronic chart review by the Veterans Affairs electronic medical record system. <bold>Methodology:</bold> This retrospective chart review examined two groups of patients. Group 1 was patients admitted to the inpatient medical floors and Acute Psychiatry for alcohol withdrawal prior to the staff using the symptom-triggered protocol. Group 2 were patients admitted to the inpatient medical floors and Acute Psychiatry for alcohol withdrawal after the protocol had been initiated. Between group 1 and group 2 the following outcomes were compared: length of stay, total amounts of benzodiazepines used during alcohol withdrawal, time from administration of first benzodiazepine to last, and reports of adverse events related to alcohol withdrawal. <bold>Results:</bold> The symptom-triggered protocol showed statistically significant decreases in length of stay (−2.68 days, p-value = 0.0054), total amount of benzodiazepine administered in lorazepam milligram equivalents (−9.5 mg, p-value = 0.0009), and time of administration from first dose of benzodiazepine to last dose (−57.58 hours, p-value &lt;0.0001). No difference in frequency of adverse events was observed. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Use of a symptom-triggered protocol resulted in significantly shorter hospital stays, benzodiazepines administered, and time of benzodiazepine use when compared to the previous standard of care for the management of alcohol withdrawal.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Ineffective seizures during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can delay response, prolong hospitalizations, and increase healthcare costs. Methylxanthine derivatives (caffeine, theophylline, aminophylline) can be used as adjuvants to increase seizure duration; however, only one study (N = 8) has been published using a fixed oral dose of theophylline and none exploring its impact on other seizure quality indices. <bold>Objective:</bold> To determine the safety and impact of a calculated oral theophylline loading dose (resulting in a 10-15 mg/L plasma concentration) on seizure duration, maximum sustained coherence (MSC), and post-ictal suppression index (PSI) when administered 1.5 hours prior to the ECT. <bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective study using inpatient hospital records between January 2007 and June 2012 at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre. Patients receiving ECT and a calculated oral liquid theophylline dose were selected. Data variables collected include: age, sex, height, weight, ECT parameters for each ECT during the series (electrode placement, charge delivered, static and dynamic impedance, average seizure energy index, maximum sustained power, EEG endpoint, MSC, PSI, time to peak power, time to peak coherence) and medications (name, dose, start date, modifications). Records were also examined for any treatment related side-effects. <bold>Results:</bold> We identified 46 cases and analyzed 16 which had no treatment modifications except the addition of theophylline. The predicted theophylline plasma concentrations were 12.83 ± 1.11 mg/L with dosages ranging from 260-600 mg. Seizure duration increased by 164.9% (23.5 seconds) with theophylline (p = 0.023). The MSC increased by 8.3% (N = 11; p = 0.076); however, patients with an initial MSC &lt; 92% (N = 5) showed the largest increases, all achieving ≥94.6%. An insufficient number of cases (N = 2) precluded any meaningful analysis of its impact on the PSI. No theophylline-related adverse events were documented and no seizure length exceeded 120 seconds. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> A calculated theophylline loading dose prior to ECT is well tolerated and effective in prolonging seizure duration. Its positive impact in patients with a lower initial MSC should be further explored, in addition to its effect on the PSI and the potential existence of a dose-response relationship.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background/Rationale:</bold> Despite Suboxone’s efficacy for opioid dependence, there continues to be an overwhelming shortage of community treatment programs. In some cases, providers may choose not to treat this population and/or may not have the resources, expertise, and structure necessary to meet the patients’ ongoing needs. The monitoring demands, unique medication properties, and risk for diversion allow for a novel role for pharmacists. <bold>Description of the Innovative Practice:</bold> A physician-pharmacist Suboxone maintenance clinic was piloted at a local health department (HD). The HD traditionally referred Suboxone patients to community physicians at considerable cost with varying outcomes. A psychiatric pharmacist and primary care physician partnered to create an internal clinic, which included the development of a treatment contact, policies, and protocols. The goals were to optimize care, reduce cost, and limit diversion. The pharmacist’s unique training allowed the physician to manage the patient load during just a few hours per week. All intake assessments and follow up appointments were conducted by the pharmacist. After each appointment, the pharmacist would debrief the physician, allowing for efficient completion of the assessment. The pharmacist documented each interaction. The physician appended notes, when applicable, and cosigned. The pharmacist and physician electronically accessed substance abuse counselors' treatment records. Counselors and providers met directly to review treatment plans and outcomes. The pharmacist worked to limit diversion by routinely gathering data from outside providers, pharmacies, and laboratories. <bold>Impact of Practice on Patient Care/Institution:</bold> The HD’s Suboxone clinic has improved patient care by producing consistency and structure. Gaps have been identified, such as inconsistent urine toxicology collection and provider misperception about patient adherence. During the first 6 months, 6 initial assessments and 50 follow up appointments have been completed, equating to a potential savings of $6600. The clinic has a 98% appointment attendance rate and 100% retention rate. Eighty-three percent of patients have successfully progressed to monthly monitoring. Two patients are in the process of dose tapers. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Physicians and pharmacists can optimize the care of Suboxone-maintained patients through collaboration. The HD is utilizing data from this pilot to develop a permanent program, including a state-approved collaborative practice protocol.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Due to the risk of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) associated with olanzapine long-acting injection administration; it is only available through a restricted distribution program. Although PDSS is reported to occur in approximately 1/1400 injections, the FDA requires anyone who receives the injection to remain at the registered healthcare facility with immediate access to emergency services for a minimum of 3 hours post-injection. In a community mental health center (CMHC) the implementation of an Olanzapine Long-Acting Injection Clinic (OLAIC) is possible if the resources and support are available. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> The OLAIC is held at an outpatient Midtown CMHC, which is the psychiatric service of Wishard Health Services (WHS). The clinical psychiatric pharmacists ensured that the appropriate facilities, pharmacies, and prescribers were registered with the manufacturer prior to initiation of the clinic. Clinical pharmacists coordinated/conducted educational seminars and mandatory in-services for approximately 150 CMHC staff. Educational information included the WHS Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee-approved protocol and the clinical presentation of PDSS. The development of the clinic, logistics and flow of staffing and monitoring, and obtaining the injection was led by the clinical psychiatric pharmacist. The clinic consists of the clinical psychiatric pharmacist, psychiatric injection nurse, and Midtown staff. Prescribers must complete an OLAIC referral form that is reviewed by 2 clinical psychiatric pharmacists and one psychiatrist for patient appropriateness for the injection and clinic requirements. The clinic was initiated in November 2011 every other Tuesday, with coordination, scheduling, and monitoring led by the psychiatric clinical pharmacist. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Since the initiation of OLAIC, 104 injections have been administered to 11 patients. Patient demographics include: diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, average age of 37 years, 64% male, and at least 2 hospitalizations within the last 12 months prior to starting OLAIC. All patients complied with the three-hour post-injection observation. There was one possible PDSS event reported. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> While OLAI requires multiple steps for appropriate use, it is feasible that it can be used successfully in clinic settings. The clinical psychiatric pharmacist can be the optimum leader in developing and maintaining a successful olanzapine long-acting injection clinic.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Medication non-adherence can contribute to poor outcomes for patients with schizophrenia. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics such as haloperidol decanoate and paliperidone palmitate are therapeutic options for patients who are nonadherent to oral antipsychotics. Dosing for haloperidol decanoate varies, but doses above 450 mg per month are not often necessary. The therapeutic range for haloperidol is 5 ng/mL – 15 ng/mL. <bold>Complete Patient History:</bold> AB is a 44-year-old African American male who was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility with an Axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia, paranoid type. The patient was diagnosed in his early thirties. Additional past medical history included obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Labs and vitals on admission were noncontributory. Following initial assessment and extensive discussion with outpatient providers, the patient’s outpatient regimen of haloperidol decanoate 400 mg IM every two weeks was continued in addition to haloperidol 20 mg PO daily. Haloperidol levels were: Day 3 = 26.8 ng/mL, Day 9 = 22.8 ng/mL and Day 14 = 18 ng/mL. Despite some improvement, the patient had residual symptoms requiring continued inpatient treatment. Given the patient’s history of poor adherence and concerns of increasing haloperidol decanoate frequency or dose, oral haloperidol was discontinued and paliperidone palmitate 156 mg every 4 weeks was ordered. A follow-up haloperidol trough was 12 ng/mL. Following four months of acute hospitalization, the patient was successfully transferred to a step-down unit on the combination of haloperidol decanoate and paliperidone palmitate with only minor residual symptoms. The patient had no extrapyramidal symptoms and did not require standing anticholinergic medications during his hospitalization. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A PubMed search revealed no reported cases of administering haloperidol decanoate and paliperidone palmitate concurrently. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> While antipsychotic polypharmacy with oral agents is a growing trend, reports of polypharmacy with long-acting injectable antipsychotics are rare. In this case, the patient tolerated and responded well when paliperidone palmitate 156 mg IM every four weeks was added to his previous regimen of haloperidol decanoate 400 mg IM every two weeks. While situations warranting two long-acting injectable antipsychotics are rare, clinicians should be aware of this available therapeutic option.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) is a late, neuropsychiatric manifestation of Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) in which there is a striking disorder of selective anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Treatment of suspected WE includes immediate high dose (500 mg three times daily) intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration of thiamine to restore depleted levels. While no randomized trials support this high dose regimen, this approach is clinically justified when lower doses fail. Once WE progresses to KS, the prognosis is poor, with only about 20-25% of patients experiencing a full recovery if properly treated. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient is a 50 year old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for liver transplant in 2000 status post alcoholic cirrhosis, alcohol dependence, hypertension, gout, acute kidney injury and history of QTc prolongation. The patient’s social history includes a long history of severe alcohol dependency, consuming 2-3 half gallons of liquor or 2-3 cases of beer weekly. Patient’s recently estranged husband reports 12-15 hospitalizations for alcohol detoxification since her liver transplant. During a recent hospitalization at an outside facility, patient was treated with low dose benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal. Patient was lucid on admission; however, with no thiamine supplementation, patient developed worsening confusion, agitation, aggression and confabulation. She was discharged after nineteen days with a diagnosis of cognitive disorder, not otherwise specified and referred to a nursing home for long term care. The family admitted the patient to our institution for further evaluation and treatment. A diagnosis of KS was suspected, benzodiazepines were discontinued and thiamine 500 mg IM was initiated. Thiamine was continued at this high dose while inpatient for fourteen days, and the patient recovered fully. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A PubMed search revealed a published case report of reversal of KS after delay of treatment by four months. No other similar case reports were found. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Even though initiation of high dose thiamine IM did not occur until approximately three weeks after WE onset, the two week course of treatment produced a full reversal of KS that had developed as a result of delayed thiamine therapy.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> ANCHOR-CD is an open-label, observational study with target enrollment of 400 idiopathic CD patients treated with Dysport, abobotulinumtoxinA. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine efficacy and patient outcomes in CD patients treated with abobotulinumtoxinA in routine clinical practice. <bold>Methods:</bold> Assessments include: The Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM). <bold>Results:</bold> Initial treatment data from an ongoing study of cervical dystonia patients was collected on July 26, 2012 from 209 patients enrolled at 33 US clinical sites. The types of dystonic neck posturing included torticollis (85.4%), laterocollis (54.9%), retrocollis (24.3%), and anterocollis (15.5%). Of the 209 patients, 156 (75%) were previously treated with botulinum toxin therapy: 102/156 (66%) were switched from onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), and 32/156 (21%) patients continued on abobotulinumtoxinA. The median cycle one abobotulinumtoxinA dose was 500 Units. The most frequently injected muscles were the splenius capitis, trapezius, levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid, and semispinalis capitis. Mean (SD) TWSTRS total score was 41.2 (18.3) at baseline and 28.1 (16.3) at 4-week follow-up demonstrating a −12.5 (9.9) mean change or 32.1% improvement compared to baseline. Mean (SD) Pain NRS score (0-10) was 4.8 (3.1) at baseline and 3.5 (2.8) at 4-week follow-up demonstrating a −1.24 (2.6) mean change from baseline. 63.5% of physicians and 42.4% of patients rated much improved and very much improved for the CGIC and PGIC, respectively. Modified TSQM scores indicated that 83% of patients were satisfied with abobotulinumtoxinA treatment. To date, 3 (1.4%) patients reported adverse drug reactions and withdrew from the study. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cervical dystonia patients treated with abobotulinumtoxinA during cycle 1 reported improvements in the severity, disability and pain symptoms. 83% of patients reported satisfaction with treatment.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> A 2008 study, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, found that serious mental illness costs the U.S. $193 billion dollars per year in lost earnings alone. Moreover, according to a report by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute, over the past three years, states have cut $4.35 billion from their budgets for mental health services. Effective July 1, 2010, Arizona cut nearly all services, except medication monitoring, a generic medication formulary, and crisis services, for approximately 17,600 mentally ill patients not receiving Medicaid, representing half of the seriously mentally ill in Arizona. Conversely, Medicaid patients retained their benefits including access to brand-name medications, psychotherapy and wrap around services, including transportation and case management. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of public mental health benefit cuts on costs, length of stay, and number of inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and emergency department visits. <bold>Methods:</bold> The design of this study was a retrospective record review of psychiatric admissions between October 1, 2009-March 31, 2010 and October 1, 2010-March 31, 2011. The inclusion criteria targeted mental health patients between the ages of 18 and 55 with a serious mental illness diagnosis that were seen in the inpatient or emergency department (ED) of The University of Arizona Medical Center - South Campus, which is one of the largest providers of acute inpatient psychiatric services for public mental health patients in southern Arizona. Economic impact variables, including cost, length of stay, and number of visits, were compared pre and post benefit change and across serious mental illness diagnoses. <bold>Results:</bold> Total length of stay, both per patient and per visit, decreased significantly following benefit cuts as did the number of hospitalizations per patient; however, the number of ED visits increased. Greater costs and length of stays were associated with psychotic disorders and bipolar diagnoses, particularly following benefit cuts, while more ED visits were associated with anxiety diagnoses. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The significance of these results will support the creation of public policies that balance limited budget savings when reducing public mental health benefits for already underserved populations.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Rasch analysis is intended to assess scale functioning and item fit, measure individual participant attitudinal variation from pre to post test, and identify construct shift bias. This analysis was conducted to evaluate a questionnaire given to psychiatric inpatients who attended a pharmacist-led medication education group. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective pre-post questionnaire was distributed to psychiatric inpatients who participated in a medication education group. Variables collected included patient self-reported medication knowledge and attitudes, demographics, information related to previous psychiatric hospitalizations, length of group attended, and outpatient pharmacist relationships. Knowledge and attitude items were measured on a 4-point Likert-type scale with response options ranging from “agree” to “disagree.” Rasch analysis was conducted to ensure all items measured the same construct and demonstrated the probability of the person responding to an item was not dependent on the other assessment items. Rasch measurement includes several diagnostic indices that allow item-specific and person-specific examinations of data reliability and measurement fit. In addition, the Rasch technique makes it possible to evaluate the contribution of each person’s measures on each item. A z-test was used to evaluate for instrument content gaps and a dependent t-test was performed to measure for statistical differences before and after the intervention. <bold>Results:</bold> Sixty patients responded to the Medication Attitude and Knowledge Questionnaire over a 16-week period. Gaps identified were not statistically significant (p = 0.1064 and 0.5305) indicating that content validity is comprehensive. On a group level, no significant differences were identified in patient answers before and after the intervention (p = 0.2162, p = 0.8292). When each patient was analyzed separately, only one patient out of 60 showed a significant difference in answers after the intervention. Results also demonstrated that after attending a group, 100% of patients indicated they intended to adhere to their medication regimen post-discharge. <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> This evaluation was unique because patient attitudes were explored before and after medication education group attendance. Medication Attitude and Knowledge items were valid and reliable. However, in the future, condensing the scale to a two-item scale is recommended and excluding negatively worded questions could improve the ability of psychiatric patient interpretation.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> ADHD is common in modern societies, and coincident rates of new stimulant prescription orders in child /adolescent patients have risen sharply. Since the neural effects of prolonged stimulant therapies remain obscure, studies to discern neurotoxic consequences are a research priority. Behavioral sensitization refers to a phenomenon wherein the serial administration of a psychomotor stimulant produces augmented subsequent stimulant-provoked behavioral responses. While much literature supports sensitized amphetamine (AMPH) responses in rats, few investigators have specifically quantified AMPH effects after chronic adolescent growth phase exposures. Equally scarce in current literature are reports revealing stimulant effects following a prolonged AMPH injection regimen (i.e. &gt;4 weeks). <bold>Methods:</bold> This research incorporates two phases. PHASE I experiments determined the motor activating and stereotypic effects of AMPH in adolescent rats (Post-natal Days [PND] 69-89). PHASE II sessions requantified these same effects around PND 218. In both phases, data were collected counting open field grid crossings and stereotypic response chains. The longitudinal design of this research bridged comparison of young relative to mature rats’ AMPH dose-responsivity patterns. Our design separately permitted AMPH sensitivity measurements with a paired control group. The treatment group consisted of 10 male rats injected from PND40 to PND90 with 7.5 mg/kg AMPH. A control group consisted of 9 male rats injected through the same 50-consecutive-day interval with saline. All rats subsequently passed through almost 20 weeks of injection-free growth. Around PND218, behavioral measures were requantified for all rats 30 minutes after 7.5 mg/kg AMPH. Open field navigations were videotaped, and recordings of all stereotypic behavior (e.g. sniffing, paw tremor, wet dog shakes, ambulation, and repetitive movement) were blind scored by investigators. Formulas embedded in a Colquhoun statistical instrument assisted AMPH potency ratio determinations [PR] (briefly: PR was tabulated using scatter plot estimation of the ED50-AMPH in ratio to the ED50-saline) for each behavioral measure in both young and mature animals. <bold>Results &amp; Discussion:</bold> AMPH sensitization was confirmed since data show ambulation in mature treatment rats differed significantly from ambulation in mature control rats. Moreover a nearly significant trend toward sensitization was noted for repetitive movement strings of mature treatment relative to control rats.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Vilazodone is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item clinician-rated scale used to measure MDD symptom severity and improvement following treatment. Each item ranges from 0 to 6 with higher score indicating greater severity. This analysis assessed clinically relevant symptom improvement in MADRS items by evaluating baseline to end of study (EOS) shifts from more to less severe categories. <bold>Methods:</bold> The analyses were conducted on pooled data from 2 positive, Phase III, 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (NCT00285376, NCT00683592) in outpatients (18-70 years) with MDD. Vilazodone was titrated over a 2-week period from 10 mg to a 40-mg target dose taken once daily with food. Post hoc analyses were conducted on study completers. The shift analyses were done at 2 levels: patients with baseline score ≥2 to an EOS score &lt;2 (‘minimal to no symptoms’) and patients with baseline score ≥4 to EOS score ≤2. Odds ratios were estimated and nominal P values were obtained for vilazodone vs placebo using Fisher’s exact test. <bold>Results:</bold> The percentage of patients with severity category shift from baseline ≥2 to EOS &lt;2 was significantly higher for vilazodone vs placebo on all MADRS items (OR range, 1.4-1.7; P≤.05) except Reduced Appetite (OR 1.3; P = .232). In patients with greater symptom severity (baseline ≥4), more vilazodone than placebo patients shifted to ≤2 at EOS. Differences were statistically significant for vilazodone vs placebo on items of Apparent Sadness (60% vs 47%; OR, 1.7; P = .003), Reported Sadness (60% vs 48%; OR, 1.6; P = .003), Inner Tension (58% vs 41%; OR, 2.0; P = .003), Reduced Sleep (51% vs 36%; OR, 1.8; P = .002), and Lassitude (57% vs 47%; OR 1.5; P = .029). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Significantly greater proportion of patients treated with vilazodone compared with placebo achieved a shift from a baseline score ≥2 to EOS score &lt;2 on all MADRS single items except Reduced Appetite. Shifts to the ‘minimal to no symptom’ severity category demonstrated that vilazodone treatment is associated with clinically meaningful improvement in symptoms of MDD.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Clozapine is the medication of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. However, 40-70% of patients do not adequately respond to clozapine therapy. After a partial response to clozapine, augmentation with another antipsychotic agent is often utilized despite limited evidence to support this practice. The aim of this study was to describe clozapine augmentation strategies in the inpatient psychiatric setting. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were treated with clozapine and received at least one antipsychotic augmentation agent (AAA) between January 2008 and July 2011 were included in this retrospective chart review. All patients were discharged from a unit specifically for treating patients with resistant illness. Data collected included patient demographics, length of stay, clozapine dose, clozapine and norclozapine levels, AAA dose, length of augmentation, other psychopharmacologic agents and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). <bold>Results:</bold> Forty-nine patients (55.1% male, mean age 45.3 ± 12.1 years) received a total of 71 augmentation trials. The mean maximum clozapine dose in patients receiving augmentation was 406.1 mg ± 121.8 mg. The most commonly utilized AAAs included risperidone (n = 21), haloperidol (n = 18), aripiprazole (n = 12) and fluphenazine (n = 10). Other antipsychotics used to augment clozapine included paliperidone, perphenazine, thiothixene, ziprasidone and quetiapine. Haloperidol had the highest continuation rate at discharge (88.9%). Overall, first generation antipsychotics (FGAs) had higher continuation rates than second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) (81% vs 55%). Of the 49 patients, 24 were receiving a long acting injectable antipsychotic upon discharge, in addition to clozapine. Additional agents prescribed at the time of discharge included antidepressants, divalproex sodium, lamotrigine and lithium in 23.7%, 11.8%, 8.5% and 6.8% of patients, respectively. During hospitalization, 15 patients (30.6%) received adjunctive electroconvulsive therapy. <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> Treatment-resistant schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder remains a clinical challenge as effective clozapine augmentation strategies cannot be derived from the current literature. While there is more literature to support augmentation with SGAs, we found that augmentation with FGAs had higher rates of continuation at discharge and appeared to be well tolerated. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of first generation antipsychotics for clozapine augmentation.</p>

Continuation of Patient Assistance Program Benefits for Psychiatric Patients Receiving Psychotropic Medications:</bold> A Program Evaluation. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence rate of medication compliance among psychiatric patients receiving psychotropic medications through a patient assistance program (PAP) in a community health center (CHC), after the initial benefit period expired. <bold>Methods:</bold> This was a quantitative descriptive program evaluation using a retrospective chart review. One hundred electronic health records (EHRs) were reviewed for identification of psychiatric patients. Age, sex, and mental health diagnoses demographic information were reviewed for uninsured patients. <bold>Findings:</bold> Sixty-nine patients (69%) continued psychotropic medication therapy after the initial 12-week PAP benefit period expired. All patients (100%) who continued psychotropic medication therapy filled prescriptions at the CHC. Sixty-five patients (94%) continued psychotropic drug therapy on brand-name medications and 4 patients (6%) continued psychotropic drug therapy on generic medications. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Future research is needed to determine if the availability of medications through discounted programs improves medication compliance. Clinical pharmacists in ambulatory settings collaborating with medical providers for medication recommendations prior to initial prescriptions being written can be cost-saving. Prescribing provider education and clinical pharmacists improve positive patient outcomes. <bold>Key Words:</bold> medication assistance, psychotropics, pharmacy, rural.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Augmentation therapy is common in depression, but costs of care remain undefined. We examine healthcare utilization and cost in patients with depression treated with selective serotonin or selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (AD) monotherapy, augmented with either atypical antipsychotics (AA) or L-methylfolate using Marketscan data. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study included patients with depression, initiated on AD between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2009, augmented with either AA or L-methylfolate. Propensity score matching was used to produce study groups in a ratio of 3:1. All-cause and depression-related utilization and costs were assessed for 6-months following AD augmentation. Utilization was compared using t-test; cost analysis utilized t-test, Wald Chi-Square test and a generalized linear model. <bold>Results:</bold> The 4053 AA and 1351 L-methylfolate augmented patients were closely matched on age, gender, and co-morbidities. Common AD therapies (AA, L-methylfolate respectively) were escitalopram (24.5%, 23.3%), duloxetine (22.9%, 23.5%), venlafaxine (15.4%, 15.4%) and sertraline (12.1%, 13.2%). Common AA augmentation therapy included: quietapine (39.1%), aripiprazole (29.5%) and risperdone (13.7%). Mean time to augmentation was 73 days for AA and 106 days for L-methylfolate (P&lt;0.001). Mean 6-month all-cause unit utilization (AA, L-methylfolate) varied for inpatient (1.64, 0.63), outpatient (18.94, 16.43), and emergency (0.38, 0.16) visits (all p&lt;0.001). Depression-related utilization followed a similar pattern. Mean[SD] 6-month all cause and depression-related post-augmentation costs (AA, L-methylfolate) were ($8499[$13,585], $7372[$12,404]) (P = 0.005) and ($2,689[$4,201], $1,613[$2,315]) (P&lt;0.001). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients receiving AD augmentation therapy with L-methylfolate versus AA demonstrated lower healthcare utilization, and lower all-cause and depression-related costs. Further studies are warrented evaluating augmentation therapy in depression.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate and determine (1) if use of specific reference cards for diabetes, stroke, and heat stroke heightened understanding of the signs and symptoms of these conditions and (2) use of the reference cards helped case managers (CMs) in the community-based integrated multidisciplinary program of assertive community treatment (IMPACT) program better evaluate patients to determine if addition intervention or follow-up was needed. <bold>Background:</bold> Healthcare professionals who provide services to those with a severe mental illness (SMI) diagnosis, specifically schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder, face many unique challenges. In particular is patient assessment. Often CMs do not have a background or work experience differentiating medical concerns from psychiatric signs and symptoms. This pilot project is designed to help evaluate if reference cards enhance learning and help integrate knowledge more completely for these important conditions. <bold>Methods:</bold> A one-time focus group session was conducted by an independent party to elicit information on the use of reference cards as an educational tool. Anonymity was maintained. The responses were evaluated for themes. The moderator asked questions regarding reference cards about each for the following areas: ability to answer questions about acute emergencies, understanding key points, recommendations for card enhancement, and presentation of information. <bold>Results:</bold> Of the 8 CMs on the IMPACT team, 5 participated. Identified themes were quick reference and easily identifiable information. The use of pictures to illustrate the concepts was helpful. The language was appropriate for the cards and readily understandable. Suggestions for changes to the existing cards included use of a larger font, lighter background color, and moving medication information to the same side of the card. Limitations included the suggestions for changes and limited availability of the heat stroke card in the summer. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The use of reference cards as an educational tool for CMs has not been extensively evaluated. Although data are limited from this pilot project, the CMs are enthusiastic about this resource and requested cards on additional topics. Additional cards are in development.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Pharmacogenomics is a rapidly evolving field of medicine with clinical application still in its infancy. One particular area of importance may be the use of genomic biomarkers to predict effective therapeutic doses and responses to specific psychiatric medications. A patient education video outlining the details of pharmacogenomic testing may facilitate patient understanding and is vital for testing consent. <bold>Objective:</bold> Observation of a novel educational video will improve patient comprehension of pharmacogenomic testing. <bold>Methods:</bold> A pharmacogenomic educational video produced by the Mayo Clinic Patient Education department was shown to inpatient adult psychiatric patients on a mood disorders unit. Patients were given a pre-test questionnaire prior to viewing the video to assess patient demographics (gender, age and education level), baseline knowledge and perception of benefits. Following observation of the video, patients were asked to complete the same six knowledge assessment questions. <bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-one patients participated in the study to obtain 80% power. Pre- and post-test answers were compared for each individual using McNemar's test. Although trends were seen towards improved comprehension, no statistical significance was detected pre- vs. post-test. The data suggests that the percentage of patients who answered question #3 ( = understanding of slow vs fast metabolizer) correctly increased after the education (p = 0.052). Pearson's chi-square test was used to assess if gender, age or education level was associated with improvements of post-test scores. Question #2 ( = understanding if genomic testing can predict exact side effects) showed a significant improvement in knowledge for those individuals with college or graduate school education (p = 0.03). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare total number of questions correct across demographic groups. Overall, individuals with college or graduate school education had improved scores after the video compared to those with a high school education (p = 0.003). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Developing education for pharmacogenomic applications targeting medication management is a complex and difficult topic for patients. Our study found significantly improved comprehension in patients who completed 4 years of college or graduate school. Future directions should include the development of basic patient education materials geared towards patients with lower educational levels.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> This study investigated whether first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, or combination therapy of both drug categories require more management of adverse drug reactions with additional pharmacotherapy. The total number of medications in a patient's regimen was evaluated and compared at different time intervals. <bold>Methods:</bold> De-identified patient profiles containing diagnostic and medication records were obtained from a long-term inpatient psychiatric facility in South Florida. Patients (n = 84), ages 18-70, who were placed on antipsychotic medications for at least one year were evaluated. In addition, snapshot, one day patient profiles (n = 324) and six-month profiles (n = 147) were evaluated to note any changes or progress in medications. Three groups were studied: patients on first-generation antipsychotics, second-generation antipsychotics, and both first-generation and second-generation antipsychotics. The total number of medications from each patient profile was evaluated. Each medication was categorized according to indication or therapeutic use. One-time orders or as needed “prn” medications were not included in the assessment due to their short-term use. <bold>Results:</bold> Data compiled from six month and yearly data compared to snapshot data show no statistically significant difference in the total number of non-psychiatric medications used to manage first-generation, second-generation, or combination antipsychotic therapy. Anticholinergic medications were more likely to be added to first-generation antipsychotic therapy at six months (p = 0.02, n = 32) but was not statistically significant at one year (p = 0.33, n = 14). Second-generation antipsychotics did not show statistical significance in any medication category at six months (n = 23) and one year (n = 13). Combination therapy was associated with the largest increase in laxative use at six months (p = 0.02, n = 45) and one year (p = 0.07, n = 24). Combination therapy was also associated with a decrease in hyperlipidemia medication at one year (p = 0.03). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on the results of the study, the total number of medications required to treat adverse effects among the three treatment groups did not vary. However, this study may have been limited by its scope of one year and small sample size.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Guanfacine, a centrally-acting alpha-2A adrenoceptor agonist, is formulated as immediate-release (GIR) and extended-release (GXR) medications. GIR is often prescribed off-label for ADHD in the US, though it is FDA-approved for hypertension treatment only. GXR is approved in the US for treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD. Some clinicians and formularies may consider GIR substitutable for GXR, but this assumption lacks empirical validation and requires further investigation. <bold>Objective:</bold> To compare medication adherence, resource utilization, and healthcare costs between children and adolescents with ADHD treated with GIR and those treated with GXR. <bold>Methods:</bold> GIR and GXR users aged 6-17 years with at least 1 ADHD diagnosis (ICD-9-CM: 314.00, 314.01) were identified from the Truven Health MarketScan Database (11/2009-12/2010). The 6 months before and after guanfacine initiation were defined as baseline and study periods, respectively. Daily average consumption (DACON), medication possession ratio (MPR), incidence rates of resource utilization, and healthcare costs (2010 US dollars) were compared using multivariate models that adjusted for baseline characteristics. <bold>Results:</bold> The GIR and GXR cohorts included 743 and 2,344 patients, respectively. During the study period, GIR users had higher DACON (1.58 vs. 1.07, P&lt;0.001) and lower MPR (0.50 vs. 0.64, P&lt;0.001). GIR users had more frequent mental health (MH)-related inpatient (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] = 1.72, P = 0.013) and ER visits (aIRR = 1.55, P = 0.030). MH-related outpatient visits (aIRR = 1.07, P = 0.104) were not significantly different. GIR users had higher MH-related medical care costs ($1,891 vs. $1,220; adjusted cost difference [aCD] = $401, P = 0.022) and lower MH-related pharmacy costs ($1,171 vs. $1,564; aCD = −$440, P&lt;0.001). MH-related total healthcare costs ($3,062 vs. $2,784; aCD = −$159, P = 0.085) were not significantly different between GIR and GXR users. Similar trends were found for ADHD-related and all-cause utilizations and costs. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on the outcomes measured, children and adolescents treated with GIR and those treated with GXR had significantly different treatment patterns and resource consumption The results suggest that GIR and GXR may not be substitutes for some patients in the treatment of ADHD. These data indicate that further research is required to better understand the apparent differential impact of GIR vs. GXR on healthcare outcomes of ADHD patients.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Clinical pharmacists are specially trained in therapeutics and can be responsible for management of patients’ medication regimens and diseases, providing patient education, and working collaboratively with other health care providers in caring for patients. Clinical services specifically within a psychiatric setting resulted in overall disease state improvement, global function, and cost-effectiveness. By introducing clinical pharmacy services into an acute psychiatric unit, which was naïve to clinical services, we aim to show the impact of clinical pharmacist services and intervention upon patient length of stay. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patient length of stay information was collected from de-identified hospital admissions data two years prior to service initiation in 2010 and for the initial two years of clinical pharmacy services on the unit. The study was approved by the hospital IRB. <bold>Results:</bold> Average length of stay during the two years prior to clinical pharmacy involvement was 10.37 days during 2008-2009, and 9.54 days for 2009-2010, resulting in a weighted average of 9.94 days. Following the introduction of clinical pharmacy services during the years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012, average lengths of stay were 7.92 days and 8.27 days respectively. This translated to a weighted average of 8.09 days. Since no other clinical changes or services were added or started during the studied time period, the decreased average length of stay of 1.85 days is most likely attributable to pharmacy intervention in clinical decision making and patient care activities. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on the 1.85 day decreased length of stay per patient, it is evident that implementation of clinical pharmacy services had a positive impact for patients by allowing them to recover more quickly in the outpatient setting. Additional benefits for the hospital as a result of services include increased availability of inpatient acute psychiatric beds and faster psychiatric admission from the emergency department. While clinical pharmacy services did not increase hospital revenue, results show that clinical pharmacy services yielded more efficient utilization of hospital resources by decreasing length of stay. Hence, more patients can receive inpatient care per year through better stewardship of resources.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> To extend the published work reporting extrapyramidal reactions (EPR) associated with SSRI and SNRI antidepressant treatment by reviewing cases published in the medical literature between 1998 and 2012. <bold>Methods:</bold> The published medical literature was searched using PubMed and the following search terms: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran, extrapyramidal, akathisia, restlessness, agitation, dystonia, dystonic reaction, dyskinesia, parkinsonism, pseudoparkinsonism, rigidity, and tremor. In addition, the reference list of each identified paper was searched manually for any additional references. One author (JH) performed the literature searches and collected published papers, while both authors read each identified report to insure consistency and agreement regarding how each EPR case should be categorized. <bold>Results:</bold> The medical literature search initially generated 91 references and of these, 67 references were included in our review. Papers were excluded from the review if the case did not include clear descriptions of reactions consistent with known types of EPR, or if the written English was poor. A total of 71 patient cases were described and were categorized as follows: agitation (2), akathisia (10), dyskinesia (18), dystonia (19), mixed (5) and parkinsonism (17). Patients had an average age of 42.75 ± 21.19 years (range = 11–83) and there were slightly more females (56.3%) than males. The majority of EPRs occurred with the following medications: fluoxetine (25.4%), citalopram/escitalopram (19.7%), sertraline (15.5%) and paroxetine (14.1%). Most cases included patients: receiving total daily SSRI/SNRI doses within FDA labeling (77.5%), who were &lt; 65 years of age (77.5%), and who were receiving other concurrent medications (64.8%). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> SSRI and SNRI type antidepressants continue to have reports of patients experiencing extrapyramidal reactions of all types. For this review, dystonia, dyskinesia and parkinsonism were reported most frequently. Age, gender, and dosing did not appear to have an impact on EPR risk. Although the occurrence of these reactions appears infrequent, it remains important for practitioners and patients to be aware of EPR associated with SSRIs/SNRIs. <bold>Significance:</bold> One author (CC) published a review on this topic in 1997, and so this review has a direct opportunity to compare and add to prior work.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Patients with mental illness often are prescribed many medications throughout the course of their illness. Patients may or may not be offered a choice of medication options, may or may not experience benefit from their medication(s), and may or may not continue to take their medication(s). These experiences of being on (or off) of medications may impact the patient in many different ways, including affecting their personal appearance, medication adherence, family/social relationships and much more. We sought to explore the ‘medication experience’ of patients with mental illness from the patients’ perspective, piloting the use of Photovoice methodology. This participatory-action methodology gives the research participants “a voice” through the use of photographs and empowers them to express their views. <bold>Methods:</bold> We recruited 17 participants from 3 healthcare centers. Eligible participants were ≥ 18 years of age and were prescribed ≥ 1 medication to treat a mental health condition. Each participant was given a 27-exposure disposable camera and asked to imagine they were being paid to mount a photographic display entitled, “Living with My Medication.” Participants wrote reflections about their photos and discussed their photos with the researchers in focus groups using the SHOWED guided interview technique. Grounded theory analysis was used to draw themes, triangulating photographic, written reflective and focus group discussion data. <bold>Results:</bold> Participants captured and reflected on a total of 144 photos. Themes drawn from the analysis included: 1) lack of care coordination in the healthcare system and side effect burden negatively impacted medication experience and 2) participants’ support systems including family and pets had a positive impact on medication experience. The pharmacist was not incorporated into any of the participants’ medication experiences. <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> Photovoice is a potentially powerful methodology to explore the medication experience of patients with mental illness. The participants’ medication experience was deeply personal and generally inseparable from the experience of their mental illness itself. Further research should evaluate improvements in coordination of care to target better medication experiences for patients. Further exploration of patients’ medication experience may shed light on ways to improve medication adherence as well as overall healthcare delivery.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> Following approval by the FDA in 1947, methadone was primarily used to treat opiate addiction. However, since the 1990s methadone use has increased as a treatment for chronic pain. As methadone use has increased, so have methadone-related overdose deaths. The safe use of methadone for chronic pain requires familiarity with its unique pharmacokinetics and dosing recommendations. In spite of recent labeling changes, many methadone prescriptions are written and dispensed for inappropriate conditions and methadone is even a preferred drug on many formularies. We present here a series of deaths involving methadone in chronic pain patients, and discuss guidelines aimed at assisting pharmacists involved in managing methadone therapy. <bold>Methods:</bold> Methadone-related deaths were identified from a series of medical-legal cases and related forensic investigations over the period of 2002-11. Related to causation, decedent demographics, cause and manner of death, and toxicological data were retrieved. Related to pharmacist liability, issues related to drug regimen review as part of the prescription dispensing process were noted. <bold>Results:</bold> Seventeen cases were reviewed where individuals, who were predominantly male (77%) with a mean age of 37 years, died after taking methadone (20-320 mg/day). In 14 cases it was determined the deceased died due to mixed-drug intoxication including methadone, with five of those cases involving recreational drugs; the other three cases involved methadone as the single agent. Concomitant drugs most often found included: other opioids (71%), benzodiazepines (65%), prescription psychiatric medications (35%; antidepressants, antipsychotics), recreational drugs (29%; alcohol, cannabis), and other CNS depressants. Toxicology data was available in 12 cases with methadone blood levels averaging 0.56 mg/L (0.21 - 0.83 mg/L). Issues involving pharmacists’ clinical judgment that were determined to have contributed to methadone intoxication include: incomplete patient history, illegitimate medical purpose, absence of opioid tolerance, drug interactions, incorrect dosage conversion/titration, and failure to provide patient counseling. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The effects of methadone contributed to patient death in each case. While patient behaviors played a role, issues related to pharmacists’ clinical judgment were also identified in each case. These findings underline the need for pharmacists to incorporate risk management practices into their workflow to improve methadone use.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Study Objective:</bold> Although students report the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (NMUPS) for cognitive enhancement, there appears to be very mixed findings as to the efficacy of this behavior. Our study aim was to help answer the question: are U.S. high school seniors using prescription stimulants nonmedically for study enhancement while demonstrating characteristics consistent with academic success? <bold>Methods:</bold> We now present findings on what we believe is the first nationally representative, probability-based sample of high school students using data from the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study that has assessed characteristics associated specifically with NMUPS for study enhancement. Our total sample (N = 4520) was divided into three groups for comparison: (1) students reporting no past-year NMUPS (non-users), (2) students reporting past-year NMUPS to help them study (NMUPS-SE), and (3) students reporting past-year NMUPS for reasons other than to study (NMUPS-nonSE). <bold>Results:</bold> Approximately 5% of the entire sample (n = 218) reported past-year NMUPS, which consisted of NMUPS-SE (n = 88) and NMUPS-nonSE (n = 130). Various student characteristics (e.g., grade point average (GPA), views on cheating, binge drinking, truancy) were compared between the three groups. Students reporting NMUPS-SE had three times greater odds (adjusted odds ratio = 2.9, 95% confidence interval = 1.5–5.6) to report a GPA of ‘C+ or lower’ as compared to non-users. The odds of binge drinking in the last two weeks were over six times greater among students reporting NMUPS (regardless of study motives). Alarmingly, at least 90% of the students reporting NMUPS (whether using them for study or non-study purposes) appeared to view cheating as acceptable by their peers. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> We propose that NMUPS-SE is associated with students attempting to salvage academic performance, given their dissonant attitudes and behaviors (e.g., lower GPA, binge drinking, acceptance of cheating). <bold>Future Directions:</bold> Lastly, our study was cross-sectional and cannot establish causation between our independent and dependent variables. Further studies need to be conducted using a prospective, longitudinal design in large, representative samples of U.S. high school and college students.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) measures for antidepressant medication management (AMM) are an accepted quality measure. Augmentation of selective serotonin or selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (AD) therapy is common in depression; atypical antipsychotics (AA) being frequently used, and L-methylfolate an alternative. We examine AMM performance measures among patients receiving augmentation of AD with either AA or L-methylfolate. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study using Marketscan data applied propensity score matching (PSM) to create groups diagnosed with depression, treated with AD, and augmented with either AA or L-methylfolate in a ratio of 3:1 between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2009. Acute phase and continuation phase AMM measures were evaluated per the NCQA standards. Additionally, 6-month medication possession ratio (MPR) was calculated for both augmentation groups. The proportional difference in meeting the AMM measure between the AA and L-methylfolate groups was evaluated using the Pearson chi-square test, and t-test was used to evaluate MPR difference. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 11,161 AA and 1351 L-methylfolate augmented patients met study criteria, leaving 4053 AA and 1351 L-methylfolate patients following PSM. Mean age for the AA and L-methylfolate groups was 45.4 years and 45.7 years (P = 0.553); 75.4% of the AA group and 74.2% in the L-methylfolate group were female (P = 0.377). The most common AD therapies were escitalopram, duloxetine, venlafaxine and sertraline, with no significant differences between the groups. High-dose AD therapy was seen in 37.1% of the AA and 34.5% of the L-methylfolate groups (P = 0.860). The acute phase AMM measure was met by 68.7% of the AA group and 78.7% of the L-methylfolate group (P&lt;0.001), while the continuation phase measure was met by 50.3% of the AA group and 62.1% of the L-methylfolate group (P&lt;0.001). The 6-month AD MPR (SD) was 0.72 (0.30) for the AA group and 0.80 (0.25) for the L-methylfolate group (P = &lt;0.001). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Patients with depression using with either AA or L-methylfolate augmentation therapy exceeded the median 2012 HEDIS benchmarks for both acute and continuing phase AMM measures, while L-methylfolate augmentation delivered higher AMM scores than AA augmentation. Further study on the effect of augmentation therapy on AD adherence is warranted.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> The elderly are commonly on a multitude of medications for various medical conditions. By the age of 75, the average American has 2 to 3 chronic disease states. Drug metabolism declines with age. Changes in renal and hepatic functions may increase susceptibility to adverse drug events, whether an unintended responses to a drug or the toxic effects of certain drugs. In addition, there exists the potential for unnecessary drug exposure secondary to the absence of a comprehensive medication evaluation to optimize pharmacotherapy. Pharmacists can play an active role identifying and working to resolve pharmacotherapy concerns for age-related changes in drug efficiency due to declining renal and hepatic functions. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To (1) describe a medication counseling initiative conducted by a pharmacist and types of interventions performed, (2) identify medication therapy outcomes, and (3) report acceptance by other healthcare providers at two long-term care facilities. <bold>Methods:</bold> Chart reviews (n = 50) were retrospectively performed on residents of two long-term care facilities. These services included an intervention by a rounding pharmacist using a standardized intervention form identifying current patient problems or concerns, medication problems or concerns, and pharmacist recommendations for resolution. A database was created using categorical information. Nominal reporting for aggregate information and intervention acceptance was used. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 66 interventions were reported for 50 patients (68% female, 32% male) ranging from 59 to 94 years of age (average age: 81.5 years). Approximately 45% interventions pertained to drug utilization and 21% involved pain management. Additional intervention categories included eye and skin conditions and mental health diagnoses. Starting a new medication and changing an existing regimen were the most common medication therapy interventions (42% and 32%, respectively). Overall 92.4% of the pharmacist interventions were accepted by the physician. When categorized by type, interventions related to drug utilization and pain management each had an acceptance rate of approximately 93%. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pharmacist interventions have proven beneficial in outpatient settings. Our pilot study suggests that high physician acceptance rates along with medication therapy optimization may produce similar benefits in a long-term care setting.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objective:</bold> To review antipsychotic (AP) medications used and oral temperatures taken during clinic visits to identify patients served by a community-based integrated multidisciplinary program of assertive community treatment (IMPACT) that may be at risk for AP-induced hypothermia. This is a pilot surveillance program to determine if additional interventions are needed. <bold>Methods:</bold> The literature was reviewed to determine the optimum monitoring framework for patients prescribed first or second generation APs. Patients receiving APs were identified and oral temperatures obtained during regularly scheduled clinic visits evaluated. Inclusion criteria were current services through IMPACT and at least one oral temperature. Hypothermia was defined as a core body temperature of 95°F (32°C) or lower. Chart data were reviewed with individual monitoring information maintained by the IMPACT program only and not available to persons not associated with the program. Chart information was limited to one time for data collection for evaluation. Descriptive statistics are used with non-linear statistics applied to categorical variables as appropriate. <bold>Results:</bold> Data were collected from 66 IMPACT charts. Fifty-eight charts (88%) qualified for review. Four long-acting injectables (fluphenazine, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone) and 10 oral APs (chlorpromazine, clozapine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, perphenazine, quetiapine, and risperidone) were used. Hypothermia was identified for 2 patients (3%). Both received risperidone long-acting injection (LAI) 50 mg; one received an oral AP. For the temperature range 95.1°F to 95.9°F, 5 additional readings were found. These corresponded to risperidone LAI 50 mg (2), haloperidol decanoate 150 mg and 200 mg (1 each), and fluphenazine decanoate 37.5 mg (1). In this group 2 patients also received oral APs. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> AP-associated hypothermia was not identified as problematic. Patient-specific follow-up will be instituted with additional monitoring, if needed. Data will be reviewed in one year.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Objective:</bold> To review the evidence for the use of AbobotulinumtoxinA (ABO) in upper and lower limb spasticity, blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, sialorrhea, writers cramp and truncal dystonia. <bold>Methods:</bold> A systematic literature search (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) and review was performed utilizing PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standards. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in systematic reviews. The search identified randomized controlled trials and other comparative clinical studies of ABO published between 1991-Jan 2012. Study methodology, patient, and treatment-level data were extracted and summarized using descriptive statistics. Additionally, each included study underwent quality assessment for bias based on Cochrane metrics. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 28 studies met the data extraction eligibility criteria. Study size ranged from 9 to 333 patients. All included studies were randomized clinical trials with the exception of one study (observational comparative) for hemifacial spasm. Of the 28 studies, 20 focused on adult spasticity (12 upper limb, 8 lower limb) of various origins (17 post-stroke, 3 others). The other studies were: 2 each in blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, and sialorrhea; 1 each in truncal dystonia and writers cramp. Overall, ABO demonstrated clinically or statistically significant efficacy for each disorder. The majority of studies fulfilled criteria for low risk reporting bias. Total ABO doses ranged between 500–1500U for upper limb spasticity; 50–2000U for lower limb spasticity; 100–182U for blepharospasm; 51–70U for hemifacial spasm; 37.5–450U for sialorrhea; 500U for truncal dystonia and 178U for writers cramp. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on data extracted from 20 randomized clinical studies, a strong evidence base exists for the use of ABO in limb spasticity. Based on data from 8 studies, ABO appears efficacious for blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, sialorrhea, truncal dystonia, and writers cramp.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Purpose:</bold> To examine the relationship between type of antidepressant and medication adherence and cost. <bold>Methods:</bold> Our study population (n = 11,077 observations for 5,740 patients) included adult patients with diabetes enrolled in a health plan in Hawaii between 2007 and 2010 who filled &gt;1 prescription for an antidepressant: 1) tricyclic antidepressants (n = 1,650); 2) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI, n = 5,859); 3) serotonin-2-receptor antagonists (n = 679); 4) alpha-2-receptor antagonists (n = 477); 5) serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI, n = 1,345); 6) norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRI, n = 1,078). Medication adherence was measured as medication possession ratio (MPR) for antidepressants. Patients with MPR&gt;80% were considered adherent. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between type of medication and adherence. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the association between antidepressant medication and cost. All models controlled for age, gender, morbidity level, isle of residence, having coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure, race/ethnicity and year. <bold>Results:</bold> Compared to SSRIs, taking tricyclics (OR = 0.71, p&lt;0.001), NDRIs (OR = 0.75, p = 0.001), and serotonin-2-receptor antagonists (OR = 0.71, p = 0.001) was significantly associated with lower adherence. After adjustment for adherence, antidepressant costs were lower relative to SSRIs for tricyclics (IRR = 0.46, p&lt;0.001), serotonin-2-receptor antagonists (IRR = 0.57, p&lt;0.001), NDRIs (IRR = 0.90, p = 0.048), and alpha-2-receptor antagonists (IRR = 0.58, p&lt;0.001), but higher for SNRIs (IRR = 2.9, p&lt;0.001). Overall non-antidepressant costs were higher for alpha-2-receptor antagonists (IRR = 1.84, p&lt;0.001) but lower for NDRIs (IRR = 0.85, p = 0.15) relative to SSRIs and lower for patients who were adherent to any antidepressant (IRR = 0.81, p&lt;0.001). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Type of antidepressant medication was significantly associated with odds of adherence and both medication and non-medication costs in patients with diabetes in Hawaii. Regardless of type of medication, adherence to antidepressants was significantly associated with lower total costs of care. Hence, health care providers may want to emphasize the importance of adherence to antidepressants in patients with diabetes.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Original Research. <bold>Background:</bold> The CPNP Consumers Relations Committee has worked closely with National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) over the last several years to help provide consumer education to patients, caregivers, and the general public. Over the last 6 years, CPNP members have helped participate in NAMI’s annual meeting by providing educational workshops and hosting the “Ask the Psychiatric Pharmacist Booth”. Each year members have distributed surveys to consumers, caregivers and family members that evaluated consumer's awareness of psychiatric pharmacists and the services CPNP members provide to NAMI. <bold>Objective:</bold> The objective of this study was to determine if there has been an increase in awareness about psychiatric pharmacists amongst NAMI members attending the NAMI annual meetings. Secondary we assessed trends in Medication Education Fact Sheets awareness and understandability. <bold>Methods:</bold> A voluntary, anonymous, written survey was administered to attendees of the 2007-2012 NAMI Annual Meetings. The survey consisted of 16 questions developed by the 2007 Consumer Relations Committee and included questions regarding: awareness and role of psychiatric pharmacists, where medication information is obtained, Medication Fact Sheet awareness and understandability, and pharmacist involvement at local NAMI chapters. <bold>Results:</bold> Since 2007, the number of surveys collected ranged from 34-171. Of those surveyed in previous years, 73-82% of respondents were not aware that pharmacists specialize in mental health. However, between 70-91% of respondents would like to know more about psychiatric pharmacists. This year's results were similar to results collected in previous years. A total of 45 surveys were completed, 72% of respondents were unaware of psychiatric pharmacists and 89% of respondents stated that they would like to learn more about psychiatric pharmacists. In 2007, only 12% of the respondents were aware that the medication fact sheets were available on the NAMI website. While in 2012, 27% of respondents were aware of the medication fact sheets located on the NAMI website. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The survey responses indicate that there continues to be a significant need to educate consumers, family members and providers who attend the NAMI Annual Convention about psychiatric pharmacists. Increased participation of CPNP members in local and state NAMI chapters may help increase awareness of psychiatric pharmacists</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Objective(s) and Hypotheses:</bold> The objective of this observational, retrospective chart review is to ensure patient safety by evaluating the prescribing patterns and use of citalopram at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System (VAPSHCS). It is hypothesized that patient safety measures and prescriber patterns of citalopram use will be examined and analyzed. <bold>Research Design:</bold> Electronic medical records will be examined for citalopram indication, dose, changes in therapy such as dose increases or reductions, frequency, length of therapy, age, gender, comorbid cardiovascular diseases, frequency of mental health/psychiatric clinic visits, documentation of decompensation of depression symptoms, as well as monitoring of EKG, pulse, magnesium, and potassium levels. <bold>Methodology:</bold> Subjects 18-60 years old who were taking citalopram greater than 40 mg per day and subjects over 60 years old who were taking greater than 20 mg per day on August 25th, 2011 at the VAPSHCS, Seattle Division were included in this descriptive study. No patients were excluded from this study. The primary end point was citalopram dosage appropriateness after the issuance of the FDA warning on 8/25/2011 concerning citalopram use in doses greater than 40 mg per day for subjects 18-60 years old and greater than 20 mg per day for subjects over 60 years old. Key secondary endpoints included monitoring of EKG, pulse, magnesium and potassium levels, number of mental health clinic visits, and documentation of decompensation of depression symptoms. <bold>Findings/Progress to Date:</bold> Study findings in progress.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Individuals with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) often manage complex medication regimens with many potential adverse effects and other concerns. Such individuals would benefit from support and education from their pharmacist regarding optimization of their regimens. Pharmacists with stigma or negative attitudes toward individuals with SPMI may be less likely to counsel and provide services to these patients. A consumer-led educational intervention significantly reduced negative attitudes of pharmacy students toward individuals with SPMI. There is no known data on the effects of such an intervention on pharmacists. This study will provide quantitative and qualitative data about the effects of a consumer-led Continuing Education (CE) program on pharmacists’ attitudes towards those with SPMI. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine the effects of a consumer-led CE program on pharmacists’ attitudes toward consumers with a mental illness. 2. Determine the effects of a consumer-led CE program on pharmacists’ willingness to provide pharmacy services to consumers with a mental illness. <bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty pharmacists were recruited through the CE program provider at Northeastern University. The CE program included a brief overview of the history of U.S. mental healthcare followed by a presentation of two consumers with a mental illness, facilitated by the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Data will be collected from three surveys (one before and after the CE program, and a third 2 months after the program) that participating pharmacists will be asked to complete. The surveys ask items about pharmacists’ background, attitudes toward individuals with SPMI, perception of the needs of individuals with schizophrenia, and willingness to provide services to individuals with schizophrenia compared to patients with asthma. Qualitative data will be captured from in-depth phone interviews on a subset of ten randomly selected participants two months after the program. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Descriptive statistics will be reported for selected variables. Bivariate and multivariate statistics will be used to analyze relationships between each pharmacist’s pre-intervention and post-intervention responses, and explore factors influencing pharmacists’ attitudes toward individuals with SPMI and their willingness to provide services to individuals with SPMI. Key themes regarding the program’s effectiveness will be identified from phone interviews.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> In July of 2004, The Joint Commission unveiled a new safety goal, and laid out the requirements for medication reconciliation. Its official implementation began in 2005, as National Patient Safety Goal # 8. The following year, accredited organizations had to have a process in place for obtaining a complete patient medication list upon admission, utilizing the patient in the process, and communicating the list to the next provider of service. This requirement might have appeared simple at first, but a sound, fool-proof medication reconciliation process remains a challenge to this day. In fact, The Joint Commission suspended scoring this Safety Goal from 2009 until 2011. Officially, The Joint Commission stated in the January 2011 issue of Joint Commission Perspectives<sup>®</sup> the compliance problems facilities face cannot be resolved easily with the current structure of health care. Our efforts at this time are to find where our deficiencies lay, their impact on patient safety, which disciplines are involved, and determine how to eliminate the barriers to a successful process. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine both the numbers of errors and the number of patients affected. 2. Determine the disciplines involved and address their particular barriers to success. 3. Resolve the system processes allowing the error to occur across all facets of our health care team. <bold>Methods:</bold> A Pharmacist will randomly select twenty Medication Reconciliation Forms a month, and inspect all medication orders. These are created by the Psychiatric Intervention Team Nurse. We will audit forms for patients admitted as inpatients through the Emergency Department; transfers from other hospitals will be excluded. If errors are found, they will be recorded, as well as which discipline was involved in the error. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Errors are reported as an actual number and a percentage, the number of patients affected, and the disciplines involved. Solutions will be developed based on the errors that are found, and will address the disciplines and processes involved. Continuous monitoring will reveal either the success of the new processes, or opportunities for further improvement.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Chronic use of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are well-documented to cause Type II Diabetes (T2DM), however, the acute effects are less well known. To date, one randomized-controlled trial and numerous case reports have documented acute hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma in psychiatric patients receiving olanzapine. Given the increasing use of SGAs in medically ill patients being treated for agitation and delirium, it is essential to better comprehend the effects of olanzapine on blood glucose in the acute setting. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the acute effects of olanzapine versus haloperidol on fasting blood glucose (FBG) in medical patients. Secondary objectives include characterizing prescribing patterns and assessing adverse effects in diabetic versus nondiabetic patients. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective analysis assesses 200 patients between January 2011 and October 2012. Patients were included if they were age 18 years of age or greater, received olanzapine or haloperidol, and had at least two FBG readings after the initiation of the antipsychotic. Patients were excluded if they had a past psychiatric history of a psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, no baseline fasting blood glucose, or if they were initiated on any of the following medications during their course: tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, and beta blockers. The primary outcome of this study is the mean difference in FBG in patients receiving olanzapine versus a control group of patients receiving haloperidol over a maximum of 14 days. Secondary objectives include prescribing patterns, adverse effects, and the initiation of an antidiabetic agent. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests will be performed to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> This study reports the mean difference in fasting blood glucose in the olanzapine versus haloperidol group and assesses for statistical and clinical significance. Dose-related effects, adverse events, and demographic characteristics associated with changes in fasting blood glucose are detailed.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> There is an estimated eight million people worldwide who abuse opiates. Opioid maintenance treatment is aimed at avoiding illicit drug use, not achieving a drug-free state. Additionally, maintenance treatment aims to improve quality of life and psychosocial functioning for the patient along with reducing harm and costs for society. Opioid agonists such as methadone, partial agonists such as buprenorphine, or agonist/antagonist combinations such as buprenorphine/naloxone can be used in opioid maintenance treatment. There have currently been no studies looking at the most efficacious dose of buprenorphine/naloxone in maintenance rehabilitation programs. It has been noted that patients may be prescribed benzodiazepines for anxiety, and zolpidem or trazodone for insomnia. Though these medications may help patients through the agony associated with acute withdrawal, their role in the maintenance period is questionable. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Investigate the difference between relapse rates with use of buprenorphine/naloxone at 8 mg or less as compared to higher doses. 2. Investigate the difference in time to relapse with use of buprenorphine/naloxone at 8 mg or less as compared to higher doses. 3. Investigate the difference between relapse rates with use of buprenorphine/naloxone with and without concomitant use of sedating medications. 4. Investigate the difference in time to relapse with use of buprenorphine/naloxone with and without concomitant use of sedating medications. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective cohort study which will examine two independent variables. Patients will be identified through the Veterans Affairs computer charting system as having been enrolled in the Suboxone treatment group. A Fisher’s Exact Test will be used to determine rates of relapse in both groups. ANOVA will be used to evaluate time to relapse. A pre-specified p value of 0.05 will indicate statistical significance. SPSS software will be used for all statistical calculations. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the difference in relapse rate and time to relapse for patients taking 8 mg or less as compared to higher doses, as well as the difference in relapse rate and time to relapse for patients taking a concomitant sedating medication.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> It has been estimated that anywhere between 13%-40% of cancer patients are suffering from clinical depression, and these rates may be an underestimate when depressive symptoms are taken into consideration. Levels of psychological distress and disorders are considerably higher than the general population and can vary between cancer diagnoses. Comorbidities with depressive disorders have been shown to cause a decrease in chemotherapy adherence and increase in mortality compared to patients without depression. Despite the importance of treating psychological disorders, about 40-90% of cancer patients are reportedly under-treated. This descriptive pilot study seeks to identify trends in antidepressant prescribing, taking into consideration demographic variables such as cancer diagnosis, age and gender. Results of this hypothesis-generating study can be utilized to inform future research and aid prescribers and patients to predict and prevent depressive effects on cancer morbidity and mortality. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective is to characterize and describe patterns and trends in the prescribing of antidepressant medications in subjects diagnosed with prostate, colorectal, breast, pancreatic and lung cancer using the Maine All-Payer Claims Database (MeAPCD). <bold>Methods:</bold> Methods: This is a descriptive cohort study; the population is Maine subjects with solid tumors identified within the MeAPCD from 2007-2009. Inclusion criteria for selection was based on ICD-9 codes for breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung (NSCL), prostate and pancreatic cancers. Subjects were characterized based on antidepressant receipt and/or ICD-9 code for depressive disorders. Descriptive statistics will analyze demographics and trends of diagnosis and prescribing of antidepressants. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> A total of 30,761 subjects were identified by ICD-9 codes for solid tumor cancers. Median age at first diagnosis was 62 years old, with 67% being female. There were 6,743 subjects (21.9%) that received antidepressant therapy, with 27% diagnosed for breast, 22% colorectal, 26% NSCL, 23% pancreatic and 13% prostate cancers. There were 68,898 claims for psychiatric drugs with 31.6% for escitalopram and sertraline. We are currently reviewing utilization of antidepressants among cancer diagnoses by ICD-9 code and will report their prescriptive patterns by cancer type, age, gender and geographic location.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Antipsychotics are the primary pharmacologic treatment for schizophrenia. However, twenty to sixty percent of patients with schizophrenia are treatment resistant with a persistence of psychotic symptoms after two adequate trials with antipsychotics. Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP), many patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia are prescribed APP. Current guidelines state that APP should only occur during cross titration or after at least two trials of antipsychotics (at least one second generation in addition to clozapine) and after addressing other causes of treatment failure. This study will determine if APP prescribing follows a rational approach to treatment at this venue. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective is to identify differences in the demographics and treatment histories of patients prescribed APP compared to those prescribed monotherapy. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of the treatment regimen to reduce as needed medications (PRN) use and seclusion-restraint interventions after 6 weeks of treatment, and length of stay. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective cohort design. Adult patients prescribed scheduled antipsychotics in two State Psychiatric Hospitals are identified from the Clozapine Authorization and Monitoring Program databank from January 1-31, 2012. Two groups are identified, those on APP and those on monotherapy. Pharmacy electronic profiles are used to distinguish patients in cross titration from those prescribed APP and to assess treatment histories. Patient charts will be used for all other information. Patients must be between 18 and 64 years of age, have an axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia, and have been on a stable dose of antipsychotic(s) for six weeks. Sample size is estimated at 100 patients per group. Comparisons of demographics, interventions, and length of stay will be made between those on APP and those on monotherapy. Chi Square statistics will be used for nominal data and Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon Rank sum tests for continuous data. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Patient demographics, reduction in needed interventions, length of stay, and prescribing history will be compared between groups. The null hypothesis is that there is not a significant difference between patients prescribed APP and those prescribed monotherapy.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> The use of antipsychotic polypharmacy has been the subject of much research and debate. Most of the available literature focuses on the safety and efficacy of the use of multiple antipsychotics or on strategies to reduce this practice. Implementation of The Joint Commission’s Hospital Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services (HBIPS) requirements mandates hospitals to monitor the adequate documentation and appropriate justification for the use of multiple antipsychotics. According to the HBIPS section of the Specifications Manual for Joint Commission National Quality Measures, the medical record of any patient discharged on two or more routine antipsychotic medications must contain documentation of appropriate justification for the use of multiple antipsychotic medications which may include a history of at least 3 failed trials of monotherapy, plans to taper down the additional antipsychotic to monotherapy or cross-taper in progress, augmentation of clozapine therapy or other justifications deemed appropriate by the prescriber. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of this study is to evaluate the use and documentation of antipsychotic polypharmacy at two inpatient psychiatric facilities in New Jersey in order to determine if appropriate justification for the use of multiple antipsychotic medications was documented. <bold>Methods:</bold> All patients discharged between January 1st and June 30th 2012 on two or more routine antipsychotics were identified and their medical records were reviewed. Information collected during the review included any documentation regarding the use of more than one routine antipsychotic drug and demographic information. The samples from each site will be characterized and compared using descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis and the Student’s t-test. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Results reported will include the proportion of charts reviewed which adequately document the correct justification for the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy and the rates of each justification given.

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic with well documented efficacy in schizophrenia. However, its use is limited due to adverse effects and monitoring requirements. Cautious titration of clozapine is recommended due to the risk of orthostatic hypotension, syncope and cardiac collapse. It is recommended that clozapine be initiated at 12.5 or 25 mg daily and the target dose be reached in escalating increments of 25-50 mg per day over two weeks. For patients with an interruption in therapy greater than 48 hours, the manufacturer suggests that clozapine be retitrated from the initial recommended dosage; however, parameters for optimal retitration are not specified. Currently at VCUHS, titration schedules are left to the prescribers’ discretion, as no protocol exists for titration of clozapine. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective of this project is to characterize adherence to the manufacturer recommended clozapine titration schedule on days 1, 3 and 7 in patients newly initiated or retitrated on clozapine at VCUHS. Secondary objectives will compare the incidence of orthostatic hypotension in patients who received recommended clozapine titration and those who did not, characterize adherence to clozapine titration schedules, determine average target dose and days to reach target, describe average morning blood pressure and heart rate on days 1, 3 and 7 and compare Morse Fall Risk Assessment prior to initiation and on day 7 of clozapine treatment. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients will be identified using the Mylan<sup>®</sup> Clozapine Prescription Access System and electronic medical records will be retrospectively reviewed. Patients greater than 18 years of age hospitalized at VCUHS between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2012 who were newly initiated or retitrated on Mylan<sup>®</sup> clozapine will be included. Patients with clozapine treatment duration less than seven days, those who resumed their home dose, those who received FazaClo<sup>®</sup> brand products and those who are pregnant or prisoners will be excluded. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests along with descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate the objectives. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The results of this quality improvement project will be used to evaluate prescribing patterns, assess cardiovascular adverse effects associated with clozapine and optimize current protocols at VCUHS.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Clozapine was the first atypical antipsychotic agent described as the best treatment option in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Drug level monitoring has been used to determine adherence, lack of efficacy, toxicity and potentially, for dose adjustments. Clozapine level above 350 ng/mL is considered “therapeutic” and above 1000 ng/mL is considered toxic due to dose related adverse events. Researchers debate whether an actual positive correlation between clozapine daily dose and clozapine/norclozapine (CYP1A4 reversible clozapine metabolite) ratio levels exist. Few have found positive correlation and encourage periodic clozapine therapeutic drug monitoring but other studies reported differences on clinical response after dose adjustments based on clozapine/norclozapine levels even within “therapeutic range” of 350-1000 ng/mL. From observation, clozapine doses adjusted locally after levels above 1000 ng/mL without signs and symptoms of toxicity lead to relapse in schizophrenia positive symptoms. The aim of the evaluation is to collect information as a quality improvement initiative to assess the use of clozapine levels after dose adjustments and its incorporation on clozapine target drug monitoring at Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective is to describe utilization of clozapine levels as a guide for dose adjustments and its variations among subjects at the Tuscaloosa VA Medical Center. Second, to determine feasibility of the adjustment of clozapine dose based on levels as target drug monitoring. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective review will evaluate at least 20 medical records of patients that have/ had an active clozapine order since January 2009 to December 2012, are/were followed by local Clozapine Treatment Team and have at least two clozapine/norclozapine serum levels documented. Demographic variables (age and gender), clozapine indication (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), clozapine dose information (starting date, dose adjustments and dates), time to therapeutic response, reason for discontinuation, if applicable, clozapine/norclozapine level and dates, adverse events related to clozapine dose adjustments/titration and dates, and other mental health medications. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the clozapine dose and corresponding average clozapine/norclozapine level within each dose, average time to therapeutic response and degree of change between clozapine/norclozapine levels within each dose range after dose adjustments.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Approximately 30% of patients with schizophrenia meet operational criteria for treatment resistance. This is defined as the persistence of significant symptoms through adequate trials of at least two different antipsychotic drugs (APDs). The second-generation APD clozapine, is approved for use in such patients as it demonstrates superior efficacy relative to other APDs. Unfortunately, significant symptoms persist in about 40-70% of patients treated with clozapine. Although the evidentiary basis for the practice is poor, the use of two or more APDs in combination remains prevalent in treatment resistant schizophrenia; this includes the combination of clozapine with other APDs. The introduction of an additional APD is intended to improve outcome but it can also confer additional risk in terms of side effects. This study will assess outcomes and identify possible adverse events in patients who had another APD added to their clozapine regimen. <bold>Objectives:</bold> (1) To determine which antipsychotics are being used at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VAMC for augmentation of clozapine resistant schizophrenia patients; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of augmentation of clozapine; and (3) to evaluate additional adverse events occurring in augmented patient population. <bold>Methods:</bold> The VA’s computerized record system will be used to identify patients who have been on clozapine for at least four consecutive months for the treatment of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients receiving clozapine for any other diagnosis will be excluded. The primary group will be patients who received an additional APD following four consecutive months of clozapine monotherapy. The control group will consist of patients who continued on clozapine monotherapy. Data collection will include age, gender, ethnicity/race, duration of illness, clozapine dose at time of augmentation or highest recorded, BPRS scores at four months and after any augmentation, augmenting agent (dose/route), and reason for augmentation. Clinical outcomes will be obtained through chart review of electronic medical records for 12 months after four month monotherapy trial. The research was approved by the institutional review board (IRB). <bold>Results and Conclusions:</bold> To be determined.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. None. <bold>Background:</bold> Electronic nicotine delivery systems (e-cigarettes) are devices that use a rechargeable battery to vaporize a nicotine-containing solution of glycerin or propylene glycol. They are designed to look like cigarettes and marketed as a smoking alternative. Once only sold on the internet, they are now available in grocery stores, convenience stores, some pharmacies, and other retail outlets. Their safety and efficacy has not been established by FDA review, but an unknown number of veterans are using them. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the awareness, knowledge, and use of e-cigarettes among veterans and to identify trends in e-cigarette use, what benefit or harm was experienced from use, any health or demographic variables that may be predictive of e-cigarette use, and clinics in which targeted education may be useful. <bold>Methods:</bold> A four-part survey was created to assess awareness, knowledge, and use of e-cigarettes among veterans at the Lexington VA Medical Center. Willingness to complete the survey and presentation to one of the outpatient clinics are the only inclusion criteria. Veterans who are unwilling or unable to participate will be excluded. Veterans will self-administer the survey, with an investigator available for questions. Informed consent and HIPAA acknowledgement will be obtained from all participants. Data will be pooled and groups will be compared to determine if there is any difference in awareness, knowledge, or use of electronic cigarettes. Group comparisons will examine differences between smokers and non-smokers, different clinic populations, participants with and without a history of substance abuse, and those with and without a history of mental illness. Using a 2-tailed alpha of 0.05, 260 survey responses will be required to detect a 5% difference between groups. <bold>Results and Conclusions:</bold> Descriptive statistics will be reported for all survey items and used to compare awareness and use of e-cigarettes to national surveys already in the literature. T-tests will be used for group comparisons and multivariate regression analysis will be used to determine if demographic variables are predictive of e-cigarette use. Full results and conclusions will be presented at the 2013 CPNP Annual Meeting.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Research has become an increasingly collaborative effort, allowing individuals from multiple institutions or academic disciplines to pool together knowledge and experience from individual contributors. While there are many benefits to collaboration, potential obstacles may arise such as the delegation of required tasks, reconciling varying viewpoints of the involved parties, and maintaining effective communication throughout the process. To capitalize on the benefits of collaboration, such as increasing the number and diversity of potential subjects, a multi-site research project is being conducted to determine consumer and provider satisfaction with medication fact sheets prepared for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) by members of the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists (CPNP). PGY-1 and PGY-2 pharmacy residents, along with supervising psychiatric clinical pharmacists, are investigators in the project. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Describe a multi-site collaboration among clinical pharmacists and pharmacy residents on a prospective survey study. Specifically, we will detail formation of the investigator group, communication, resource utilization, and unforeseen obstacles. <bold>Methods:</bold> This collaboration is currently ongoing and detailed information about the process is being tracked as the project progresses. Various communication tools, such as an internet-based workspace, e-mail, and telephone conference calls, are being utilized by investigators to discuss project goals and design, address concerns, and provide updates on project status at the individual study sites. Specific responsibilities are rotated and assigned amongst the involved investigators as they arise. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will detail the collaborative process in order to help others better understand its potential benefits and drawbacks. We anticipate the information will help others who would like to implement and further optimize similar future endeavors.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves the induction of a convulsion by the application of electrical current to the brain for therapeutic purposes. The practice of ECT is established as an effective and safe treatment for acute episodes of severe major depressive disorder (MDD) and other mental disorders. Studies of ECT for patients with MDD have demonstrated response rates of 70% to 90% when used first line, and 40% to 60% when used to manage treatment-resistant depression. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) states that continuation ECT (C-ECT) occurs within 6 months of acute treatment to prevent relapse, whereas maintenance ECT continues beyond the six-month point to prevent recurrence. For the purposes of this research, only patients on C-ECT were evaluated. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective of this study is to compare the outcomes of the three treatment modalities: patients on C-ECT monotherapy; patients on C-ECT with pharmacotherapy; and patients on pharmacotherapy monotherapy. Comparing patient’s number of psychiatric hospital admissions, suicide attempts, and suicides will assess outcomes. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2011 will be used to identify patients who received C-ECT in conjunction to antidepressant treatment, patients who only received antidepressant therapy, and patients who received C-ECT monotherapy alone. All Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC) veteran patients aged 18 years or older receiving C-ECT with or without antidepressants or patients on antidepressants, with a diagnosis of depression will be eligible for inclusion. Excluded patients will be those who have a history of substance abuse, patients with psychosis, patients with psychotic depression, meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for another axis I or axis II disorder (except nicotine dependence); neurological pathology on axis III; and having already participated in a C-ECT program. Eligible patients will be enrolled consecutively to a target sample size of up to 62 patients in each arm. Results will be used to identify differences in outcomes, overall efficacy between treatments, and the possible need for practice changes. <bold>Results:</bold> Pending.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Numerous literature sources have established the effectiveness of symptom-triggered benzodiazepine therapy for alcohol withdrawal symptoms (AWS) commonly under CIWA-Ar protocol. A large number of earlier studies have demonstrated clinical advantages of reduced total benzodiazepine dose and reduced length of stay with symptom triggered (ST) over fixed schedule (FS) dosing, but there have been some recent studies that show a reduced advantage and sometimes, no difference at all between ST and FS dosing. Furthermore, the vast majority of these studies have excluded patients receiving psychiatric treatment. Substance abuse is highly prevalent in the mental health population. This study will compare and measure the relative success of ST versus FS dosing of benzodiazepines for the treatment of AWS in psychiatric patients. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study will be a retrospective cohort study measuring total dose of benzodiazepine consumed and time to discontinuation of CIWA protocol while each patient is on the inpatient psychiatric unit. We will also examine differences in the rate of escalation of care between the two groups. Data will be collected from January 2010 to March 2011. The inclusion criteria will be anyone over age of 18, anyone who has had their last drink within 72 hours, and anyone admitted to the psychiatric unit for alcohol withdrawal. Exclusion criteria will be anyone with active seizures, active psychosis, and long term benzodiazepine use (continuous use of benzodiazepines greater than 2 weeks). After separation into FS versus ST groups, patient’s total dose of benzodiazepines consumed during time of admission until time of CIWA protocol discontinuation will be documented for comparison. Similarly, time to CIWA protocol discontinuation will also be documented for comparison. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The independent variables measured will be total dose of benzodiazepines used and time to discontinuation of CIWA protocol. The dependent variables measured will include average CIWA score. The data will be analyzed by a student’s t-test. Demographic data will be compared using chi-squared or Fisher’s exact.<sup>1</sup>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> In alcohol dependent patients, sudden cessation may result in a wide array of symptoms ranging from agitation and discomfort to seizures, delirium tremens, and even death. For this reason, patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal are often admitted to the hospital for medical management. University of Missouri Health Care (UMHC) recently reassessed its withdrawal treatment protocols and, on 4 June 2012, switched from an institution specific Severity Assessment Scale (SAS) to the more validated Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study is to compare the SAS to the CIWA-Ar protocol to determine whether one protocol offers benefit. The primary objectives of the study are: to quantify total benzodiazepine use associated with each protocol; and to evaluate whether either protocol is associated with higher rates of severe withdrawal complications. Secondary objectives of this study are to: determine differences in the number of times patients required lorazepam; evaluate differences in the indicators on which patients scored; assess differences in symptom severity; detect differences in the number of patients requiring transfer to a higher level of care due to withdrawal related complications; assess differences in the need for rescue sedation; identify differences in route of administration used; and record the number of patients on a withdrawal protocol who left the hospital against medical advice. <bold>Methods:</bold> A health system wide retrospective chart review was conducted. Charts from 1 August 2011 to 31 October 2011 wherein the SAS protocol was ordered, and those from 1 August 2012 to 31 October 2012 wherein the CIWA-Ar protocol was ordered, were eligible for this pilot study. Patients included must have been at least 18 years of age and experiencing alcohol withdrawal. Those with a documented medical or psychiatric illness associated with seizures or hallucinations, those withdrawing from substances other than alcohol, and those using opiates, antiepileptics, clonidine, or beta-blockers were excluded from the study. <bold>Results:</bold> Preliminary data is being analyzed for approximately 100 patients. Data analysis is anticipated to be complete by March 22, 2013.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs) are prescribed for seizures, mood stabilization, and headache disorders. Over the past decade, less expensive, generic alternatives have become more widely available; however, some studies suggest that after conversion from brand to generic AEDs, there were increased seizures and the definition of bioequivalent has been challenged. These breakthrough seizures can result in a number of negative consequences. As generic AEDs became more widely available, there was an institutional decision to not stock generic AEDs because of safety concerns. Seeing as not all patients take AEDs for seizure control and these agents are quite costly, we would like to know the number of patients who could safely be converted from Topamax and Lamictal to the generic formulations. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Assess the number of patients who were prescribed Topamax and Lamictal over a period of time, 2. Record the indication for use, 3. Assess how many non-seizure patients could be converted to generic formulations, 4. Estimate the potential cost-savings. <bold>Methods:</bold> A Composite Health Care System report was generated to review the patients who received Topamax and Lamictal between May 30th, 2012 and November 26th, 2012. The patients’ charts were manually reviewed for the drugs’ indications. The pharmaceutical supplier database was queried to review the total brand units purchased over the past 12 months and the generic equivalent costs were evaluated. <bold>Results:</bold> There were 955 patients identified who were prescribed these medications for the aforementioned time frame. Of these patients, 36 patients had a diagnosis of seizures. The indication could not be determined for 253 patients because the prescription originated from an outside provider. Over the past 12 months, the facility spent $389,000 on Lamictal and Topamax. If generic equivalents had been purchased, the cost would have been $4,800 with a cost-savings of $384,000. <bold>Conclusions and Future Directions:</bold> The study showed that the majority of patients who received Lamictal and Topamax prescriptions were not for seizures. If these non-seizure patients were converted to generic products, there is the potential for significant cost-savings. Patients who have a seizure indication will remain on brand name products for safety.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. Presented at the CPNP Annual Meeting in Colorado Springs, CO on Monday, April 22, 2013. <bold>Background:</bold> At WMC, uninsured indigent patients make up 30% of admissions in the behavioral health unit (BHU). Currently, these patients are not provided medications upon discharge. In addition, many of these patients cannot afford the medications they are stabilized on at discharge. As a result they decompensate and are readmitted. A retrospective review of 30-day readmission rates from BHU in 2011-2012 was completed and provided financial information needed for WMC administration to fund this pilot study. It showed that ∼ 4 patients /month were being readmitted due to an inability to afford medications. <bold>Objective:</bold> 1. Compare readmission rates of the uninsured indigent patients provided with 30 day supply of medications to historical readmission data. 2. Determine study patient’s ability and/or barriers to obtaining follow up care post 30 days. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a prospective pilot conducted on a 26 bed adult inpatient unit (WMC) for a 3 month trial period. A 30 day supply of medications shall be filled at competitive pricing from an outpatient pharmacy and given to the patient upon discharge. Patients will be included who are uninsured and cannot afford medications due to financial difficulty. They must demonstrate motivation and mental clarity to remain compliant to their treatment regimen. Excluded are patients who have an active substance abuse disease. Included patients will be decided by the treatment team based on the above criteria. Each patient who receives medication will be documented and monitored for the following 3 months. All patients, unless readmitted, will receive a follow up phone call 1 week post 30 days. We will assess and document reasons for readmission or non-readmission, medication adherence, ability and/or barriers to obtaining follow up care. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> To be determined.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Prior studies have shown that in rat models, agonist of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptors in the XII nucleus caused an increase in endogenous noradrenergic excitatory drive. The XII motorneurons innervate the genioglossus and other lingual muscles. In OSA patients, their activation helps maintain upper airway patency. This is possible because upper airway muscle activity is enhanced in OSA patients compared with healthy people. CIH (chronic intermittent hypoxia) leads to enhanced endogenous noradrenergic drive to upper airway motoneurons and this may contribute to increased upper airway muscle activity during wakefulness in OSA patients. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. To determine if prazosin and other alpha-1 blockers (risperidone and quetiapine) increases the severity of sleep apnea in PTSD patients with nightmares. 2. To determine the number of adherent patients based on the medication-possession ratios (MPR). <bold>Research Design and Methodology:</bold> The research will be a randomized, retrospective chart review. The study population will be patients where an action was taken. To evaluate treatment responses, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) will be used to measure severity. The study population will be compared to the control, which will be patients who have similar baseline demographics, but are not receiving alpha-1 blocking agents. Inclusion criteria include: patients diagnosed of PTSD and sleep apnea, who have documented AHI scores, who have documented PCL (posttraumatic stress disorder checklist). The PCL consists of 17 items measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely.” A cutoff score of 60 is clinically significant PTSD in the veteran population and have a BMI &gt; 30. Exclusion criteria include: patients with preexisting cardio-pulmonary diseases. <bold>Clinical Relationships:</bold> Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker, and quetiapine/risperidone, which both have some alpha-1 receptor blockage, may cancel the genioglossus and other lingual muscle activity, resulting in worsening of the apneic episodes. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Study results showing no increase in sleep apnea symptoms/scores (based on the AHI) would indicate that alpha-1 blockers might be safe for use in this patient population. Study results showing an increase in sleep apnea symptoms/scores (based on the AHI) would indicate that alpha-1 blockers should be avoid in this patient population.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Based on published data, an estimated 60% of individuals with schizophrenia are non-adherent to medication therapy, in turn leading to high relapse rates and increased hospitalization costs-the number one cost driver in the disease. With the introduction of risperidone, olanzapine and more recently paliperidone long-acting injections (LAIs), the pharmacokinetic advantage of LAIs was combined with the improved relief of negative and cognitive symptoms associated with atypical antipsychotics, potentially leading to better medication adherence and reduced healthcare associated costs. Paliperidone palmitate and olanzapine pamoate are the only second generation LAI antipsychotics with a 28 day injection interval, while risperidone LAI requires twice-monthly injections. Ultimately, the advantages of paliperidone palmitate compared to other LAIAs makes it an appealing choice to help increase medication adherence rates in schizophrenia. Although the use of paliperidone palmitate has been studied in several trials, there is a scarcity of economic data regarding its use. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Describe the utilization of healthcare resources in terms of hospitalization rates, emergency room visits, medications costs and adherence with outpatient appointments before and after initiation of paliperidone palmitate in patients with schizophrenia. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study is a retrospective chart review of patients over the age of 18 years old, diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder per DSM-IV criteria, referred to Truman Medical Center Behavioral Health outpatient clinic for follow-up from September 1, 2009 to September 1, 2011, after being switched to paliperidone palmitate from oral antipsychotic therapy during admission at Truman Medical Center acute care facility. Once data has been collected regarding hospital re-admission rates, emergency room visit rates, outpatient appointments adherence rates and medication regimens, average cost for each data point will be established to determine cost implications. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Primary outcomes include difference in number of psychiatric related hospital days and total number of psychiatric related hospitalizations before and after initiation of paliperidone palmitate. Secondary outcomes include the mean annual psychiatric related hospitalization costs (including psychiatric inpatient, outpatient and emergency visits), mean annual antipsychotic medication cost and mean total annual psychiatric related cost before and after initiation of paliperidone palmitate, as well as the reason for discontinuation of paliperidone palmitate.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) provides a therapeutic option for depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, among other psychiatric conditions. Seizure duration is a clinical endpoint believed by some to correlate with treatment outcomes. In the case of missed or highly-refractory seizures, case reports suggest augmentation techniques provide benefit. These strategies are thought to enhance seizure activity through pro-epileptogenic mechanisms, while reducing adverse effects associated with ECT treatment. Xanthine alkaloids, specifically anhydrous caffeine/sodium benzoate injection, are frequently used with ECT if a clinically-effective length of seizure is not achievable. However, a widespread national drug shortage of caffeine injection has led ECT providers to seek alternative options. Although published data is lacking, oral caffeine tablets have been considered a feasible substitute. This study was designed to determine if oral caffeine tablets could be used as an effective alternative to intravenous caffeine for seizure prolongation in ECT. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine the effectiveness of alternative dosage forms of caffeine in ECT augmentation 2. Evaluate the doses of oral caffeine tablets for ECT augmentation 3. Illustrate the patient impact of nationwide drug shortages 4. Outline the collaborative approach of a multidisciplinary team in resolving drug supply issues <bold>Methods:</bold> This study is an open-label, active-comparator controlled, retrospective chart review of caffeine products ordered for ECT augmentation during a six-year time period from August 26, 2006 to August 26, 2012. Patients eighteen years of age or older who received intravenous or oral caffeine will be stratified into two groups. Group one consists of patients who received oral caffeine during the study ECT course and had not received any caffeine formulation previously. Group two patients must have received caffeine injections during an ECT course prior to using oral caffeine. Seizure length (in seconds) and caffeine doses used will be recorded. Concomitant medication use will be collected in an attempt to rule out confounding factors. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will compare the duration of clinical seizures after utilizing oral and intravenous caffeine. Additionally, we will determine if equivalent dosages of oral versus intravenous caffeine can be calculated and demonstrate how a multidisciplinary treatment team can reduce the impact of drug shortages.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Schizophrenia is a serious, life-long mental illness that affects over 2 million-Americans. In addition, the illness affects not only the patient, but the patient’s family and friends, ability to live independently, and ability to function productively in society. Antipsychotics play an integral role in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia and help improve quality of life. There are a number of antipsychotics on the market today which allows physicians the option to choose alternatives for patients that cannot tolerate certain antipsychotics. Just like many other agents, a majority of today’s antipsychotics must be taken on a scheduled basis one or more times per day. To complicate the situation, many patients diagnosed with schizophrenia are non-adherent to their medication regimen. Non-adherence in schizophrenia is estimated to be as high as 42 percent and accounts for a significant number of relapses leading to hospitalizations. For patients that are non-adherent, a number of pharmaceutical companies have developed long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics. Due to the new 30 day hospital readmission policy of the Affordable Healthcare Act, this study will investigate the option of initiating these agents in the inpatient setting and whether LAI antipsychotics can help keep patients out of the hospital. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of this study is to compare all LAI antipsychotics utilized in a healthcare system to one another by their thirty-day readmission rate. In addition, the study will compare the different agents by hospital readmission rate and rate of compliance after 30 days. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis will be conducted over a two year period from December 2010 to November 2012. Patients included in the study will be adults diagnosed with schizophrenia that received LAI antipsychotic agents in the inpatient setting. Data collected will be analyzed using a statistical software package [Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version 9.3, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC]. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The study will report a comparison of the different LAI antipsychotics that have been utilized in the inpatient setting and whether their initiation in this setting is an effective option for both patients and the healthcare system.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is an Axis II disorder seen in 2-6% of the general population and 20% of those admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Presentation includes symptoms such as affect dysregulation, cognitive misperception, and impaired impulse control and is therefore similar to that of axis I disorders such as bipolar disorder. No agent is FDA approved for the treatment of BPD; a variety of agents are utilized in order to target specific symptoms, though certain classes lack robust demonstration of efficacy within the literature. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate differences in the number of agents prescribed for treatment of BPD and bipolar disorder. 2. Compare baseline and follow-up global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores in each group and determine if the differences in therapy regimens result in better therapeutic outcomes. 3. Examine the rate of use of agents outlined in the 2001 American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines for the treatment of borderline personality disorder in order to determine if current therapy trends have changed since the time of writing. <bold>Methods:</bold> The institution’s computerized patient record system (CPRS) will be used to identify veterans with an inpatient admission between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2012. In addition, the records must include a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, or an unspecified personality disorder displaying one or more symptom clusters indicative of borderline personality disorder. Data collected will include patient age, gender, allergies, past medical history, name and maximum dose of medications utilized during an inpatient stay within the study period, baseline GAF score, and final GAF score. Documented symptoms of BPD will be collected only for individuals with a diagnosis of an unspecified personality disorder. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the differences between the number and types of agents utilized in the treatment of bipolar disorder with and without co-morbid borderline personality disorder as well as differences in GAF scores between groups and resulting from use of individual therapeutic agents.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> The definition of antipsychotic polypharmacy is concomitant prescription of two or more scheduled anti-psychotic medications in an individual patient. While not officially recommended in most schizophrenia treatment guidelines recent studies have shown that antipsychotic polypharmacy is often utilized as a treatment option in patients with schizophrenia. Antipsychotic polypharmacy studies estimate a utilization rate ranging anywhere from 7% to 41%, in various mental healthcare settings worldwide. By detailing the effectiveness and incidence of adverse outcomes associated with antipsychotic polypharmacy, this evaluation may provide information valuable to the development of criteria for use and monitoring recommendations for antipsychotic polypharmacy. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine rate of antipsychotic polypharmacy prescribing at TVAMC in veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 2. Describe adverse outcomes associated with antipsychotic polypharmacy including QTc prolongation, movement disorders, weight gain, development of metabolic co-morbidities, and re-hospitalization rates. 3. Determine rate of prescriber congruence to the Texas Medication Algorithm Project Antisychotic Algorithm for Schizophrenia. <bold>Methods:</bold> Outpatients with active orders for two or more scheduled antipsychotic medications on January 1, 2011 will be screened for inclusion. <bold>Inclusion:</bold> Maintenance on two or more scheduled antipsychotics for ≥30 days and diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Data collected from the electronic medical record will include age range, gender, antipsychotic medication and peak dose, route of administration of antipsychotics, psychiatric co-morbidities, metabolic co-morbidities, duration of mental illness, number of previous antipsychotics trialed, QTc (baseline and ≥1 month after initiation of combination), weight (baseline and ≥1 months after initiation of combination), AIMS score (baseline and ≥1 months after initiation of combination), fasting lipid profile (baseline and ≥1 months after initiation of combination), and hospitalizations (1 year following initiation of combination). <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Objective 1: % outpatients with diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder maintained on antipsychotic polypharmacy. Objective 2: median change from baseline (and interquartile ranges): QTc, AIMS score, weight, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c and median number of hospitalizations (and interquartile ranges) 1 year post-initiation of polypharmacy combination. Objective 3: % patients who received 2 trials of antipsychotic monotherapy and 1 trial of clozapine (or 3 trials of monotherapy plus documented clozpaine ineligibility) prior to polypharmacy.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. CPNP 2013 Annual Meeting, Colorado Springs, CO. <bold>Background/Purpose:</bold> Citalopram (Celexa<sup>®</sup>) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 for the treatment of depression. Recent post-marketing reports of QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes associated with citalopram use have prompted new FDA dosing recommendations and monitoring parameters, as well as changes to the citalopram product labeling. The purpose of this project is to evaluate adherence to the updated citalopram dosing recommendations and monitoring parameters within the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the following parameters, pre- and post-implementation of citalopram labeling revisions: (1) number of patients prescribed citalopram doses exceeding 40 mg/day (2) number of patients age 60 and over prescribed citalopram doses exceeding 20 mg/day (3) number of patients with documented congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, myocardial infarction (within the previous 6 months), and/or uncompensated heart failure (4) number of patients prescribed citalopram in conjunction with other medications that prolong the QT interval (according to the Arizona Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERT) list). <bold>Methods:</bold> A computer generated report will be used to identify patients prescribed citalopram from June 1, 2010 to September 30, 2010 and from June 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012 within the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System. A random sample of up to 100 patients will be selected from each report for inclusion in the chart review process. All charts will be reviewed for prescribing adherence to citalopram dosing recommendations, and adherence rates will be compared between the groups. <bold>Results:</bold> Pending at time of abstract submission. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Pending at time of abstract submission.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Patient understanding of medication therapy can significantly impact adherence to treatment. Adequate education for patients and their caregivers about mental illness and medication(s) is important in successfully implementing a regimen that patients are able to manage. Written medicine information (WMI) is a collection of facts for a specific medication intended to facilitate patient understanding of medication therapy. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) has partnered with the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists (CPNP) for nearly a decade to prepare WMI for commonly prescribed psychotropics. Available to the public at no cost at www.nami.org, there were 300,000 page views of these resources in 2011. This WMI specifically targets the mental health population and covers a wide range of medication topics. During this period of collaboration, CPNP pharmacist members completed annual revisions to provide up-to-date information. Additionally, much work has been done to standardize definitions, warnings and instructions for use as well as reduce Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score to improve readability. Given the important role of WMI in patient medication adherence, it is vital to understand consumers’ and providers’ views on readability, content, and satisfaction with NAMI WMI. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Assess consumer and provider satisfaction with NAMI WMI. We expect results will support continued high-quality and further refined WMI on psychiatric medications. <bold>Methods:</bold> Surveys consisting of Likert scale and multiple-choice questions will be offered to consumers, health care professionals and trainees of the MUSC IOP, STVHCS, and Rolling Hills Hospital. A paper copy of a NAMI medication fact sheet and survey will be offered to all patients who receive standard medication counseling. Surveys will be collected using a closed container to maintain anonymity. A paper or an electronic survey along with a copy of the NAMI medication fact sheet will be distributed to licensed health care professionals and trainees practicing at data collection sites. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Using survey results, we will report on consumer and provider satisfaction with NAMI medication fact sheets. We anticipate results will guide recommendations for maintaining and updating WMI resources well-matched to the needs of patients with mental illness, as well as their families, caregivers, and providers.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Through recent years, evidence has shown a higher incidence of depression among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Several structured behavioral interventions for the management of diabetes have been studied due to the significant cost of managing the disease. Evidence strongly supports the use of such structured behavioral interventions for education and management of diabetes using collaborative care teams, showing significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c, LDL cholesterol, and weight. At the Rockford Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) affiliated with the William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital, the Diabetes Lifestyle Management group is a structured 2-hour group that occurs over 3 sessions and provides patients with comprehensive education of diabetes disease state management. The group is a part of the Integrated Care service, which is the collaborative care team and plays an integral role in facilitating self-management. One of the integral components of the Diabetes Lifestyle Management group is a 1-hour section led by a mental health clinician and conducted using motivational interviewing techniques to address lifestyle and behavior changes for diabetes management. <bold>Objective:</bold> The objective of this study is to compare diabetes outcomes including hemoglobin A1c, LDL cholesterol, and weight in patients completing the Diabetes Lifestyle Management group before and after the integration of motivational interviewing. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective records review of up to 300 patients completing a minimum 2 sessions of the Diabetes Lifestyle Management at the Rockford VA CBOC will be conducted. Data collected will include hemoglobin A1c, weight, LDL cholesterol, and diabetes disease-state knowledge in patients within 3 months prior to and 2 to 6 months following completion of the Diabetes Lifestyle Management group. Outcomes of patients completing the group prior to the integration of motivational interviewing will be compared to the outcomes of patients who received motivational interviewing as a component of the group. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Research is ongoing and preliminary results will be presented at the College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists Annual Meeting.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold>. Total outpatient prescription expenses for antipsychotics increased from $1.7 billion in 1997 to $7.4 billion in 2007. In June 2012, the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management Services, Medical Advisory Panel, and VISN Pharmacist Executives created recommendations for antipsychotic selection. These recommendations were created to guide clinicians in the selection of these agents and were based upon numerous clinical trials involving both first and second generation antipsychotics. These recommendations state that should a patient fail an adequate trial (6 weeks) of two first line agents (haloperidol, loxapine, quetiapine, risperidone or perphenazine), they should be offered a trial of clozapine. If clozapine fails, or if the patient is not a candidate for clozapine treatment, they may then be offered a third trial of a first line agent, an alternative agent not listed above, or a second line agent (olanzapine, ziprasidone or aripiprazole). These three agents are significantly more expensive than alternative formulary agents and have not been shown to be superior. These guidelines are currently not in effect at the Veteran’s Affairs Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA ECHCS). Use of antipsychotics has been associated with weight gain, diabetes, and worsening lipid profiles which represent major cardiovascular disease risk factors. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has created guidelines regarding cardiometabolic monitoring of antipsychotic agents. A clinical pharmacist could be utilized to enforce these new recommendations and aid in scheduling appropriate cardiometabolic monitoring which would result in a significant cost savings and improved patient outcomes. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Determine the number of patients newly started on olanzapine, ziprasidone or aripiprazole and their compliance with selection criteria. Determine the number of patients on these agents who complied with ADA recommendations. <bold>Methods:</bold> We will look retrospectively at patient charts from July of 2011 to July of 2012 to identify patients who were newly started on olanzapine, ziprasidone or aripiprazole aripiprazole at the VA ECHCS for compliance with the proposed recommendations and the ADA guidelines. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report on the number of patients who did not meet criteria for second line agents, the associated cost avoidance and compliance with ADA recommendations.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Recently there has been controversy surrounding a FDA warning that advises against using citalopram at doses greater than 40 mg per day because of QTc prolonging effects. This warning also recommends a maximum dose of 20 mg in patients with hepatic impairment or patients who are older than 60 years of age. Most of the studies used to develop this recommendation were not designed to evaluate QTc prolongation as the primary outcome. The unpublished QT/QTc study of citalopram mentioned in the FDA drug safety communication only evaluated doses of 20 mg and 60 mg, thus providing no evidence on the QTc prolonging effects of citalopram 40 mg. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Investigate the prevalence of QTc prolongation (&gt; 470 msec for men and &gt; 480 msec for women) after initiation of citalopram. 2. Evaluate whether QTc prolongation is citalopram dose-dependent. 3. Determine whether patients ≥ 60 years of age taking citalopram are at a higher risk of QTc prolongation. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients ≥ 18 years of age at the VA North Texas Health Care System will be included if they have received at least one 30 day prescription for citalopram between the dates of 1/1/2007 and 2/29/2012, and have a baseline EKG within one year prior to initiation of citalopram and at least one repeat EKG within 3 months post citalopram initiation. Target enrollment is 200 patients. Patients will be excluded if they have a prolonged QTc interval at baseline or if they are taking a concomitant medication with a significant risk of prolonging QTc interval. For the primary objective, the number and percentage of subjects with prolonged QTc interval will be reported. For secondary objectives, Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests will be used as appropriate to compare the prevalence of QTc-prolongation at various citalopram dosages, and to determine if a higher risk exists for patients ≥ 60 years of age. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the number and percentage of cases of QTc prolongation among patients taking citalopram, and analyze QTc prolongation as a function of citalopram dose and patient age.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a potentially irreversible, chronic syndrome related to antipsychotic therapy and is characterized by hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movements. The involuntary movements can occur after exposure to a new neuroleptic medication, within 4 weeks of withdrawal from an oral neuroleptic medication, or within 8 weeks of withdrawal from a depot neuroleptic medication. Rating scales are utilized to monitor for the emergence or progression of TD including the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and the Dyskinesia Identification System: Condensed User Scale (DISCUS). Center for Behavioral Medicine (CBM, formally known as Western Missouri Mental Health Center) is a sixty-five bed state psychiatric inpatient facility with published policies of minimum requirements for TD monitoring. Patients receiving a first-generation antipsychotic or having a diagnosis of TD are to be monitored every 3 months, while those patients on second-generation antipsychotics are assessed every 6 months. As TD is a severe and debilitating side effect of antipsychotic medications, a pharmacist driven database was created at CBM to prompt reminders for TD monitoring. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The primary objective of this study is to compare compliance with monitoring of tardive dyskinesia before and after implementation of a pharmacist driven monitoring database. Secondary analyses include evaluation of monitoring adherence between antipsychotics classes, patient care units, and age groups (defined as 18 to 49 and 50 to 90 years). <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective, single-centered, observational study. Included in the study will be patients between 18 and 90 years of age having an inpatient length of stay of at least 90 days and receiving at least one scheduled antipsychotic medication. Groups A and B will consist of those patients admitted to the facility prior to and after implementation of the monitoring database, respectively. Demographic information to be collected includes: gender, age, unit, length of stay, monitoring frequency based on policy, dates of tardive dyskinesia ratings, antipsychotic medications, dates of therapy initiation, and TD diagnosis. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Percent adherence at baseline, 3, and 6 months with monitoring recommendations for TD based on scheduled antipsychotic medication will be reported and compared between groups (pre and post intervention).</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Insomnia is a symptom of most psychiatric disorders, including affective disorders, anxiety disorders, and thought disorders. Pharmacologically, many agents can induce sleep. Benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics are often utilized for sleep, however, they may be habit forming. As a result, non-habit forming agents are used as alternatives. Trazodone, a triazolopyridine antidepressant, and quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic, are among the non-controlled medications prescribed off label for insomnia in the inpatient psychiatric population. Although they can be associated with severe side-effects, including anticholinergic and orthostatic side-effects, the safety, efficacy, and usage patterns of these two commonly prescribed drugs as “anti-insomnia” medications have not been contrasted. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1) Compare the effectiveness of trazodone and quetiapine in inpatient psychiatric patients with regards to total sleep time (TST), number of night-time-awakenings, sleep efficiency (SE), and sleep latency (SL). 2) Identify trends in length of hospitalization, as well as common side-effects of trazodone and quetiapine use and their frequency. <bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were recruited from St. Helena Hospital Center for Behavioral Health (CBH) in Vallejo, California inpatient population. Inclusion criteria are all patients between 18 to 65 years of age admitted between September 2011 and January 2012 to CBH with a physician’s order for trazodone or quetiapine. Patient enrollment target is 50. Exclusion criteria include patients who 1) are diagnosed with primary insomnia, 2) are pregnant, 3) are simultaneously on trazodone and quetiapine, 4) were on either trazodone or quetiapine up to two weeks prior to study and 5) are unable to coherently communicate with the interviewer. Patient demographics, baseline laboratory values, diagnoses, daily dose of study drug, as needed use of temazepam, length of hospitalization and number of past hospitalizations were recorded. Patients were interviewed to subjectively estimate their TST, number of night-time-awakenings, side-effects and sleep quality (Likert Scale 1-4). Nursing sleep records were also used as objective measures of TST, for number and duration of night-time-awakenings, and SL. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Investigators hypothesize that the data will help determine the efficacy and safety profiles of trazodone and quetiapine use for insomnia in the inpatient psychiatric setting.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Paliperidone palmitate is the first FDA approved once-monthly injectable atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Risk of relapse in schizophrenia is considered to be directly related to non-adherence with antipsychotic medication. The use of paliperidone palmitate (PP) would theoretically improve patients’ adherence and therefore reduce the risk of relapse and re-hospitalization. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate the clinical utility and safety of PP in the inpatient setting. 2. Determine cost-effectiveness of PP in an inpatient setting, based on the impact on hospital readmission rates. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study will evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients who were prescribed PP at Monmouth Medical Center, an acute care inpatient psychiatric facility. To be included in the study, patients will be required to be ≥ 18 years of age, have received an oral test dose of paliperidone or risperidone before starting treatment with PP, and received at least one loading dose as an inpatient. Exclusion criteria include a CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min, significant adverse events upon administration of the oral test dose, and pregnancy. Target enrollment is ≥ 100 patients. The following information will be gathered from the inpatient and Emergency Department records: diagnosis, length of stay, discontinuation due to adverse events or contraindication, clinical disposition at discharge, laboratory data, and 30 and 90-day readmission rates. Positive clinical outcomes will include significant improvement in symptoms or return to baseline in the level of functioning. Negative outcomes will include transfer to a higher level of care or readmission within 30 days. Number and % of patients with positive vs. negative outcomes will be reported as well as the rate of adverse effects. Descriptive statistics will be used to examine 30 and 90-day readmission rates. Cost information will include the cost of the medication using AWP and the cost of the average inpatient admission at our facility. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the number and percent of 30 and 90-day readmission rates and positive vs. negative treatment outcomes, and analyze cost-effectiveness based on the cost of the medication and the cost of readmission to our inpatient facility.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Introduction:</bold> Mental health literacy is the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid in their recognition, management, and prevention. Assessing literacy and identifying areas for improvement has potential to improve diagnostic and treatment outcomes of patients with mental health disorders. This study aims to evaluate the mental health literacy of physicians, nurses, and pharmacists by assessing their perceptions and knowledge of mental illnesses and terminology. This is part one of a two phase project, with the first phase focusing on the mental health literacy of providers who work primarily in an inpatient setting. The second phase will focus on surveying providers who primarily work in an outpatient setting. <bold>Methods:</bold> A survey designed to evaluate mental health literacy was created and electronically distributed to pharmacists, nurses, and physicians who work in inpatient settings in Springfield, IL. The survey contained a patient case depicting Major Depressive Disorder. Survey respondents were asked to identify the cause of the patient’s problems and rate effectiveness of various interventions. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to interpret the data as well as Mann-Whitney U tests to determine whether survey responses were affected by age, history of personal mental illness, or history of family mental illness. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 207 survey responses were received and 97.6% of the respondents correctly identified the patient to have depression. Clinical psychologists, psychiatrists, antidepressants, exercise, relaxation and stress relief techniques were rated the most helpful interventions for the patient. Respondents believed that with professional intervention, the patient would make a full recovery but problems would probably recur, and without professional intervention, the patient’s symptoms would worsen. The survey brought attention to areas for professional education, including utility of cognitive behavioral therapy, inpatient hospitalization, and electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of depression. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The majority of the survey respondents appeared to have a high degree of mental health literacy. There are still areas that can be improved upon as indicated by results and the state of Illinois receiving a NAMI mental health grade of D.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> The National Coalition for the Homeless reports that 20 to 25% of homeless people suffer from at least one severe and persistent mental illness, not including other chronic diseases. Due to the increased prevalence of chronic health conditions and the limited access to healthcare, the homeless have greater levels of mortality and premature morbidity. Often times, homeless individuals are embarrassed to discuss their current living situations and prefer not to disclose such information. Patients may feel that their healthcare professionals discount what they are saying due to the fact that they are homeless. This dismissal of thoughts and emotions can provoke feelings of disbelief or distrust and cause the patient to feel like they are being patronized or denied. These discounted feelings could result in inadequate health care. The purpose of this study is to identify how homeless women feel they are perceived by healthcare professionals as well as identify their unmet healthcare needs. This study aims to determine if pharmacists can meet the unmet healthcare needs of homeless women. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. How do homeless women feel they are perceived by different healthcare providers including pharmacists, doctors, nurses, and psychiatrists? 2. Among homeless women, what healthcare needs are not being met by their healthcare providers? 3. What impact can pharmacists have on improving the unmet healthcare needs of the homeless? <bold>Methods:</bold> Participants will be recruited from Bethlehem Haven’s Homeless Shelter in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with an enrollment goal of &gt; 30. For objective 1: An invalidation survey will be used to assess how the women feel they are perceived by their PCP, pharmacist, nurse, and/or psychiatrist. For objective 2: Participants will complete a questionnaire ranking the importance, current access, and desire for access of different healthcare needs. For objective 3: Healthcare needs classified as “not accessible but desirable” will be evaluated by two pharmacists to determine practical strategies for meeting these needs. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> A disruptive analysis will be conducted to identify perceptions and unmet health and mental needs for homeless women. Practical strategies for addressing these needs will be recommended.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Many patients with bipolar disorder (BD), depressed, or major depressive disorder (MDD) are unresponsive to medication or have dose-limiting side effects. These patients, referred to as treatment refractory depression (TRD), often either metabolize medications too rapidly (UM), or too slowly (PM), or are treated with inappropriate medication choices based on diagnosis. We plan to use genetic testing in TRD to identify differences in metabolism as well as different forms of illness. <bold>Aims and Objectives:</bold> Our hypothesis is that patients who receive pharmacogenetic testing and guided treatment will have better clinical outcomes and suffer fewer side effects after 4 months of treatment. We expect to precisely identify which decisions are best informed by genetic testing, and that patient will be motivated and eager to participate in testing. <bold>Methods:</bold> After collecting past medication trials and confirming diagnosis, we will obtain DNA from 200 subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU) using the TMAP guidelines, or pharmacogenomic guided treatment (PGT), which will have objective, genetically guided decisions made by the prescriber. For example, TMAP may indicate to switch antidepressants, whereas genetic testing may indicate which antidepressant is preferable based on drug metabolism or will recommend skipping steps if indicated (e.g., early use of lithium augmentation given a favorable genotype). <bold>Analysis and Interpretation:</bold> Prospective assessment of outcome: compare the number of subjects who achieve recovery as assessed by BDI, CGI, YMRS, ISS, CGI, and Side Effect Questionnaire. Retrospective Analysis of Clinical Decision Making: at conclusion, all subjects will have their genetic test results examined to identify variants that predict atypical drug metabolism or poor clinical response. Patient concerns and expectations of genetic testing: subjects will be administered the MACGNET scale, used to assess concerns about genetic testing. <bold>Outcome:</bold> We will report the number of subjects enrolled in each arm and present preliminary findings.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Atypical antipsychotic agents serve an important role in the treatment of many psychiatric disorders but have the potential to cause adverse effects, notably metabolic disturbances. These agents are known to cause increases in obesity and metabolic parameters such as glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. In 2004, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA), in collaboration with other organizations, acknowledged the association between the use of atypical antipsychotics and the development of metabolic abnormalities and provided a monitoring protocol for the use of these agents. Despite this recommendation, rates of monitoring remain low. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study is to assess whether a pharmacist recommendation form is effective in improving baseline metabolic monitoring for patients admitted to an acute inpatient psychiatry unit at an academic medical center. <bold>Methods:</bold> A pharmacist recommendation form with metabolic monitoring parameters will be placed on the charts of patients ordered a scheduled atypical antipsychotic during a two month period. A retrospective chart review will be conducted to assess the percentage of baseline monitoring ordered pre- and post-intervention as well as during the intervention. Patients age 18 years or older who have been ordered a scheduled atypical antipsychotic will be included. Patients who have been ordered first-generation antipsychotics or who only have orders for as needed atypical antipsychotics will be excluded. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The primary dependent variable will be the percentage of metabolic monitoring parameters ordered by physicians before, during and after the pharmacist recommendation form implementation.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> MDD is a prevalent mood disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Response rates to therapy approximate 50%, making management a significant challenge. Recent research has attempted to identify risk factors predicting response. Duloxetine (Cymbalta<sup>®</sup>) is an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake FDA-approved for management of many indications, including MDD. Pharmacokinetic studies of duloxetine found it is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, which may be implicated in drug interactions. In addition, duloxetine interacts with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke. These are potent inducers of CYP1A2. Duloxetine has 30-40% lower bioavailability in smokers as determined by serum blood levels. The dose-response relationship that this altered bioavailability may have in clinical practice remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate potential need for adjustment of duloxetine doses or an alternative agent instead of duloxetine in the smoking population. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare effectiveness defined by time to discontinuation of duloxetine in smokers versus non-smokers, describe differences in mean total daily dose of duloxetine, and to assess prevalence of adverse events <bold>Methodology:</bold> A retrospective chart review will be conducted to evaluate patients initiated on duloxetine therapy. Subjects will be identified through the initiation of drug consult at the LSCDVAMC October 1st 2009 through May 16th 2011. Consults will then be screened for indication (pain vs. MDD) and for use outside of the LSCDVAMC prior to drug consult. After screening, included subjects will be stratified according to tobacco use and separated into 2 cohorts. Subjects will be randomized in each group prior to data collection. Data to be collected include; demographics, concomitant medications, comorbid psychiatric and pain-related conditions, maximum total daily dose, frequency, and duration of use, date and cause for discontinuation, and reported adverse events. Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks from initiation or until discontinuation; whichever occurs first. A Kaplan-meier curve be utilized to describe data for time to discontinuation. A Cox-regression survival analysis will be conducted to compare data. Categorical variables will be described in frequencies and percentages and continuous variables described using means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges as appropriate. <bold>Results and Conclusions:</bold> Pending.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Medication reconciliation is a process of identifying the most accurate list of medications a patient is taking and using this list to provide correct medications for patients across the continuum of care. Performing high quality, effective medication reconciliation is important to identify discrepancies, decrease number of adverse drug events attributable to medications errors and improve patient safety. Medication reconciliation efforts begin with ensuring an accurate admission medication list. Rolling Hills Hospital, an acute 80-bed inpatient psychiatric hospital conducted a Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) of its medication use process and identified admission medication reconciliation as a high risk process in need of improvement. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Primary objective of the study was to evaluate the current effectiveness of medication reconciliation at Rolling Hills Hospital. Secondary objectives included identifying unintended discrepancies upon admission medication orders, and determine the most effective approach for medication reconciliation in an inpatient psychiatric hospital. <bold>Methods:</bold> Data were collected randomly from patients (≥13 years of age) admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital during a 2-month period. Pharmacist collected data at least twenty-four hours post-admission to allow for clarification of admission medication orders and permit normal processes of care to correct problems occurring at time of admission. Data collected included number and class of medications, number and type of medication discrepancies, patient demographics, and disease states. Pharmacist verified medications by contacting community pharmacies or obtaining medication administration records from other institutions or previous admission records at Rolling Hills Hospital. Pharmacist then interviewed patients to verify allergies, prescription medications, and over-the-counter medications and herbals. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Results will be reported from the data collection, identifying areas of the medication reconciliation process in need of improvement. We anticipate that the results will help identify the best practices for medication reconciliation at an inpatient psychiatric hospital.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Methadone has unique properties including onset of effect, variable half life, side effects, and receptor binding. It is a synthetic opioid with strong affinity to mu receptors and binds to NMDA receptors where it has antagonist properties. These properties benefit patients with allergies to other opioids and may benefit those with neuropathic pain; but methadone is more often used for refractory pain after other opioids with more predictable pharmacokinetic profiles have failed. Opioid rotation is a strategy utilized to improve or maintain pain control. Prospective clinical trials show that many patients are not successfully rotated from methadone to other opioids due to lack of pain control or other side effects. This may be due to methadone’s antagonistism of NMDA receptors not seen with other opioids. Memantine is a potent NMDA receptor antagonist that is FDA approved for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and also has potential for pain treatment. This study's aim is to determine if adding memantine during opioid switching will improve the success in rotation from methadone to other opioids. <bold>Objectives:</bold> Determine if memantine can assist with opioid rotation from methadone to other opioids. <bold>Methods:</bold> This is a prospective, feasibility trial with a case cross over design. Using VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guidelines Management of Opioid Therapy (OT) for Chronic Pain (2010) patients on methadone will be rotated to another opioid regimen chosen by their primary care provider. Memantine will be started 8 days before a methadone taper is initiated. The memantine titration schedule has been used in previous clinical trials (starting at 5 mg daily and increasing by 5 mg every other day to FDA maximum recommended dose of 20 mg daily given as 10 mg bid). The dose will be continued for 2 weeks while the new opioid regimen is titrated per Clinical Practice Guidelines. After another 2 weeks memantine will be stopped. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the number of participants switched from methadone to another opioid (without needing to return to methadone). Other measurements will include: reason for opioid rotation, Brief Pain Inventory, Epworth Sleep Scale, Morphine equivalents (before during and after opioid rotation) and patent satisfaction survey.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Second generation antipsychotics (SGA) increasingly are being prescribed in the pediatric patient population and are associated with metabolic adverse effects such as weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and glucose abnormalities. Metabolic monitoring is essential for early detection and intervention to prevent poor health outcomes; however, monitoring practices have not been well studied in pediatric populations. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The purpose of this study is to describe a managed care pediatric population newly initiated on an SGA and identify percentages of patients who 1) received recommended monitoring at baseline and follow-up, 2) developed a metabolic effect subsequent to SGA initiation and 3) received a pharmacologic or behavioral intervention for the metabolic effect. <bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective cohort analysis has been approved by the Kaiser Permanente of Colorado (KPCO) Institutional Review Board. Patients &lt;18 years of age, who purchased a newly initiated SGA between January 1, 2002 and June 30, 2011 at a KPCO outpatient pharmacy, were included. The primary study outcome was the percentage of patients who received all metabolic monitoring at baseline and follow-up after SGA initiation. Metabolic monitoring was defined as lipid, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight measurements. Metabolic effects at follow-up were defined as weight gain of &gt;7%, blood pressure ≥95th percentile based on age and weight, LDL ≥110 mg/dL, and fasting blood glucose &gt;100 mg/dL. Pharmacologic and behavioral interventions for patients who experienced a metabolic effect were examined. Patient characteristics and outcomes will be compared using t-tests and chi-square tests for continuous and categorical data, respectively. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 1023 patients, mean age 13 years, initiated an SGA during the study. Of these, 63% initiated risperidone, 19% quetiapine, 12% aripiprazole, 5% olanzapine, and 1% ziprasidone. The most common diagnoses were mood disorder (31%) and depression (20%). Five percent of patients received all recommended baseline monitoring and 3% received all recommended follow-up monitoring. The percentage of patients with monitoring for each parameter at baseline and follow-up, respectively: lipids (15% and 10%), glucose (8% and 12%), blood pressure (58% and 45%), and weight (55% and 43%). Metabolic effects and clinical interventions are being evaluated and results will be presented.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> First generation antipsychotics (FGA) are known to cause numerous side effects. The advent of second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) or “atypical antipsychotics” appeared promising until metabolic side effects began to surface. SGAs are associated with weight gain, dyslipidemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, increased cardiovascular risk, and other complications. The ADA-APA-AACE-NAASO consensus statement recommends baseline screening and ongoing monitoring of patients on SGAs. However, studies demonstrate metabolic monitoring to be poor and reported adherence to the consensus recommendations range from below 50% at best to none at worst. <bold>Description of Pharmacy Centralized Refill Service (CRS):</bold> The Pharmacy CRS provides refill medication monitoring through a collaborative protocol agreement. Refill requests are authorized by CRS if the requirements for laboratory tests are met and a primary care provider office visit has occurred within the last year. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Comparisons of the following for CRS clinics as compared to non-CRS clinics: a. Prevalence of metabolic monitoring for SGA refills. b. Prevalence of metabolic conditions in patients taking SGAs. c. Mean change in A1c, plasma glucose, blood pressure, lipid values and BMI. 2. Identify providers’ action in response to CRS monitoring when triggered by SGA refills. <bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective cohort study during April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2012 for patients followed at a CRS clinic as compared to non-CRS clinic patients. Eligible patients aged 18-65 years and taking an SGA (aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, paliperidone) will be enrolled. Patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s or dementia will be excluded. A sample size of 123 patients per group is needed to detect a 0.15 difference in monitoring rates with a 0.95 confidence interval and power of 0.8. Laboratory results and vital signs (A1c, plasma glucose, blood pressure, lipid panel, weight, body mass index), metabolic diagnoses (diabetes, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity) and SGA medication history will be collected using electronic medical records. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the prevalence of metabolic monitoring and metabolic conditions and mean change in metabolic parameters for patients seen at CRS and non-CRS clinics. Identified provider response to CRS monitoring prompts for CRS clinics will also be reported.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Unintentional injuries are a large cause of death in elderly patients with many of them contributed to falls. Given these inherent dangers, reducing the rate of falls in elderly patients should be a priority of the health care professional. There have been many risk factors discovered that may increase the number of falls in the elderly population (e.g. increased age, history of falls, impairment or gait imbalance, taking four or more medications, or taking psychotropic medications). Although some of these risk factors cannot be prevented, I believe risk factors associated with psychotropic medications can be lessened with guidance from the Beers Criteria and the START (Screening Tool of Older Person’s Prescriptions) and STOPP (Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment) tool. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine if the amount of falls can be decreased on our geriatric inpatient psychiatric unit through the use of recommendations based on the Beers Criteria and the START and STOPP tools. 2. Assess prescriber adherence to medication recommendations in patients who experience a fall. 3. Conduct a retrospective review of patients who fell in the year 2012 to determine if other interventions can be made to reduce falls. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis of patients 65 years or older who experienced a fall from January 1st 2012 to December 31st 2012 will be completed to establish a baseline amount of falls per month. This retrospective analysis will also serve to collect demographic data regarding patients who experienced a fall. This data will then be compared to data after the recommendations have been made to our psychiatrists. Descriptive statistics will be used to compare monthly amount of falls and demographic data. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Demographic data and comparisons between monthly amounts of falls before and after the recommendations will be reported.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Autistic disorder (AD) is a developmental disorder. It is characterized by significant delays in language, deficits in social interaction and repetitive or stereotypical behaviors. Currently, there is no cure for AD and the treatments are aimed at alleviating symptoms. The lack of consensus about the best treatment approach results in emotional distress to the family. The aim of the study is to identify the treatment strategies used in clinical practice, evaluate outcomes associated with the treatments, and describe the impact of AD on the family. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. To study the association between treatments and clinical outcomes in children with autistic disorder 2. To determine which treatments predict clinical outcomes in children with autistic disorder 3. To identify the extent and predictors of caregiver strain in the primary caregivers of children with autistic disorder <bold>Methods:</bold> A national representative sample of parents of children aged 4-8 years with a confirmed diagnosis of AD will be selected for the study. The sample will be stratified on the basis of three factors: status of autism mandate in the state, race, and urban/rural area of residence. The sample will be identified from mailing lists of autism advocacy organizations. The study will be based on survey methodology and the modified Dillman method. Content validity of the survey has been assessed by experts in health services research and developmental disabilities during the development of the survey. Each person on the mailing list will receive a consent form and the survey via email. A pilot study will be conducted to evaluate the clarity of the survey, prior to the actual study. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Cluster analysis will be utilized to identify the different treatment strategies employed. ANCOVA will be used to measure the difference in treatment outcome scores among children receiving different treatments. Multiple regression will assess which treatments predict outcomes in children. The caregiver strain on the family of children with AD will be quantified by using descriptive statistics. The predictors of caregiver strain will be identified by utilizing multiple regression.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Nonadherence to medications is a significant issue in patients with mental illness that can be precipitated by a number of factors; including patient perception of drug therapy value, cost, side effects, complexity of drug regimen, poor communication with health professionals, health literacy, and medical comorbidities. A review of the literature supports the premise that group interventions aimed at increasing the knowledge and support of those with mental illness is beneficial to increase adherence in medication therapy. Furthermore, the literature supports utilizing motivational interviewing along with cognitive-behavioral techniques and a holistic approach to engage, empower individuals, and illicit positive behavioral changes within the target population. Recently an Australian study examined outcomes following the introduction of a weekly medication information forum in an acute psychiatric inpatient service. This study found an increase in positive attitudes toward medication after the forums. This research will serve as foundation for expansion of group programming to enhance inpatient treatment for behavioral health disorders. <bold>Objective:</bold> Assess patient satisfaction and perceived therapeutic benefit of group sessions led by pharmacists or student pharmacists in an inpatient psychiatry setting. <bold>Methods:</bold> Participants will be recruited from an inpatient locked behavioral unit of UC Health University of Cincinnati Medical Center Psychiatric Services in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon discharge, all patients will be asked to complete a survey designed to assess their perceptions of group sessions led by pharmacists or student pharmacists. It is estimated that 100 patients will complete this survey over a four month period ending March 2013. Overall treatment satisfaction will be scored on a Likert scale of 0-5, with 5 being the highest level of satisfaction. Mean scores will be compared utilizing an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with statistical significance defined as p value &lt; 0.05. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report patient satisfaction scores showing perceived therapeutic benefit of group sessions led by pharmacists or student pharmacists. Perceived therapeutic benefit is defined as the selection of “4” or “5” in 50% of survey responders who participated in group sessions.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Smokers with substance use disorder have twice the expected rate of deaths attributable to tobacco use than in the general population. Despite the evident need for smoking cessation in this population, tobacco use dependence treatment is not routinely provided due to the ungrounded belief it will interfere with recovery from the primary substance use problem. Trials of smoking cessation among patients actively receiving treatment for substance use disorder have yielded modest quit rates. Limited data exists on concurrent tobacco use dependence behaviors and beliefs that may indicate the unique challenges to smoking cessation this population faces. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the perceptions of clients in an alcohol and other drug treatment facility regarding the provision of smoking cessation services, including 1) motivations for and barriers to smoking cessation; 2) attitudes towards quality, extent, and importance of smoking cessation services offered at their facility; 3) attitudes towards smoking cessation in a population actively receiving treatment for substance use disorder; 4) the ‘culture’ of smoking cessation at the facility; and 5) social support. <bold>Methods:</bold> Semi-structured, one-on-one in-person interviews will be conducted with clients using standardized qualitative research methods at Salvation Army Harbor Light Center, a 90-day residential alcohol and other drug treatment facility in Pittsburgh, PA. All clients who are current or past smokers will be invited to participate in this study. Baseline demographic data will be obtained via survey methods and will include age, race/ethnicity, income level, and primary drug of choice, stage of change, co-morbidity, smoking status, and housing status. Interviews will be transcribed verbatim and transcripts will be verified with other members of the research team. Codes will be developed and themes will be identified using Grounded Theory to generate a theory/hypothesis. Survey data will be evaluated using descriptive statistics. Data analysis will be conducted simultaneously to identify a point of saturation. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The data collected will help to tailor smoking cessation services to the needs of the population – both at this program and other similar programs. The data may also further explore the role of the pharmacy student in providing smoking cessation services to this population.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> With the increasing use of opioids and often lack of clear guidelines for chronic pain diagnosis and treatment, patients can be at risk for inadequate treatment of pain, addiction, adverse effects, and a lack of understanding of risks and benefits of various treatment modalities. Physicians may not always be informed of the most recent evidence-based research in chronic pain management. The American Pain Society, the American Academy of Pain Medicine and recent research have recommended guidelines for chronic pain management for chronic non-cancer pain, and the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain recently sponsored the development of evidence based guideline for the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Also, pharmacists are an accessible resource in the community and have specific knowledge regarding therapeutics, drug interactions, adherence and possible prescription drug abuse. Chronic pain management can be improved with increased access to pain management guidelines and consultation with pharmacists. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The study has two objectives: (i) to assess the degree to which physicians' prescribing practices for chronic pain patients are consistent with current practice guidelines and evidence-based medicine; and (ii) to assess when, to what degree, and under what circumstances do physicians consult pharmacists regarding therapeutics, drug interactions, dose, and addiction potential. <bold>Methods:</bold> Participants in the study (n = 600) will be recruited from chronic pain specialists through mailing lists of professional pain associations. The anticipated respondents will be 150. A survey will be developed and content validity will be established by expert review of the survey questions. Participants will answer questions regarding their practice and prescribing with chronic pain medications. Physician responses will be compared to practice guidelines and the degree and utility of their consultation with pharmacists will also be assessed. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Gaps in chronic pain management will be identified and recommendations regarding improving collaboration between physicians and pharmacists and adherence to practice guidelines will be offered based upon the study results.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a syndrome that can emerge after exposure to a traumatic event, which may lead to debilitating illness, high personal, societal, and economic costs, and increased risk of suicide. In the veteran population, the strongest predictor of developing PTSD is frequency and intensity of direct combat exposure. It was found that up to 25% of soldiers returning from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), respectively, had a provisional PTSD diagnosis. In response, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has increased its mental health care workforce in order to meet the increasing needs of these veterans. The 2010 VA/Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines for the treatment of PTSD recommend psychotherapy techniques and/or pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or venlafaxine) as initial management. <bold>Objective:</bold> 1. To calculate the percentage of OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD who are receiving treatment in concordance with VA/DoD clinical practice guidelines. 2. To determine length of time veterans are waiting to see mental health providers 3. Compare outcomes between patients receiving evidence-based treatment to those that do not. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review will be conducted for 400 STVHCS patients with OEF/OIF service who have a PTSD-related encounter between September 1, 2011 and August 31, 2012. Patient demographics (age, sex, race), social history, comorbid conditions including chronic pain, medications, Global Assessment of Functioning, PTSD Checklist-Military, number of hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and no-shows to mental health appointments will be collected for patients who meet inclusion criteria. For objective 1, number and percentage of patients receiving evidence-based treatment will be reported. For objective 2, mean wait time for an initial visit to a mental health provider will be calculated. For objective 3, descriptive statistics will be used to report differences in outcomes. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Data will be analyzed to determine the number and percentage of patients following treatment guidelines to demonstrate appropriate care of PTSD at the STVHCS. Differences in outcomes between groups will also be reported in an attempt to demonstrate a relationship between prescribing trends, psychotherapy, and outcomes.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics were developed in order to maintain more consistent blood drug concentrations and decrease the frequency of administration, with the thought that LAI antipsychotics would replace the daily oral antipsychotic dosage form. Observations in clinical practice have revealed variations in prescribing LAI and oral antipsychotics simultaneously, bringing into question the actual use of the various antipsychotic dosage forms. Additionally, because an oral antipsychotic is often used for adjunct symptom control with a LAI antipsychotic as the backbone of therapy, information on the use of acute care services by those patients requiring dual therapy is needed. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Evaluate prescribing practices of antipsychotics in a community mental health center. 2. Determine use of acute care services by those requiring LAI and oral antipsychotic therapy during the study period. <bold>Methods:</bold> Prescribing practices of Midtown Community Mental Health Center providers for LAI and oral antipsychotics will be analyzed from January 1, 2012, to May 31, 2012. Those included in the study are patients 18 years of age and receiving a long-acting injectable antipsychotic available on the market during the data collection period. Exclusion criteria include active prisoner status. Data collection will include demographic information (age, gender, race, and diagnosis), specifics of LAI and oral antipsychotic treatment (medication name, dose, and frequency), and description of acute care service use (reason for use, length of stay, and if and how the medication regimen was changed). <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Data presented will include breakdown of LAI prescribed, percentage and description of patients on dual LAI-oral antipsychotic therapy, and the percentage and description of patients on dual LAI-oral antipsychotic therapy that utilized acute care services.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Shared decision-making (SDM) is a process when the provider and patient contribute equally to medical decisions. While the majority of SDM research has been conducted in medicine, interest in SDM in psychiatry is growing. In general, psychiatrists advocate therapeutic collaborations with patients; however they identify barriers to SDM such as patient competence and honesty about adherence. While psychiatrists may generally demonstrate a positive attitude towards SDM, the extent to which SDM is actually practiced as well as their willingness to practice SDM are unknown. The goal of this project is to study providers’ willingness to practice SDM and identify their perceived barriers to SDM. This is the first step of a multi-step project to implement SDM in psychiatric settings in Austin, TX. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1). Determine providers’ attitudes toward SDM and experiences with SDM and examine the relationship between these variables and providers’ willingness to engage in SDM, 2). Determine if attitudes toward SDM differ based on providers’ demographic/practice characteristics, and 3). Identify providers’ perceived barriers to SDM. <bold>Methods:</bold> Researchers will e-mail an electronic survey to 85 psychiatric providers (i.e., attendings, residents, and physician extenders) practicing at a private teaching hospital, state hospital, and/or outpatient clinics. The survey will measure five items: attitude (20 items, Leeds Attitude to Concordance Scale II), willingness (2 items), experiences (3 items), barriers (1 item), and demographic/practice characteristics (10 items). Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables. Bivariate relationships between the dependent and independent variables and covariates will be analyzed using correlations, t-tests, and ANOVA procedures. Multiple regression analysis will be used to assess the relationships between willingness, attitudes and SDM experience. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the number of providers with SDM experience and obtain better insight about barriers. We will analyze relationships between the dependent (willingness) variable, independent (attitudes and SDM experience) variables, and demographic/practice characteristics. Results will be used to determine potential sites in which SDM can be utilized and to identify barriers to SDM so that they can be addressed prior to implementation.

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Abuse of and dependence on opioids has emerged as a significant and growing societal burden, with members of the Veteran population in particular having a high prevalence of addiction to both illicit and prescription opiates. Despite increased access to opioid agonist therapy (OAT) made possible by the approval of buprenorphine/naloxone (BN), several barriers may be contributing to underutilization of this treatment option. With the increased enrollment for Veterans Affairs (VA) services due to the conclusion of overseas military operations, many Veterans will require mental health care, including care for substance use disorders. In response to this projected increased need, the VA announced an initiative seeking to hire additional healthcare professionals dedicated to mental health issues. It is important to explore how opioid-dependent patients utilize VA system resources to determine if special attention should be paid, in the form of increased dedicated personnel, to the treatment of opioid dependence and the use of effective treatment strategies such as buprenorphine/naloxone. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1) Determine the number of hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits and no-shows to appointments of patients diagnosed with opioid dependence and prescribed BN compared to patients with a diagnosis but not prescribed BN. 2) Compare patient characteristics of the two groups. 3) Determine the number of hospitalizations, ED visits and no-shows to appointments pre-BN and post-BN initiation. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study will be retrospective chart review of adult Veterans with a diagnosis of opioid dependence or opioid abuse during the evaluation period. Patients will be divided into those who received a prescription for BN and those who have not. A random subset of those never prescribed BN, equal in number to those patients prescribed BN, will be reviewed for comparison purposes. Patients who received BN for less than 3 months will be excluded. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Results from this project may provide additional data to support the VA’s efforts to expand access to BN therapy.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Introduction:</bold> Medication adherence has always been a problem with drug therapy regimens, especially in the psychiatric population. Antipsychotics have a variety of undesirable side effects and are more prone to non-adherence. Along with antipsychotic medications, many patients with mental illness take numerous other psychotropics such as mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants. Unfortunately, there are only a few long acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics available in the United States, among which are haloperidol and risperidone. <bold>Purpose:</bold> The LAI formulated antipsychotics, which can be beneficial in a patient-specific regimen, and potentially cost effective when considering the possibility of needing to use ‘one-time’ or ‘as needed’ medications more often in a population treated with oral agents only. This question is the focus of this study. <bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis with de-identified data, will aid in evaluating adherence response and the necessity of additional ‘one-time use’ or ‘as needed’ (PRN) doses with patients receiving LAIs compared to patients receiving only oral agents in their treatment regimen. Using an analysis of data from a long-term inpatient psychiatric facility, medical records review from January 2011 to December 2012 will be conducted to identify certain outcomes. The outcomes to be assessed include regimen stability based on the use of PRN psychotropics between the two groups and medication selection within each group. Evaluation of the medication regimens of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines will help assess and create an effectiveness profile. <bold>Results:</bold> The results of this study could be beneficial when suggesting and establishing patient-specific treatment regimens with the highest chance for a positive clinical outcome in regards to efficacy, cost of secondary medications and administration, and safety of staff in inpatient hospital settings.

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Current guidelines promote non-pharmacological interventions as first-line in the management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). However, these methods are not always attempted or documented prior to using psychopharmacological agents. Antipsychotics have been shown to increase mortality in elderly dementia patients, which has prompted the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) to form an initiative to reduce the use of these medications in long-term care (LTC) patients. Veterans Affairs (VA) Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS) has implemented approaches to the use of antipsychotic medications including the use of Caretracker to electronically document behaviors and interventions and also individualized non-pharmacologic intervention plans. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of interdisciplinary approaches in the use of non-pharmacologic approaches for BPSD and antipsychotic use. <bold>Methods:</bold> TVHS has 238 operating (LTC) beds. Data will be collected over a two month period, January and February, for consecutive years of 2011, 2012 and 2013. The primary endpoint will be the average number of PRN antipsychotic doses administered per patient with a PRN antipsychotic order for the January-February 2011 study period compared to the January-February 2012 and 2013 study periods. Secondary endpoints will include the average number of PRN antipsychotic doses administered per total number of patients, percent who received a scheduled and/or PRN antipsychotic medication, percent who received an antipsychotic with the primary indication of behavioral or psychological symptoms related to dementia, percent of PRN antipsychotic doses administered with corresponding behavioral symptoms and non-pharmacological interventions documented, percent of patients receiving psychopharmacological medications, mean antipsychotic dosage for individual antipsychotic agents, and mean haloperidol dose equivalent for patients prescribed scheduled antipsychotics. <bold>Statistics:</bold> Descriptive analysis will be performed to assess the average number of PRN antipsychotic doses administered, mean antipsychotic dosage for individual antipsychotic agents, and mean haloperidol dose equivalent for patients prescribed scheduled antipsychotics. A student t-test will be used to analyze all primary and secondary endpoints. All tests will be two-sided and p-values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. <bold>Results:</bold> Data collection in progress.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> It is estimated that 40-50% of psychiatric patients discharged from an inpatient psychiatric facility will be readmitted within one year. Efforts to contain cost and make healthcare more efficient such as decreasing duration of hospital stays, has paradoxically increased the rate of hospital readmission. Many risk factors have been significantly correlated with psychiatric rehospitalization including: sex, marital status, age, involuntary first admission, psychiatric diagnosis, global functioning, the degree and type of symptoms, comorbid psychiatric disorders, history of past psychiatric hospitalization, number of previous admissions, and discharge diagnosis. The more that is understood regarding risk factors influencing time-to-readmission, the more opportunities are available to reduce psychiatric readmissions by mitigating these risk factors. <bold>Objective:</bold> To identify risk factors that influence time-to-readmission in Veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit at the VA WNY Healthcare System. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study is an IRB-approved retrospective chart review of Veterans admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2012 to identify risk factors for readmission (dependent variable). Patients will be included if they have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and presence of two or more psychiatric admissions within this date range. A Computerized Patient Record System chart review will be conducted for each patient to identify independent variables including age, sex, number of previous admissions, time since previous admission in months, psychotropic medications at the time of discharge, number of medications at the time of discharge, antipsychotic dose(s) optimized prior to admission, number of days prior to admission since antipsychotic medication fill, alcohol abuse, other substance abuse, assignment to a psychiatrist, compliance with appointments since previous admission, homelessness, and number of days in the hospital on previous admission. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report relative statistical relationships between the independent and dependent variables.

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Healthcare professionals undergo demanding academic training. It has been documented that medical students experience significant psychological distress during their academic training. Literature indicates this problem is not unique to medical students in the U.S., psychological distress may be found in medical students worldwide. Pharmacy students also experience challenging academic training. Psychological distress among pharmacy students has received less attention in the literature. Therefore, this study will examine psychological distress in pharmacy students. <bold>Objectives:</bold> For the purpose of this study psychological distress is defined as depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is designed to determine the self-reported prevalence of depression and anxiety, as well as the degree of stress among pharmacy students. Additionally, the study will determine which self-reported methods pharmacy students utilize to cope with psychological distress. Coping methods that will be investigated include the following: treatment from mental health professionals, support from non-professionals, utilization of prescription medications, and utilization of non-pharmacological methods. <bold>Methods:</bold> All pharmacy students enrolled in their third professional year at a private, U.S. university will serve as the sample for the current study (n = 154). This study utilizes survey methodology and each student will receive a consent form and survey. The survey includes standardized instruments for depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Reliability and validity of depression, anxiety, and stress instruments have been established. Content and face validity of the survey was assessed by experts in health outcomes research and psychiatry. The study has received IRB approval. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Reported outcomes will include the prevalence of depression and anxiety, and degree of stress among pharmacy students. These outcomes will be compared to the prevalence of depression and anxiety, and the degree of stress among the general population. Additionally, self-reported methods of coping with depression, anxiety, and stress will be reported. Demographic information will also be collected and reported. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and t-tests will be utilized to analyze the data.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a non-inflammatory chronic persistent pain disorder. The worldwide prevalence of FMS is estimated to be 0.5%-5%. It has been reported to affect more than 5 million people in the United States (U.S.), with the prevalence being between 2%-5% in adults. The unknown etiology, multitude of symptoms, high resemblance with other disorders, and lack of physiological manifestations present challenges in the diagnosis of this disorder. Adding to this challenge the literature also documents the discouragement, rejection, suspicion, negative profiling, and stigma faced by these patients during their encounters with health care professionals and society. Few studies in the U.S. have described and investigated how the Quality of Life (QOL) of FMS patients’ is impacted by perceptions of physician attitudes, trust in physicians, perceptions of medical professionals, and treatment effectiveness. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The objectives of this study will be: 1.) To assess the differences in the self-reported QOL of FMS patients based on type of treatment (prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, non-pharmacologic treatments, and the combination of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments). 2.) To predict the self-reported QOL of FMS patients based on patient perceptions of physician attitudes, patients’ trust in physicians, patients’ perceptions of medical professionals, treatment-effectiveness, and demographics. <bold>Methods:</bold> This study utilizes web-based survey methodology. All members of the National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association (NFMCPA) will serve as the sample for the current study. Current membership is approximately 125,000. An invitation to participate in the study and a link to the survey created utilizing Qualtrics<sup>®</sup> software will be included in the NFMCPA’s monthly e-mail newsletter. Content validity of the survey was assessed, by researchers in FMS, during the development of the survey. A pilot study was completed to evaluate the clarity of the survey instrument. Based on the findings of the pilot study minor changes to the content of the survey were made. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Outcomes will include FMS patients’ self-reported perceptions of physician attitudes, trust in physicians, perceptions of medical professionals, treatment effectiveness, and QOL. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and regression analysis will be utilized to analyze the data.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> One-on-one pharmacist led medication counseling may be the ideal modality to provide inpatient medication education. Patients admitted to inpatient behavioral health units are often prescribed psychiatric medications, undergo multiple medication changes, and may experience side effects. Patients may have questions or concerns about medications early in their hospitalization and could greatly benefit from pharmacist counseling and intervention. Unfortunately, patient dissatisfaction with medication information is prevalent in the behavioral health patient population. It can affect attitudes about medications and compliance, two important predictors of mental health stabilization. Large group-based education is helpful at disseminating information in a time efficient manner. However, concerns regarding patient privacy, possible disruptions, and differing education needs among patients may limit its usefulness. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Determine the impact of pharmacist led medication counseling (including identification of drug therapy problems and patient medication attitudes), 2. Determine the feasibility of pharmacist led medication counseling, 3. Increase patient participation in the medication decision-making process. <bold>Methods:</bold> This single-center, prospective, intervention study includes participants from four of the eleven inpatient behavioral health units at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview. Adult patients, with at least one psychiatric medication, will meet with a pharmacist upon request from the treatment team. The pharmacist will evaluate the patient’s medication regimen and consult with the provider. The pharmacist will educate the patient on each medication, recommend strategies for medication compliance, and address the patient's questions and/or concerns. The pharmacist will also discuss potential therapeutic medication options, determine the patient’s personal therapeutic goals and medication preferences, and assess the patient’s compliance and understanding of his/her medications. The pharmacist will make recommendations incorporating the patient's therapeutic preferences. Patient and physician surveys will be used to assess medication attitudes and satisfaction. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Outcomes remain under investigation, as data collection and analysis are currently ongoing. We will report the number and type of drug therapy problems identified, recommendations made and accepted, and whether or not the accepted recommendations were able to incorporate the patient’s preferences. Data from the patient and provider surveys and pharmacist time and number of patients counseled will be reported.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Purpose:</bold> Student pharmacists represent a group of healthcare professionals at high risk of developing substance use disorders (SUD). The purpose of this research project is to develop the Student Pharmacist Chemical Health Scale (SPCHS), a prevention/early intervention instrument designed to identify individuals at high risk for SUD. <bold>Methods:</bold> Administration of the SPCHS to University of Georgia student pharmacists yielded 393 usable submissions. The SPCHS collected data using Qualtrics computer software and examined demographics, age of first use, family history of addiction/mental illness, current alcohol use, trauma history, impulsivity, negative proscriptions, protective factors, and genetic use patterns. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was used to identify patterns of high-risk alcohol use. <bold>Results:</bold> One hundred thirty-one (33.33%) respondents reported the presence of risk factors which may contribute to the development of a SUD. The mean age of first use for all respondents was approximately 17 years old, but the mean age of first use in individuals who qualified as alcohol dependent was approximately 15 years old. AUDIT scores ≥ 8 suggest the presence of hazardous and harmful alcohol use and potential alcohol dependence. The SPCHS found fifty-one (12.98%) respondents had AUDIT scores of 8-15, and seven (1.78%) respondents had AUDIT scores ≥ 16. When examining family history of 1st or 2nd degree relatives, one hundred sixty-nine (43.00%) respondents reported a family history of alcohol or substance abuse, and one hundred thirty-nine (35.37%) respondents reported a family history of psychiatric illness. <bold>Conclusion and Future Directions:</bold> This project is currently being expanded to include other colleges of pharmacy. Predictive tools like the SPCHS may be implemented as part of large-scale alcohol and drug education and intervention programs. The ability to effectively screen and detect individuals at increased risk for developing SUD could be used in early screenings to combat addiction by means of prevention and early intervention.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Half of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) Veterans with mental health problems receive a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Symptoms include reexperiencing the event, avoidance of stimuli, and hyperarousal. Many Veterans fail to adhere to medication treatment and the reasons are unclear. <bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of this study is to determine risk factors for treatment non-compliance in OEF/OIF Veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) being treated at the PTSD Medication Management Clinic at Veterans Administration Western New York Healthcare System in Buffalo, NY. <bold>Methods:</bold> This IRB approved study is a retrospective cohort chart review of Veterans with PTSD treated in the PTSD Medication Management Clinic for at least two months between January 2010 and June 2012. A chart review is being done to identify patients compliant with therapy, the dependent variable, defined as keeping at least 75% of appointments. The noncompliant group consists of patients treated in the clinic for at least 2 months who kept less than 75% of their appointments. The chart review will identify independent variables including the number of medications prescribed in the first 30 days of treatment as well as the type of medications prescribed. Other patient factors being identified include: age, sex, number of scheduled appointments in the first 2 months of treatment, alcohol use, substance abuse, presence of traumatic brain injury, homelessness, marital status, employment, enrollment in school, and professional counseling. CART (Classification and Regression Tree) analysis will be used to look for relationships between the dependent and independent variables with significance accepted at p&lt;0.05. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> The cohorts have been identified and data collection is underway with results pending.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Antipsychotic polypharmacy refers to the co-prescription of more than one antipsychotic drug for greater than 60 days for an individual patient. In some clinical settings, the prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder could exceed over 50%; however, there is extensive literature demonstrating greater risk than benefit for routine clinical practice. In most evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia, combined antipsychotic therapy should only be considered as a last resort in patients with treatment-resistant illness. While few patients may benefit from antipsychotic polypharmacy, the use of multiple antipsychotic medications can increase the risk of adverse effects and treatment failure. <bold>Objective:</bold> To identify and compare the prevalence of patients receiving scheduled prolonged (&gt;60 days) dual antipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in the Temple Mental Health pharmacist medication management clinic versus a psychiatrist managed clinic. <bold>Design:</bold> Retrospective analysis. <bold>Methods:</bold> Patients receiving dual antipsychotic therapy that are enrolled in the Temple Mental Health pharmacist medication management clinic or a psychiatrist managed clinic from January 1, 1999 through fiscal year 2012 will be analyzed. A chart review will be performed for study participants who meet inclusion criteria to determine patient demographics (age, gender, race) and past psychiatric history (other Axis 1 diagnosis excluding Bipolar spectrum disorders, and Axis 2 diagnoses). Current outpatient psychiatric medications, antipsychotic initiation and discontinuation dates, and days on dual antipsychotic therapy will also be obtained. Descriptive statistics will be reported for patient and prescribing characteristics overall and by clinic. Bivariate analyses entailing Chi-square analyses, significance alpha level of 0.05, will assess patient and prescribing differences among the clinics. The study has an 82% power. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> We will report the prevalence of patients receiving scheduled prolonged (&gt;60 days) dual antipsychotic therapy for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in the Temple Mental Health pharmacist medication management clinic versus a psychiatrist managed clinic.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Work in Progress. <bold>Background:</bold> Substance abuse is a key concern among military personnel and veterans. Buprenorphine/naloxone is an effective opioid replacement treatment option for opioid dependence when used as part of a comprehensive treatment program. Providers who prescribe buprenorphine/naloxone must receive specific training and obtain a DEA number allowing them to write for this medication. The San Diego Veterans Affairs (SDVA) healthcare system started using buprenorphine/naloxone in January 2010. The facility also offers comprehensive psychosocial rehabilitation treatment through its Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program (ADTP) at the same physical location where patients receive their opiate medication management. This study will determine how successful the use of buprenorphine/naloxone for opiate replacement has been as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program at this facility. <bold>Objectives:</bold> 1. Compare retention rate and percentage of opiate-negative urine samples of buprenorphine/naloxone treatment at this facility to rates described in the literature. 2. Describe different treatment settings in which patients receive buprenorphine/naloxone at the SDVA. <bold>Methods:</bold> This will be a retrospective chart review. Patients included will be &gt;18 years of age with a prescription for buprenorphine/naloxone from 1/1/2010-12/31/2012 for opioid replacement therapy and will be followed in buprenorphine/naloxone clinic (either individual or group) for at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria will be patients prescribed buprenorphine/naloxone for any purpose other than opioid replacement therapy such as acute opioid withdrawal or pain, patients in buprenorphine/naloxone group &lt;3 months (enrolled after 9/30/12) and patients whose opioid replacement therapy was co-managed by a provider outside of the San Diego VA program. <bold>Outcomes:</bold> Retention in treatment is defined as the percentage of patients who continue to receive buprenorphine/naloxone. Opiate negative urine samples will be determined as a percentage of all urine samples. Urine samples positive for opiates, oxycodone or methadone will count as positive. Missing urine samples will count as positive. Urine samples from date of enrollment into buprenorphine/naloxone treatment and up to one year after will be included. Both percentage retention in treatment and percentage of negative urine samples will be compared to a weighted mean of percentages described in the literature using Pearson’s Chi-square test. <bold>Results and Conclusion:</bold> Results will be presented.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are affecting a growing number of people. Several medications are implicated in contributing to cognitive problems. Older adults with memory impairments have a large prevalence of polypharmacy and are at high risk of medication-related problems. Clinical pharmacists have the opportunity to improve the safe and appropriate use of medications in elderly patients with memory impairments. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> The clinical pharmacist in the Memory Clinic provides patient-centered care in an interdisciplinary team at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, a non-profit integrated health care delivery system. The care model team is comprised of geriatric psychiatrists, a geriatrician, a nurse practitioner, licensed clinical social workers, a clinical pharmacist, and support staff. Our common goal is to provide patients with dementia and their caregivers with a comprehensive care plan. The clinical pharmacy specialist performs a detailed review of medications prior to the initial memory clinic presentation. The medication review identifies possible drug-related causes of impaired cognition. When appropriate, the pharmacist suggests alternative treatments and provides general geriatric recommendations. Patients undergo extensive neuropsychological testing, physical exam, lab, and radiology assessment during the visit and social workers meet with families for a psychosocial assessment. Findings and care plan are discussed during interdisciplinary team rounds. Diagnosis and recommendations are presented and resources are provided at the follow-up appointment. The primary care provider is notified of the results and will continue to manage the patient’s care. <bold>Impact on Patient Care/Institution:</bold> The clinical pharmacist has been a member of the team since August 2011. The goals of the clinical pharmacist include promoting the safe and effective use of medications for memory, improving safety and management of behaviors in dementia, and enhancing the care experience for patients. Outcomes related to these goals will be presented. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Older patients with memory impairment are at high risk for medication-related problems. The clinical pharmacist in a Memory Clinic has a unique opportunity to help preserve quality of life and avoid adverse medication-related events for patients. The clinical pharmacist provides important consultative and educational services to patients, the Memory Clinic team, and other health care providers.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Approximately 19 million individuals in the United States are diagnosed with a substance use disorder (SUD), including many veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The prevalence of SUD within the veteran population has been steadily increasing, resulting in increased utilization of substance abuse services, such as buprenorphine programs for opioid dependence. As this population grows, there is an increased need for multidisciplinary services. Clinical psychiatric pharmacists do not have prescriptive authority for buprenorphine, but can play a vital role in outpatient buprenorphine programs. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> The clinical psychiatric pharmacist is involved in many aspects of the outpatient buprenorphine program. There are over 100 patients enrolled in the buprenorphine program at the White River Junction VAMC. The clinical pharmacist devotes approximately 10 hours per week to the program, which includes dispensing the medication, monitoring lab values and patient counseling. A spreadsheet is maintained and updated weekly to monitor doses, refill dates and urine toxicology results. Some patients, who struggle with buprenorphine overuse, are provided a locked medication dispenser, which is refilled and locked by the clinical pharmacist. The clinical pharmacist is also involved in the dispensing process in the outpatient pharmacy; this allows for open communication between the clinical pharmacist and patient. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> The clinical psychiatric pharmacist has been involved in the outpatient buprenorphine program at the White River Junction VAMC for approximately eighteen months. Prior to this, the program included less than 100 patients, pharmacy wait times were over sixty minutes, early refills were frequent and no patients utilized a locked medication dispenser. Since clinical pharmacy involvement, the pharmacy wait time is approximately 30 minutes or less, early refills are infrequent and five patients receive their buprenorphine in a locked medication dispenser. The clinical pharmacist has helped open the lines of communication between the patient, the pharmacy and the prescriber. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Substance use disorder programs, such as buprenorphine programs, can benefit from clinical pharmacy involvement. Even with limited prescriptive authority, clinical psychiatric pharmacists can play an important and active role in outpatient buprenorphine programs.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> According to the CDC, 46% of individuals 6 months of age or older received an influenza vaccine during the 2011-2012 flu season. Many barriers were identified by patients in a survey conducted the previous flu season at the community mental health center including being unaware of where to obtain a flu vaccine. In this survey, less than one-fourth of patients were vaccinated against the flu. No published literature exists documenting the development of a pharmacist-run flu clinic in a mental health center. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> Based on survey results previously presented at the CPNP meeting, a need for increasing the rate of influenza vaccination was identified in our community mental health center. A collaborative practice agreement between the clinical pharmacist and psychiatrist was already in place, but it did not allow for administration of medication. A protocol for administering the influenza vaccine by intramuscular injection was developed. Reimbursement was handled through billing the patient’s insurance carrier. The flu vaccine and materials were obtained through the inpatient pharmacy. The flu clinic ran for 6 weeks during the fall of 2012 and utilized an immunization certified pharmacist and pharmacy students. Posters were placed throughout the mental health center advertising the availability of the flu vaccine and patients were made aware of the availability of the flu vaccine during their visit with clinic providers. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> During the clinic, 33 patients were vaccinated against the flu and the overall rate of flu vaccination in patients surveyed at the mental health center was increased to 34% of patients from 28% the previous year. A post-vaccine survey indicated that all patients were either very satisfied or satisfied with the service provided by the pharmacist and would return for a future vaccination. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> While the overall rate of influenza vaccination at the mental health center was still lower than the national rate, it was increased from the previous year. The number of patients receiving vaccination is dependent on multiple factors and cannot be explained solely by the development of the pharmacist-run flu clinic, but it may be a contributory element.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background/Rationale:</bold> The Center for Drug and Alcohol Programs (CDAP) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) focuses on research and clinical services for substance use disorders. Given the patient population, demand for depot naltrexone has increased, but the CDAP clinics are neither staffed nor structured for medication administration or storage. A previously established pharmacist-run clinic exists at MUSC for the purpose of administering long-acting injectable antipsychotics and monitoring the patients who receive them. With the increasing patient and physician demand, a protocol was developed to allow patients to receive extended-release intramuscular naltrexone in the PharmD clinic. <bold>Description of the Innovative Service:</bold> The collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) protocol developed for extended-release intramuscular naltrexone clearly defines the roles/responsibilities of the referring physicians and collaborating pharmacists. The CDTM protocol specifically outlines the process for pharmacist training, credentialing, and ensuring continued competency; physician referral; patient responsibilities; and pharmacist responsibilities for obtaining informed consent, medication procurement, medication administration, physical assessment, laboratory monitoring, side effect monitoring, and counseling. The protocol applies only to adult outpatients referred by MUSC psychiatrists. <bold>Impact on Patient Care/Institution:</bold> The creation of the CDTM protocol for extended-release intramuscular naltrexone provides a service to patients at MUSC that was previously unavailable. The purpose of the service is to provide continuity of care to patients who require extended-release intramuscular naltrexone, enhance patient care through education, monitoring, and close follow-up, and to reduce adverse events associated with extended-release intramuscular naltrexone. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The extended-release intramuscular naltrexone CDTM protocol has been approved by the Department of Pharmacy Services and CDAP physician representative at MUSC, the pharmacists have been credentialed, and the clinic is in the process of preparing for its first patients.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Mental illnesses are some of the most misunderstood illnesses in society. The actual symptoms and patient experiences are not as well-recognized as other diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes. CPNP Purdue began three years ago with a group of students with a special interest in psychiatric pharmacy. Our goal is to increase the awareness and knowledge of mental illnesses in students and the community and to build a solid foundation of understanding. We work to achieve this by increasing the presence of student pharmacists in the mental health community. <bold>Description:</bold> We are increasing recognition by inviting guest speakers that are experts in their fields to present to students about psychiatric and neurological conditions, as well as initiating a shadowing opportunity in Indianapolis. Some examples of this include a Purdue Medicinal Chemistry professor who will discuss the neurological illness of Parkinson’s disease and his recent research, and a psychiatrist who will speak about medicating psychiatric disorders in children. We also build relationships with people afflicted with mental illnesses by preparing and serving dinners at the day shelter, and doing interactive events with Mental Health America (MHA) of Tippecanoe in Lafayette, Indiana. Student chapter members are building their skills and medical writing and learning to apply their knowledge by writing film reviews for The Mental Health Clinician. These reviews evaluate if the movie portrays mental illnesses appropriately and realistically. CPNP Purdue student members are also writing drug information sheets about top psychiatric drugs for the MHA website. <bold>Impact on Psychiatric Pharmacy:</bold> Our chapter strives to highlight opportunities and discuss them in depth in order to give new student CPNP chapters insight on successes and failures. As one of the founding student chapters, our experiences can be a great source of information for other student chapters. In addition, our continual presence as student pharmacists at MHA Tippecanoe demonstrates our support and provides consumers a positive perception of pharmacists. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> We endeavor to continually expand and improve our CPNP student chapter through increasing involvement on campus and in the community.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. None. <bold>Background:</bold> Health care systems are tasked with providing cost effective care to their patients. With rising costs of prescription medications, the ongoing pharmacoeconomic evaluation of medication utilization is necessary. Opportunities exist for psychiatric pharmacists to proactively evaluate and consult with prescribing providers to convert to cost effective regimens. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> On July 7, 2011 a report within pharmacy software was generated to identify current outpatient aripiprazole prescriptions. The psychiatric pharmacist reviewed this list to identify opportunities for cost savings. Interventions were limited to prescriptions written within the Mental Health service line and included recommendations to convert from multiple to once daily dosing and from doses that required whole tablets to doses that could be achieved through tablet splitting. With prior approval from the prescribing provider, the psychiatric pharmacist evaluated the electronic medical record for appropriateness of conversion to a more cost effective regimen and contacted the Veterans by telephone for further assessment and education. Interventions were documented in the electronic medical record using a templated SOAP note format. In addition, the psychiatric pharmacist provided education to the prescribing provider staff to guide prescriber prescription conversion prior to pharmacist intervention and future prescribing of cost effective aripiprazole dosing. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Psychiatric pharmacist interventions and education resulted in annualized cost avoidance of $100,765.80 through medication adjustment in 36 patients. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Psychiatric pharmacist interventions may provide significant cost avoidance for health care systems, allowing for prudent allocation of economic resources to a Veteran population.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Patients with psychiatric illness are at high risk for relapse when there are gaps in continuity of care. Treatment outcomes achieved during the inpatient stay can quickly be reversed by poorly coordinated care transitions. In particular, barriers to medication access and subsequent non-adherence can result in hospital readmission and increased healthcare costs. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> The Transitions in Care program was initially piloted at our institution in 2008. In 2010, a business plan was developed to support expansion of the program to all units within our 300 bed psychiatric hospital. Our pharmacist-led Transitions in Care team strives to meet the individual needs of our patients by: 1. Performing medication reconciliation for all hospital admissions and discharges to promote safe and accurate medication use 2. Verifying prescription insurance and working collaboratively with treatment team to resolve medication access issues during inpatient stay 3. Processing discharge prescriptions prior to discharge to proactively identify and resolve issues so that medications can be delivered to the inpatient unit 4. Providing patients with a complete medication list and individualized counseling prior to discharge <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> The primary goals of our program are to facilitate care transitions, improve patient outcomes and decrease preventable hospital readmissions. Since 2011, pharmacy has made 16,434 interventions to facilitate the care transitions of 3,592 patients. Discharge medications were provided for 1,072 patients. In 2011, unplanned psychiatric readmissions within 30 days of discharge were 4.2% lower among patients who participated in the Transitions in Care program than those who did not (Transitions 3.6% vs Usual Care 7.8%). Based on the projected reduction in readmissions and adjusting for length of stay, this program is estimated to have avoided up to 3,600 patient days in unplanned readmissions. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Successful implementation of a sustainable, pharmacist-led Transitions in Care program has improved the quality of patient care and resulted in reduced 30 day readmission rates. The program has been well received by healthcare providers and is valued by patients who often request this program.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an evidence-based practice consisting of a multidisciplinary treatment team providing comprehensive psychiatric and rehabilitative services to individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses. Treatment team members include a psychiatrist, nurses, vocational specialists, substance abuse specialists, and peer specialists. Many ACT teams receive funding from the state Department of Mental Health (DMH). In August of 2012, Missouri granted pharmacists the authority to perform Medication Therapy Services (MTS). An MTS-certified pharmacist may initiate, modify and discontinue medications under a medication therapy protocol with a collaborating physician. The state of Missouri also recognizes psychiatric pharmacists as Qualified Mental Health Providers (QMHPs), and client encounters can be billed as medication or consultation services. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> An MTS-certified clinical pharmacist is functioning as a prescriber on a DMH-funded ACT team. The collaborating physician completes initial client intakes and yearly psychiatric evaluations and reviews and co-signs the electronic progress notes of the pharmacist. The pharmacist participates in daily one-hour treatment team meetings and completes an average of four to eight medication assessments per day. Most assessments occur at the client’s place of residence. Home visits are typically 30 to 60 minutes in length and consist of a comprehensive review of psychiatric symptoms, medications, and treatment plan goals. Medication adjustments are completed when appropriate. Specific procedure codes allow for services to be billed at a rate of $34.86 per 15 minutes. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> The concept of a pharmacist as a prescriber on an ACT team is new and not common practice. The clinical value of a pharmacist within ACT was demonstrated in a six month retrospective review of pharmacist interventions published in 2010. A total of 80 recommendations were made involving medication adjustments, labs and adverse events. Having a pharmacist on an ACT team has the potential to significantly decrease medication-related complications and improve treatment adherence. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> ACT is a valuable and essential psychiatric treatment for persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses. This innovative service allows not only for the incorporation of the clinical pharmacist into evidence-based practice, but also provides financial compensation for services provided.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Managing patients with psychiatric illness presents unique challenges to primary care providers. This can be due to a high number of medications, lack of medication knowledge, medication access issues, and side effects, among other factors. Meeting the healthcare needs of patients with mental illness requires expertise in both psychiatric and medical medications. Psychiatric clinical pharmacists are optimally positioned to provide specialized care in this unique practice setting. <bold>Description of Innovative Service:</bold> Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic provides both inpatient and outpatient services to those suffering from mental illness. The addition of three psychiatric clinical pharmacists to the pharmacy department provided the opportunity to increase clinical pharmacy services in the outpatient setting, specifically in the primary care clinic. In October, pharmacists began seeing patients Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. The pharmacist performs allergy and medication reconciliation, evaluates medication adherence and the current medication regimen, and meets with patients one-on-one prior to their appointment in the clinic. Pharmacists identify drug-related problems, and serve as a resource for intensive medication therapy management issues and drug information requests. All interventions are documented in the electronic medical record and in a clinical interventions database. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Between October 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012 clinical pharmacists have seen 125 patients over 146 encounters (84% of all appointments in psychiatric primary care clinic during that time period). Patients seen in the clinic were 22-76 years old (average age: 53 years), primarily male (n = 71, 57%), had an average of 4 chronic disease states including psychiatric diagnoses, and were prescribed an average of 8 medications. During these encounters, pharmacists identified and addressed 44 allergy and adverse drug reaction discrepancies, 92 medication reconciliation interventions, 84 adherence issues, and 67 additional drug-related problems. Additionally, patients received counseling on each issue identified. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In three months, pharmacists made 287 interventions over 146 patient visits in a psychiatric primary care clinic. Pharmacists have been a welcome addition to the healthcare team. Providers have increased confidence that their patients’ medication regimen is appropriate and safe. And more importantly, patients are empowered to actively participate in their medication therapy.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center is a federally qualified health center that provides clinical pharmacy services. Clinical pharmacy services initially centered on collaborative practice agreements targeting diabetes, hypertension and lipid management. With the addition of a faculty member from the school of pharmacy the clinical pharmacy services were expanded to include comprehensive medication reviews for patients on antipsychotic medications. <bold>Description of Innovative Practice:</bold> This program expanded clinical pharmacy services provided to patients at Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center to include comprehensive medication reviews with a focus on antipsychotic medications. This service was offered as part of the health centers partnership with the Patient Safety and Clinical Pharmacy Services Collaborative (PSPC) with support from Acumentra Health. Patients who were prescribed an antipsychotic within the last year were identified through the electronic medical record. The clinical pharmacy technician called identified patients and offered a comprehensive medication review with the psychiatric pharmacist. Patients were instructed to bring in all medications, both prescriptions and over the counter. The psychiatric pharmacist had a 30 minute appointment with each patient to review all medications, including antipsychotics. Documentation included a SOAP note format in the electronic medical record and an updated medication list. Through ongoing work with PSPC adverse drug events and potential adverse drug events were tracked for all patients seen for comprehensive medication reviews. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Comprehensive medication review were completed for patients who are receiving primary care services at the clinic and receiving mental health services as another facility. This assisted in recommending appropriate monitoring for antipsychotic medication and that an accurate medication list was available in the electronic medical record. This expanded service allowed the psychiatric pharmacist to answer patient questions regarding their medications. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Expanding the clinical pharmacy services to provide medication reviews for patient currently prescribed antipsychotics provided an additional service for patients. This service was able to identify potential adverse drug events and updated medication list through medication reconciliation.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background:</bold> University of Southern California (USC) Telehealth provides counseling and psychotherapy through virtual sessions conducted via computers. Services are provided by licensed clinical social workers (LCSWs) and interns of the USC School of Social Work. Over 50% of current clients are prescribed medications for chronic illness, medical, and/or psychiatric issues. Clients have revealed reluctance to address medication issues with the medication prescribers. Therapy providers are not trained to answer clients’ complex medication questions or provide medication education, justifying the need for psychiatric pharmacists to provide consultation and education services. <bold>Description of the Innovative Service:</bold> This pilot program is taking place in the USC Telehealth Services offices. A PGY2 psychiatric pharmacy resident is the primary consultant, supervised by a faculty member in the School of Pharmacy. The pharmacy resident is available to the USC Telehealth clients and staff for at least 4hours/week. Client services are focused on individualized medication education and encouragement to communicate with the medication prescriber. If clients have medication issues and consent to speaking with pharmacy resident, the resident will be introduced to the client with the therapist at the end of the therapy session. Individual follow-up appointments with the pharmacy resident will be scheduled if needed. The pharmacy resident also provides formal pharmacotherapy in-service sessions, conducts medication-focused case discussions, and is available for consultation to USC Telehealth staff. <bold>Impact on Patient Care:</bold> Pharmacy resident services are provided for at least 4 hours weekly between January - March 2013. Client volume served by pharmacy resident will be recorded, as well as barriers to contact for clients with medication issues who do not consent to meeting with pharmacy resident. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> As telehealth services continue to expand, a unique opportunity exists for psychiatric pharmacists to provide services to both clients and mental health providers. The results of this in-progress pilot have high potential for a continued partnership with USC Telehealth and a unique training site for future pharmacy residents.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Innovative Practices. <bold>Background/Rationale:</bold> The Transitions Clinic was developed to provide support for veterans with need for intensive psychiatric care either after inpatient hospitalization or as an alternative to hospitalization. The target population for participation includes veterans with depression who are at high risk for suicide. Pharmacists were invited to participate in this multidisciplinary program to provide education and support to veterans surrounding medication use, as medication non-adherence is often a barrier to recovery. <bold>Description of the Innovative Service:</bold> The Transitions Clinic is a 4-week outpatient program that meets three days per week. Clinic team members include: psychiatrists, social workers, occupational therapists, a peer support specialist, a registered nurse, and a clinical pharmacist. The clinical pharmacist facilitates the Medication Education Group, which is a 50-minute interactive, educational group which covers key areas of medication use including adverse effects, mechanisms of action, the importance of adherence, and strategies for successful maintenance of a medication regimen. It further serves as a forum for patients to gain medication related knowledge and peer support. The goal of the group is to foster medication adherence and improve communication between patients and providers regarding medication use. <bold>Impact on Patient Care/Institution:</bold> Data was analyzed for patients completing the clinic from February 2010 through July 2011 where both pre and post treatment scores were available. Of the 73 veterans with depressive disorders, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) scores decreased by 22.2%, from pre-treatment mean of 33.8 to post-treatment mean of 26.3 (p &lt; 0.0001). For the 69 veterans that completed the Quality of Life Satisfaction Survey (Q-LES-Q) the mean score increased by 12.4%, from 34.9 pre-treatment to 39.2 post-treatment (p = 0.0268). Future analysis is pending to assess changes in medication beliefs/utilization from participating in the Transitions Clinic through assessment of modified Medication Understanding and Use Self-Efficacy Scale (MUSE) scores and self-reported medication adherence. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Veterans who completed the Transitions Clinic program demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms and quality of life. The Transitions Clinic provides a model for successful interdisciplinary collaboration in caring for veterans in an intensive outpatient program.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> The porphyrias are a group of genetic disorders of heme biosynthesis that result from the deficient activity of a certain enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is defined by a prophobilinogen deaminase deficiency and can manifest as neuropsychiatric symptoms during an exacerbation. <bold>Patient History:</bold> The patient is a 55 year old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for AIP, chronic back pain, renal insufficiency, hypertension, and nicotine dependence. The patient has presented to the hospital with multiple AIP exacerbations since diagnosis eleven year prior to the current case; however, he has never displayed neuropsyciatric manifestations. His symptoms on admission included severe gastrointestinal pain and non-bloody emesis. Similar to previous treatment courses, the patient was initiated on panhematin therapy and symptomatic management including antiemetics and opiate pain control. Two days into his hospital admission, he began to display delirium symptoms, including decreased cognition, disorientation, and aggressive behavior. The patient was successfully managed with perphenazine and as needed olanzapine during his inpatient course. Within 48 hours, his cognition normalized and antipsychotics were discontinued prior to hospital discharge. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Psychiatric manifestations of AIP are well documented in literature and the incidence is estimated to be 40-58 percent. Several references that group medications into varying classes of tolerability in patients with AIP are available. These sources were utilized in the management of the patient. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this case of AIP with psychiatric manifestations, the patient was successfully treated with first generation antipsychotics. The medications were well-tolerated and did not appear to exacerbate physical symptoms of AIP.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Clozapine is primarily metabolized via Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 1A2. Knowledge of interactions with clozapine is crucial to prevent psychiatric decompensation or drug toxicity. Notable interactions include 1A2 induction from inhaled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of cigarette smoke and 1A2 inhibition due to concomitant fluvoxamine administration. There is also evidence that infection and/or acute inflammatory processes may decrease CYP450 1A2 activity resulting in clozapine toxicity. <bold>Patient History:</bold> A 43 year-old female was admitted to a medical intensive care unit (MICU) for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Other medical history included schizophrenia, pulmonary hypertension and coronary artery disease. The patient was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure for ventilation and initiated on azithromycin 500 mg intravenously daily as well as systemic steroids. Within 24 hours she was transferred to a general medicine unit. All home medications were continued including a total daily dose of clozapine 450 mg by mouth. Clozapine adherence and dose were confirmed. After the second clozapine dose was administered the patient became unarousable and transferred back to the MICU requiring intubation. With additional symptoms of myoclonus, sialorrhea and hypotension, clozapine toxicity was suspected. Fifteen hours after the last dose of clozapine was administered, serum obtained revealed clozapine and norclozapine levels of 1400 ng/mL and 606 ng/mL, respectively. Toxicity could not be accounted for by drug interactions. While the patient was a smoker, her consumption had been stable for the past year at only 3 cigarettes daily. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A MEDLINE search revealed cases associating infection and/or acute inflammatory processes with clozapine toxicity. It is proposed that various cytokines reduce CYP450 1A2 activity and that up to a 50% reduction of clozapine dose may be needed to minimize toxicity. Also, literature regarding the interaction between clozapine and smoking would suggest that 2 days of cessation from 3 daily cigarettes would not likely result in toxicity requiring intubation. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case adds to the growing literature that infection and/or acute inflammatory processes are associated with increased clozapine levels and clinical toxicity. Clinicians should be aware of this potentially life threatening event.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Clozapine has been described as the best antipsychotic treatment option in several clinical scenarios, including treatment-resistant or refractory schizophrenia. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been advocated as a potentially accurate method to diminish the risk of adverse effects and toxicity and to assess adherence to therapy. A therapeutic range is still up for debate but investigators have concurred that response is observed in trough levels above 350 µg/L and toxicity in levels above 1000 µg/L. Most studies report a positive correlation between clozapine daily dose and serum levels, but a wide inter-individual variation between serum levels within a fixed dose exists. <bold>Patient History:</bold> The patient is a non-smoking 59 year old African American female with a past psychiatric history of paranoid schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and past suicide attempts. Social history was non-contributory. Both of patient’s parents had history of inpatient treatment for mental health. The patient was initiated on clozapine in 2009 after several trials of other antipsychotics with persisting psychotic symptoms. Veteran was titrated up to 400 mg daily with good therapeutic response. All other psychotropic medications were cross tapered over five months. One year later during an inpatient stay for diagnosis of depression, routine monitoring blood work revealed a “critical” clozapine serum level of 1381ng/mL. No clinical signs of toxicity or significant drug-drug interactions were observed. Clozapine dose was tapered to 200 mg daily over the next 3 weeks and patient subsequently discharged. The patient was re-admitted to the acute psychiatric unit three months after discharge for psychotic symptoms including auditory and visual hallucinations, racing thoughts, pressured speech, and paranoia despite treatment adherence. The most recent clozapine serum level prior to admission was 589ng/ml. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A PubMed search revealed one published case report of a patient who decompensated following clozapine dose reduction after a serum level exceeding 1000ng/ml. As there are no specific recommendations for monitoring clozapine serum levels, limited data exists regarding therapeutic range. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Clozapine levels exceeding 1000ng/ml may not be toxic and may be required by some patients for effective symptom management.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Reflex epilepsy is a syndrome in which seizures occur in response to specific sensory stimuli such as visual or auditory triggers, or cognitive tasks performed by the patient. Common seizure-producing stimuli include flashing lights, music, or tasks such as writing or calculation. <bold>Patient History:</bold> The patient is a 28 year old male with new onset of medically intractable seizures. He experiences two types of seizures: one type which consists of right facial twitching and another which presents as violent and aggressive outbursts lasting 5-30 minutes. His past medical history is significant for history of PTSD and heavy marijuana abuse. In spite of high doses of multiple antiepileptic medications, the patient continued to have daily seizures requiring constant physical restraint due to the violent nature of his episodes. Eventually he discovered his seizures could be reliably triggered by strong emotions. Though calm at baseline, emotional responses to seeing a police officer or hearing certain music could consistently precipitate a sudden violent episode. In an attempt to mitigate some of the aggressive episodes related to emotional triggers, the patient was prescribed dronabinol and titrated to a total of 25 mg daily. This regimen decreased the aggressive type seizures to the point that the patient could be discharged. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> While marijuana has shown some anticonvulsant effects, results are mixed and it is not well studied in humans. The main cannabinoids in marijuana are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol, and cannabinol. Dronabinol is a synthetic formulation of THC. Some animal studies suggest that cannabidiol may more effective than THC for seizures, though further studies in humans are needed. <bold>Discussion:</bold> Though not typically considered an anticonvulsant, dronabinol reduced the frequency of aggressive seizure episodes in this patient. It is not clear if dronabinol was acting as an anticonvulsant or simply blunting the patient’s emotional triggers which caused his seizures. Another possibility is that his heavy marijuana use at baseline disrupted his endogenous cannabinoid system enough to initiate his seizure disorder. Emotion-induced reflex epilepsy is rare, but dronabinol may be a reasonable treatment option in this challenging patient population.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Use of supplements as energy boosters and performance enhancers for athletes has been a topic of concern, particularly the potential for supplements to adversely affect cardiovascular (CV) function. Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, the manufacturer of a dietary supplement is charged with ensuring the safety of the product, but no Food and Drug Administration approval is needed. The ingredients of dietary supplements marketed for increased endurance may be associated with a variety of potentially adverse effects on CV function, particularly heart rate and blood pressure. Often little evidence-based research is available to support claims for the ingredients or provide guidance for clinicians regarding potential effects if combinations are used. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> A 17-year old adolescent male presented for a preseason sports physical. Upon physical exam, his blood pressure was 210/120 mm Hg. Lisinopril 10 mg daily was initiated. He was referred to the pediatric hypertension for follow-up. A thorough medication history was done. During the course of the evaluation, the patient acknowledged using performance-enhancing supplements and caffeine-containing drinks in an effort to augment athletic performance. Following discontinuation of the supplements, his hypertension resolved and lisinopril discontinued with no adverse blood pressure consequences. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Literature retrieval was accessed through Ovid, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and PubMed (1965-August 2012) Reports of CV adverse event or CV-related effects, defined as changes in heart rate and/or blood pressure for this case report, were reviewed for individual ingredients in the supplements. Reports of adverse effects were found for nine of the supplement ingredients. Caffeine was a component of five of the nine ingredients. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Clinicians are encouraged to obtain a thorough patient history, including asking specific questions regarding any recent or chronic use of performance-enhancing supplements or energy drinks. The potential for adverse effects from supplements may be under-estimated by users.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> The pharmacokinetic drug interaction of paroxetine and risperidone has been well documented, as both are metabolized via CYP2D6. The addition of low-dose risperidone to paroxetine in the management of chronic depression has also been described in many case reports, with the belief that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions achieve remission of depressive symptoms. <bold>Complete Patient History:</bold> The patient is a 30 year-old Hispanic male with a past medical history significant for asthma, hyperlipidemia and schizophrenia, undifferentiated type. The patient’s social history was noncontributory. The patient was previously stabilized on clozapine but was noncompliant with therapy and laboratory requirements. Because of previous treatment failure with haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate, ziprasidone, olanzapine, divalproex and aripiprazole, the patient was initiated on risperidone oral along with risperidone long-acting injectable and titrated up to 4 mg orally twice daily and 50 mg intramuscularly every two weeks. BPRS scores reduced from 68 to 57 during this titration period. The patient continued to verbalize grandiose, delusions, exhibited poor personal hygiene and was physically assaultive to many peers. Paroxetine 10 mg daily was added to the patient’s regimen to increase risperidone blood concentrations. Over the course of 8 weeks, the patient’s BPRS reduced from 57 to 37, delusions were markedly decreased, there was gradual improvement in self-care and no aggressive or assaultive behaviors were documented. The patient was discharged from long-term psychiatric care two weeks later. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A MEDLINE search revealed no published case reports of paroxetine-boosted risperidone levels for the management of schizophrenia. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this case report, the addition of paroxetine 10 mg daily to risperidone 4 mg orally twice daily and risperidone long-acting injectable 50 mg intramuscularly every two weeks decreased BPRS scores, reduced aggression, violence and delusions, and improved the patient’s personal hygiene. Paroxetine was specifically selected because of the pharmacokinetic drug interactions (via CYP2D6) that would increase risperidone blood concentrations. The addition of paroxetine may be a viable option if the patient is experiencing partial response from risperidone therapy.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Pisa syndrome, or pleurothotonus, is an uncommon dystonia in which patients present with tonic lateral flexion of the trunk. Often reported as a side effect to antipsychotics, literature has also described Pisa syndrome as a side effect of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors. <bold>Case Presentation and Discussion:</bold> We describe a 67 year old man with schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease who developed Pisa syndrome after receiving treatment with two antipsychotics. The patient was admitted to the hospital psychiatric unit due to aggressive behaviors and was being treated with quetiapine at maximum dose (800 mg/day), trazodone at bedtime, melatonin in the evening, simvastatin for hyperlipidemia and temazepam at bedtime as needed. His remote medication history is notable for an intolerance and poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Upon admission, he became increasingly aggressive and after a physical altercation with another patient, he received a low dose of oral risperidone (0.5 mg), repeated 18 hours later for persistent aggression. Six hours after the second dose of oral risperidone, he presented with worsening akathisia and significant trunkal flexion. Diphenhydramine was administered orally, followed by 00 intramuscularly, and all psychotropic medications were held. The symptoms of Pisa syndrome disappeared within hours and upon reinitiation of oral quetiapine (600 mg/day) the following day, symptoms did not reoccur. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case describes an uncommon side effect likely due to treatment with two antipsychotics. The patient was treated with maximum approved doses of quetiapine without report dystonias, therefore the administration of risperidone for breakthrough aggression is suspected to have caused this unusual side effect. Pisa syndrome is not commonly described in the literature and few case reports are documented in patients receiving two antipsychotics.</p>

<p>
<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Mirtazapine has been studied as an augmentation strategy to enhance clozapine’s effects on negative symptoms of patients with chronic schizophrenia. Mirtazapine has commonly been thought to be safe, well tolerated and void of interactions. The following presentation is a case report of a patient with toxic levels of clozapine. After discontinuation of mirtazapine the clozapine and norclozapine levels returned to expected levels. <bold>Patient History:</bold> A 62-year-old Caucasian male, non-smoker, with a history of schizoaffective disorder was admitted to the Psychiatric Medical Unit after becoming confused. Three days prior to his presentation, his serum clozapine level was found to be elevated and subsequently his clozapine was held. Initially, he presented as agitated and aggressive, and then progressed to catatonic. He was responding to internal stimuli and auditory hallucinations. Prior to admission his medications included: acetaminophen, albuterol, atenolol, benztropine, budesonide, clozapine, docusate, ferrous sulfate, gemfibrozil, glipizide, lorazepam, metformin, mirtazapine and oxybutynin. The serum concentration levels for clozapine/norclozapine prior to admission were 1,067ng/ml and 1.019ng/ml (0.96 ratio) and when the medication was held 308ng/ml and 837ng/ml (2.72 ratio). Clozapine was restarted and mirtazapine was stopped; when the patient reached half of his prior dose of clozapine, levels were obtained; 176mcg and 99ng/ml (0.56 ratio). The complete workup found no other acute illness. Presently another level is pending. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Using mirtazapine to augment clozapine; recognizing mirtazapine is metabolized by CYP 3A4, 2D6, and 1A2 with clozapine metabolism occurring via isoenzymes CYP 1A2, 3A4, and 2C19 Data supports this augmentation with validation (SANS, PANSS and BPRS scores) of improved cognition. Unfortunately, relevant articles do not provide serum concentrations of clozapine during augmentation with mirtazapine. Clozapine levels are a useful tool in treatment because of clozapine’s inter-patient variability. Clozapine levels also help monitor toxicity, and adherence. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> There is no current literature demonstrating an interaction between mirtazapine and clozapine. This case possibly demonstrates a cytochrome or protein binding displacement interaction between mirtazapine and clozapine. Therefore, it is hypothesized that an interaction may have occurred in this patient. A retrospective review of patients taking a combination of clozapine and mirtazapine could further clarify this interaction.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with both first and second generation antipsychotics and other medications with dopaminergic activity. The etiology is poorly understood. Risk factors, such as a recent initiation or dose increase of an antipsychotic medication, dehydration, or genetic susceptibility may increase this potential. The differentiation between the diagnoses of NMS, substance use, serotonin syndrome, or hyperthermia, includes laboratory and clinical presentation characteristics. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient, a 34-year old Caucasian man, was found unconscious on his front porch by emergency services after an anonymous call. Upon presentation to the emergency department, he had a temperature of 107.5°F (41.9°C) and a Glasgow Coma Scale rating of 3 (range: 3-15). Fluids were administered and cooling blankets applied. He was empirically treated for bacterial meningitis although the lumbar puncture was negative and admitted to the intensive care unit. Supportive measures decreased his temperature to 101.7°F (38.7°C). Arterial blood gas, comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and cardiac risk panel results were within normal limits; the urinalysis, urine drug screen, and serum drug screen were negative. Follow-up indicated discharge from a forensic unit one day prior to presentation. The medication list included benztropine, citalopram, chlorpromazine, divalproex, haloperidol, and hydroxyzine. Based on the medication discharge list and clinical presentation, the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale was applied. The criteria scoring indicated a probable relationship (8 of 12) between the use of antipsychotics, dopaminergic agents, and symptoms consistent with NMS. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> Case reports and review articles related to NMS and antipsychotic agent usage were found and evaluated. The potential contribution of highly anticholinergic agents was researched. Additional information on comorbidities and risk factors in patients with a psychiatric diagnosis were reviewed. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Psychiatric patients may be more at risk for medication-related adverse effects, such as NMS. Primary care physicians may not be fully aware of the potential severity for this medication-related effect, particularly in patients with multiple risk factors.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> Research suggests testosterone may be effective as an antidepressant-augmentation strategy in men with low testosterone levels and who are only partially responsive to antidepressants. No formal guidelines exist for the use of testosterone in such individuals. <bold>Review of the Literature:</bold> A PubMed search revealed limited RCTs with inconsistent results, possibly influenced by differences in patient population and route of administration. A recent meta-analysis of 7 studies showed a significant positive effect of testosterone replacement in depressed men, but results varied depending on administration route. <bold>Patient History:</bold> The patient is a 40 year old Caucasian male with history of chronic depression committed after a recent overdose. He claimed he has been suicidal for years with symptoms of low energy, frequent crying, hopelessness, and a non-existent sex drive. The patient has had several psychiatric admissions in the last 5 years and multiple medication trials. Medical co-morbidities include chronic back pain and hypogonadism. A baseline testosterone level was subtherapeutic at 176 ng/dL (348-1197 ng/dL). Initial attempts were made to optimize the patient's antidepressant regimen but depressive symptoms persisted. Due to his report of past response to testosterone replacement, Endocrinology was consulted at Week 3, and Testosterone 1% gel 5 g daily was initiated. A testosterone level at Week 7 was still low (260 ng/dL), resulting in a dose increase to 7.5 g daily. On Week 8, the level had unexpectedly decreased to 187 ng/dL, which resulted in a change to Testosterone cypionate 200 mg IM Q 2 weeks to avoid poor absorption. Testosterone levels at Weeks 11 and 13 were in the normal range (830 and 911 ng/dL, respectively). By week 17, after 6 weeks of therapeutic levels, the patient's intrusive thoughts of suicide and endorsements of unchanged mood persisted. Due to his refractory symptoms, ECT has been pursued. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite achieving therapeutic testosterone levels for 6 weeks, a trial duration consistent with clinical studies, our patient did not achieve a significant improvement in mood. Our case demonstrates absorption variability among formulations and affirms observations noted in the literature suggesting idiosyncratic responses to testosterone, with occasional cases of marked response and many others showing none.</p>

<bold>Abstract Type:</bold> Therapeutic Case Report. <bold>Background:</bold> First-line therapy for persons with a diagnosis of a severe mental illness with psychotic features is treatment with antipsychotics. Antipsychotics work by antagonizing different dopamine receptors in the brain, particularly the D2 receptors, and can contribute to various side effects. One of the more problematic effects is hyperprolactinemia. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, have been used to treat hyperprolactinemia. One of the potential consequences of using a dopamine agonist, however, is decompensation, defined as changes in mood or worsening of symptoms of psychosis. <bold>Patient-History:</bold> The patient is a 53-year-old Caucasian male with a Bipolar I Disorder diagnosis treated with risperidone and quetiapine. A prolactin level of 49.0 (reference range 2.0-18.0 ng/mL) was obtained in December 2010; he was diagnosed with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia following complaints of erectile dysfunction and problems with ejaculation, both symptoms of elevated prolactin levels. Bromocriptine was started April 2011 and slowly titrated to a total daily dose of 15 mg, administered as 7.5 mg twice daily. The patient was monitored for signs of worsening mood and psychosis. In June 2012 the prolactin level was lower (32.4 ng/mL). He reported erections improved but still experiences some difficulty with ejaculation. To date, bromocriptine use has not been associated with changes in mood or psychosis. <bold>Review of Literature:</bold> A MEDLINE search revealed one case report, three case series, one randomized placebo-controlled trial, and one randomized crossover study with an herbal product using bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia. Strategies for hyperprolactinemia management were reviewed. These include (1) letting the issue resolve on its own, (2) adding a dopamine agonist, (3) adding a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic, or (4) switching from current drug therapy to a prolactin-sparing agent. Antipsychotics considered to be prolactin-sparing include clozapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report a case of a patient with diagnoses of Bipolar I Disorder diagnosis and antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. Treatment with bromocriptine decreased prolactin levels and improved symptoms of erectile dysfunction without precipitation of psychosis or worsening of mood.</p>
