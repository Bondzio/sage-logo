<p><italic>The Journey and Promise of African American Preaching</italic></p>
<p>Kenyatta R. Gilbert</p>
<p>Minneapolis: Fortress, 2011. 170 pp. $20.00</p>
<p>With this timely work, Kenyatta Gilbert makes a tremendous contribution to homiletics in general. More specifically, using a practical theological framework, he makes an even greater contribution to African American homiletics in particular. Throughout the book, readers can sense that Gilbert is not simply engaging in an academic exercise as he entreats his readers to adopt his holistic, trivocal model for preaching. He speaks from the perspective of a son of African American churches who is deeply ingrained in the tradition while simultaneously being deeply invested in the future of an institution that has to meet tremendous challenges in the years to come.</p>
<p>Gilbert starts his work by lamenting the general state of Black preaching and the plethora of concerns that twenty-first century preaching must address, such as: “high incarceration rates, father absenteeism, unwed and teenage pregnancy, domestic abuse and violence, high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, high foreclosure rates, homelessness, joblessness, job discrimination, unaffordable health care and unscrupulous pay-day lending.” Gilbert admonishes preachers to speak to the needs of the people by preaching trivocally (holistically) to every aspect of African American life. By trivocal preaching, he means preaching with three distinct voices: the priestly, the prophetic, and the sagely. The priestly voice attends to the spiritual formation of the worshipping community by encouraging daily prayer, Bible study, and holy living. The sagely voice is the voice of wisdom that remembers the community’s past and uses those memories as lenses through which to interpret the future. The prophetic voice is a call for justice through which the preacher risks rejection and ridicule by speaking the truth to power. Gilbert contends that for African American churches to thrive in the twenty-first century and beyond, the preacher must employ each of these voices.</p>
<p>To make his case for the need for trivocal preaching, Gilbert provides a brief and well-researched overview of African American preaching from the beginning of the West African-North American slave trade to the Civil Rights movement. He is careful to note that throughout the history of African American preaching there have been many different purposes of preaching, such as: seeking justice; building self-esteem and community; resisting racism/injustice; and encouraging holy living. He is also clear that the many purposes of preaching reflect the diversity of needs that have arisen in African American communities throughout the history of Africans in America.</p>
<p>Gilbert adeptly delineates the strengths and shortcomings of contemporary practical theological perspectives of Matthew Lamb (experientially oriented and focused on the struggle for liberation against oppression and suffering) and James Loder (theologically oriented and claiming that humans should strive to emulate God’s nature and actions). Each of these theorists contributes greatly to furthering the development of a practical theology for African American congregations. However, since they are more theoretically than contextually focused, they both fail to take into account the real world experiences of Africans in America. Ultimately, Gilbert relies on the contextually focused theory of Dale Andrews, who contends that African American churches have historically served as places of refuge wherein the community could experience communal care, religious formation, and liberating hope. It is from Andrews that Gilbert gains his understanding of the need for holistic preaching that has priestly, sagely, and prophetic dimensions.</p>
<p>One of the most outstanding and crucial aspects of this work is Gilbert’s practical instruction for developing a trivocal sermon. His approach includes: <italic>exploration</italic> of the rhetorical situation of the recipients of the message and exploration of the biblical text, <italic>clarification</italic> of what God is doing in the biblical text and the world (stating the central claim), <italic>internalization</italic> of message and shaping its form, and <italic>proclamation</italic> of the Word with power. He even creates a quick reference guide for his approach that aids in sermon development. He shares three of his own sermons as examples of trivocal preaching and highlights excerpts from sermons of well-known and well-respected preachers to demonstrate each of the voices of trivocal preaching.</p>
<p>Gilbert successfully argues for the need for trivocal preaching and also offers a theologically sound and practical guide to trivocal sermon development. His book will have a constructive, meaningful, and substantive impact on African American preaching for years to come.</p>
