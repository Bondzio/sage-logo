Despite the increase in the control of ambulatory blood pressure and the improvements in the rest of CVR factors and treatment adherence, interindividual variability of therapeutic response remains like one of the reasons why the control of CVR factors is not attained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013492736">1</xref></sup></p><p>Interindividual variability in drug treatment response depends on two fundamental aspects: environmental factors (including lifestyle) and genetic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013492736">1</xref></sup> There are two tools that help to control these two factors. One is pharmacotherapeutic follow-up (PFU), which identifies environmental factors, drug-related problems, and negative outcomes associated with medication. The other is pharmacogenetics, which provides information on the genetic profile of patients with regard to drug metabolism and efficacy. Research on the genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 has focused on isoenzymes CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 because these are the ones that metabolize most drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2168479013492736">2</xref></sup></p><p>Different phenotypes (fast, normal, semislow, and slow metabolizers) are determined by the presence of intact or mutated alleles, which code for the enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450 proteins. Accordingly, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 allelic variants are associated with poor metabolizers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013492736">3</xref></sup> and carriers of CYP3A4*1B had a significantly lower activity than those with CYP3A4*1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2168479013492736">4</xref></sup> The existence of these genetic variants has several clinical implications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013492736">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2168479013492736">6</xref></sup> The difference in the ability to metabolize drugs means that in general, slow metabolizers are at a higher risk of developing adverse effects to a drug used at standard dosage because they have higher drug concentrations in the blood than normal metabolizers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2168479013492736">5</xref></sup> In these cases, dose reduction is one option when seeking to reduce the toxic effects of a drug. On the contrary, fast metabolizers may have a lower drug concentration in the blood when taking standard drug dosages compared with normal metabolizers.</p><p>Although community pharmacies are the health facility that is closest to patients, and where most drugs are dispensed, no pharmacogenetic studies have been conducted to date at these pharmacies. The aim of this study was to determine whether pharmacogenetics and PFU can be implemented in community pharmacies and whether these two factors might contribute to improving treatment efficacy and safety and to selecting the most suitable drug.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2168479013492736" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="section3-2168479013492736"><title>Design and Patients</title><p>A prospective cohort study was carried out to compare the clinical outcomes of a group of hypertensive patients receiving PFU, according to genotyping for variant alleles *2 and *3 in the CYP2C9 gene and *1B in the CYP3A4 gene. The study was conducted over 6 months at a single community pharmacy in a peripheral neighborhood area in Cartagena, Spain. The 2 pharmacists participating in the study were trained in PFU through completion of a specific master’s degree in pharmaceutical care from the University of Granada, Spain.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were all hypertensive patients treated with antihypertensive drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 (losartan, irbesartan, carvedilol) and CYP3A4 isoenzymes (bisoprolol, lercanidipine, verapamil, diltiazem, enalapril, amlodipine, enalapril, felodipine, nifedipine), who went to collect their medication at the community pharmacy during the study period and who participated voluntarily in the study by signing an informed consent form.

This assessment is used to identify (1) any potential or actual patient health outcomes that are not consistent with the objectives of pharmacotherapy and are associated with the use of medicines (negative outcomes associated with medication [NOMs]) and (2) situations in which the use of medicines caused or may cause the appearance of an NOM (drug-related problems).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2168479013492736">10</xref></sup> Once the relevant problems were identified, the necessary interventions to patients or to physicians were carried out to solve the identified NOM and were followed by a subsequent assessment of the achieved outcomes. A decision was made whether to intervene in the NOM, either directly through the patient or through the pharmacist-patient-doctor route, with an open letter handed to the patient who then delivered it to his or her doctor. A pharmacist intervention was considered as accepted when the physician took into account the pharmacist’s recommendation and was considered as negative when the health problem could not be solved.

After pharmacists’ intervention, the abnormal increase in systolic blood pressure was reduced in all of these cases.</p><p>We observed that patients who were heterozygous for the CYP2C9*2 variant allele showed a tendency toward less efficacy-related problems than the corresponding normal homozygous patients (44.4% vs 78.9%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .072). This might be because the CYP2C9*2 allele is associated with a slow metabolizer phenotype,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2168479013492736">3</xref></sup> and therefore, the drug dosage that actually acts in this patient group is higher than normal.</p><p>Most NOMs were related to dose-dependent efficacy. This may be associated with the fact that 50% of the drugs were not appropriately prescribed if we consider the patient’s genotype.</p><p>A significant limitation of our study is the small population size. Although the service was offered free of charge to all hypertensive patients, only 37 agreed to participate. This may be explained by outpatients ignoring the importance of drug therapy monitoring or because society is not aware that one of the functions of community pharmacists is to be responsible for drug needs, efficacy, and safety. We believe that this type of study can contribute to change patients’ attitudes to community pharmacists. Although DNA extraction and genotype determination were performed in 3 hours, another limitation of the study was that, due to methodological issues, the pharmacogenetic tests were not performed until all patients were recruited, and therefore, no genotype-based intervention could be carried out. This study should be regarded as the first demonstrating that pharmaceutical follow-up and pharmacogenetics can be developed from the community pharmacy. The next step would be to intervene according to the patient genotype, but this implies the constitution of the multidisciplinary process in which the involvement of the physician, who has to know how to interpret genetic information, is of crucial importance. Future studies with randomized cohorts of patients will be needed to demonstrate the utility of genotype-based prescription in this scenario.</p><p>In conclusion, in addition to PFU, pharmacogenetics can be used in community pharmacies to carry out a more exhaustive study of medication in outpatients. The allelic variants of CYP2C9, unlike CYP3A4*1B, appear to lead to more efficacy-related NOMs, although this has to be confirmed in independent series with larger sample sizes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Granada University, Spain, for supporting this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"
