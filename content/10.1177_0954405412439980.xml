<abstract>
<p>The lost foam casting process for the manufacture of press dies has attracted a lot of attention because of various advantages, such as the small number of processes involved and the reduction in the cost of die production. In a recent study, tensile tests were conducted to analyze the casting defects of ductile cast iron, study the wear of as-cast and heated cast iron, and investigate the use of AISI H13 as a tool material for die casting. However, the most commonly used material for hot press forming is the forged tool steel AISI H13, which has excellent thermal resistance. In spite of the abovementioned advantages of die materials fabricated by lost foam casting, which arise from the near net shape design of the die, no study has been conducted on the use of the heat-treated H13 cast material for hot press forming dies. In this study, impact, machinability, tensile, and wear tests were conducted at high temperatures, and the properties of the heat-treated H13 cast material and the heat-treated H13 forged material were compared.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Press dies for sheet metal forming have been made from materials fabricated by the lost foam casting process. The manufacturing costs can be reduced by this process, which involves near net shape technology, because of the minimal separate surface finishing and cooling hole machining required. In addition, in a comparison of the hot ductile fracture characteristics of two types of dies, it was found that heat check formation in a mold fabricated with the casting process was lower than in that fabricated by the forging process. Therefore, the lifetime of a tool can be improved in the case of a mold fabricated by the casting process.</p>
<p>Recently, high oil prices and environmental regulations have led to a great demand for materials, like high-strength steel (HSS), to be used in lighter, more reliable cars. HSS is a type of alloy steel that provides better mechanical properties (such as strength and toughness) than carbon steel. This steel is used to manufacture core automobile components, such as bumpers and side sills, which require high levels of toughness. For the forming of HSS into an arbitrary shape, the material should be inserted in the die set after being heated to a high temperature. For this reason, HSS cannot normally be manufactured using cast dies, which are usually used at room temperature. Therefore, forged dies manufactured with AISI H13, which is a tool steel designed for hot working, are used in the automobile industry. Also, the increased awareness of environmental issues has led to the emergence of the hot press forming process as a technology for the production of automotive parts.</p>
<p>Turetta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954405412439980">1</xref></sup> reported that the forming process contributes to the strength increase of sheet metal by transforming its austenite microstructure into a martensite microstructure through rapid cooling. Mori et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954405412439980">2</xref></sup> showed that this process also results in decreased spring-back and excellent formability at high temperatures. Since the 1990s, the forming process has been used for automotive parts, such as bumpers and door impact beams, and the application of these parts has become more and more widespread.</p>
<p>As shown in the abovementioned research, dies for hot press forming are fabricated with forged AISI H13 material because of its high life span, dimensional stability, and abrasion resistance. However, its poor machinability greatly increases the manufacturing time and cost because of the complexity of the machining process. In addition, large dies have to be manufactured in several parts in order to cut the cooling channels. Therefore, if the properties of a press die manufactured by the casting process can be improved enough to make them comparable with those of a die manufactured by the forging process with heat treatment, there may be great reductions in costs and manufacturing times. Furthermore, the separate cutting of cooling channels would not be required. Various studies related to such cast materials have been carried out.</p>
<p>It was found that the tensile strength, investigated by Nilsson and Vokál,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954405412439980">3</xref></sup> and hardness, analyzed by Ma et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954405412439980">4</xref></sup> of a heat-treated ferrous casting mold are similar to those of a die made of material fabricated by the forging process. However, the properties related to elongation and impact are somewhat deteriorated because the casting mold material is relatively brittle and has fine porosity. Islam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954405412439980">5</xref></sup> observed that the solid solution of carbide in the cast microstructure is not homogeneous, so heat treatment for this solid solution can be performed during the preheating stage. In addition, with the aim of finding alternatives, various studies have been carried out on the manufacture of aluminum cast molds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954405412439980">6</xref></sup> and their thermal properties,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954405412439980">7</xref></sup> and analytical simulations have been performed for AISI H13 cast molds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954405412439980">8</xref></sup> These studies also showed the possibility of the improvement of formability. The research reported so far has focused on dies used for die-casting as well as casting processes, and studies on the effects of the heat-transfer coefficient on the time and pressure have been performed by Kim and Kang.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954405412439980">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, no studies have yet been reported on hot press forming dies or heat-treated dies made with H13 fabricated by the casting process. Therefore, in this study, the properties of forged and cast materials are compared in the context of the heat-treatment conditions. In addition, mechanical properties such as thermal shock, machinability, tensile strength, and wear are investigated at high temperatures. On the basis of the results, the possibility of replacing forged materials with cast materials is proposed.</p>

<p>Metal with a temperature between 1580 °C and 1650 °C was poured into the lost-foam sand mold using a ladle with a W-block shape, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954405412439980">Figure 1(a)</xref>. Dust and impurities on the fabricated W-block were removed using a shot-blasting machine.

As shown in this figure, the W-block had the standard dimensions for steel casting, called ASTM A-703. This standard prevents mass effects from changing the microstructure and mechanical properties according to size, and stops the side effects of the product cooling rate from being dependent on the product’s appearance or location.</p>

<title>High-temperature wear test</title>
<p>Generally, wear is defined as the loss of dimension as a result of the plastic deformation caused by friction at the interface between two sliding surfaces. Die wear, as the main cause of product dimension errors, is strongly influenced by the hardness of the coating layer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954405412439980">12</xref></sup> the lubrication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954405412439980">13</xref></sup> and the temperature conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954405412439980">14</xref></sup> and the wear resistance can be improved by controlling these parameters. In addition, wear has an effect on metal flow and tool life, so it is essential to estimate this property in this study. Parameters related to wear include load, temperature, friction velocity, and slip distance, and the characteristics of wear also depend on the surface roughness and mechanical properties of the material.</p>
<p>In this study, the amount of wear of the cast material was compared with that of the forged material with variations in temperature and slip distance.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954405412439980">Figure 7</xref>, the impact value of the forged material was higher than those of the cast materials. In addition, the impact values of materials heat-treated under conditions 2 and 3 were about 50% higher than that of the cast material, because the toughness is enhanced owing to a grain refinement of microstructure depending on the tempering condition.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954405412439980">Figure 9(a)</xref>, the cutting force of the cast materials in the cutting direction increased in proportion to the cutting length, but the force of the forged materials was almost constant. This is because the microstructure of the cast material is less homogeneous than that of the forged material. This inhomogeneity roughens the surface of the tool and causes the cutting force to increase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954405412439980">Figure 9(b)</xref> shows the cutting force in the moving direction. It is seen that the force of the cast material shows a tendency similar to that in the cutting direction because of the increase in cutting force in the cutting direction. Also, the increase of the cutting force wears the tool, and the worn tool has a direct effect on the surface of the material. Therefore, the cutting force is the significant factor in choosing the cutting forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954405412439980">17</xref></sup></p>

As seen in this figure, when the cutting length of the cast material is in the range 0–30 m, the cutting length is the same as that of the forged material because of its similar surface roughness. However, the wear per unit cutting length of the cast material in the range over 30 m is greater than that of the forged material.

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The conclusions from this investigation of the substitution of forged H13 with cast H13 for the hot-stamping process were obtained through high-temperature impact tests, the evaluation of machinability, tensile testing at elevated temperatures, and high-temperature wear tests. The results show that, for the application of cast materials as die materials in hot press forming, the heat-treatment conditions should be optimized to improve the ductility characteristics, and a casting process that minimizes defects and reduces roughness must be used.</p>
<list id="list1-0954405412439980" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The impact value of cast H13 was lower than that of forged H13, but the impact value of the cast material was increased from 50% of that of the forged material to 100% through alteration of the heat-treatment conditions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The cutting force in the cutting direction of the cast material increased up to double that of the forged material, but the cutting force in the moving direction was decreased to about 50% of the maximum value according to the heat treatment condition. The cutting force of the cast material in the moving direction was similar to that of the forged material. Although the machinability of the cast materials was lower than that of the forged material, it is inferred that the lost foam process with the near net shape more than makes up for the disadvantage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The tensile strengths of the cast material fabricated under the same heat treatment condition were similar to that of the forged material, but the stress of the cast material, heat-treated under the different tempering conditions, were considerably decreased.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The elongations of the cast material manufactured in the temperature range 100–400 °C were about 50% of that of the forged material. The lowered elongations were improved by 33% and 14% by heat treatment from room temperature to 300 °C and at 400 °C, respectively.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regardless of the temperature, the wear amount of die materials was commonly increased proportional to the slip time. The wear amount of the cast materials at 100 °C and 200 °C, except cast 3 materials at 200 °C, was about 90% of that of the forged material. The amount of the cast 3 material at 200 °C was about 60% of that of the forged material.</p></list-item>
