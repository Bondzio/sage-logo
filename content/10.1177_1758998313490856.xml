<sec id="sec25-1758998313490856"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute intra-articular fractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint have always presented as a difficult injury to manage for the treating surgeon and therapist. Traction management enabling ligamentotaxis and motion is a popular method to manage these injuries. This case series presents the design and results of hand-based swing traction splinting which is less cumbersome for patients than other forms of traction splinting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1758998313490856"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Five patients presenting with intra-articular proximal interphalangeal joint fractures underwent surgery whereby a transverse K-wire was inserted across the middle phalanx. The treating Occupational Therapist fabricated a hand-based swing traction splint to provide a distraction force from the K-wire to the splint. Range of motion and patient satisfaction were the primary outcome measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1758998313490856"><title>Results</title>
<p>All five patients reported satisfaction with their hand function following therapy involving swing traction splinting. Furthermore, range of motion was comparable to other forms of traction management reported in the literature with an 88° mean arc of motion at the proximal interphalangeal joint.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-1758998313490856"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This case series demonstrates that hand-based swing traction splinting is a viable treatment option for the management of intra-articular proximal interphalangeal joint fractures. With similar outcomes to other forms of distraction that enable early movement, such as the pins and rubber traction system, this design is an alternative. The less cumbersome splint design is the main advantage over other splinting methods that apply distraction whilst also enabling early motion.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1758998313490856" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute intra-articular proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint fractures have always presented as a difficult injury to manage for the treating surgeon and therapist. Poor outcomes following this injury can be debilitating for the patient and significantly impact on their participation in activities of daily living, work and leisure pursuits.</p>
<p>The surgical options to reconstruct these challenging fractures are open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), external fixation or traction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1758998313490856">1</xref></sup> Hemi-hamate arthroplasty has also been advocated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1758998313490856">2</xref></sup> as has extension block splinting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1758998313490856">3</xref></sup> and extension block pinning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1758998313490856">4</xref></sup> Conservative management via splint immobilisation has been deemed to produce unsatisfactory results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1758998313490856">5</xref></sup> and is not recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1758998313490856">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Applying traction to the injured joint has the benefit of ligamentotaxis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1758998313490856">7</xref></sup> a term used to describe the reduction of fracture fragments and realignment of joint surfaces via a distraction force on the ligamentous and volar plate attachments. Interventions that enable both traction and movement of the joint are considered superior to those that only enable traction or only allow movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1758998313490856">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1758998313490856">9</xref></sup> Hence, this report will focus on outcomes following interventions that implement both traction and motion.</p>
<p>These interventions can be classified into one of two categories: traction provided via an external splint following Kirschner wire (K-wire) insertion; or traction provided by surgical intervention, that is those not requiring a thermoplastic splint in order to provide traction, including the pins and rubber traction system (PRTS) introduced by Suzuki et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1758998313490856">10</xref></sup> in 1994 and various external fixation devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1758998313490856">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1758998313490856"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1758998313490856"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1758998313490856"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1758998313490856">15</xref></sup> The surgeons working in our centre currently prefer traction provided by external splint application; hence, this case series came about in an attempt to improve splint design.</p>
<p>Traction splinting was first introduced in 1946 by Robertson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1758998313490856">16</xref></sup> Labelled the Banjo splint, three wires and rubber bands enabled traction; however, the system was effectively static and did not enable PIP joint movement. Forty years later, in 1986, Schenck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1758998313490856">17</xref></sup> described the first splint enabling both traction and passive motion of the PIP joint. With the preservation of articular symmetry and joint space, along with pain-free range of motion, outcomes were positive; however, the splint which was fabricated around a 10½ inch pizza pan has been considered too bulky.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1758998313490856">18</xref></sup> Haines et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1758998313490856">18</xref></sup> in 1991 decreased the splint size by 50% and used a spring rather than a rubber band to apply the traction, which the authors stated would allow more reliable tension. Dennys et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref></sup> in 1992, moved away from the arcuate splint design and introduced a far more compact design utilising a lateral hinge at the PIP joint in conjunction with a dorsal forearm-based splint. In 1995, Murray and McIntyre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1758998313490856">20</xref></sup> published a dorsal-based traction splint similar to the splint described by Dennys et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref></sup> with the addition of a profundus pulley strap to maximise motion at the PIP joint and used a rivet system for the lateral hinge to further streamline the splint. Byrne and Yau,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1758998313490856">21</xref></sup> also in 1995, modified the lateral hinge design to a volar forearm-based splint and used rivets rather than the larger thermoplastic material hinges described by Dennys et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref></sup> A further improvement to the splint design came in 2006 when Kadelbach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1758998313490856">22</xref></sup> modified Byrne and Yau’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1758998313490856">21</xref></sup> splint design and rather than using rivets, simple lateral hinges designed by van Veldhoven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1758998313490856">23</xref></sup> were implemented. Koul et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1758998313490856">24</xref></sup> described in 2009 an alternative traction splint design with a high profile 4-inch outrigger providing traction from elastic connected to a hook glued to the nail plate. The first hand-based design was described in 2010 by Baier and Szekeres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1758998313490856">25</xref></sup> Whilst the splint enabled free wrist motion, the splint design was a modified version of the original Schenck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1758998313490856">17</xref></sup> design and utilised a high profile hand arc traction component rather than the more popular and more streamlined swing traction design.</p>
<p>O’Brien and Presnell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758998313490856">26</xref></sup> explored patient experiences of distraction splinting using a dorsal forearm-based swing traction splint similar to the Murray and McIntyre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1758998313490856">20</xref></sup> design. These authors highlighted that ‘almost all patients have described the splint as confronting in appearance’ (p. 250) and the major theme to emerge from their study was the patients disconnect between the perceived complexity of the injury and treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758998313490856">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following a review of the literature, we were keen to explore if further improvements could be made to swing traction splinting in order to improve splint appearance, enhance hand function whilst the splint was in situ and reduce the amount of disconnect between the perceived complexity of the injury and the treatment.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a smaller hand-based swing traction splint was designed and implemented. This case series presents the results of its use with the first five patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1758998313490856" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Austin Health Office for Research as an Audit Activity. Five patients were referred for therapy following comminuted, intra-articular PIP joint fractures and were treated between October 2010 and September 2012. Fractures were classified according to the descriptive classification system outlined by Morgan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1758998313490856">27</xref></sup> Inclusion criteria were intra-articular fractures of the base of the middle phalanx with surgical intervention of a transverse K-wire inserted. The K-wire enables a distraction force to be applied via fabrication of a swing traction splint. Surgeons from the Austin Health Plastic Surgery Unit and the Melbourne Institute of Plastic Surgery performed all K-wire insertions and patients were referred to Occupational Therapy at Austin Health and Malvern Hand Therapy for post-operative management. Details of the therapy protocol and splint design are outlined below.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1758998313490856"><title>Treatment protocol</title>
<p>Patients identified by the treating Surgeon as candidates for swing traction splinting had a transverse K-wire inserted followed by an hour-long hand therapy session as soon as possible to fabricate the swing-traction splint. Three hundred grams of traction was applied as per previous recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1758998313490856">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1758998313490856">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1758998313490856"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref></sup> Following splint application, an X-ray was obtained to check the position of the fracture fragments and traction tension was adjusted if required. Subsequent therapy sessions were half hour in length and were conducted weekly whilst the swing traction splint was in situ and then continued either weekly or fortnightly depending on progress. All patients attended therapy for three to four months following injury. Initial exercises following splint application were to perform passive flexion (held for 2 minutes at end range), and 10 repetitions of active assisted (moving the swing traction with the unaffected hand) and active motion, in both flexion and extension, four times per day. Frequency and number of repetitions of the hand exercises were varied depending on pain levels and range of motion achieved. As required, a dorsal static finger extension splint fastened with Velcro was fabricated separately and worn overnight in conjunction with the swing traction splint to address any early extensor lag, PIP joint contracture or as an extension block for particularly unstable fractures whereby full extension is to be prevented. Patients were encouraged to use their uninjured fingers and thumb for light functional activities, but avoid any functional use of the injured finger. Patients were instructed to avoid activities that required greater than an arbitrary amount of 300 g of force to avoid injury. Following removal of the K-wire and swing traction splinting, therapy continued to enhance functional hand use and maximal range of motion via standard interventions of exercise, use of a flexion strap and static night extension splinting to address any PIP joint contracture or extensor lag.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1758998313490856"><title>Splint design</title>
<p>The circumferential hand splint is fashioned via a volar approach and fastened with Velcro using either 1.6 mm or 2.0 mm solid or perforated thermoplastic material, with metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) joint flexion of the injured finger between 30 and 40°. Velcro is added over the proximal phalanx and immobilisation of the MCP joint ensures flexion force is transmitted through the PIP and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints during exercise. Additional small circles of thermoplastic reinforcement with holes punched in the centre were bonded to the splint base at the level of the PIP joint. This enabled the ‘swing’ component to stay in place and not ‘jump out’ of the splint. Two-millimetre copper wire was bent to shape with the proximal ends of the outrigger bent inwards at a 90° angle and cut to a length of 3 mm to allow for the ‘swing’ with thermoplastic moulded over the distal end, providing a platform for the adhesive-backed loop Velcro to be applied. Medium density elastic was used to provide the distraction force from the K-wire to the swing platform with hook Velcro tabs. A little finger injury splint pattern is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1758998313490856">Figure 1</xref> and photos of the splint used for Case 3 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1758998313490856">Figures 2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1758998313490856"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1758998313490856"/> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1758998313490856">5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1758998313490856">Figure 6</xref> shows passive flexion performed by the therapist at week 5 with the same patient. A pattern for an injury to the ring finger is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1758998313490856">Figure 7</xref>, and photographs of this splint used for Case 5 are seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1758998313490856">Figures 8</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1758998313490856"/> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1758998313490856">10</xref>. It is important when making the ‘swing’ that the finger continues to follow normal patterns of movement and the injured finger bends towards the base of the thumb as illustrated by the angle of the ‘swing’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1758998313490856">Figure 2</xref>. This is easily achieved if the ulnar-sided ‘arm’ of the swing is slightly longer than the radial arm when making the splint for the middle, ring or little fingers.

<sec id="sec5-1758998313490856"><title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>X-rays were reviewed to estimate the percentage of joint involvement and joint congruency and fracture union. The lateral view was used to calculate the degree of articular involvement as a percentage of the entire joint surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1758998313490856">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Active range of motion using a dorsal approach was measured using a 15-cm plastic goniometer at weekly intervals for the first six post-operative weeks, at eight and 12 weeks post-operatively and at a two-year review appointment. Measurements were also taken on the un-injured contralateral finger for comparison. Kleinert and Verdan’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1758998313490856">28</xref></sup> total active motion (TAM) assessment system was then implemented to calculate the injured fingers’ range of motion as a percentage of the contralateral uninjured finger. In order to compare with other studies, PIP joint arc of motion was also calculated.</p>
<p>Complications that arose throughout the treatment phase were documented.</p>
<p>Pain scores recorded on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1758998313490856">29</xref></sup> were taken whilst the splint was on and the hand at rest, whilst undertaking prescribed exercises with the splint on, four weeks following splint removal and six weeks following splint removal. Patients returning for a two-year follow-up were also asked if they were experiencing any pain.</p>
<p>Grip strength measures using the second notch of the Jamar Dynamometer were taken at a two-year follow-up for those who had reached this milestone at the time of manuscript preparation utilising the American Society of Hand Therapists recommended standardised positioning as described by Mathiowetz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1758998313490856">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1758998313490856">31</xref></sup> was administered as an outcome measure to allow patients to self rate the level of upper extremity disability and symptoms 12 weeks following surgery.</p>
<p>A patient questionnaire was implemented at week 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1758998313490856">Figure 11</xref>) and week 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1758998313490856">Figure 12</xref>) to ascertain splint comfort, and satisfaction levels with regards to splint appearance, hand appearance and hand progress. Data on splint wear compliance, use of the hand within splint for light or heavy activities and the number of occasions of knocking the hand to cause pain during the traction splinting phase were also collected. Return to work timeframes for both light and full duties were documented and a comments section enabled patients to note any other concerns or comments regarding their hand and therapy.

All patients’ range of motion continued to improve and measures taken eight weeks post-operatively indicated that four had greater than 83% of the contralateral finger (rating of ‘good’) whilst the fifth recorded a ‘fair’ rating at 70%. Further measures were taken at 12 weeks post-operatively and all patients recorded a ‘good’ result of greater than 90% movement when compared to the contralateral finger. The mean total active arc of motion at the PIP joint was 88° at the 12-week measure. At their two-year follow-up, all three patients reported normal range of motion compared to the other hand and measured 94%, 99% and 104% of movement in comparison to the contralateral finger.

<sec id="sec13-1758998313490856"><title>Patient questionnaire – splint comfort and compliance/satisfaction/return to work</title>
<p>The responses following administration of the questionnaire at six weeks and 12 weeks are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1758998313490856">Table 7</xref>. Most patients reported the splint to be moderately comfortable and all were moderately or extremely happy with the appearance of the splint. Four patients were moderately to extremely happy with the appearance of their hand at both the six- and 12-week assessment. One patient was unhappy with the appearance of his finger and noted on the six-week questionnaire that his knuckle still had severe swelling from the original injury. On the 12-week questionnaire this subject commented that, due to the type of injury, his finger will never appear as it did previously and he reported that he was only slightly satisfied with the appearance of his hand. All patients were at least moderately satisfied with their progress at six weeks, and at the 12-week assessment, three were extremely satisfied, one moderately satisfied and one slightly satisfied. With regards to splint compliance, two patients reported removing their splint: one only once during the fifth week to wash his hand and the second removed his splint to wash his hand a couple of times per week during weeks five and six. Whilst light activities were encouraged with the splint in situ, one patient felt that she was unable to perform any light activities whilst the other patients varied in their frequency of hand use. Patients were advised not to use their hand for heavy activities and all except (who reported occasional use of his hand for heavy activities) complied with this recommendation. No more than 10 occasions of knocking the hand to cause pain was reported during the six weeks of splinting by any the patients.

<p>Return to light duties and full duties is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1758998313490856">Table 5</xref>. Four patients were working at the time of injury whilst the fifth was on extended long service leave. Of the four working subjects, one manual labourer (landscaper) injured his non-dominant hand and returned to work after splint removal. A prison guard whose dominant hand was injured at work also sustained additional injuries and was unable to return to work for three months post-injury. The heavy nature of Cabinet Making kept one patient who injured his dominant hand from returning to work for a similar length of time. A patient in a clerical role who injured his dominant hand was the only patient able to return to work with the splint in situ and returned three weeks after surgery.</p>

<p>The fractures sustained by patients in this case series are comparable to those found in other series examining traction management of PIP joint injuries. There were no cases of non-union or joint collapse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1758998313490856"><title>Range of motion</title>
<p>Range of motion outcomes were similar to other studies. Schenck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1758998313490856">17</xref></sup> with 10 cases and Morgan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1758998313490856">27</xref></sup> with 14 cases using an arcuate splint design reported an arc of motion at the PIP joint of 87° and 89°, respectively. Stern et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1758998313490856">6</xref></sup> reported a mean of 80° in six subjects, one subject whom was treated with an arcuate splint and the other five subjects with a banjo splint. The mean 88° arc of motion achieved in our case series at 12 weeks post-operatively also compared similarly to the forearm-based swing traction splinting reported by Dennys et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref></sup> who in their series of 13 cases reported a mean total arc of motion at the PIP joint to be 81°. With the high profile traction design by Koul et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1758998313490856">24</xref></sup> the mean TAM of 223° at eight weeks was similar to our TAM of 217° at the same time point.</p>
<p>Many small series have reported use of the PRTS with a mean arc of motion at the PIP joint ranging between 66° and 86°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1758998313490856">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1758998313490856">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1758998313490856">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1758998313490856"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1758998313490856"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1758998313490856"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1758998313490856"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1758998313490856">37</xref></sup> Modified versions of the PRTS such as the system described by Deshmukh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1758998313490856">38</xref></sup> with a mean arc of 85° at the PIP joint and two studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1758998313490856">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1758998313490856">40</xref></sup> with a mean arc of 88° at the PIP joint also yield similar results.</p>
<p>With regards to external fixation devices, results again are similar with an arc of motion at the PIP joint averaging 92° with the S-Quattro device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1758998313490856">41</xref></sup> and an average of 77° with Allison’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1758998313490856">14</xref></sup> dynamic external fixation device and 72° with Johnson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1758998313490856">15</xref></sup> modified Allison device.

<p>Agarwal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1758998313490856">34</xref></sup> analysed complications of the PRTS and noted that infection rates were ‘especially noted at the proximal ‘traction pin’ site subject to rotation of the pin’ (p. 494). Less K-wires are typically required when utilising traction splinting when compared with PRTS or similar external fixation traction devices and it could be postulated that there is a decreased risk of infection with the former. In our series, the patient who did acquire a superficial infection had the elastic component of the splint rubbing against the pin site as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1758998313490856">Figures 3</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1758998313490856"/> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1758998313490856">5</xref>. Following this incident, the K-wire configuration was improved with the K-wire bent to avoid the elastic component touching the skin, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1758998313490856">Figures 8</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1758998313490856"/> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1758998313490856">10</xref>.

<sec id="sec18-1758998313490856"><title>Pain</title>
<p>In a study by O’Brien and Presnell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758998313490856">26</xref></sup> exploring the patient experience of distraction splinting, a subtheme of unexpected levels of pain early in the post-operative phase emerged. In our case series, pain did increase when undertaking exercises compared with at rest in the splint; however, patients did not report having difficulty in performing the exercises, nor did they report experiencing unexpected levels of pain. As our case series commenced shortly after publication of the O’Brien and Presnell paper, we were able to implement their recommendation to ‘prepare the patient… that exercise can be painful in the early stages’ (p. 258).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758998313490856">26</xref></sup> This education may well have influenced the patients’ perceptions and expectations regarding pain and hence we support and encourage use of this recommendation. Further to this, all patients were prescribed analgesia for the first post-operative week, also in-keeping with recommendations made by O’Brien and Presnell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758998313490856">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>VAS scores were used by Ellis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1758998313490856">39</xref></sup> in a pins and rubber band system study that recorded in eight patients an average of 0.6 on the scale with an average follow-up length of 26 months which was similar to our 0.8 reported at 12 weeks. As only three patients have reached the two year milestone post-operatively, data for longer-term pain outcomes are limited in this study.</p>
<p>Reporting of some pain in subjects post-operatively is common within the literature. With regards to traction splinting, Dennys et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref></sup> reported most patients experienced some discomfort early in the treatment program and Morgan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1758998313490856">27</xref></sup> reported half of their 14 subjects reported mild discomfort in their injured finger at an average follow-up of 24 months. Use of surgically applied traction devices also reported similar incidences of post-operative pain, although comparison is difficult due to varying lengths of follow-up and varying categories of pain levels documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1758998313490856">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1758998313490856">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1758998313490856">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1758998313490856">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1758998313490856">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1758998313490856">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1758998313490856">41</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1758998313490856"><title>Grip strength</title>
<p>With range of motion being the primary outcome in all studies, few reported on other outcome measures such as grip strength which was reported in only two other studies. Both of these PRTS studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1758998313490856">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1758998313490856">39</xref></sup> reported that grip strength of the injured hand was 92% when compared to the unaffected hand. Whilst the mean length of follow-up was similar for these studies to our own, 34 months for the Deshmukh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1758998313490856">38</xref></sup> study and 26 months for the study by Ellis et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1758998313490856">39</xref></sup> unfortunately neither study reported hand dominance, and hence results are difficult to interpret as the dominant hand commonly has a stronger grip than the non-dominant hand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1758998313490856">42</xref></sup> The three patients in our study assessed at two years post-operatively all reported their grip strength felt the same as their pre-injury levels and both patients who injured their dominant hand recorded grip strength greater than their non-dominant injured hand (average 103.5%) whilst the patient who injured his non-dominant hand recorded grip strength at 84% of his non-injured dominant hand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1758998313490856"><title>DASH</title>
<p>No other studies have reported use of the DASH as an outcome measure. An extremely low level of disability was evident at 12 weeks post-intervention and the main functional impact was whilst the splint was in situ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1758998313490856"><title>Patient questionnaire – splint comfort and compliance/satisfaction/return to work</title>
<p>The patient questionnaire covered several parameters and most notable was the positive responses to splint comfort and splint wear compliance, and the high levels of satisfaction with splint appearance, progress at six weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention. Majumder et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1758998313490856">9</xref></sup> when using the PRTS administered a patient questionnaire and 12 of 13 patients reported satisfaction with their treatment. The unsatisfied patient reported the frame catching on his clothing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1758998313490856">9</xref></sup> Similarly, although small numbers of occasions were reported in our series, knocking of the traction system to cause pain can be problematic in both forms of traction management. One advantage of the traction splint over PRTS or external fixateurs is the existence of a ‘frame’ to protect the K-wire/s. Fortunately, knocking of the splint did not impact on alignment, nor adversely impact on outcomes. The patient in our series who was only slightly satisfied with the appearance of his hand and the progress of his hand at the 12-week assessment was the only patient who sustained his injury at work with no fault of his own. The nature of this injury along with the patient sustaining other injuries in the incident may have influenced satisfaction levels when compared to those who sustained injuries undertaking leisure pursuits. Return to work statistics are scant throughout the literature, with one study reporting 12 of 13 subjects returning to their original occupations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1758998313490856">38</xref></sup> Time away from work largely depends on the hand injured; dominant versus non-dominant and the type of work undertaken by the patient. The clerical worker in our series was able to return to work fastest at three weeks post-surgery, the manual labourer with his non-dominant hand injury at seven weeks and the two manual workers with dominant hand injuries at three months post-injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1758998313490856"><title>Splint design</title>
<p>According to authors of forearm-based traction splinting, the wrist is included in the splint to prevent distal migration of the splint when traction is applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1758998313490856">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1758998313490856">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1758998313490856">22</xref></sup> In our hand-based design, distal migration of the splint was not observed and we believe that: the circumferential design of the splint, support around the base of the thumb and the volar thermoplastic support under the proximal phalanx along with Velcro to hold the MCP joint in flexion, significantly reduces the likelihood of distal migration.</p>
<p>The adaptation from a forearm-based splint to a hand-based splint makes tasks such as writing, feeding oneself and putting arms through sleeves much easier to manage due to free wrist motion. Hence, the functional advantage of this design is vast. Further to this is the improved aesthetics and splint comfort with the smaller design. O’Brien and Presnell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758998313490856">26</xref></sup> highlighted that some patients found the forearm-based splint out of proportion to the injury; however, with positive responses to the questionnaire and discussion with patients in our small series, this was not raised as an issue. Similarly, with three patients reporting they were extremely satisfied with the appearance of the splint and the other two moderately satisfied, the hand-based design did not elicit the ‘confronting appearance’ notion that was reported by most patients in the study by O’Brien and Presnell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1758998313490856">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Supporters of the PRTS commonly site bulkiness to be the main disadvantage of traction splinting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1758998313490856">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1758998313490856">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1758998313490856">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1758998313490856">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1758998313490856">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1758998313490856">40</xref></sup> Having debulked the splint significantly by making it hand-based, tips were taken from the literature on traction splinting to further enhance the design. The lateral hinge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1758998313490856">19</xref></sup> was chosen as it is more compact than earlier designs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1758998313490856">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1758998313490856">18</xref></sup> Rivets and brass fasteners were avoided to maintain a streamlined and less costly approach with the use of swing design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1758998313490856">23</xref></sup> Small hole-punched circles of thermoplastic bonded to the splint addressed the potential problem alerted by Kadelbach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1758998313490856">22</xref></sup> of the wire sliding out of the thermoplastic.</p>
<p>The elastic thread attached to the swing frame via Velcro tabs was chosen as it is a simple method of applying traction and precise force can be applied and measured by use of a Haldex gauge. Adjusting the force applied is as simple as lifting the tab and stretching or relaxing the elastic thread and reapplying it to the Velcro loop in a slightly longer or shorter position. Adjusting force can be difficult to achieve when using elastic bands or springs, or designs with set attachments points on the swing frame such as embedded dressing hooks. No instances of the Velcro coming off the swing frame or any instances of patients self-adjusting the tension occurred in our case series. This system avoids the pitfalls associated with fatigue of smaller elastic bands used in the PRTS and some traction splint designs.</p>
<p>Further application of this splint design could be to modify the swing and volar splint base to enable hand-based swing traction for two or more concurrently injured fingers.</p>

<sec id="sec23-1758998313490856" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As highlighted by Chinchalker and Gan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1758998313490856">43</xref></sup> the goal of treatment of PIP joint injuries is the restoration of joint congruity and stability and a pain-free normal anatomic arc of motion. Applying continuous traction throughout the range of motion is the current preferred treatment option. Comparable results have been achieved via traction splinting and application of devices such as the PRTS and either option is valid. It appears that the application of PRTS or like systems is more technically demanding for the surgeon whilst fabrication of traction splinting is more demanding for the therapist. Ultimately, surgeon and therapist preference will determine the treatment modality implemented. For those who choose traction splinting, we advocate hand-based splinting over the larger forearm-based designs.</p>
