<abstract>
<p>A novel and effective approach for nondestructive <italic>in situ</italic> structural health monitoring of a hard-to-inspect location is presented in this article. Laser vibrometry is used to confirm that Lamb waves, generated by low-profile surface bonded piezoceramic transducers, are able to create circumferential creeping waves on the free surface of cylindrical cavities. The behavior of the propagating ultrasonic stress waves around the cavity and their interaction with simulated fatigue damage emanating from the top of the cavity is visualized. The transformation to a cylindrical co-ordinate system is found to be useful in visualizing wave scattering due to the presence of an open notch. Nondestructive evaluation of the structure is shown to be viable with the strength of the scattered spiralling creeping wave field maintaining its form and growing in amplitude as the notch length in increased. An informed selection of the excitation frequency is recommended as the A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode is found to be more efficient than the S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode in generating creeping waves around the cavity. Results from a receiving low-profile piezoceramic transducer are used to substantiate the laser vibrometry measurements and further establish the potential of the technique.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1475921710395814" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of <italic>smart</italic> skin construction for aircraft and of <italic>smart</italic> structures in general, indicates a revolution in structural design. The key enabling technologies for this revolution include primarily the rapid and continuing advances that have been made in the past three decades in the development of miniaturized sensors, actuators, and of various multifunctional materials and structural concepts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475921710395814">1</xref></sup> This article focuses on one aspect of this revolution, namely the development and practical implementation of novel and effective approaches for <italic>in situ</italic> structural health monitoring (SHM) in hard-to-inspect locations.</p>
<p>Weep holes in the wing spars of aging aircraft are examples of such hard-to-inspect locations. These weep holes are required to distribute fuel in the wing. Unfortunately, weep holes also present an ideal fatigue critical location for crack initiation. Up to 64 weep holes have been found to be cracked on a single aircraft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921710395814">2</xref></sup> Cracks may grow both toward and away from the wing skin on opposite sides of the holes. The bottom cracks can easily be detected using traditional ultrasonic and current state-of-the-art stress wave based SHM methodologies. However, the upward growing top cracks pose a greater challenge to ultrasonic based SHM techniques. Weep holes are currently inspected for the presence of small fatigue cracks using an eddy current bore-hole transducer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921710395814">3</xref></sup> This approach requires the wings to be emptied and purged of fuel so that manual inspection can be completed by an operator crawling into the wing.</p>
<p>The development of a nondestructive <italic>in situ</italic> SHM technique to detect and monitor the progression of the structural defects of this problem would be highly advantageous from a safety, time, and economic standpoint. <italic>In situ</italic> SHM offers the prospect of a quantum gain in performance and cost efficiency for structural integrity management of expensive assets such as aircraft and infrastructure. The technologies relating to this research area have many potential applications ranging from life extension programs for aging structures to the development of novel and lighter <italic>smart</italic> structures. The use of structurally integrated, affordable, and miniaturized sensors is a key component to such <italic>in situ</italic> SHM research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475921710395814">4</xref></sup> The probability of detection of a flaw in a structure can be increased by using permanently fixed actuators and sensors such as low-profile piezoceramic discs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475921710395814">5</xref></sup> Although errors incurred with the couplant and positioning of traditionally used ultrasonic wedge transducers can be eliminated with permanently installed piezoceramic elements, there are still some serious technical issues to implementing them to a structure. This is of particular importance, when an <italic>in situ</italic> SHM system that relies upon a comparison with a single baseline measurement has the possibility of being influenced by environmental conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475921710395814">6</xref></sup> Konstantinidis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921710395814">7</xref></sup> identified environmental temperature as one of the main contributors to the lack of long term stability of <italic>in situ</italic> SHM systems and introduced the optimal baseline subtraction method to correct the effect. Piezoelectric properties are also liable to degradation due to the applied strain exceeding the static failure strain of a surface mounted lead–zirconate–titanate (PZT) material but it has been shown that as long as the applied strain does not exceed the static failure strain of a PZT material, then the performance will remain consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475921710395814">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is shown in this article that ultrasonic Lamb waves propagated in the riser from low-profile PZT piezoceramic transducers bonded on the outer surface of the wing can be used to generate circumferential creeping waves on the free surface of weep holes. The creeping waves are guided to the defect location where they are reflected, transmitted, and diffracted by various ratios dependent on the geometry of the defect. The transmitted creeping waves, and the Lamb waves that are leaked, can be sensed using a second low-profile piezoceramic transducer bonded on the outer surface of the wing. This scenario can be likened to typical pitch-catch, <italic>in situ</italic> SHM methodology.</p>
<p>This article explores the benefits of Lamb wave based <italic>in situ</italic> SHM as well as the current application for circumferential creeping waves in ultrasonic nondestructive SHM of fuel weep holes. The investigation indicates great potential for an extension of the current regime to a Lamb wave based methodology for <italic>in situ</italic> SHM in hard-to-inspect locations.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1475921710395814"><title>Lamb waves for SHM of aerospace structures</title>
<p>Many aerospace systems have met their original service requirements and are beyond their design life. These systems are often being required to remain in service for an extended period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921710395814">2</xref></sup> SHM is one of the enabling technologies that assist in the continued safe operation of these aerospace systems. Through intelligent analysis of data acquired from a distributed sensor network within a SHM system, the structure’s potential to meet its design function can be assessed. Evidently, SHM of aerospace structures has recently received increased attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475921710395814">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cracks are characteristic types of damage to aerospace structures that develop due to fatigue from cyclic loads and corrosive service environments. Current inspection techniques involve complex, time-consuming procedures, which can be labor-intensive and expensive. Parts may have to be disassembled and re-assembled for inspection, which can cause significant downtime for the aircraft and require significant labor. A fast, low cost built-in SHM system is highly desirable to overcome the shortcomings of such current inspection techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475921710395814">10</xref></sup> In 2006, Aldrin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475921710395814">11</xref></sup> claimed that SHM is typically driven by the benefits of a reduction in labor cost for time spent on superfluous inspections, management of locations of limited accessibility to minimize costly teardowns, and the availability of robust indications of catastrophic failure of the structure to prompt safe retirement. Additionally, SHM technology must also meet requirements set by the aerospace industry which include parameters regarding the probability of detection, data integration interface standards, reliability, speed, and a high level of technological readiness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475921710395814">12</xref></sup> One developing area in SHM technology employs guided waves for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of a structure. There are multiple benefits of using guided waves in SHM applications such as those highlighted by Rose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475921710395814">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lamb or plate waves are vertically polarized guided waves whose particle motion lies between two parallel surfaces in the plane defined by the plate normal and the direction of wave propagation. They have been found to be useful for NDE of particular aerospace structures which act as natural waveguides, i.e., spars and skins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475921710395814">14</xref></sup> Like other forms of guided waves, Lamb waves exhibit dispersive behavior. The analytical solution of propagating Lamb waves, in the form of the Rayleigh–Lamb equation, shows that for a given frequency there will exist at least two modes, each with their own frequency dependent group velocity.</p>
<p>Defining the angular frequency as <italic>ω</italic>, phase velocity as <italic>c<sub>P</sub></italic>, mass density as <italic>ρ</italic>, plate half thickness as <italic>h</italic>, longitudinal (pressure) velocity as <italic>c<sub>L</sub></italic>, and transverse (shear) velocity as <italic>c<sub>T</sub></italic>, Rose<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475921710395814">15</xref></sup> presents the compact form of the Rayleigh–Lamb equation as:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1475921710395814"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921710395814-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

</p>
<p>The Rayleigh–Lamb equation is a composite of the characteristic equations derived from the homogenous solution of the wave equations, with the application of a stress-free boundary condition on the upper and lower surfaces of a plate. The +1 index of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1475921710395814">Equation (1)</xref> corresponds to symmetric (S) motion and −1 index, asymmetric (A) motion.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1475921710395814"><title>Circumferential creeping waves for NDE of fuel weep holes</title>
<p>The weep hole can be considered as a cylindrical cavity that scatters ultrasonic waves, presenting a challenging case for SHM because the damage is located sub-surface. Several papers regarding Lamb wave scattering by cylindrical cavities include.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475921710395814">16</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475921710395814">18</xref></sup> Fromme and Sayir<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475921710395814">19</xref></sup> studied flexural waves propagating in an aluminium plate containing a circular hole. The scattered field around a circular cavity was measured point-wise using a heterodyne laser interferometer and found to be in agreement with Kirchhoff and Mindlin types of plate theories. They introduced a notch for visual interest, sighted a boundary layer close to the hole, but did not attribute it to Rayleigh wave phenomenon. They also claimed that few experimental papers on the scattering of Lamb waves by a hole in a plate could be found. The presence of a discontinuity on the surface of a hole, such as a radially directed notch, causes significant scattering of an ultrasonic wave if the wavelength is comparable to the defect dimension. Ogilvy and Temple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475921710395814">20</xref></sup> noted that when an ultrasonic wave impinges on a crack within a solid, the emitted energy distribution will be the result of contributions from:
<list id="list1-1475921710395814" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>specular reflection of the incident wave from the leading face of the crack (toward the source), obeying normal geometrical laws of optics;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rayleigh waves traversing the leading face of the crack to either radiate body waves from the crack tip or wrap around the crack and traverse the trailing face; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>transmission and diffraction of the incident part of the Rayleigh wave that has passed beneath the crack tip.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The specimen geometry suggests that the weep hole is able to guide circumferential creeping waves to the defect location. A circumferential creeping wave can be described as a leaky Rayleigh mode propagating along the free concave cylindrical surface of a hole. The propagation length of the creeping wave is limited because the curvature causes energy to leak radially into the surrounding medium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475921710395814">21</xref></sup> The exact solution for the propagation of Rayleigh waves on curved surfaces was reported by Rulf,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475921710395814">22</xref></sup> who defined a relationship between dispersion, wavelength, and radius of curvature. Ying et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475921710395814">23</xref></sup> were the first to visualize circumferential creeping wave behavior, producing a series of stroboscopic photographs of the dynamic processes of both ultrasonic longitudinal and transverse waves at 2.5 MHz creeping around a cylindrical cavity in glass.</p>
<p>Utilization of creeping waves for SHM applications has received little attention. Prior work has focused on early detection of fatigue cracks from weep holes. In 1994, Nagy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921710395814">3</xref></sup> used high frequency ultrasonic vertically polarized shear (SV) waves to generate circumferential creeping waves for crack detection in fuel weep holes. They developed a special split-aperture (two-element) 45° shear wave wedge transducer for the task. Operating in a pulse-echo, or pitch-catch arrangement, their technique was able to overcome the effect of the strong specular reflection of the bulk wave masking the circumferential creeping wave on the free surface of the weep hole reflecting and transmitting from the crack interface. In the case of 0.25-in. diameter (6.35 mm) weep holes, optimum sensitivity was calculated at 5 MHz. The detection threshold was found to be approximately 0.003 in. (0.076 mm) and the signal saturated at crack lengths in excess of 0.020 in. (0.51 mm). Aldrin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475921710395814">24</xref></sup> evaluated the practical implementation of using high frequency ultrasonic vertically polarized shear waves to detect fatigue cracks emanating from free, fluid-filled, and elastically lined weep holes. He suggested that for successful sizing of top cracks larger than 0.020 in. (0.51 mm), information in addition to the magnitude of the reflected and transmitted leaky Rayleigh waves is required and that this information could be sourced from additional signals diffracting from the crack tip.</p>
<p>Nagy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921710395814">3</xref></sup> asserted that peripheral rays within one wavelength of a vertically polarized shear (SV) wave are well coupled to the leaky Rayleigh wave creeping around a hole. Like SV waves, Lamb waves are vertically polarized. The fundamental A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode has a significant shear component whereas the S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode does not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475921710395814">25</xref></sup> This suggests that (1) it is feasible to extend the current ultrasonic bulk wave practice of using circumferential creeping waves to detect the presence of a notch originating from the top of a fuel weep hole to an <italic>in situ</italic> guided Lamb wave method and; (2) the A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode, because of its significant shear component, is superior in this application due to it creating a circumferential creeping wave on the free surface of the hole and interacting with the notch significantly stronger than the S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode of equivalent spatial wavelength.</p></sec>

<p>The 6061-T6 series aluminium T-section beam with 4.75 mm web thickness used for the investigation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921710395814">Figure 1</xref>. The 10-mm diameter through-hole was fabricated with the hole center located 20 mm from the bottom surface of the flange. Lamb waves were generated in the riser with piezoceramic discs bonded with a two-part epoxy adhesive to the bottom surface of the flange. Ware et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921710395814">2</xref></sup> used fatigue tests to generate top cracks with lengths up to 3 mm in a component of comparable size. This was consistent with the size of damage seen in the field. Hence, the piezoceramic actuator was bonded 26 mm from the weep hole center to have a line-of-sight of a 3-mm notch in the riser. The notch was cut upward with a 0.5-mm wide blade in 1 mm increments to a length of 3 mm.
<fig id="fig1-1475921710395814" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The dimensioned T-section shown with axes centered on the weep hole for transformation to cylindrical co-ordinates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921710395814-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A 10-mm diameter, 1-mm thick, Ferroperm Pz26 ceramic disc was chosen for Lamb wave generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475921710395814">26</xref></sup> The idealized fundamental planar resonant frequency of this particular disc is 220 kHz, corresponding to a spatial wavelength of 11 mm for a propagating A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode in a 4.75 mm thick aluminium plate. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921710395814">Figure 2</xref>, it can be seen that the equivalent spatial wavelength for the S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode occurs at 420 kHz. Taking advantage of the resonant behavior of the low-profile piezoceramic actuator enables for good signal-to-noise response from laser vibrometry, as well as allowing for the A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode to be propagated in the incident wave. In this configuration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921710395814">Figure 3</xref> shows that the A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode is essentially nondispersive above 200 kHz. The dispersive effect, which can cause significant attenuation of the A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode in particular, can be further minimized by using a narrow bandwidth windowed tone burst rather than a wideband pulse for actuation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475921710395814">27</xref></sup> A four-cycle Hanning windowed sinusoidal tone burst was chosen such that the incident packet propagating around the hole could be isolated from the waves reflecting from the top edge of the riser.

<p>Staszewski et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475921710395814">28</xref></sup> showed the potential of laser vibrometry for simple, rapid, and robust detection of fatigue cracks in metallic structures using Lamb waves generated by low-profile, surface-bonded piezoceramic transducers. Similarly, a computer-controlled laser vibrometry rig pictured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921710395814">Figure 4</xref> was developed at Monash University for use in this investigation. A Parker Automation 404XE Electromechanical Positioning System with LV233 stepper motors was used to position the specimen. The stepper motors, capable of a resolution of 5000 steps/mm, enabled accurate and consistent positioning of the mounted specimen. Custom software was developed in MATLAB to synchronize positioning with signal generation and data acquisition.

<p>Lamb wave responses of the plate were sensed using a three-axis laser vibrometer. A Polytec CLV 3D sensor head with left, right, and top beams was positioned and focused to measure three components of velocity (<italic>V</italic><sub>L</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>R</sub>, and <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub>) of the specimen at any given position. The 1.5-MHz modified CLV-M030.B decoder module output a voltage directly proportional to the surface velocity with a factor of 25 mm/s/V. The signals were further low-pass filtered and amplified by 20 dB through a Krohn-Hite Model 3944 Programmable 4-Channel 2 MHz Filter. The velocity signals were later converted to their orthogonal components using the supplied equations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475921710395814">29</xref></sup> where the angle between the optical axis and the top laser beam is 12° with a 160-mm focal length lens.</p>
<p>Data acquisition was performed with a National Instruments PCI-6115 board and BNC-2110 block at 10 MHz and stored in the controlling computer. Input capture from the laser was hardware triggered by the rising edge of the excitation signal. This was essential for ensemble averaging and synchronization of spatially varying data. In this case, 16 time series averages were performed at each scan location to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for a series length of 1 ms. The excitation signals were amplified from the 10 V output at 4 MHz by 14 dB with a Krohn-Hite Model 7602 Wideband Power Amplifier.</p></sec></sec>

The velocity fields of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921710395814">Figure 7</xref> show that the notch causes significant interference to propagation of the 220 kHz signal by collecting and concentrating the wave energy. The creeping wave generated on the leading side of the weep hole ascends the leading face of the notch, wraps around the tip, and then descends the trailing face of the notch to continue to propagate as a creeping wave on the trailing side of the weep hole. As the creeping wave propagates along the trailing face of the weep hole, it is seen to leak energy into the riser.

<p>The scattered velocity field of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921710395814">Figure 8</xref> demonstrates that the transformation to a cylindrical co-ordinate system is beneficial in isolating the radial specular reflections and leaked waves from the azimuthal spiralling circumferential creeping waves caused by the presence of the notch. With the S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode being approximately 65% of the amplitude of the A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1475921710395814">Figure 9</xref>), the scattered velocity field of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921710395814">Figure 8</xref> maintains its form and grows in amplitude as the notch length in increased. This signature behavior is potentially the key for NDE of the structure.

<p>The 420 kHz excitation exhibits significantly different behaviors in comparison to the 220 kHz excitation. The bandwidth of the incident wave is evaluated on the riser at point A, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921710395814">Figure 5</xref> and is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1475921710395814">Figure 10</xref> to extend from 220 to 600 kHz. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1475921710395814">Figure 11</xref> indicates that the incident wave contains a dominant S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921710395814">Figure 12</xref> demonstrates that the notch causes minimal interference to wave propagation. The low amplitude scattered velocity field of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1475921710395814">Figure 13</xref> is comprised of the S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode as shown by the 2D FFT of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1475921710395814">Figure 14</xref>. Unlike the A<sub>0</sub> mode at 220 kHz, the scattered wave does not attach to the trailing side of the weep hole. This infers that the scattering of an incident A<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode around an open hole is significantly different to an incident S<sub>0</sub> Lamb mode.

<sec id="sec9-1475921710395814"><title>Exterior quantitative evaluation</title>
<p>Having shown that the scattering on the riser from the presence of the notch is highly dependent on the modal content of the incident wave, the next steps are to ascertain first, whether the scattering is detectable from outside the fuel tank and second, whether the scattering is useful for NDE of the structure. A line scan on the flange was used to evaluate the variation of surface velocity with time and distance from the weep hole. An optimized position to locate a receiving low-profile piezoceramic disc was then chosen for further evaluation using the results of the line scan. The orientation of the in-plane velocity component, <italic>V</italic><sub>xf</sub>, and out-of-plane velocity component, <italic>V</italic><sub>zf</sub>, for the line scan is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921710395814">Figure 2</xref>, with the origin positioned directly below the center of the weep hole.</p>
<p>The velocity field along the flange from the 220 kHz excitation signal is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1475921710395814">Figure 15</xref>. The scattered <italic>V</italic><sub>zf</sub> field of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1475921710395814">Figure 16</xref> reveals the addition of a Hanning windowed sinusoidal pulse from the addition of the notch, sweeping along the flange. This scattered pulse peaks in amplitude approximately 50 mm from the weep hole center. The time series of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1475921710395814">Figure 17</xref> for <italic>V</italic><sub>zf</sub> extracted at 50 mm shows a growth in amplitude as the notch length is increased. The scattered pulse responsible for the change in amplitude spans 35–70 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1475921710395814">Figure 18</xref>). To substantiate this finding, a 5-mm diameter, 1-mm thick, Ferroperm Pz27 piezoceramic disc was bonded to the flange 50 mm from the weep hole center. The voltage response of the piezoceramic receiver is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1475921710395814">Figure 19</xref>. A similar trend occurs to that of the <italic>V</italic><sub>zf</sub> response, with an increase in signal amplitude from the arrival of the additional pulse from the damage. In applying a Hanning window over the scattered time series that spans the time at which the scattered pulse arrives from the notch (35–70 µs), the transformation to the frequency domain is greatly enhanced. The potential of this technique is thus shown from the clear increase in signal amplitude from the presence of damage at the 220-kHz excitation frequency.

<p>Results were also taken with the 420-kHz excitation signal at 50 mm from the weep hole center, with amplification to the same peak voltage as the 220 kHz signal.

A clearly defined Hanning windowed sinusoidal pulse is no longer visible in the scattered <italic>V</italic><sub>zf</sub> response. Although the notch does scatter the incident wave and is detectable with the bonded piezoceramic disc, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1475921710395814">Figure 22</xref> demonstrates that the scattering is weak. This further emphasizes that the sensitivity of the technique is highly dependent on the modal content of the incident wave.

<p>This article has proposed a novel and effective approach for <italic>in situ</italic> SHM for hard-to-inspect locations, namely weep holes in the wing spars of aging aircraft. The technique utilizes the compact form of surface bonded low-profile piezoceramic transducers to generate Lamb waves that can interrogate a structure for defects. The results indicate not only the ability of Lamb waves, particularly the A<sub>0</sub> mode, to generate creeping waves on the free surface of the weep hole but that the interaction of the creeping waves with the damage is highly detectable. The results further indicate that the selection of an appropriate excitation frequency is crucial to the efficacy of the technique.</p>
<p>Further understanding of the creeping wave phenomena in the presence of damage and its implementation in an <italic>in situ</italic> SHM strategy can be utilized to optimize the information received from networks of integrated actuators and sensors. Future work will be focused on understanding and optimizing the technique by way of benchmarking and validation of computational tools against known analytical solutions (for simple cases), and against systematic experimental measurements. In particular, the influence of the low-profile actuator on the generation of the circumferential creeping and leaked waves, and the sensor configurations for the reception of the scattered waves from the inclusion of damage shall be investigated.</p>
<p>When implemented on aircraft, the proposed <italic>in situ</italic> SHM strategy should lead to a safer, more manageable and cost efficient approach to certification and maintenance. This technology has the potential to change and define the frontier technologies in design and maintenance as well as lead to the use of advanced <italic>smart</italic> materials (e.g., piezoelectric materials) in new and aging structures. This technique holds great promise for revolutionary developments in SHM.</p></sec>
