            <p>The purpose of this study was to examine the association between leukotriene-modifying agents (LTMAs) and completed suicide. Data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System from 1999 to 2009 were used to identify the number of completed suicides for each LTMA. Data from IMS Health were used to determine the number of prescriptions dispensed by drug in the same time period. The authors calculated the rate of completed suicides per million prescriptions and, using a mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis, determined the empirical Bayes (EB) rate multipliers and 95% confidence intervals for each drug. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and short-acting beta-agonist (SABAs) were analyzed for comparison purposes. There were 105 completed suicides reported where a LTMA was implicated. Most (n = 101) involved montelukast, and all but 9 occurred in 2008 to 2009, following an FDA warning. Aggregated suicide rates over the 1999-2009 period were 0.51, 0.24, and 4.09 per million prescriptions for montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton. The suicide rate as a class was 0.06 per million prescriptions in the prewarning period and 1.82 per million prescriptions in the postwarning period. Montelukast was associated with a significantly lower rate of suicide when compared to SSRIs and a significantly higher rate when compared to SABAs.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Suicide is a significant public health issue both in the United States, where it is the 11th leading cause of death, and worldwide.<sup>

            </sup> Although there are many causes and risk factors for suicide, over the past 5 years, there has been an increasing recognition of the potential association between use of certain prescription medications and suicide.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427856">2</xref>
            </sup> The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about psychiatric symptoms and suicidality for entire classes of medications, including antidepressants,<sup>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861511427856">9</xref>
            </sup> and, more recently, leukotriene-modifying agents (LTMAs).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511427856">10</xref>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The LTMAs, which in the United States include montelukast (Singulair; Merck &amp; Co, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), zafirlukast (Accolate; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Delaware), and zileuton (Zyflo; Cornerstone Therapeutics, Cary, North Carolina), are an important class of medications used in the treatment of both asthma and allergic rhinitis.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861511427856">13</xref>

            </sup> These drugs are particularly useful in children because of side effects associated with other options<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861511427856">16</xref>
            </sup> and for asthma because they are available in an oral dosage form. In fact, Singulair is among the top 10 best-selling drugs in the United States.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861511427856">17</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The presence of an FDA precaution has the potential to drastically reduce utilization of LTMAs, in a manner similar to that which occurred in the case of antidepressants.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861511427856">18</xref>

            </sup> Limiting utilization of LTMAs could have negative health consequences for patients who would otherwise benefit from these agents. For this reason, it is important to ascertain whether an association between LTMAs and suicide exists. The FDA warnings were based on case reports, and experts have called for more research to be conducted to confirm or refute the presumed association.<sup>

         <title>Materials and Methods</title>
         <p>We conducted a mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092861511427856">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092861511427856">25</xref>
            </sup> of the association between the LTMA agents—montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton—and completed suicides using data from the FDA and from IMS Health Incorporated.</p>
         <sec id="section3-0092861511427856">
            <title>Data Sources</title>
            <p>Data from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) from 1999 to 2009 (most recent available) were used to determine the number of reports of completed suicides associated with an LTMA. In the FDA AERS system, such reports are submitted by health care providers (usually physicians, pharmacists, or nurses), pharmaceutical companies, or rarely the patient/caregiver. Only initial reports of completed suicides were included in this analysis. Other types of suicide-related events (ie, suicide attempts) and follow-up reports of the same event were not included. We also excluded reports of events occurring outside of the United States. Reports were included only if the generic or brand name of an LTMA—montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), or zileuton (Zyflo)—was listed as the primary suspected drug, secondary suspected drug, or concomitant drug. For comparison purposes, we also examined reports involving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)—including citralopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a class of antidepressants that have been the focus of numerous FDA warnings about increased risk of suicide and, in this analysis, were included as “positive” control.<sup>

               </sup> For a potential “negative” control, we included reports of completed suicides involving short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs). To the best of our knowledge, SABAs have not been previously associated with suicide, but like LTMAs, these drugs are used for the treatment of asthma, so any underlying risk of suicide in the patient population could be anticipated to be similar.</p>
            <p>The Xponent™ Database, from January 1999 to December 2009 (IMS Health, Inc), was used to determine counts of dispensed prescriptions for each drug identified above for the time period specified. These data were based on total dispensed prescriptions from retail (chain, independent, food stores, and mass merchandisers) pharmacies in the United States. The data do not provide information on whether the prescriptions were taken by patients. Nevertheless, these data are commonly used for measuring prescription dispensations and are a reliable representation of total prescriptions dispensed in the United States.</p>

            <title>Data Analysis</title>
            <p>We used the mixed-effects Poisson regression analysis approach described by Gibbons and others<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092861511427856">25</xref>
               </sup> to analyze these data. This method, which specifically includes denominators adjusting for drug usage, is a more robust alternative to commonly used “numerator-only” methods, such as the proportional reporting ratio, Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and empirical Bayes screening.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092861511427856">26</xref>
               </sup> This method requires an exact denominator or a proxy denominator. We used the proxy denominator of number of prescriptions dispensed described above because no such denominator is available from the FDA AERS data.</p>
            <p>We first determined the rate of completed suicides per million prescriptions for each drug class (LTMAs, SSRIs, and SABAs) by year (1999-2009). Next we calculated the aggregated rate of completed suicide per million prescriptions for each individual drug. We also did this for 2 time periods, 1999-2007 and 2008-2009, to examine changes in reporting that might have occurred as a result of the FDA warning issued in 2008.</p>
            <p>Next we determined the empirical Bayes (EB) estimate and associated rate multiplier for each drug. The rate multiplier describes the deviation of the rate of suicide for a target drug from the overall rate for all drugs in the analysis as a whole. We conducted this analysis first with a model that included LTMAs and SSRIs and then for a model that included LTMAs and SABAs. Each of these analyses was conducted for the complete data set (1999-2009) and then separately for each of the 2 time periods of interest (1999-2007 and 2008-2009). A description of the mixed-effects Poisson regression model used is described in detail by Gibbons and others<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092861511427856">25</xref>
               </sup> elsewhere. A rate multiplier of 1.0 indicates that the drug has the same rate as the average for the other drugs in the analysis (ie, SSRIs in the first analysis and SABAs in the second analysis), a multiplier of 2.0 is twice the average rate, and a multiplier of 0.5 is half the average rate. Statistical inference was made by calculating large sample confidence (posterior) intervals for the rate multipliers.</p>

         <p>In total, there were 101 completed suicides where montelukast was implicated, and all but 9 occurred in 2008 or 2009. Over the entire time period analyzed, only 3 suicides were reported for zafirlukast and just 1 for zileuton. The number of prescriptions for zileuton was very low relative to the other 2 LTMAs, and therefore the single suicide (in 2009) has a disproportionate influence on the suicide rate for that drug. The aggregated suicide rate over all the years assessed was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.42-0.62), 0.24 (0.02-0.38), and 4.09 (0.05-22.71) per million prescriptions for montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton, respectively.</p>
         <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861511427856">Figure 1</xref>, we show rates of completed suicide for LTMAs as a class compared to SSRIs and SABAs. Suicide rates for SSRIs were generally quite high, with an aggregate rate over the entire time period of 2.79 completed suicides per million prescriptions (95% CI, 2.69-2.90). The rate for SSRIs appeared to peak in 2005 (at 4.49 completed suicides per million prescriptions), declined until 2007, and then rose again dramatically in 2008. The suicide rate for LTMAs remained near zero until 2008, when the FDA issued the first warning for this class of drugs.<sup>

            </sup> Prior to the warning, the LTMAs, as a class, never exceeded 0.28 completed suicides per million prescriptions, but in 2008, the rate was 2.40, which is not dissimilar to the overall rate for SSRIs. The rate for LTMAs aggregated over the entire time period was 0.50 (95% CI, 0.41-0.61). This class suicide rate is primarily driven by montelukast because this drug accounts for 94% of all prescriptions for LTMAs. As expected, the rate of completed suicides for SABAs remained near zero (aggregate rate 0.17; 95% CI, 0.14-0.21) throughout the time period analyzed.</p>

In this case, we found that in the early time period (1997-2008), there were no significant differences between drugs—that is, the LTMAs and SABA all had confidence intervals that included 1.0. However, in the 2008-2009 time period, montelukast had a EB rate multiplier of 5.61 (95% CI, 4.46-6.89). This effect also held when the analysis was conducted over the entire time period, as can been seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427856">Figure 4</xref>. Among the SABAs, albuterol and levalbuterol had EB rate multipliers and confidence intervals less than 1.0. The other SABAs, such as zileuton, had relatively sparse data (because of low prescription volume) and thus wide confidence intervals that include 1.0.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>In this study, we combined counts by year of spontaneously reported completed suicides for which an LTMA was implicated, with a denominator of prescriptions dispensed for the same drug—the later data coming from pharmacies across the United States. We found very few (9 total) completed suicides for these drugs reported prior to 2008. There were 62 events reported in 2008 and 31 in 2009.</p>
         <p>In March 2008, the FDA first issued a safety alert for suicides and LTMAs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511427856">10</xref>
            </sup> In that communication, the FDA indicated that the manufacturer of montelukast, Merck &amp; Co, had “updated the prescribing information and patient information for Singulair to include the following post-marketing adverse events: tremor (March 2007), depression (April 2007), suicidality (suicidal thinking and behavior) (October 2007), and anxiousness (February 2008).”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511427856">10</xref>
            </sup> A subsequent review by the FDA of clinical trials data found no cases of completed suicide and only 1 case of suicidal ideation in more than 19,000 patients treated with LTMAs. Nevertheless, the warning was continued, and the FDA issued a statement to the effect that although these data do not suggest that montelukast, zafirlukast, or zileuton is associated with suicide or suicidal behavior, these clinical trials were not designed specifically to examine neuropsychiatric events.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861511427856">12</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The dramatic increase in reporting of suicides that we observed following the FDA warning is not surprising. This reporting bias has been a frequently cited limitation of spontaneous event reporting systems.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092861511427856">26</xref>
            </sup> Although it is likely that these events would not have been reported had the FDA warnings not been issued, we cannot say with the same certainty that the association between the drugs and the events does not exist. Clearly, spontaneous reporting systems are not designed to prove causality. Nevertheless, the apparent direct link between the FDA warnings and the reporting of completed suicides is somewhat disconcerting. Furthermore, we see the same pattern of apparent reporting bias with the SSRIs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0092861511427856">Figure 1</xref>, where the timing of FDA warnings about SSRIs and suicides in 2003 to 2004 coincides directly with increased reporting of suicides. Reporting then appears to wane for a period before being stimulated again by additional and expanded FDA alerts in 2007.<sup>

         <p>Despite the issues of reporting bias, the reporting of these events suggests an important signal for further investigation. We used an EB method to test if the rate of reported suicides for LTMAs was different from that of SSRIs—a class of drugs known to be associated with suicides. We also compared LTMAs to SABAs—a class of drugs that is also used to treat asthma but has not been previously associated with suicides. In the analysis that included SABAs, montelukast clearly demonstrates an elevated rate in the time period after the FDA warnings. However, compared to SSRIs, even in the time period after FDA warnings, montelukast and zafirlukast both had rate multipliers that were significantly lower than those drugs, whereas the results for zileuton across all analyses were null and likely influenced by sparse data (only a single reported suicide and low prescription volume).</p>
         <p>Although the reporting of completed suicides clearly seems to have been influenced by the FDA warnings about suicidality and LTMA, what is unclear from this analysis is the degree to which this represents either underreporting in the early time period (before the warnings) or overreporting in the later time period (after the warnings). In could be that suicides were occurring throughout the time that montelukast was on the market but that these events were just never recognized until it was brought to the attention of the public. On the other hand, the FDA warnings may have prompted individuals to report suicides in patients taking montelukast even when there was no real link between the two.</p>
         <p>Our result should be interpreted with an understanding of the limitations that may exist with the data and associations observed. The numerator used to calculate suicide rates in our analysis was from reports submitted to the FDA AERS. Besides the reporting bias we have already mentioned, there are other problems inherent in spontaneously reported adverse effects data, including underreporting of events, and problems with reporting quality (missing data and inability to validate).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092861511427856">27</xref>
            </sup> In addition, besides heightened awareness and reporting secondary to FDA warnings, reporting bias can be related to the length of time the suspected medication has been on the market (newer products more likely to be reported), the reporting environment (ie, reporting is encouraged in some hospitals or health care settings but not others), or the severity of the event (more severe events are more likely to be reported).</p>
         <p>A major limitation of the FDA AERS data is the mechanism by which drugs are entered in the database. Drug names are listed as a text field only and are recorded exactly as reported to the FDA on the adverse event form—meaning that both generic and brand names may be used, and spelling errors are common. This makes searching the database for drugs of interest difficult, and as a result, the accuracy of the counts of events by drug may suffer. We used several different search strategies to capture the greatest number of potentially relevant reports.</p>
         <p>A related issue with the FDA AERS data is the way that drugs are categorized in the database. Reporters are instructed to identify up to 2 suspected products (“primary suspect product” and “secondary suspect product”) along with any concomitant drugs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092861511427856">28</xref>
            </sup> In our analysis, we considered completed suicides where the drug of interest was listed in any one of these fields. However, as a sensitivity analysis, we conducted the analyses by limiting the events to include only those where the drug of interest was reported as the primary suspect product and separately when the drug was either the primary or the secondary suspect product. Although the number of events changed, and subsequently our calculated suicide rates, the conclusions of our analyses remained the same.</p>
         <p>The denominator used to calculate suicide rates in our analysis was based on retail prescriptions dispensed in the United States. Although the retail distribution channel likely captures a majority of the use of these drugs, some utilization occurs in hospitals or other settings that is not captured in these data. Furthermore, prescriptions dispensed are not necessarily the same as exposure because of the inability to measure patient adherence. However, there is substantial literature validating the use of prescriptions claims as a measure of drug exposure.<sup>

         <p>Some of the drugs we examined had relatively low prescription volume, including zileuton. The EB rate multipliers that we estimated are considered “shrinkage estimators” because when there are sparse data, the estimators will regress toward the overall mean—in this case, 1.0. We observed this for zileuton and some of the SABAs.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>In summary, we found that rates of reported completed suicides associated with montelukast increased substantially following warnings issued by the FDA. Using a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, we found these rates were statistically greater than those of SABAs but were lower than SSRIs. Although these findings are informative, because of potential biases for the observed associations, it is important to evaluate the association between LTMAs and suicide using more robust study designs, as well as data of higher quality.</p>
