<title>Background:</title>
<p>Augmenting the nasal dorsum with conchal grafts can cause visible irregularities over time due to the morphological qualities of that material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X12456196">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>This study describes the senior authors’ technique of dorsal nasal augmentation with chondrofascial “open sandwich” grafts consisting of pieces of conchal cartilage and retroauricular fascia. The authors assess the efficiency and reliability of this graft in nasal dorsal augmentation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X12456196">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The authors retrospectively reviewed the cases of 19 patients who underwent dorsal augmentation rhinoplasty with chondrofascial grafts. Both cartilage and fascia were harvested through the same incision in the retroauricular sulcus. The conchal graft was cut in 2 to 4 pieces and slightly crushed with tissue forceps. The pieces of cartilage were arranged and fixed to the fascia in different patterns according to the nasal dorsum contour.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X12456196">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 35 months in 16 patients who qualified for inclusion in the final data. The maximal thickness of the chondrofascial graft was 4.5 mm. There were no major complications in the recipient area, except 1 case of undercorrection. There were 2 complications in the donor area. In 1 case, a hematoma was treated conservatively. In another case, a strip of skin necrosis in the conchal area occurred and was treated by excision and direct suture with satisfactory resolution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090820X12456196">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The autologous chondrofascial graft is appropriate for slight to mild dorsal nasal augmentation. The method, as with most rhinoplasty techniques, requires careful and judicious preoperative examination, planning, and execution. The postoperative scar is inconspicuous and the donor site morbidity is minimal.</p>

<body>
<p>Augmentation of the nasal dorsum remains a challenging task for the plastic surgeon. Autologous, homologous, and alloplastic materials are used for this purpose with different rates of success. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages. In our practice, we advocate autologous materials for dorsal nasal augmentation. Among the available autologous materials, the conchal cartilage is still a graft of choice for less severe dorsal deformities, especially when septal cartilage is unavailable.</p>
<p>Different techniques of harvesting, tailoring, and preparing conchal cartilage grafts have been described. Some authors employ a morphologically-unmodified cartilage graft as one straight or rolled piece<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12456196">1</xref></sup> or suture cymba and cavum conchal cartilages in tandem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12456196">2</xref></sup> Due to its naturally curved form and irregularities, the conchal graft can shift over time, causing visible warping or bumping on the dorsum, especially in thin-skinned patients. Other authors prefer crushing or scoring the conchal graft. But even scored, crushed, or trimmed conchal grafts placed as 1 piece to cover the entire dorsum can show irregularities over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12456196">3</xref></sup> The senior author (NA), keeping these challenges in mind, designed a modified technique in which the conchal cartilage is processed into straight, soft, and pliable pieces of graft using different maneuvers. To reduce the risk of visibility, the conchal grafts are fixed to a piece of fascia harvested from the retroauricular area. In this way, a chondrofascial graft, called the “open sandwich” graft, is designed. The purpose of this article is to present our experience with using this graft in dorsal nasal augmentation.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X12456196" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A chondrofascial graft consisting of conchal cartilage and retroauricular fascia was used for dorsal nasal augmentation in 19 consecutive cases, which we retrospectively evaluated. Among them, 3 cases were primary and 16 were secondary rhinoplasties. An open approach was used in 15 cases and a closed approach in the remaining 4 cases. All operations were performed by the senior author (NA). The indications for augmentation were concavity and irregularities of the nasal dorsum. All patients exhibited a dorsal deficiency of 2.5 to 4.5 mm.</p>
<sec id="section7-1090820X12456196">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Preoperatively, the nasal dorsal contour was examined. We simulated dorsal nasal augmentation using dental impression material. This helped us to establish the degree of desired augmentation of the nasal dorsum and to estimate the approximate dimensions and contour of the chondrofascial graft.</p>
<p>The anterior and posterior surfaces of the concha bowl and retroauricular area were infiltrated with 0.5% xylocaine solution with 1:200 000 epinephrine. First, dissection in the postauricular area was started through the 4-cm incision in the retroauricular sulcus. The skin and soft tissue envelope were elevated from the underlying fascial layer at a distance of about 3 cm toward the hair line, starting from the retroauricular sulcus. After the subcutaneous pocket was created, harvesting of the retroauricular fascia was started about 0.5 mm behind the retroauricular sulcus, continuing above the posterior auricular muscle and the insertion of the occipitalis and trapezius muscles. To prevent modification of the position of the auricle, it is important to avoid cutting the posterior auricular muscle. Finally, a rectangle-shaped piece of retroauricular fascia was harvested with a dimension of a maximum of 5.0 × 2.5 cm and with a thickness of about 2 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12456196">Figure 1A</xref>). After that, the dissection of the concha began through the same incision in the retroauricular sulcus. The skin and soft tissue were elevated from the posterior concha, leaving the perichondrium attached to the cartilage. The level of the conchal transection was established using 4 needles introduced from the anterior surface through cartilage. This allowed us to leave an intact strip of concha of 5 to 6 mm along the antihelix and the origin of the helical root, to prevent deformity of the auricle. Dissection of the concha was continued on the anterior surface in the subperichondrial plane. The conchal graft was harvested as a single piece. Tie-over dressing was applied to prevent hematoma formation and preserve concha bowl contour.</p>
<p>According to preoperative assessment of the nasal dorsum and depending on the conchal bowl architecture (ie, length, height, curvature, thickness, and definition and extension of the helical root), the graft was cut in 2 to 4 pieces to obtain pieces of cartilage that were as flat and smooth as possible. To attenuate irregularities, the conchal grafts were shaved with a No. 15 blade and slightly crushed with thin-toothed forceps to soften and flatten them. The edges were moderately crushed and even slightly fragmented at the junction between pieces with tissue forceps. The separation of fragments was avoided. In addition, the grafts were fixed with fibrin glue. The perichondrium on the posterior surface of each piece of the cartilage was slightly scored with a No. 15 blade to prevent bumping on the opposite side.</p>
<p>The cartilage pieces were placed and fixed to the retroauricular fascia and to each other with 6/0 PDS sutures (Ethicon, Inc, Branchburg, New Jersey) and fibrin glue. The crushed edges were slightly overlapped in “fish scale” fashion to prevent visibility and depressions at the junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12456196">Figure 1B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12456196">C</xref>). In 6 cases, cartilage pieces were superimposed, creating a multilayered graft. The width of the chondrofascial graft ranged between 7 and 9 mm. The nasal dorsum was undermined as necessary, taking care not to undermine too much to avoid postoperative deviations of the graft. The nasal bones were rasped to create an adequate recipient site for the graft. The “open sandwich” graft was placed on the nasal dorsum in the sub–superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) pocket, with the fascia facing upwards. Adjustments to the final position and form of the graft were carried out with the graft taken out, trimmed, and replaced. The graft was fixed cephalically at the level of the radix with 2 pull-out 4/0 nonabsorbable sutures. Caudally, the fascial layer of the graft was fixed to the septum and upper lateral cartilages with separate 6/0 PDS sutures. After being fixed on its caudal edge and tightened from the cephalic part, the retroauricular fascia acted as a tent, providing additional stability of the graft. The pull-out sutures were removed on the fifth postoperative day. Overcorrection was avoided. In all cases, the chondrofascial graft was used for aesthetic purposes only after a stable nasal framework was ensured and functional disorders were solved. Other aspects of rhinoplasty were performed where indicated. A nasal splint was placed in all cases and removed on postoperative day 9. Taping of the nasal dorsum was continued for 2 more weeks to ensure stability of the graft. Broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis was used intraoperatively and for 5 days postoperatively.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Three patients were removed from the study due to inadequate follow-up (2 patients had been followed for less than 1 year and 1 was lost 2 months after surgery). In the remaining 16 patients, the average follow-up was 23.1 months (range, 12-35 months). The patients’ ages ranged from 20 to 43 years (average 28.5 years). There were 4 men and 12 women in this group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12456196">Table 1</xref>). Separate, subjective clinical evaluations were made by each member of the surgical team and by another independent medical team consisting of 2 plastic surgeons from our hospital who had not treated any of the patients. These evaluations involved inspection, palpation, and/or photographic documentation. Both medical teams evaluated all 16 patients included in the final study. Dorsal nasal contour, dorsal aesthetic lines, and nasal facial balance were evaluated.</p>

<p>Follow-up revealed no cases of infection, hematoma, seroma, or displacement of the graft at the recipient area. No significant resorption or warping of the chondrofascial graft was noted. A summarized result of the individual authors’ analysis exhibited that excellent results were obtained in 4 cases, good results in 5 cases, satisfactory results in 6 cases, and a poor result in 1 case (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X12456196">Table 2</xref>). The independent medical team appreciated postoperative results as excellent in 5 cases, good in 6 cases, and satisfactory in 5 cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090820X12456196">Table 3</xref>). According to the patients themselves, 5 were very satisfied, 6 were satisfied, and 5 were partially satisfied with the result (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090820X12456196">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the higher rate of patient satisfaction with the postoperative result could be related to the severity of the preoperative nasal deformity. There was 1 case of initial undercorrection of the nasal dorsum, but the patient was satisfied with the result and refused secondary augmentation. We had no revision surgeries in our series. There were 2 complications in the donor area. In 1 case, a hematoma occurrence was treated conservatively. In another case, a strip of skin necrosis developed in the conchal area and was treated by excision and direct suturing with satisfactory resolution. There was no significant pain and no instances of scar visibility in the donor area, because the postoperative scar was well hidden in the retroauricular sulcus. There was no significant difference between operated and nonoperated ears. The maximal thickness of the chondrofascial graft (when the grafts were superimposed) was 4.5 mm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are many publications describing different techniques of harvesting and application of conchal grafts. However, some authors are reticent to use conchal cartilage for dorsal nasal augmentation because of its curvature, irregularities, and unpredictable evolution. Hubbert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12456196">4</xref></sup> stated that the naturally curved conchal shape is ill-suited for the dorsum and, if forced out of its resting orientation by sutures or scoring, it frequently develops lump or bump irregularities years later under the thin dorsal skin. Crushing is one of the possibilities to modify the natural form and morphology of the conchal cartilage to obtain a smooth, flat, and soft graft to achieve a desired nasal dorsum. According to Bujía,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12456196">5</xref></sup> Cottle was the first surgeon who used crushed cartilage for nasal reconstruction.</p>
<p>Aiach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12456196">6</xref></sup> suggested crushing the cartilage gently after scoring it with multiple square incisions to remove all of its memory. However, Gruber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12456196">2</xref></sup> considers that auricular cartilage does not respond very well to crushing. He stated also that crushing or bruising the ear cartilage easily causes major warping and surface irregularities and, therefore, is not advised. Besides, there is controversy regarding the viability of crushed cartilage grafts and the predictability of the degree of graft volume loss. Garg et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12456196">7</xref></sup> in their recent study, stated that viability of chondrocytes depends mainly on the intensity of crushing. They demonstrated that slightly and moderately crushed tissues show good chondrocyte viability and proliferation at levels comparable to those of intact cartilage. We agree with Cakmak and Altinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12456196">8</xref></sup> that the ear cartilage is more pliable and can be crushed more softly, which is essential to prevent overcrushing and inherent cartilage cell death.</p>
<p>Therefore, in our technique, to diminish the risk of cartilage resorption, the grafts were just slightly crushed using forceps. In most situations, slight crushing was enough to soften and flatten pieces of the conchal cartilage. In our series, we did not notice significant resorption of the graft, which could be an explanation. Besides, we did not always crush all of the cartilage pieces, especially when we had to superimpose them to fill the significant dorsal nasal depression.</p>
<p>The cartilage pieces were not just tailored to the dorsal nasal contour. We also took into consideration anatomical characteristics of concha (ie, configuration, width, height, and thickness of its parts).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12456196">9</xref></sup> It is also useful in practical terms to appreciate the extension and thickness of the helical root into the conchal bowl. In all of our cases, the helical root was thick and extended toward the antihelix. We believe that, in such situations, it is impossible to get one piece of soft, flat, and pliable graft from the concha to cover the entire dorsum without severe crushing. Therefore, we had to cut the concha in several pieces, even when its contour was not so irregular. Besides, the smaller the pieces are, the less crushing they need to become flatter and softer, with less risk of affecting the chondrocytes’ viability. In addition, smaller pieces of slightly crushed concha have less tendency to warp. Another option to minimize risk of warping is removal of the graft perichondrium from both cartilage sites. However, this can affect the chondrocytes’ viability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12456196">10</xref></sup> Thus, we slightly scored the perichondrium, relaxing the posterior surface of the cartilage grafts.</p>
<p>Even crushed or morselized, though, the cartilage graft can occasionally cause palpable and visible dorsal irregularities due to intrinsic memory, and there is also the possibility for resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12456196">11</xref></sup> To camouflage the irregularities, several fascial grafts have been used for nasal dorsal contouring in rhinoplasty, such as superficial temporalis fascia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12456196">12</xref></sup> and fascia lata.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12456196">13</xref></sup> Daniel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12456196">14</xref></sup> suggested placing a layer of deep temporalis fascia on the top of the graft from the septum to create a more natural dorsal curvature. Later, Daniel and Calvert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12456196">15</xref></sup> introduced a modified technique, using cartilage micrografts wrapped in the deep temporalis fascia. However, harvesting the temporalis fascia carries the additional risk of permanent or transient alopecia. Besides, even a short scar situated in the temporalis area could be visible in bald or short-haired patients. Some authors have reported experience with the homologous material Tutoplast (Davol, Warwick, Rhode Island) to camouflage the cartilage edge visibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12456196">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The retroauricular fascia used in the present study is a permanent structure of the retroauricular area. It was demonstrated that the confluence of 7 structures contributes to its formation: platysma, trapezius, occipitalis, superior and posterior auricular muscles, temporalis, and sternocleidomastoideus fasciae. Some variations may exist, but these do not affect the quality and thickness of the fascia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X12456196">17</xref></sup> The retroauricular fascia has been successfully used in microtia reconstruction, in combination with costal cartilage grafts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X12456196">18</xref></sup> For aesthetic purposes, McCollough and Recupero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X12456196">19</xref></sup> used a strip of retroauricular fascia for lip augmentation as an alternative to other methods.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the technique we have described here is the first attempt to use the retroauricular fascia in combination with pieces of conchal cartilage or other cartilages in nasal dorsal augmentation. The retroauricular fascia is used as a carrier for the conchal cartilage. It adds some stability, smoothness, and thickness of about 2 mm to the “open sandwich” graft. According to our anatomical studies, the maximal dimensions of the fascia in the retroauricular area are 8 cm in length and 6 cm in width. But, in fact, the maximal dimensions of the retroauricular fascia that could be harvested through the incision in the retroauricular sulcus, at least in our hands, were 5.0 cm in length × 2.5 cm in width. These pieces of cartilage could be placed on the fascia asymmetrically according to the dorsal contour, and they could be fixed to each other and to the fascia either by sutures or with fibrin glue. Supplementary thickness could be achieved by superimposing the cartilage pieces, creating a multilayered “open sandwich” graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12456196">Figure 2</xref>). Fragments of other resected cartilages could be added to the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X12456196">Figure 5</xref>). In being placed on the undersurface of the “open sandwich” graft, cartilage pieces adhere better to the deep surface, ensuring stability of the entire graft. The absence of the visible dorsal nasal irregularities in our series can be explained by the fact that the fragments of auricular cartilage, being slightly crushed, are softer and smoother compared with costal cartilage. Besides, fragments of cartilage are camouflaged by the retroauricular fascia, which is rather thick and is “tented” with sutures. Furthermore, the fragments of cartilage are sutured in a “fish scale” manner, to avoid edge visibility.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The autologous composite graft described in our study consists of pieces of conchal cartilage and retroauricular fascia harvested through the same incision in the retroauricular sulcus. The postoperative scar is inconspicuous, and donor site morbidity is minimal. This chondrofascial graft is appropriate for slight to mild dorsal nasal augmentation but not for structural support. The method of augmentation allows balancing all 3 parts of the dorsum by placing pieces of the concha on the fascia in different manners, depending on the initial dorsal contour irregularity. Fragments of other nasal cartilages can be added to the graft to increase its thickness. In this way, the retroauricular fascia acts as a carrier for all cartilage pieces. Being placed upward in this composite structure, the retroauricular fascia masks any contour irregularities that might be present due to the cartilage underneath, especially in a patient with thin skin. It also allows for a smooth transition between the dorsum and the lateral nasal walls.</p>
