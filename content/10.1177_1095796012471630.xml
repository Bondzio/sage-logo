<p>To many labor and political activists, the food justice movement must seem like a well-intentioned but naïve or even misguided effort. Yes, low-income neighborhoods need better access to fresh, healthy food. Community gardens can help build a type of solidarity among those who work together to clear weeds, rehabilitate polluted soil, and grow tomatoes and peppers in blighted areas. In a few cases, especially well-organized projects, like Will Allen’s Growing Power in Milwaukee, create a few hundred jobs or make entrepreneurs out of people with few opportunities. But as Joel Berg, Executive Director of the New York City Coalition against Hunger, told me in an interview a few years ago, the real key to fighting hunger is not food pantries or urban gardens. It is improving the wages of low-income workers. If people made more money, they could and would eat better.</p>
<p>That is one of Tracie McMillan’s conclusions in <italic>The American Way of Eating: Undercover at Walmart, Applebee’s, Farm Fields and the Dinner Table</italic>, too. She ends her book by noting that Henry Ford understood that his success depended on
<disp-quote>
<p>the struggling workers of America. Anyone serious about changing anything about the American way of eating—whether it’s the way we grow our food, how we sell it, or how we eat it—will need to figure out how to do the same. (p. 241)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She also argues that we need to pay more attention to the challenge of finding time to prepare fresh food after working ten hours on the food prep line at Applebee’s, eight hours making not-so-fresh produce pass for fresh at Walmart, or a day sorting peaches or cutting garlic in the one-hundred-degree sunshine of California’s Central Valley.</p>
<p>Those three jobs provide the structure for this book. In a mash-up of Barbara Ehrenreich (<italic>Nickel and Dimed</italic>), Eric Schlosser (<italic>Fast Food Nation</italic>), and Michael Pollan (<italic>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</italic>), McMillan examines the system for getting food from the farm to the table by working “undercover” as a farmworker, in the produce department at a Walmart just outside of Detroit, and at an Applebee’s in Brooklyn. Interspersed with stories about how she found these jobs, what each entailed, and her interactions with coworkers, she provides lessons in the operations of the specialty produce industry, the way supermarkets manage the distribution of produce, and how chain restaurants rely on precooked, mass-produced food to ensure consistency and control.</p>
<p>Little of this will be news to readers who have paid any attention to writers like Schlosser and Pollan over the past decade. Nor does McMillan tell us much about these jobs that anyone who studies labor or who works with farmworkers or food service workers does not already know all too well. It is not news that harvesting fruit is labor-intensive and very poorly paid. While McMillan’s description of “crisping” limp lettuce and discarding mountains of rotten food at Walmart are interesting, did anyone expect a store that boasts of its low prices to offer the freshest or highest quality produce? The extent to which meals at a chain restaurant are reheated and assembled rather than cooked fresh might be more surprising, but the long hours, attention to detail, abusive but affectionate banter, and busy rhythms of the kitchen have been addressed by Anthony Bourdain and other chef memoirists.</p>
<p>McMillan provides extensive background information to provide a rich context for her on-the-job reports. Unfortunately, much of that data appear in long footnotes at the bottom of about a quarter of the pages of the book, a distracting strategy. The book might have been better if she (or her editors) had incorporated more of that information into the narrative.</p>
<p>If the conditions of these jobs are already familiar to many readers, and if the bigger picture is sometimes fragmented here, McMillan does offer several insights that make <italic>The American Way of Eating</italic> worth reading. First, like Ehrenreich’s <italic>Nickel and Dimed</italic>, she shows us these jobs from an unusual and compelling perspective. While the journalistic practice of pretending to be something the writer is not might be questionable in ethical terms, it allows McMillan to describe these jobs in a way that lets readers imagine what it would be like to do them. She does not pretend to show us what this work feels like to someone who has done it for seven or eight years. Instead, she shows us how hard it is to learn how to tell a ripe peach from one not quite ready, a process that has much in common with memorizing the placement of garnishes for 151 different dishes at Applebee’s. In the process, she invites readers to respect these workers and to recognize and appreciate how their situations are different from ours.</p>
<p>Especially when she recounts her experience as a farmworker, McMillan seems painfully (and appropriately) aware of her own privileges. McMillan acknowledges that her race and her situation give her access to better treatment and that she has options unavailable to her coworkers. After describing a bad bout with heat sickness, she reflects on the many ways her situation could be much worse:
<disp-quote>
<p>I could have to keep doing this job indefinitely. I could lack the resources to pick up and move to a more temperate climate . . . I could have a less friendly supervisor and could thus lose my job for spending an hour sitting in the shade . . . And I could be doing all of this without any legal status in the country, terrified that at any moment I’ll be forcibly returned to the border. (p. 50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She can, and does, quit each of her jobs, sometimes after just a few weeks, knowing that she has resources—education, money, connections—to fall back upon.</p>
<p>But McMillan also, almost inadvertently, offers a useful lesson here in a very different and crucially important set of working-class resources. At multiple points in her experience, she is taken care of—and often fed—by people she has just met. When she first arrives in the Central Valley, she stays in a friend’s trailer, and within hours of her arrival, several of her new neighbors arrive with bags of food they claim they cannot use. In Detroit, she rents a room from a Mexican-American single mother, who regularly invites McMillan to share her food. Together, they make huge batches of ceviche, with the landlady providing the more expensive fish and McMillan kicking in onions, lemons, lime, and cilantro. The people who help her survive—mostly Latina women—recognize that she is not making quite enough money to get by, and they find unobtrusive ways to help. In the process, they demonstrate the communal connections and collective survival that scholars have identified as key elements of working-class culture. Interestingly, that kind of collectivity seems less common in New York. While her coworkers at Applebee’s—mostly Latino men—help her learn the job and help when she gets overwhelmed, one also slips a drug into her drink one night and lets a friend assault her sexually. Despite that experience, McMillan’s narrative highlights the mutual caretaking of working-class communities.</p>

<p>Throughout the book and in a final chapter headed “A New American Way of Eating,” McMillan points to a variety of ideas for addressing the problems in the commercial food system. Her approach is, on one hand, admirably practical. Unlike some books that track large-scale social problems, she does not fall back on vague, unrealistic solutions or suggest that the only answer is a broad cultural shift. She does call for such consumers and policy makers to listen<disp-quote>
<p>to the people who work at Walmart, and the people who cook our meals, and the people who pick our food, too; they are far more versed in what it will take for them (and the rest of us) to eat well than I am. (p. 232)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But she does not stop there. Instead, she offers concrete ideas, including everything from cooking classes to helping people learn how to use the fresh food that is available to government intervention in the food distribution model currently dominated by large-scale retailers like Walmart.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while she ends the book by talking about wages, and while her descriptions of her work experiences suggest the need for improved working conditions, McMillan completely ignores unions and other forms of collective action as strategies for changing the workplace. She seems never to have spoken with an organizer or representative of the United Food and Commercial Workers or the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees unions. Her interactions with the United Farm Workers and other workers’ advocates seem to have been limited to efforts to find work. Instead of suggesting that organizing might help workers, she suggests that paying workers more would serve the interests of corporations and politicians.</p>

<p>In the end, although McMillan attempts to offer a worker-centered look at America’s food industries, <italic>The American Way of Eating</italic> suffers from the same problem that limits the food justice movement: a lack of connection with the movements that have, for decades, fought to improve the working conditions and wages of farm and food service workers. Without that perspective, even the most sympathetic account of working in food industries and even the most thoughtful, otherwise well-informed, discussion of why it is so hard for low-wage workers to eat well leave a bad taste in the mouth.</p>
