<abstract>
<p>Images of collective action shape public understanding of social movement campaigns and issues. Modern media includes more images than ever before, and these images are remembered longer and are more likely to elicit emotional responses than are textual accounts. Yet when it comes to media coverage of collective action, existing research considers only the written accounts. This means that little is known about the extent to which images of collective action events conform to or diverge from the “protest paradigm,” a pattern of reporting found in articles that tends to marginalize protesters and legitimizes authorities. The authors address this gap by analyzing newspaper photographs of one of the most significant recent cases of Indigenous-state conflict in North America—the 1990 “Oka Crisis.” This 78-day armed standoff between Indigenous peoples and Quebecois and Canadian authorities was sparked by the attempted expansion of a golf course onto Mohawk territory. The mass media produced thousands of articles and photographs in their coverage of the event. This article uses these photographs to assess the manner in which images frame collective action and collective actors. The authors find that images of collective action frame these events differently and in a more nuanced way than do textual accounts. For example, while challengers are just as likely to be shown in images of collective action, they are less likely to be specifically named. In addition, officials are more likely to be shown in dominant positions, but certain groups of officials (particularly government representatives) are also the most likely to be shown as emotional and angry. These findings illustrate the sometimes conflicting messages depicted in images of collective action.</p>

<title>The Visual Framing of Collective Action</title>
<p>A lone man carrying a shopping bag stands in front of and blocks a line of tanks. Four college students sit at a lunch counter. Soldiers surround a student as he places flowers into their guns. A Buddhist monk sets himself on fire as others look on. These descriptions will enable many readers to recall well-known photographs of collective action. Long after the historical details that surround these events are forgotten, these iconic images shape how the public understands the campaigns and movements from which the photographs were taken. Yet most scholars who study the media, social movements, and framing pay scant attention to these images, instead focusing on the written text that accompanies them. The lack of attention to the pictorial is a problem since like written texts, images also frame issues, causes, and movements. There is a strong likelihood that the frames presented in texts and images are not the same. However, the limited empirical attention given to images means that little is known about the media’s representation and framing of this visual dimension of contentious action.</p>
<p>A wealth of studies on textual accounts has shown that the media tends to marginalize movements for social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764211419357">Dardis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764211419357">Gamson &amp; Modigliani, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211419357">Hertog &amp; McLeod, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764211419357">Stamou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764211419357">Wolfsfeld, 1997</xref>). This is because the media’s coverage of protest and social movements generally conforms to a “protest paradigm” in which the press emphasizes the negative, violent, and irrational elements of protest and protesters while legitimating figures of authority by quoting them and therefore tacitly supporting their accounting of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419357">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764211419357">Rauch et al., 2007</xref>). This marginalization is the result of two sets of processes. First, the routines of news collection force reporters to work under intense time pressures on topics about which they are not experts. Therefore, they rely on authorities as quick and reliable sources. Second, because news agencies are commercial enterprises, they seek to maximize profit. Sales are maintained or increased by making stories that are as appealing and dramatic as possible; as a result, collective action tends to be framed as episodic, dramatic, and novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211419357">Boyd, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419357">Bridges &amp; Bridges, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419357">Smith, McCarthy, McPhail, &amp; Augustin, 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764211419357">1</xref></sup> Together, these two sets of practices make it more likely that media depictions convey messages consistent with the perspective of officials and/or present dramatic displays of collective action. Still, the majority of research on media coverage of collective action, including the studies cited earlier, is based entirely on the analysis of written accounts of protest. There has been no attention paid to the many images that accompany these written articles. As we aim to show, there is reason to expect that images and texts deal with the pressures of news routines and the pursuit of news values in different ways and, as a result, could offer different representations of collective action.</p>
<p>In this article we examine the role of images in news coverage of collective action via an analysis of newspaper photographs of one the most significant recent cases of Indigenous-state conflict in North America—the “Oka Crisis.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002764211419357">2</xref></sup> Between July and September of 1990, Mohawks, primarily from the Khanesatake First Nation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002764211419357">3</xref></sup> engaged in a 78-day armed standoff with Quebecois and Canadian authorities over the attempted expansion of a golf course onto traditional Mohawk territory. It was the first time in over a century that Indigenous peoples in Canada used force to resist state land encroachment. The mass media produced thousands of articles, often accompanied by photographs, in their coverage of the event. The large volume and the ongoing nature of the conflict make it an ideal case with which to examine the meanings surrounding imagery of contentious action. We therefore use these photographs to assess the extent to which images frame actors in the same way as textual accounts: as marginal, weak, violent, emotional, and dramatic.</p>
<p>In analyzing these images, this article makes two main contributions. First, we produce one of the first quantitative studies of images of collective action. While there have been a small set of studies that examine one image of collective action in detail (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764211419357">Skow &amp; Dionisopoulos’s [1997]</xref> study of the image “Burning Monk” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764211419357">Perlmutter and Wagner’s [2004]</xref> analysis of “A Death in Genoa”), there have been no large-scale systematic analyses of such images. We provide a new method for analyzing large numbers of photographs of collective action. Second, we assess how different groups of actors are framed in images of collective action. These images convey meaning about collective action events and reflect the media’s presentation of collective action and those who engage in it. We use the Oka Crisis to assess competing hypotheses about how collective action is visually framed.</p>

<title>Mobilization and the Media</title>
<p>More than ever, the public learns about collective action through the media. As such, media coverage is central to modern social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764211419357">Cottle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764211419357">Holmes Cooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764211419357">Kielbowicz &amp; Scherer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764211419357">Walgrave &amp; Manssens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764211419357">Wilkes, Corrigall-Brown, &amp; Myers, 2010</xref>). It has been widely shown that the media do not simply mirror events but refract what activists do and say through framing,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002764211419357">4</xref></sup> which is defined as the process of selecting “some aspects of a perceived reality and making them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764211419357">Entman, 1993</xref>, p. 19).</p>
<p>Images, like texts, serve to create meaning about actors and events and convey messages about the extent to which actors and their claims matter. The legitimacy of various groups is communicated through messages about their relative power and the extent to which they are behaving rationally and sympathetically. This messaging can best be understood to take place, like the framing of texts, both at the manifest and latent levels. At the manifest level, framing occurs by selecting which individuals are shown and what these individuals are shown to be doing (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764211419357">Goffman, 1979</xref>). For example, certain actors appear more often or are shown engaging in violent or aggressive acts. At the latent level, factors such as camera angle, whether the subject is looking at or away from the camera, and the relative size of the subject in relation to other subjects all serve to communicate underlying meanings about the power of the different individual(s) within a photograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764211419357">Iedema, 2001</xref>). A subject looking at the camera or who is larger than other subjects, for example, has more power than one who is smaller or looking away from the camera.</p>
<p>As there has been no large-scale, systematic study of images of collective action, theoretical models of framing are based on analyses of texts from written articles. Studies of textual framing show that in events and situations where there are multiple parties and claims being made, media accounts tend to give some actors, such as officials, and their claims more credence than others, such as challengers. The ultimate result is a tendency to marginalize challengers and a rendering of their cause as illegitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419357">McLeod &amp; Hertog, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764211419357">Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>). This marginalization occurs in part as a result of the propensity of media stories about collective action to emphasize violence, criminality, and deviance among challengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419357">Smith et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings are a reflection of what has come to be known as the protest paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764211419357">Chan &amp; Lee, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764211419357">McLeod &amp; Hertog, 1998</xref>). This paradigm of coverage refers to a system of reporting on protest events whereby reporters use a particular narrative structure, rely on official sources, and invoke public opinion in particular ways that, taken together, serve to marginalize protesters and their issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764211419357">Hertog &amp; McLeod, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764211419357">Stamou, 2001</xref>). Many empirical studies have demonstrated the prevalence of the protest paradigm across a variety of movements, concluding that by and large, challengers and their concerns are marginalized by the mainstream media, which tends to uphold the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419357">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764211419357">McLeod &amp; Hertog, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764211419357">Snow, Vliegenthart, &amp; Corrigall-Brown, 2007</xref>). For example, in a study of the global justice movement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764211419357">Boykoff (2006)</xref> found that five frames predominated in the media’s coverage of the movement: violence, inconvenience to others, “loopiness” of the protesters, ignorance of the protesters, and protesters’ lack of focus.</p>
<p>The protest paradigm occurs as a result of two processes: the structure of news routines and the search for news values. First, the media follow a set of “news routines” that lead them to select and feature certain types of stories and events. News routines are the day-to-day organizational and structural arrangements of news production. In general, routines of news collection require reporters to work under intense time pressures and report about topics on which they are not experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764211419357">Myers &amp; Caniglia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419357">Oliver &amp; Myers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764211419357">Ryan, 1991</xref>). Because reporters work under strict timelines and are constantly moving from one topic area to another, they come to rely on official sources who can be contacted on myriad of issues easily. This enables reporters to gather quotes and information on a range of topics quickly.</p>
<p>There are a number of specific routines that can illustrate these processes. For example, because newspapers still have to be published irrespective of whether any newsworthy events have occurred on a given day, events occurring before slow news days (usually Mondays) have a better chance of being included in the newspaper than those occurring on busier news days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764211419357">Myers &amp; Caniglia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419357">Oliver &amp; Myers, 1999</xref>). A number of scholars have also shown that some reporters have regular newsbeats—either locations (e.g., city hall) where they routinely go or issues for which they are regularly responsible, making these places and issues more likely to be reported about over time (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764211419357">Oliver &amp; Myers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764211419357">Ryan, 1991</xref>). While these aspects of news routines are structural, they have real consequences for the extent and nature of coverage allotted to different issues and actors. A result of these routines is the (sometimes) unintended consequence that certain voices are privileged over others.</p>
<p>Presenting challengers as irrational, weak, and violent occurs in part because of the way that the news is collected. In addition to the routines of news collections, the protest paradigm is a result of media actors searching for news value. At their core, newspapers and other types of media are consumer products. In order to maintain their circulation numbers, they need to feature stories that will be of interest to their readers. A story is said to have “news value” if it has novelty and drama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764211419357">Boyd, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764211419357">Bridges, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764211419357">Bridges &amp; Bridges, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764211419357">Shoemaker &amp; Reese, 1996</xref>). Novelty refers to any aspect of the story that departs from the usual. In the case of collective action, marches or demonstrations are now relatively routine and predictable ways to air grievances, therefore, these kinds of tactics tend to get less media attention than they would have in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764211419357">McCarthy, McPhail, &amp; Crist, 1999</xref>). Events are perceived as dramatic if they involve violence and/or destruction; this observation is the basis of the statement “if it bleeds it leads” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419357">Gitlin, 1980</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764211419357">Myers and Caniglia (2004)</xref> found that riots characterized by higher levels of violence and greater numbers of arrests were more likely to be reported by the <italic>New York Times</italic>. The news media has an interest in portraying collective actors in dramatic ways in order to increase their circulation and overall revenue.</p>
<p>The effect of news routines and the pursuit of news values on coverage of collective action have been well accounted for in past studies of textual framing of collective action. However, there are a number of challenges that arise from using past work on textual analyses of media articles as the basis for understanding the media’s visual framing of collective action. Newspapers have multiple interests. From the perspective of news routines, the way reporters collect the news leads them to often marginalize challengers, showing them as weak and irrational. From the perspective of news values, newspapers are pressed to show dramatic and sensational images of protest and protesters regardless of how they fit with the protest paradigm. Often these two interests are compatible; however, this is not always the case. To illustrate, the news routine of contacting officials for quotes, for example, would lead us to expect that officials will be painted in a positive light while challengers will be shown in negative terms. However, images of challengers in dominant or powerful positions are more sensational and therefore might have higher news values, garner more attention, and increase circulation.</p>
<p>These conflicting interests could be dealt with, in part, if the media presented different depictions of collective action in images than in the texts that accompany them. When comparing textual and visual framing of protest, clearly the images and headlines in newspapers are most likely to garner attention and are therefore important elements leading to newspaper profitability. Because of this, it could be expected that images of protest would be more likely to feature dramatic displays. At the same time, the text of articles might be more likely to emphasize the militancy of challengers, as shown in past work on a diversity of collective action campaigns, including the Oka Crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764211419357">Baylor, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419357">Grenier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764211419357">Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764211419357">Skea, 1993</xref>). The routines of news collection make it likely that reporters will rely on information from officials. It is possible that images and texts will depict collective action differently because of these conflicting needs.</p>
<p>In this article, we address the multiple interests of the media by examining the variation in the visual framing of the 1990 Oka Crisis. There are two reasons why the Oka Crisis is an ideal case for assessing these relationships. First, the event took place over a 78-day period, allowing for a wide variety of images, articles, and frames to appear over time. Indeed, years later this event continued to be the subject of intense media scrutiny. Second, all major and many smaller newspapers in Canada covered the event. This breadth of coverage makes it possible to compare across papers and over time. Before outlining our expectations about the visual imagery surrounding the Oka conflict and the factors that cause variation in imagery, we provide an overview of the event itself.</p>

<title>The 1990 Oka Crisis</title>
<p>The historical roots of the Oka Crisis date back several hundred years. During the 1700s, the governor of New France gave the Catholic Church land known as the Pines to be held in trust for the Mohawks of Kahnesatake. Despite this agreement, the Church later sold the land to the municipality of Oka who, in 1990, made plans to expand a local golf course (from 9 to 18 holes) onto the Pines. Although the Mohawks had at numerous times during this period attempted to regain their land, they were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764211419357">York &amp; Pindera, 1991</xref>). When their in-court attempts to stop the development failed, several dozen Mohawk Warriors and supporters set up a barricade. In response, the town’s mayor, Jean Ouellette, enlisted the help of the Quebec provincial police force, and on July 11, 1990, the police officers stormed the Mohawks’ barricades.</p>
<p>The raid ended in disaster. The Mohawk Warriors were also armed, fought back, and in the ensuing battle, police officer Marcel Lemay was killed. The police retreated and left behind several police cruisers that the Mohawks then used to reinforce their barricades. The image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764211419357">Figure 1</xref> shows a Warrior standing on top of one of these police cruisers. This image was printed over 25 times in Canadian newspapers and portrays an image of the Warriors as violent and aggressive. However, this image can also be seen to depict the Warriors as triumphant.</p>

<p>To show their support, Mohawks from nearby Kahnawake set up an additional blockade at the Mercier Bridge—a primary artery from the suburbs of Montreal into the city. The police countered with their own barricades, and by July 13, some residents of the suburb of Chateauguay began what would become nightly riots (replete with burning effigies) at the foot of the Mercier Bridge. In support of the Mohawks, many individuals, both Native and non-Native, traveled across the country to set up a peace camp at Oka Park. Scores of demonstrations in support of the Mohawks were held across the country. In some cases, individual First Nations set up road and rail blockades. Media reports describe the events as being part of a long, sometimes “hot,” “Indian Summer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764211419357">Chambers, 1990</xref>, p. B3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764211419357">Farquharson, 1990</xref>, p. A8).</p>
<p>Despite mounting pressure on authorities for a peaceful resolution, the standoff had not been resolved by August 20. On this date, then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney ordered 2,500 Canadian troops to replace the Quebec police. Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa asked the army to dismantle the barricades and they advanced into Mohawk territory. The next day, in anticipation of the risk of shooting, residents of the town of Oka and the community of Kahnawake were evacuated. Mohawks who were trying to leave Kahnawake in a 75-car convoy were attacked by a stone-throwing mob. Media descriptions at the time made a comparison between this incident and “Alabama in the 1960s” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764211419357">Valpy, 1990</xref>, p. A7).</p>
<p>By September 1, the Mohawks, consisting at this point of “thirty warriors, one traditional chief, one spiritual leader, nineteen women and seven children,” retreated to the Kanehsatake Treatment Center.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0002764211419357">5</xref></sup> The Mercier Bridge was reopened 5 days later. The army then cut off all telecommunication lines and prevented journalists’ access to the Mohawks. On September 26, the remaining Mohawks burned their weapons and walked away from the Center. While 34 people were initially charged on a variety of offenses, in the end, all but two men—Ronald Cross and Gordon Lazore—were acquitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764211419357">Binder, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764211419357">Laurent, 1992</xref>). In 1997, the Canadian government bought the Pines from the town of Oka, and in 1999 the Mohawks regained the legal right to manage this land.</p>

<title>Theoretical Expectations and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Past work on textual framing shows that because of the routines of news collection, most collective action and actors are covered in the media in a way that marginalizes them, portrays them as weak, and emphasizes their violence and irrationality. In addition, the media is a corporate entity that has an interest in showing collective action as dramatic in order to increase news values and circulation. Together, these factors shape how the media will cover an event like the Oka Crisis. In this article, we seek to assess how these different factors shape visual framing. So, for example, do images of protest tend to depict challengers as marginal, weak, and emotional/violent in the same way as do textual accounts (see e.g., analyses of textual media coverage of Oka by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419357">Grenier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764211419357">Skea, 1993</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764211419357">Wilkes, Corrigall-Brown, &amp; Ricard, 2010</xref>), or do they tend to show the strength and power of challengers in dramatic displays? In order to answer these questions, we compare the depictions of three groups of challengers (Mohawk Warriors, other Mohawks, and other First Nations) and three groups of officials (government representatives, police, and soldiers).</p>
<p>First, we consider who is most likely to be represented in images of collective action. The role of news routines leads to officials being quoted more often than challengers in textual accounts of protest. As an extension, this perspective would predict that officials would be shown more often in images of collective action than challengers. From the perspective of news values, we would expect challengers to be shown more than officials as they are more sensational and dramatic.</p>
<p>Second, we examine the extent to which different actors are marked as individuals. This can be operationalized in terms of whether individuals are named in the captions that accompany images. Being named is a key component of being represented. Because of news routines, officials are more likely to be known by reporters and are therefore more likely to be identified. Alternatively, as was documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764211419357">Gitlin (1980)</xref> in his study of the New Left movement of the 1960s, media has an interest in sensationalizing the leaders of challenger groups in order to increase interest in a cause or campaign. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764211419357">Gitlin (2003)</xref> notes, “sustained media performance requires a recognizable persona” (p. 305), and the media actively works to create media celebrities in order to garner interest in an issue.</p>
<p>In addition to the numerical representation and naming of various groups, we examine the relative power of the different subject types in images of protest. A powerful position would be, for example, when the subject is larger than other subjects in the image and when the viewers feel that they are looking up at the subject. The protest paradigm suggests that officials will be presented in more powerful positions while challengers will be shown in weaker positions. However, from a news values perspective, showing challengers as powerful can draw the attention of the reader.</p>
<p>Finally, we assess the legitimacy of the different groups. The protest paradigm would suggest that officials are more likely to be presented in a rational and unemotional way, whereas challengers are more likely to be presented as irrational and emotional. In addition, officials should be less likely than challengers to be presented as violent, for example carrying weapons. From the perspective of news values, the most sensational images are those that display violence or emotion on the part of either officials or challengers.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The photographs for our study were obtained from three sources—the <italic>Globe and Mail</italic>, the <italic>Montreal Gazette</italic>, and the <italic>Vancouver Sun</italic>. In 1990 the <italic>Globe and Mail</italic>, published in Toronto, was Canada’s only national newspaper. The <italic>Montreal Gazette</italic> is the largest English-language circulation paper closest to the conflict, and the <italic>Vancouver Sun</italic> is the largest circulation newspaper published outside Quebec and Ontario. We searched the indexes of these papers—Canadian Newsstand for the <italic>Montreal Gazette</italic> and the <italic>Vancouver Sun</italic> and the <italic>Globe and Mail</italic>’s own separate indices—using the keywords <italic>Oka</italic> and/or <italic>Mohawk</italic>. We then collected all articles that covered or mentioned the 1990 conflict, including stories about the Oka Crisis, the support blockade at the Mercier Bridge, various supportive collective action events that took place at the time, and the trial of the Mohawks involved after the event ended. Because there were many instances of articles that were about an entirely different issue but still included some reference to this event, we restricted our sample to articles where the Oka Crisis and related events were a major or significant focus. In all, this data collection approach resulted in 1,439 subjects that appeared in the photographs from 1990 until 2008.</p>

<sec id="section6-0002764211419357">
<title>Coding</title>
<p>Previous studies of textual framing have drawn attention to the challenges of coding frames. For example, some scholars have coded entire articles as having either an episodic or thematic frame (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764211419357">Smith et al., 2001</xref>), while others scholars have treated each reported speaker utterance as distinct (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764211419357">Ferree, 2003</xref>). Here, we combine content analysis with semiotic meaning interpretation. The unit of analysis for this study is individuals as they appear within the photographs (total number of individuals coded for all images was 1,439). We assigned each person within an image a subject number. We then coded the actors’ characteristics and body positioning within the photograph along a variety of dimensions. Actor characteristics include the type of actor (Mohawk Warrior, other Mohawk, other Native, government, police, soldier, other), gender, and age (child, adult, and elderly). We ascertained the type of actor by using information provided in the image, the caption, and the article that accompanied the photograph.</p>
<p>Our semiotic measures were selected to indicate the relative power and legitimacy of the various actors within images. Power was operationalized in two ways. First, we coded a gaze variable that indicated whether the reader is looking up, directly at, or down on the subject. A subject is powerful if the viewer is looking up at the subject and less powerful if the viewer is looking down on the subject. Second, we coded a size variable that indicated the relative size of the subject within the image. This variable had three categories indicating whether the subject took up less than 25% of the image, between 25% and 50% of the image, or more than 50% of the image. A subject is identified as more powerful if they take up a greater proportion of the image. In addition, we coded two indicators of subject legitimacy: whether the subject had an emotional facial expression and whether they were carrying a weapon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0002764211419357">6</xref></sup> We treat emotional facial expressions and the presence of weapons as aspects that decrease subject legitimacy. We also coded a number of characteristics of the photographs themselves, including the total number of subjects in the image and the newspaper in which the image appeared. At least two and sometimes three coders coded each image. Intercoder reliability was above 80% for all measures and varied between 82% and 100% agreement.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>When comparing the prominence of officials and challengers in images of contentious action, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419357">Table 1</xref>, we find that challengers are equally, if not slightly more, likely to be shown in images than officials. Raw percentages show that as a group, challengers represent 40.86% of the subjects while officials are 34.75% of the subjects in the images. Within these groups, Mohawk Warriors and other Mohawks are the most common individuals featured in images of collective action, with these groups appearing in 15.08% and 15.91% of photographs, respectively. Thus, while most studies on textual framing of collective action find that officials are quoted and cited more often than challengers, the aforementioned results indicate that this is not the case for images where challenges are featured more often.</p>

<p>In addition to appearing in images, being named specifically as a subject in a photograph is to be assigned a distinct identity and is akin to being quoted in a written account. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419357">Table 1</xref> indicates, officials are on average named 26.80% of the time while challengers are only named 21.93% of the time (<italic>t</italic> = 8.266, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000). In addition, there is significant variation within the groups. Within the larger group of challengers, Warriors are only named in 13.82% of the articles<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0002764211419357">8</xref></sup> while other Mohawks and other natives are named 24.89% and 29.57%, respectively. There is also significant variation in the frequency with which officials are named. While government officials are very likely to be named, and are named in 84.13% of the articles, police and soldiers are quite unlikely to be named, 3.89% and 2.98%, respectively. The high naming rate of government officials is likely attributable to the fact that they are already known to reporters.</p>
<p>The results in this table also show that the viewer of the photograph was more often looking up at challengers than officials. This is especially true of the Mohawk Warriors who appeared as higher than the viewer in 14.29% of the images (see e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764211419357">Figure 1</xref>). In terms of the relative size of different actors within images, government officials took up more than 50% of the image in 88.28% of the photographs. However, not all officials were equally likely to appear large relative to other subjects in the photographs. Police and soldiers were relatively unlikely to take over 50% of the image space. Only 27.92% of police and only 22.89% of the soldiers took up 50% of the image space. Consistent with the findings related to subject naming presented earlier, these numbers show the extent to which police and soldiers tend to remain anonymous within images. Some challengers were accorded more space. While “other Mohawks” and Mohawk Warriors were relatively likely to be accorded a large share of the image (42.36% and 41.47%, respectively) and less likely to be accorded small portion of the image (10.92% and 13.82%, respectively), other Natives were more likely to be presented as a small portion of the image (21.83%).</p>
<p>One core element of appearing as a legitimate actor is to be shown as rational and peaceful, although this clearly leads to less dramatic and visually interesting photographs with lower news values. When comparing images of challengers and officials, we find that there is no significant difference between these groups in terms of their propensity to have emotional expressions (<italic>t</italic> = −1.234, <italic>p</italic> = .218). When further breaking down the groups, however, it is notable that in fact, government officials are the most likely to be shown with an emotional facial expression (33.10%).</p>
<p>Finally, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764211419357">Table 1</xref> show that officials are much more likely to be shown holding weapons than challengers. It should be noted that weapons included more than just guns. We also coded actors who were shown throwing stones or hitting something with a stick, for example, as having a weapon. There is, however, significant variation among groups. Soldiers and the police are both relatively likely to be shown with weapons (59.20% and 29.87%, respectively). Among challengers, the Warriors are essentially the only group who were shown with weapons. While 34.10% of Warriors were depicted with weapons, none of the other Native group and only 0.87% of the other Mohawk group was shown with weapons.</p>
<p>The GEE models presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764211419357">Table 2</xref> show the relationship between subject type and whether the subject was named, the viewer angle, subject size, subject emotion, and whether the subject was carrying a weapon. These models also include controls for the gender of the subject, the number of subjects in the photograph, and the newspaper in which the photograph appears. Model 1 shows that other Mohawks, other Natives, and government representatives are significantly more likely to be named than Warriors, who are treated as the reference category. On the other hand, Warriors and police have equivalent likelihoods of being named, and soldiers are significantly less likely to be named than Warriors.</p>

<p>Models 2 and 3 examine the photograph angle. These models show that Warriors are significantly more likely to be presented so that the viewer feels like they are looking up at them than are police, other Natives, and the general other category. Models 4 and 5 show the factors associated with the size of the subject in an image. Because the size of the subject was coded as small, medium, or large, we estimated binary models: small versus large and medium versus large. The results indicate that compared to Warriors, other Mohawks are more likely to be framed in such a way that they appear large compared to other subjects. In addition, in most photographs, government officials are much larger than Warriors. It should be noted that government representatives are often a large part of the image because they are presented in head shots. While these head shots are not at all dramatic, head shots of major political leaders would be easily accessible to reporters and editors, who have routine access to these images for stories that do not have other images readily available. However, the selection of which groups of individuals are worthy of having headshots catalogued at newspapers archives and which individuals should have headshots attached to images is important. It is possible that headshots of leaders of First Nations groups were not catalogued for easy use and, therefore, they were not selected to accompany articles as often as were head shots of government officials. Police were more likely to be shown as a small part of the image.</p>
<p>Model 6 shows that compared to Warriors, other Mohawks, other Natives, and especially government representatives are significantly more likely to be shown in images as having emotional facial expressions. There is no significant difference between the expressions of the police and soldiers, on the one hand, and Warriors, on the other. The lack of emotional expressions among Warriors is in part because of the widespread use of masks among the members of this group. This can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0002764211419357">Figure 2</xref>. Called “Face to Face,” this image was the most reprinted photograph from the conflict and it appeared over 100 times in Canadian newspapers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0002764211419357">9</xref></sup> It depicts a masked Warrior engaged in a “visual” standoff with a Canadian solider. Worth noting is that the Warrior is larger and appears more powerful than the soldier. He also is shown holding a weapon, whereas the soldier’s weapon is hidden.</p>

<p>Because of the use of masks, it is difficult to gauge the Warrior’s emotional expression. The use of face coverings highlights an important way in which, in comparison with texts, images provide a forum for the agency of collective actors. While texts can describe a group as violent, angry, or irrational even if they are not, this could be more difficult to portray in images if it did not actually occur. Even though images can be framed and selected to show a particular version of the event, if the images are not staged, there are some restrictions on how they can be framed by photographers. The present analysis highlights this element of agency that visual framing offers for challengers.</p>
<p>Model 7 examines the presence of weapons in the images. Compared to Warriors, other Mohawks and other Natives are significantly less likely to be shown as having weapons. However, while soldiers are significantly more likely to be shown with weapons than Warriors, part of the general understanding of the role of a soldier is to possess and use weapons. The Warriors were as likely as police to be seen as holding and using weapons in the images analyzed in this project.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While there has been a large body of literature examining how the media depicts protest and collective action, studies have generally overlooked the ways that collective action is visually represented and framed by the media. As it is clear that images of collective action shape how social movement campaigns and events are remembered long after the campaigns have passed, this neglect hinders our understanding of how collective action is framed by the media. In this article, we addressed this issue by analyzing the visual imagery that accompanied newspaper stories of the 1990 Oka Crisis. While work on the textual framing of this event emphasized the criminality of the Mohawk Warriors and other groups of challengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764211419357">Grenier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764211419357">Skea, 1993</xref>), we show in this analysis that the images of this same event depict the groups in a somewhat different and more nuanced way.</p>
<p>In general, studies of textual framing of collective action show that the media frames officials more prominently than challengers. This general pattern is called the protest paradigm, and it is not well supported by our analysis of the images of the Oka Crisis. While the protest paradigm may be dominant in textual accounts of collective action, images reflect a different story. In fact, images represent challengers and authorities equally. This could be occurring because of news agencies’ concerns with news values and in elements that increase reader interest and circulation numbers, such as novelty and drama.</p>
<p>While showing challengers surely creates more dramatic displays, which increases news value, legitimacy bestowed on each group through the specific naming of individuals does not favor challengers in the same way. In fact, authorities were more likely to be individually named than challengers. This apparent conflict between being shown and being named speaks to the different demands facing the media. In effect, the presence of challengers in images increases news values and interest, whereas the lower frequency of naming challengers undercuts their legitimacy as actors worthy of being listened to and negotiated with.</p>
<p>As operationalized by the relative size within the image, our analysis also shows that officials are more likely than challengers to be featured in dominant positions. At the same time, challengers, particularly Warriors, were more likely to appear as higher than the viewer. There was also considerable diversity within groups. For example, within the authority category, while government officials were often presented as the dominant part of the image (taking more than 50% of the image space), police and soldiers were very unlikely to have a dominant role in the images. Clearly there is considerable variation within the broad groups of officials and challengers. Not all authorities are presented in the same light. While government officials are more likely to be named and appear large within the image, police and soldiers are very unlikely to be given this type of dominant positioning.</p>
<p>The variation within authority and challenger groups is an area for further research and inquiry. It is clear that the media do not treat all challengers in the same way. By depicting some groups as peaceful, rational, and legitimate, other challengers are depicted as violent, irrational, and illegitimate. This had been documented in a variety of other campaigns where the mainstream of a movement is contrasted with a radical flank. In the civil rights movement, the contrast between Martin Luther King and the Black Panthers illustrates this binary. Future work should examine these processes in more detail as they relate to images. In addition, more analyses are needed to assess how the framing of these groups in images changes over time and in relation to critical events. It is very likely that events during the Oka Crisis, such as the storming of the barricades, the killing of police officer Marcel Lemay, and the arrival of Canadian soldiers, impacted the photographic framing of different groups of actors. Consideration of these types of contextual changes would provide a more dynamic understanding of the visual framing of collective action.</p>
