<p>The attraction of anniversaries proves potent for publishers. As I write, I can see on my shelves the impact of Trafalgar and Borodino. Leipzig and, even more, Waterloo will soon be upon us. Most of the resulting works unfortunately take a familiar approach and, more seriously, do not add significantly (or even at all) to what we already know. Indeed, the challenge of intellectual relevance (as opposed to profitability) thus confronts the standard operational account.</p>
<p>There are fewer works that are innovative and even fewer that are both innovative and well grounded in a good knowledge and understanding of the sources. That helps explain the significance of Michael Hughes’ book. Hughes, Associate Professor at Iona College, New Rochelle, is doubly to be congratulated because, as I tried to indicate in my <italic>War and the Cultural Turn</italic> (Polity, 2011),much of the recent work on the cultural side of war is faddish and fails to adopt a critical stance, or indeed to engage with the extent to which the cultural approach is vague as well as porous.</p>
<p>Instead, Hughes offers a tight and well-grounded exposition and analysis of French military culture in the Napoleonic period in which military honour is presented as a dynamic element. Moreover, this honour is discussed as both individual and collective. The interplay of honour with the themes and ethos of a virile masculinity captures the Napoleonic drive as an active, quasi-sexual force, and helps explain military devotion to Napoleon as a crossover between sublimation and a coercive dominance of foreign women. As Hughes points out, songs about women and sex, and especially those that featured foreign women, often hinted at rape. Indeed, he argues that military songs challenged troops to demonstrate their masculinity and their patriotism by exploiting the libertine lifestyle that Napoleon’s wars offered. In turn, such conduct, as well as the humiliation entailed, helps explain the harshness of Prussian conduct in France in 1815, a harshness that was, in turn, to affect relations between the two states thereafter. A first-rate study that deserves wide attention.</p>
