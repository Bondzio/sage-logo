<p>This paper validates issues of nurse manager stress and coping, supporting findings reported in the United States and replicating these in a Canadian context. That the role of the nurse manager is a complex and important one to multi-level outcomes is well articulated. Despite the growing body of evidence, nurse managers across North America still continue to report overwhelming role complexity and insufficient supportive structures needed for personal coping and role effectiveness. At a time in history when our healthcare systems need nurses the most, ineffective nurse manager coping patterns and inadequate structures to help individuals actualize this role further threatens an existing nurse manager succession planning void. In desirably transparent healthcare environments, acceptance of a culture of stress without system-level interventions to address these issues no longer represents a sustainable alternative.</p>
<p>The authors allude to two possible areas for much needed intervention: span of control and therapeutic dialogue. The great variability in nurse manager span of control continues to be a major threat to the nurse manager’s ability to achieve satisfaction in their work, engage staff, and favorably affect organizational commitment. This is an area ripe for policy change and one which could go a long way toward strengthening nurse manager–staff relationships much needed to promote healthy practice environments. That nurse managers reported their interviews as opportunities for therapeutic intervention suggests the need for these individual’s voices to be heard and alludes to some of the loneliness inherent in this often ‘squeezed or sandwiched’ position.</p>
<p>This paper makes a valuable contribution to the evidence surrounding nurse manager work complexity and the importance of this much needed yet often neglected position. This reviewer commends the authors for researching this phenomenon and reinforcing the need for senior leadership action to better configure and support the pivotal nurse manager position.</p>
