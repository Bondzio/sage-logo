<p>David Crouch’s <italic>Flirting With Space</italic> is an interesting, compelling sort of book. It is difficult to place it because you do not see this kind of text about that much any more. It reminds me of Doreen Massey’s (2003) <italic>For Space,</italic>as a series of provocative essays around the central theme of geography, representation and experience. Here Crouch is given the space to lift off on ideas and lines of thought around several different painters, art projects (including his own) and everyday life. Perhaps this sort of work might be loosely described as ‘creative geographies’, although this is not evoked explicitly through the book. His writing is personal and passionate, hanging around a central notion of ‘flirting’, a flirtation with space which I want to deal with first before I move through other themes within the book.</p>
<p>Getting to grips with ‘flirting’ is, I suppose, quite difficult. Maybe this is very apt given the book’s title! The start of the book introduces the term, flirting appearing as a posturing away from urgency and volatility as the forms of relationality we are used to. Flirtation seems to be a much more subtle kind of relation, a soft and less insistent potential to happen. I did have a few problems with this setup, however, first because I was not quite sure how to read it. The book starts and finishes on the notion of the wave, but the figure of the wave also might describe how the book positions ideas and articulates them. In my own performance of reading-feeling-thinking-feeling-reading (or some scrumpled combination of that) <italic>Flirting with Space</italic>, I found the prose quite oscillating. How it writes a sort of expressiveness of space is really very well. One is swept along with feelings of feeling, or how to feel. But as it touches down in social and cultural theory I felt less comfortable and the writing continues as if in the vein of Virginia Woolf’s streams of consciousness. For instance, in comparing the intensities of Woolf and Thrift, he writes:<disp-quote>
<p>these urgencies deserve closer reference to complexities of living, interloping amongst other energies through which change, creativity, and the felt need to negotiate life as well as the significance of creativity amongst continuity and slowness that may be of no less power and significance. (p. 14)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although sentences like this certainly help give account to Crouch’s concern for the subtle and the less intense, making sense of the prose – in places – is not always that easy.</p>
<p>Another way the book describes flirting is as a kind of energy, Deleuze and Grosz and other thinkers help get us there. Energy is positioned as some kind of pre-personal affect but we never really see theorized how this energy is constituted or manifested until its articulation through the more empirically minded chapters. In fact, grounding some of the discussion in a little of the geography, as opposed to the poststructural thinkers, might really have helped – questions of theoretical consistency aside. What kind of affect is energy, or what kind of energy is affect? How might energy compare here to, for instance, Jennifer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512439156">Lea’s (2009)</xref> excavations of energy in yogic meditation? Indeed, what the book might add to recent debates around creative geographies would have been interesting to have articulated more fully. Conceptually, the book seems to flirt with geographical styles of thinking but without fully engaging in some of them as clearly as it could.</p>
<p>Crouch explores the artwork of Peter Lanyon and his performances in researching and exploring landscapes in order to develop themes, content and inspiration. Crouch describes these as performances of everyday abstraction. Lanyon’s artwork is particularly famous for its abstractions, but Crouch draws us into the immersive encounters with landscape necessary for Lanyon to perform, articulated through detailed, embodied and sensuous experiences and rich knowledge of place and texture. This seems a particularly important addition to research seeking to ground representations in their practices and doings and, even more nicely, turns a representational abstraction into a set of vibrant practices.</p>
<p>Parts of the book seem to look back upon Crouch’s work. Chapter 3 draws on part of his previously published research focusing on community gardens and caravanning. While it is useful to see this work placed alongside others, I did think that a few of the arguments could do with some updating. Geography’s empirical engagement with performativity has been ongoing for some time now, and comments which suggest otherwise must have come from earlier versions of his papers, which should really have been cleaned up.</p>
<p>Crouch’s approach is to make many journeys along the lines of the energies he is exploring, weaving narrative around different moments of travelling, from Sebald’s waiting passenger to writings on vacationing and the caravan experience. Here energy animates the commingling of practices of taking photos, finding stillness or talking about one’s holiday. Once again, I think the approach is effective and through these moments you see his energies at work, but it could have been more so by directly reflecting back to a more precise sense of what those energies are. In the sense of movement that animates the whole book, it may well be that some of the arguments are sometimes overstated, especially when Crouch thinks journeys in relation to notions such as mobility. For instance, are ‘feeling, performativity and becoming’ underplayed by the prioritization of individuals caught in Latourian nets to be shuttled elsewhere? Work on ‘new mobilities’ is certainly far more nuanced than this. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512439156">David Bissell’s (2009)</xref> research on passenger subjectivities, or Helen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512439156">Wilson’s (2011)</xref> on passenger propinquities would obviously provide contrasting perspectives.</p>
<p>In all, this is an interesting and valuable book. It could also be read as a retrospective on an important career in geography and art. It does come with some flaws and editorial problems, but it remains fun to read and essentially thought-provoking.</p>
