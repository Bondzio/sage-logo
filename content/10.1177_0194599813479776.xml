<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Four hundred fifty-two adult Medicaid obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients (404 ambulatory, 48 inpatient) receiving head and neck airway surgery form the basis of this report.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Ninety-four percent of the nasal, 86% of the palatal, and 79% of the nasal/palatal surgeries (89% overall) were ambulatory. The observed catastrophic complication rate among ambulatory patients was zero (95% confidence interval, 0.0%-1.1%).

<body>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder affecting 2% to 26% of the general population depending on sex, age, and body mass index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813479776">1</xref></sup> The prevalence of OSA in the general surgical population tends to be slightly greater than the general population, perhaps reflecting the different populations undergoing surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813479776">2</xref></sup> The majority of ambulatory surgery patients with OSA have not been properly diagnosed or have not received appropriate treatment preoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813479776">3</xref></sup> Many patients undergoing airway surgery are likely to have OSA without a formal diagnostic evaluation.</p>
<p>The frequency of postoperative airway complications in OSA patients is thought to be higher than would be expected following surgery. Oxygen desaturations, hypertension, negative pressure pulmonary edema, tongue edema bleeding problems, and airway obstruction have all been identified in OSA patients postoperatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479776">4</xref></sup> and may contribute to perioperative morbidity. Thick necks, short mandibles, increased comorbidities, and an increased sensitivity to narcotics are a few of the challenges faced by clinicians caring for OSA patients postoperatively. The severity of OSA may exert the greatest influence on the risk of postoperative surgical complication. Preoperative hypoxemia less than 80%, an apnea-hypopnea index of &gt;70 events per hour,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813479776">5</xref></sup> the frequency of apneas and hypoxemia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813479776">6</xref></sup> or severe OSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813479776">7</xref></sup> may singularly, or in combination, adversely influence the risk of complications. Others have found that the risk of increased complications may extend to individuals with mild OSA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813479776">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Practice guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea have been developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists to improve the perioperative care and to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with OSA undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures who receive sedation, analgesia, or anesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813479776">9</xref></sup> Recommendations were made that airway surgery in adults and tonsillectomy in children younger than 3 years with OSA not be performed on an ambulatory basis. Clinical judgment was to be used to assess the risk in individual patients. Other ambulatory surgery safety recommendations were included that covered equipment and surgical processes regarding OSA patients, difficult airway equipment, and the availability of respiratory care equipment, radiology facilities, and clinical laboratory facilities. As with the development of most practice guidelines, these recommendations provide basic guidance that is supported by analysis of the current literature and by a synthesis of expert opinion, open forum commentary, and clinical feasibility data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813479776">9</xref></sup> Although some authors have suggested overnight stays were not always necessary,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813479776">7</xref></sup> prevailing opinion, since guideline development, seems to favor overnight stays for airway surgery in OSA patients. More recent recommendations have continued to recommend overnight care for patients undergoing nasal, palate, and tongue surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813479776">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>To determine the actual incidence of complications associated with ambulatory airway procedures performed on patients with OSA, a retrospective cohort study of adult Medicaid patients was undertaken using administrative data.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599813479776" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The institutional review board at the University of Toledo approved this study. A retrospective cohort study of an adult Medicaid managed care population diagnosed on claims with OSA and subsequently undergoing nasal and/or pharyngeal surgery between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011, was performed. Data were sourced from administrative claims paid through January 31, 2011. Amerigroup had no policy regarding the site of postoperative management of obstructive sleep apnea patients, nor was any attempt made to steer the patient population during the study period. Data extracted for study purposes included demographic, geographic, diagnosis, and health care utilization information at the patient level. Two groups of patients were identified based on the length of stay, and the outcomes were compared between these 2 groups. The inpatient group was defined as patients who were discharged the next day or later following surgery. The outpatient group was defined as patients who were discharged the same day as surgery. The age-adjusted Charlson Index Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813479776">10</xref></sup> was calculated for patients based on the diagnosis to determine the relative risk of the patients and to determine whether a difference between groups required adjustment in the final analysis. The primary safety outcome of interest is any of the following adverse events occurring between 1 and 30 days following surgery: 1 or more inpatient admissions, 1 or more emergency room (ER) visits, 1 or more observation stays, and 3 or more physician visits. Secondarily, we assessed safety for each type of adverse event occurring between 1 and 30 days following surgery, as well as time in days to an adverse event where the number of outcomes allowed for valid comparison. For adverse events, we report incidence associated with specific <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> diagnosis codes indicating pain (780.96), dehydration (276.51), bleeding (459.0), airway obstruction (519.8), pneumonia (486), ventilatory status (v46.11), tracheostomy (519.00), pulmonary embolism (415.19), myocardial infarction (410.0-410.90), cardiac arrest (427.5), stroke (434.91), deep venous thrombosis (453.40), sepsis (995.91), acute respiratory distress syndrome (518.82), blood transfusion (v58.2), or aspiration (507.0).</p>
<p>Descriptive analysis of the study population and key outcomes was conducted. The distribution of each categorical demographic or clinical factor is described using the frequency and relative frequencies overall and by group. Differences in distributions for categorical demographic factors between groups were assessed using χ<sup>2</sup> analysis. Significant differences between groups were adjusted for in the inferential analysis as a confounder. The distribution of each continuous demographic or clinical factor overall and by group was assessed visually and tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Where values are approximately normally distributed, they are described using the mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval (CI). Differences in distributions for these continuous demographic factors between groups were tested using a 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test for equal variances. Where continuous demographic variables failed to approximate normality, they are described using the median and interquartile range (IQR, or 25th and 75th percentiles). Differences in distributions for nonnormally distributed demographic variables between group participants were tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Relationships between variables with significant differences between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
<p>To determine differences in safety between groups, we conducted several analyses against key safety outcomes. For the primary safety outcome and each secondary safety outcome, χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was completed. Type I error rate was set at .05.</p>

<title>Patient Population</title>
<p>Four hundred fifty-two patients met inclusion criteria of having sleep apnea and subsequently undergoing nasal and/or pharyngeal surgery between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2011. Forty-eight (10.6%) of these patients underwent surgery in an inpatient setting staying at least 1 full day, whereas the vast majority (n = 404, 89.4%) underwent outpatient surgery. No significant differences in age, state, or age-adjusted Charlson Index Score were noted between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813479776"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). A higher proportion of surgeries occurring in the inpatient setting was for male patients compared with outpatient surgeries (<italic>P</italic> = .03).</p>

<p>Prevalence of 3 or more PCP visits between 1 and 30 days following surgery was 0% for patients undergoing either inpatient or outpatient surgery. No significant differences between inpatient and outpatient groups were found in either raw or sex-adjusted odds of a subsequent inpatient admission following surgery. No observation stays following surgery were noted for patients in either group.</p>
<p>Fifty-one percent of the adverse events were pain-related diagnoses. Only 2 patients had an adverse event for a surgery-associated condition, both for dehydration.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study included 452 Medicaid patients from multiple surgeons in different-size communities, with a variety of available resources in 11 states across the country. Medicaid recipients, a population associated with a lower socioeconomic status, lower educational level, and fewer overall resources to cope with life issues, would be anticipated to experience a greater rate of complications than a more general population, as has been shown with other conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813479776">11</xref></sup> Despite these potential differences in resources, surgeons across the country have successfully treated the vast majority of these patients (89%) in an ambulatory manner. This reflects a growing trend across the country where the ambulatory setting is increasingly used for surgeries previously reserved for inpatient care.</p>
<p>Most important, the observed catastrophic complication rate among ambulatory patients was zero (95% CI, 0.0%-0.9%). The most common adverse events were pain-related diagnoses (51%), which is not unexpected given the inclusion of tonsil and palatal surgery and is reflected in the 2 patients who had an adverse event (dehydration). Despite having 452 patients in our study, a prior study by Kezirian and his coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813479776">12</xref></sup> had 3130 patients and demonstrated a serious nonfatal complication rate of 1.5% in a veteran population. We would have required a significantly larger study population to determine meaningful differences between our 2 study groups.</p>
<p>Our data derive from a high-level administrative data set, which limits our ability to look at a patient’s medical history or surgical experience in any depth. Although a smaller percentage of the patients stayed overnight, we are not able to determine the surgeon’s rationale for making that decision. Was the overnight stay preplanned? Or was it a decision made in the immediate postoperative period? Our data lack clinically relevant information, such as polysomnography study results, severity of sleep apnea, preoperative hypoxemia levels, continuous positive airway pressure use before or after surgery, the presence or absence of nasal packing, weight gain or loss since the diagnosis of sleep apnea, or body mass index, to truly know if the populations are similar for adequate risk adjustment. Finally, we have no control group for comparison. Ideally, a study group of patients who had similar surgeries, but no obstructive sleep apnea, would be needed to compare postoperative course.</p>
<p>Our analysis demonstrates the potential and the limitations of using administrative data to assess health outcomes. Despite case mix adjustment, the comparison of the performance between clinicians using administrative data is fraught with caveats. Clinical databases with their more detailed information might permit a better explanation of outcomes. However, clinical databases are expensive—in one study an order of magnitude greater than clinical databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813479776">13</xref></sup>—and hence widespread adoption will likely remain limited. Administrative data may be further distorted by the variable amounts of time, energy, and money expended by physicians and organizations optimizing reimbursement. That is, coding practices may make the patients appear sicker, but they do not change clinical outcomes. In these circumstances, caveats must be prominently acknowledged and conclusions must be drawn conservatively.</p>
<p>Prudence and caution should characterize the perioperative care of patients with OSA as these patients are at increased risk of airway compromise. We conclude the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0194599813479776" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Clinical judgment should continue to be used to assess the risk of perioperative complications in OSA patients undergoing airway surgery. The decision to engage in ambulatory surgery for OSA patients can only be made by the unique clinical assessment of the patient by the treating surgeon. All airway surgery does not require overnight admission (either observation or admission), nor should all be done ambulatory.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The routine postoperative admission of all OSA patients to the hospital following airway surgery is not supported by our data.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The goal of perioperative pain control should be the control of pain, not its elimination. Most oral narcotics (codeine, tramadol, oxycodone, hydrocodone) can cause respiratory compromise through respiratory depression and central apneas as all use the CYP2D6 pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813479776">14</xref></sup> Pain, through its stimulation of respiration, directly antagonizes narcotic respiratory compromise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813479776">15</xref></sup> permitting a greater margin of safety if narcotics are used in this patient population. Given the consequences of overmedication, infrequent postoperative provider visits related to pain may be not only unavoidable but also desirable in this patient population.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Administrative data sets can be used to provide insight into practice safety questions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Prospective clinical studies can be ethically conducted to conclusively support the safety of ambulatory airway surgery in OSA patients. The CHEER (Creating Healthcare Excellence through Education and Research) network is one such network that could be used to prospectively study this issue with patient-level data.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The mutual goal of physicians, hospitals, and managed care organizations is to provide the best care at both individual and population levels. This collaboration is important insofar as it allows an academic and clinical partnership between the various stakeholders in health care that can result in a better understanding of clinical disease and can serve as a basis for further collaboration and input from clinicians related to health plan medical policy.</p>
