<abstract>
<p>Over the past 10 years, human resources (HR) professionals have shown a tendency to underestimate the importance that employees place on employee benefit programs in terms of job satisfaction and employee attraction. Surveys show that employees value benefits over most other HR programs and that HR professionals are not in tune with those preferences. Possible reasons for the difference in opinion are that HR professionals are unaware of employee survey findings, the lack of respect sometimes given to benefit programs by HR professional associations and consultants and outdated job satisfaction studies cited in human resource and organizational behavior textbooks.</p>

<body>
<p>For many years, human resources (HR) professionals have shown a tendency to underestimate the importance that employees place on their benefit programs. For example, in 2010, Towers Watson surveyed about 10,000 U.S. employees and found that they ranked job security, base pay, health care benefits, length of commute and vacation/paid time off benefits as the top five job characteristics that would attract them to an employer. By contrast, 218 HR professionals surveyed in 2011 by Towers Watson reported that base pay, organizational mission and values, company reputation as a great place to work, career development opportunities and challenging work were the top five factors for attracting U.S. employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712464471">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This inconsistency is not a recent or isolated occurrence, as there has been a pattern of underestimating the importance of employee benefits to employees for at least the past 10 years. The pattern is evident in the results of two reliable surveys of employee and employer opinions about the important elements in the employment relationship. The surveys are conducted by the HR consultancy, Towers Watson, and the professional association, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM).</p>
<p>This article tracks the employee reward preferences in recurring surveys to show the value employees place on employee benefits in relation to other HR programs, as well as whether HR professionals are in tune with employee preferences. It also discusses possible reasons for and significance of the major differences of opinion between employees and HR professionals.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368712464471">
<title>The Surveys</title>
<p>Since 2001, Towers Watson has biennially surveyed a cross section of thousands of employees in hundreds of mostly medium and large companies in the United States to determine what attracts, retains and engages them. The elements include health care, retirement, vacation and other benefits, work–life balance, job security, base pay, career advancement opportunities, company reputation and other organizational programs and characteristics of importance to employees.</p>
<p>Since 2002, SHRM has sponsored annual surveys of a random national sample of about 600 working Americans to determine the key factors that drive job satisfaction. Respondents have been asked to rank the importance of about 25 factors that contribute to their job satisfaction, including employee benefits, work–life programs, job security, compensation, opportunities to use skills and abilities, the work itself, relationship with supervisor and an organization’s financial stability.</p>
<p>From 2002 to 2010, SHRM also has surveyed a random sample of 400 to 600 of its members to see what they believe are the most important drivers of job satisfaction for all types of employees in their organization. Towers Watson has provided this information only for 2011.</p>
<p>Although SHRM surveys are conducted each year, the focus here is on surveys in years in which economic or employment conditions were likely to influence the results or otherwise show a major change in employee or employer opinions. These surveys represent the closet thing we have to a national survey of employee reward preferences over a sustained period.</p>
<p>The surveys are discussed chronologically according to the date they were conducted, beginning with 2003, not 2002, for comparability with later surveys. For initial years, the top 10 factors are shown, and for other years, they are summarized.</p>

<title>2003 Towers Watson Survey</title>
<p>In April 2003, Towers Watson surveyed about 36,000 U.S. employees to determine what attracts, retains and engages employees. It characterized the period as one of downsizing and reductions in merit increases and bonuses. For example, pay increases averaged 3.8%% in 2002 and 3.3%% in 2003, down from 4.4% in 2001. The national unemployment rate rose to 6.0% from 4.4% at the time of the prior survey.</p>
<p>Towers Watson described employees’ mood as “rational endurance” or doing what it takes to get the job done to help their company succeed. Reflecting this mood, career advancement opportunities fell to fifth in importance from third, as heath care, work–life balance and retirement programs moved up in the rankings over earlier surveys. It seems as though in tough times employees attach greater importance to programs that provide financial security and have practical importance in their daily lives.</p>

<title>2003 SHRM Job Satisfaction Survey</title>
<p>In December 2003, SHRM surveyed 604 randomly selected U.S. employees on their job satisfaction. Although the economy showed signs of improvement and the stock market was revitalized, the mood of employees was probably largely unchanged from the rational endurance that Towers Watson noted in April 2003.</p>
<p>Employees were asked to rate 21 factors in terms of importance to overall job satisfaction, using a 5-point scale ranging from <italic>very important</italic> to <italic>very unimportant</italic>. The very important factors, and percentage of employees selecting them, were as follows:</p>

<p>A total of 429 randomly selected HR professionals affiliated with SHRM rated the same factors, in terms of their importance to the job satisfaction for all types of employees in their organization, as follows:</p>

<p>SHRM noted a substantial disconnect between the responses of employees, who placed a higher priority on financial, personal factors, such as benefits, pay and job security, and HR professionals, who predicted that employees would be more concerned about nonfinancial, relational aspects of the workplace, such as relationships with their supervisor and employee communication with senior management. HR professionals thought that employee benefit programs were the third most important factor for employees, who on the other hand rated them as the most important one, far ahead of relational HR matters.</p>
<p>SHRM noted that employees were faced with many stressors and sought practical ways with dealing with them—a job, benefits, salary, flexibility and safety. It also alerted HR professionals to the burden that larger health care co-pays, higher premiums and curtailed services placed on employees and to the finding that employee benefits were becoming more crucial to employee job satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712464471">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>2005 SHRM Job Satisfaction Survey</title>
<p>In January 2005, SHRM surveyed 600 randomly selected U.S. employees on job satisfaction, as well as 600 HR professionals. At that time, the economy was moving in a positive direction and the job market showed signs of expansion.</p>
<p>Although times were better in 2005 than in 2003, the top five factors driving job satisfaction were the same as in 2003. Employee benefits programs held the top spot in both surveys. As in 2003, there was a substantial difference between the responses of employees, who placed a higher priority on tangible personal factors, such as benefits, pay and job security, and HR professionals, who predicted that employees would be more concerned with relational matters in the workplace, such as relationship with their supervisor and management recognition of their performance.</p>
<p>SHRM speculated that employees were more concerned about their benefits than HR professionals may have realized. As in 2003, it noted that employees were being asked to pay more for health care coverage and were experiencing higher deductibles and co-pays. It also noted that there was talk of reductions in Medicare coverage and underfunding in the Social Security system, which served to increase the value of benefits and make them more salient to employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712464471">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>2005 Towers Watson Survey</title>
<p>In mid-2005, Towers Watson surveyed about 60,000 U.S. employees as it had done in the past. The survey was conducted when economic conditions were improved over its prior survey in 2003 and from the time of the January 2005 SHRM survey.</p>
<p>Over the previous 2 years, there was a shift in what it took to attract employees. Employee benefits declined in importance and other elements gained. Competitive health care benefits and retirement benefits, which were ranked first and fourth in 2003, dropped to second and sixth importance. Pay matters increased in importance, as competitive base pay moved from second to first in importance and salary increases linked to performance moved from eight to fifth.</p>
<p>Towers Watson thought the changes might have been due to improved economic conditions, as unemployment had declined and merit increase allocations improved over 2003. It said that employees were looking to share in the benefits of a good economy rather than trying to survive an economic downturn. Work–life benefits continued to have significant importance, ranking third in 2005 as they did in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712464471">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>2007 SHRM Surveys</title>
<p>In January 2007, SHRM surveyed 604 employees and 713 HR professionals. The economy and job market were the same or slightly improved since the 2005 was conducted.</p>
<p>The survey results show that even when economic times and employment conditions are good, benefits are of utmost importance to employees (ranked tied for first with pay) and that work–life benefits (ranked third) are very important. Results were also consistent with prior surveys in that HR professionals believed employees would place greater value on the relational aspects of work, such as relationship with supervisor (ranked first) and recognition for performance (ranked third), than on benefits (ranked fourth).</p>
<p>The results are also notable in that HR professionals were significantly out of touch with employees on the importance of work–life benefits, which they ranked as seventh in importance, as compared to third for employees, who had consistently rated them among the top five factors since 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712464471">7</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0886368712464471">
<title>2007 Towers Watson Survey</title>
<p>In the summer of 2007, Towers Watson surveyed about 43,000 U.S. employees. The survey was conducted when the unemployment rate was at 4.5% and pay increases averaged 3.8%. In addition, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at approximately 13,000, approaching its all-time high of 14,164 on October 9, 2007. Employees generally had a positive outlook about themselves, their employer and the future. Competitive pay ranked first, competitive health care ranked second and vacation/time off ranked third.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this survey is that a major benefit program—employee vacation/paid time off—was included for the first time. We do not know how important it was to employees in prior years, but it was very important in 2007 and may have reflected current working conditions. Claims were being made that employees were overworked and showing signs of stress, as some employers were reluctant to add staff to maintain recent productivity gains realized by tightly controlling headcount.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368712464471">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368712464471">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>This high ranking could also reflect the good times and tight labor market, which might have caused employees to de-emphasize primary benefits, such as retirement benefits, which dropped to ninth in 2007 from sixth in importance in 2005, and to focus more on secondary ones, such as paid time off/vacation, which are “nice to have” but not a “must have” when looking for a job in a bad economy. Finally, it is also possible that vacation benefits are always important to employees and that they should have been included in prior surveys.</p>
<p>The rankings of two work–life balance factors—convenient work location and flexible work schedules—also were high (fourth and fifth), which is consistent with the third and fourth rankings in 2005 and 2003, respectively, for the general category of work–life benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368712464471">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0886368712464471">
<title>2010 SHRM Survey</title>
<p>In January 2010, in the midst of the recession, SHRM conducted a survey of 606 employees and 568 HR professionals.</p>
<p>The results are consistent with prior surveys in that HR professionals believed employees would place greater value on the relational aspects of work than they actually did. The surprising result is that the disconnect between the HR professionals and employees’ ratings would be by far the largest of any in the past 7 years—employees rated benefits second in importance and HR professionals rated them seventh. These ratings were registered during a severe recession when the unemployment rate was 7.8% and after many companies had taken drastic actions to reduce personnel costs. According to an April 2009 Towers Watson survey of 141 U.S. companies, 72% of companies had laid-off employees, 60% instituted salary freezes and 29% increased employee health care premiums.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712464471">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>One would think that during a severe recession HR professionals would realize the importance that benefits would have for employees and rank them higher than seventh. It seemed that HR professionals were thinking along different lines, as they rated compensation/pay even lower at ninth in importance. Perhaps they thought that the worst of the recession was over and that employees had put financial worries behind them and would have a more positive outlook.</p>
<p>One other notable benefit-related change was the substantially lower importance given to work–life balance by employees who rated it 10th in importance, after rating it among the top five in all prior surveys. HR professionals agreed with this lower rating in 2010 and had rated it 9th in 2007. One possible reason for the decline was that during tough economic times employees were not terribly concerned about work–life matters, which in many cases do not have a direct financial impact on their lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368712464471">12</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-0886368712464471">
<title>2009-2010 Towers Watson Survey</title>
<p>In December 2009 and January 2010, Towers Watson surveyed 20,000 employees but did not report how many were employed in the United States. It also did not provide a full set of results as in past years, just the top three drivers of attraction. Although brief, the results were telling in terms of the importance of employee benefits, as sufficient vacation and competitive health care benefits ranked second and third in importance, respectively, behind competitive salary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368712464471">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The survey, however, did not include job security as an element for attracting employees. When it was included in a 2011 Towers Watson unpublished employee survey, it ranked first, followed in order by base pay, health care benefits, length of commute and vacation. This ranking was consistent with Towers Watson’s belief that employees had a strong back-to-basics orientation of what they wanted from an employer. Employees were focused more on the practical aspects of a job, such as pay and benefits, and less on intangibles, such as the reputation of their employer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886368712464471">
<title>2011 SHRM Survey</title>
<p>The 2011 SHRM survey process is noteworthy in several respects. First, employees did not rank employee benefits among the top two drivers of job satisfaction, as in past surveys. Second, SHRM did not survey HR professionals. Third, the survey effort was expanded to cover employee engagement in addition to employee job satisfaction.</p>
<sec id="section11-0886368712464471">
<title>Employee Survey Results</title>
<p>Six hundred randomly selected employees ranked the following 10 elements as most important for their job satisfaction:</p>
<list id="list4-0886368712464471" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Job security: 63%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Opportunities to use skills and abilities: 62%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Organization’s financial stability, relationship with immediate supervisor: 55%</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Overall corporate culture: 46%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Work–life balance: 38%</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This was the first year that benefits, which were tied for fifth in importance, were not ranked by employees as first or second. On closer examination, however, the ranking of fifth may not be substantially inconsistent with prior years for several reasons. First, a new factor, an organization’s financial stability, which employees rated third in importance in 2011, was first introduced in the survey in 2009, which increased the chances of employee benefits being rated lower over prior surveys.</p>
<p>Second, the fifth position ranking in 2011 was based on responses of 53% of employees, which is not much lower than the responses for the fourth (compensation/pay at 54%) and third (organization’s financial stability at 55%) highest rated factors.</p>
<p>Third, the 2011 employee survey sample included more baby boomers (people born between 1945 and 1964) than the 2010 sample. In 2011, baby boomers did not rank benefits in their top five job satisfaction factors, as in prior years. For these reasons, we must look at the forthcoming 2012 survey and later surveys to see if the importance employees assign to benefits is truly declining.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368712464471">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886368712464471">
<title>Rankings of HR Professionals</title>
<p>This was the first year that SHRM did not survey its members to get their thoughts on what employees would rate important for job satisfaction. No reasons could be located for the change. One possible one is that the historical gap between employee and HR professionals’ opinions on the importance of benefits was not being closed, even though benefits were consistently being rated as number one or two in importance, except in 2011. HR professionals had never rated benefits at the same or higher level than employees from 2003 to 2010, and in 2010 rated them seventh in importance.</p>
<p>HR professionals generally predicted that nonfinancial relational HR matters, such as the employee’s relationship with his or her supervisor and management recognition of employee performance, would be more important to employees than they actually were. In simple terms, HR professionals did not seem to know about or give value to what employee surveys said about job satisfaction, as shown repeatedly in their association’s survey reports for 7 years. Consequently, reporting the opinions of HR professionals might have seemed like a futile exercise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886368712464471">
<title>Employee Engagement</title>
<p>In 2011, SHRM decided to survey employees to learn whether they were engaged in their work, in addition to being satisfied by it, as it had done since 2002. Employee engagement surveys are far more common than job satisfaction surveys. Job satisfaction surveys predate engagement surveys in the business world by at least 30 years, and SHRM seems to be the only major organization still conducting them on a broad scale.</p>
<p>SHRM provided this rationale for adding engagement surveys<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368712464471">14</xref></sup>:<disp-quote>
<p>Job satisfaction refers to how employees feel about their compensation, benefits, work environment, career development and relationship with management. Employee engagement is about employees’ commitment and connection at work—what is motivating employees to work harder, who is motivating them to work harder and what conditions are motivating them to work harder.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many organizations that survived the recession are relying on their workforce to help them stay ahead of their competitors and manage their bottom line. Because of the recession and slow recovery, organizations’ resources have been stretched, and some employees may be feeling fatigued, dissatisfied and disengaged.</p>
<p>Why should organizations care about their workforce engagement level? Many studies have linked employee engagement to employee performance, customer satisfaction, productivity, absenteeism, turnover and support of the organization. (p. 37)</p>
<p>As noted previously, Towers Watson has conducted extensive surveys to determine what attracts, retains and engages employees. Its research has shown that the factors that attract employees are very similar to those that satisfy them, as measured in the SHRM surveys, a connection organizational psychologists made in the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368712464471">15</xref></sup> Benefits are not among the factors that retain employees, as measured in organizational commitment surveys, and engage them. When SHRM identified conditions for creating employee engagement, competitive employee benefits were not among the items employees could rate.</p>
<p>As noted by SHRM, many employers want employees who are more than satisfied or happy with their jobs; they want those who are committed and willing to give extra effort to get the job done. Thus, there is a tendency to de-emphasize the aspects of work that mainly satisfy employees. Employee benefits are a prime example of this type of reward. Benefits are necessary to hire desirable employees but do little to motivate them and are at the bottom of the rewards hierarchy when it comes to getting the work done. Thus, SHRM seems to be moving beyond job satisfaction and into employee engagement, perhaps because it feels that it is more important for HR professionals to understand what engages employees than satisfies them. This line of thinking can serve to lower the regard for benefits.</p>
<p>This account reflects much of the current thinking with regard to rewards, but some HR experts and organizational psychologists have noted holes in the logic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368712464471">16</xref></sup> One weakness is that the concept of employee engagement has a job satisfaction component.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368712464471">17</xref></sup> For example, we do not know to what extent employees who are dissatisfied with their job can also be engaged.</p>
<p>An even larger weakness is that Gallup researchers determined that the correlation between the Gallup instrument for measuring engagement and methods for measuring job satisfaction was .91, which means that there is roughly an 80% overlap in what the two concepts address.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368712464471">18</xref></sup> And some organizational psychologists have found that although job satisfaction does not drive employee performance, organizations with more satisfied employees are more productive than those with fewer. They point out that the interactions and complexities of the work process cannot be overlooked, and we must consider unit-level productivity as well as individual productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0886368712464471">19</xref></sup> Thus, downplaying the importance of job satisfaction, and thereby one of its most important drivers, employee benefits, may not be a good idea if the goal is a productive workforce.</p>
<p>Another indication that employee benefits are undervalued was Towers Watson’s decision in 2007 to include vacation/time off benefits in its surveys for the first time. After being added, it ranked third in importance that year for attracting employees, and subsequently has been among the top five. We do not know where it would have ranked before 2007, but it appears as though it was not receiving credit as an important factor for attracting employees.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In summary, there is good evidence that employees place a high value on their employee benefit programs with respect to what attracts them to an employer and satisfies them once on board. For about the past 10 years, employee surveys by Towers Watson have consistently shown that competitive health care and vacation/paid time off benefits are among the top 5 factors that attract employees to an organization and that retirement benefits are usually among the top 10. Over the same period, surveys by SHRM have shown that employees consider employee benefit programs to be among the top 2 aspects of work that drive job satisfaction. This pattern exists in good and bad economic times.</p>
<p>Over the same period, surveys by Watson Wyatt and SHRM have shown that HR professionals have not fully acknowledged the value employees assign to their benefits. Surveys by SHRM clearly show that its members erroneously believe that other HR programs are more important to employees’ job satisfaction than employee benefit programs. In 2011, Towers Watson’s survey of HR professionals showed that they believed that the top five drivers of employee attraction were not benefit programs, in contrast to employees who included health care and paid time off benefits in their list of the top five attraction drivers.</p>
<p>At times, the survey providers have displayed a tendency to undervalue benefits when constructing and selecting their survey instruments. For years, a major HR consultancy did not include paid time off/vacation benefits in their employee surveys, only to find out that when they did, the programs were rated very important for employee attraction. SHRM has stopped surveying its membership on the importance of benefits for employee satisfaction, as if their members’ lack of knowledge of their importance was unimportant. SHRM also does not appear to realize that job satisfaction, which is significantly driven by employee benefit programs, is an important component of, and by some accounts, a very close relative of, employee engagement.</p>

<title>Final Thoughts</title>
<p>It is difficult to know why benefits are not being given the credit they deserve in employment relationships, as studies on the subject are hard to find. But there are a few plausible reasons. One is that many HR professionals are unaware of the research discussed here, even when published by their own professional association and a major HR consultancy.</p>
<p>Another is that HR scholars may be leading them astray. Several textbooks on organizational behavior and human resources state that the work itself, pay, promotional opportunities, supervision and coworkers are the most important drivers of job satisfaction. This line of thought is usually supported by research done before 1970 that did not typically include employee benefits among the factors that employees could relate to job satisfaction, as the importance of benefits to employees at that time was not a great as it is today.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0886368712464471">20</xref></sup> No reference is made in current texts to the results of the persuasive surveys covering the past 10 years that are discussed here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0886368712464471">21</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368712464471"/>-<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0886368712464471">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, HR professionals may be resisting the idea that employees place substantial importance on having competitive benefit programs. This tendency might be due to a low regard for the role benefits play in the employment relationship. Employee benefits are commonly seen as entitlements that contribute significantly to personnel costs but do little to drive employee performance. In addition, benefits are often associated more with job satisfaction than with the more highly valued employee concepts of engagement and motivation.</p>
<p>HR professionals must accept the fact that employee benefits are of the utmost importance to employees and look for ways to create competitive advantages by designing and administering cost-effective benefit programs that improve their organization’s ability to attract and engage the best talent. And it may require benefit professionals to make the case for their function by citing and participating in surveys that show how important benefits are to employees and to an organization’s success.</p>
