<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the effect that loyalty and tourist satisfaction with a sporting event have on visitors’ behavioural intention not only to revisit and recommend the event but also to revisit and recommend its nearby tourist destinations. The quantitative analysis is based on 343 self-administered questionnaires collected among the visitors of the Biathlon World Cup 2009 in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. The satisfaction variables were reduced to three factors: Services, Price, and Accessibility. Through the computation of numerous Logit models, this study shows that there is a positive relationship between the three satisfaction factors and the behavioural intention to revisit and recommend the event and its nearby tourist destinations to friends and relatives. Furthermore, loyalty to the event is strongly and positively related with the intention to revisit the event in the near future but not to revisit the destination or to recommend it to friends and relatives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent decades festivals and events have become a new and alternative type of tourist attraction to mature and new destinations worldwide. Due to the importance of festivals and events in the development or rejuvenation of tourist destinations, the analysis of repeat visits and loyalty to events has become of significant importance. Repeat visits and destination loyalty have been investigated with considerable research over the past three decades; however, despite the recent increase of interest in the field of events (see Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356766711428803">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356766711428803">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356766711428803">Shanka and Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1356766711428803">Yoon et al., 2010</xref>), a review of the literature shows that little attention has been given to repeat visitation of sporting events in particular (for other research work on the topic see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356766711428803">Hill and Green, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>When analysing destination loyalty, researchers are initially challenged with determining what repeat visits and loyalty are. As identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428803">Kozak (2001</xref>), early studies on this topic divide the frequency of repeat visitation into ‘infrequent’, ‘frequent’ and ‘very frequent’; however, they do not explain the number of visits, which identify each category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711428803">Gitelson and Crompton, 1984</xref>). Sequentially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356766711428803">Oppermann (1999</xref>) proposed a classification of destination loyalty as a function of multiple visits: infrequent tourists are classified as ‘somewhat loyal’, regular as ‘loyal’ and annual and biannual as ‘very loyal’. Although this classification is based on a more measurable concept, it is still difficult to determine loyalty behaviour only on the basis of strict frequency counts. </p>
<p>In the general literature on both product and tourism marketing, several studies have focused on first time and repeat purchase. In the tourism literature, attention is mainly given to repeat visits and the intention to revisit the same destination in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766711428803">Court and Lupton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711428803">Gitelson and Crompton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428803">Kozak, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356766711428803">Mazursky, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356766711428803">Woodside and Lysonski, 1989</xref>). An overview of previous research demonstrates that repeat tourists are more likely than other visitors to choose the same destination for their future holidays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356766711428803">Gyte and Phelps, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356766711428803">Juaneda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428803">Kozak, 2001</xref>). Further studies conducted a deeper analysis and showed that it is not the destination but particular attributes to which the tourists are loyal to that attract repeat visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766711428803">Baker and Crompton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766711428803">Kozak and Rimmington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356766711428803">Ross, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, satisfaction is another concept employed in the analysis of repeat visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356766711428803">Baker and Crompton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766711428803">Chi and Qu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766711428803">Cole and Illum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428803">Hallowell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711428803">Lee and Beeler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356766711428803">Schofield and Thompson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering past research, the objectives of this study are as follows: 1) investigate the extent to which past event experiences influence repeat visits; 2) determine the relationship between the level of tourists’ satisfaction, repeat visits and their intention to return and recommend the event and nearby tourist destinations to friends and relatives. </p>
<p>The contribution of this article to the literature lies in the analysis of previous visits to the event and how this influences the intention to revisit not only the event, but also, in other periods of the year and for other leisure purposes to revisit the destination that hosts the event, the nearby destinations, and the likelihood of recommending these destinations to friends and relatives. Festivals and events are an aid for the development of new destinations or rejuvenation of mature destinations because they bring tourists to the destination and its surrounding area during the event. However, do they also entice tourists to the destination and the surrounding areas in other periods of the year (i.e. creating a sort of destination loyalty)? Past research works have concentrated on repeat visitations, loyalty and satisfaction to single events or destination; however, no connection has been done in terms of event loyalty and destination recommendation and loyalty. For these reasons, this article will investigate three concepts: i) repeat visitations and event loyalty; ii) the influence of event loyalty on destination recommendation and loyalty; and iii) the influence of satisfaction on destination recommendation and loyalty.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is divided into three main parts. In part 1 the theoretical framework presents a review of the literature on attendance motivation, satisfaction, and how these relate to repeat visits and loyalty. Part 2 presents the objectives of the research and the methodology; and the third part presents the results of the Factor Analysis and the Logit models. This article extends the theoretical knowledge as it investigates the impacts of events not only on the destination hosting the event, but also on nearby destinations. </p>

<title>Event motivations and repeat visits</title>
<p>The opportunity sets of destinations, and the choice of visiting a particular tourist area have drawn significant attention from researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428803">Kozak, 2001</xref>), highlighting the role of variables as psychological, economic, demographic, media and communication, and previous experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356766711428803">Ankomah et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766711428803">Court and Lupton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711428803">Gitelson and Crompton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766711428803">Mayo and Jarvis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356766711428803">Um and Crompton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356766711428803">Woodside and Lysonski, 1989</xref>). </p>
<p>When the tourist attraction is a festival or event, a core set of motives for event participation exists, irrespective of event theme, location, or origin of event attendees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711428803">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). In the last few decades, researchers have identified a number of attendance motives specifically connected with events. As identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356766711428803">Schofield and Thompson (2007</xref>), the desire to ‘escape’ has been identified as a ‘push’ factor in a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711428803">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711428803">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766711428803">Mohr et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356766711428803">Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766711428803">Schneider and Backman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766711428803">Uysal et al., 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766711428803">Uysal et al. (1993</xref>) proposed event novelty as a pull factor. This motivation dimension has some parallels with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356766711428803">Crompton’s (1979)</xref> categorization of socio-psychological motives. Novelty and curiosity have also been identified as pull factors by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711428803">Backman et al. (1995</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766711428803">Schneider and Backman (1996</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356766711428803">Scott (1996</xref>). These early studies have paved the way for further analysis on the difference between novelty, curiosity, desire for adventure and excitement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711428803">Formica and Uysal, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711428803">Lee, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, a relevant dimension taken into analysis in festival motivation research is socialization and the desire to meet new people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711428803">Backman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356766711428803">Chang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356766711428803">Crompton and Mackay, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766711428803">Formica and Uysal, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711428803">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711428803">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711428803">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766711428803">Mohr et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766711428803">Schneider and Backman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356766711428803">Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766711428803">Uysal et al., 1993</xref>). </p>
<p>When explaining the socialization dimension, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356766711428803">Schofield and Thompson (2007</xref>) rely on the work of Crompton and Mackay (1997) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711428803">Lee (2000</xref>) who found a distinction between the desire to spend time with friends and associates (known-group socialization) and the appeal of meeting new people (external interaction/socialization). Related to known-group socialization is family togetherness, which has also emerged from a number of studies as a significant event motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356766711428803">Backman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356766711428803">Formica and Uysal, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356766711428803">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356766711428803">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356766711428803">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356766711428803">Mohr et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356766711428803">Schneider and Backman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356766711428803">Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1356766711428803">Uysal et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Once a potential event attendee feels the motivation (whether it is push or pull factor) to visit an event, the second step a potential attendee has to decide is what event to attend. Events are characterized by the delivery of a service, where atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356766711428803">Prentice and Andersen, 2003</xref>) and experience are a core component of the product itself. As such, its consumers differ in purchasing behaviour from consumers of goods. Services are characterized by being not directly perceptible, frequently experimental and often unpredictable in their outcomes. As such, their performance evaluation is normally possible only after purchase and consumption. This characteristic of all services, including events, increases the degree of uncertainty. Several strategies are available to potential event attendees to avoid uncertainty and reduce risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356766711428803">Osti et al., 2009</xref>). Some involve a deeper and longer information search and information processing (acquisition of additional information and more extensive information process), and some relate to brand loyalty and trust (repeat visits to the same event). In fact, risk aversion has been repeatedly identified as a motivation to revisit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356766711428803">Bongkosh et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, past studies have demonstrated that previous visits are one of the factors affecting potential tourists’ choice of a destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356766711428803">Court and Lupton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356766711428803">Crompton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356766711428803">Gitelson and Crompton, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356766711428803">Kozak and Rimmington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356766711428803">Mayo and Jarvis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356766711428803">Milman and Pizam, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356766711428803">Um and Crompton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1356766711428803">Woodside and Lysonski, 1989</xref>). Potential tourists are expected to have limited knowledge about the attributes of a particular destination of which they have no previous experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1356766711428803">Um and Crompton, 1990</xref>). Therefore, familiarity with a destination may produce a tendency to quickly select or reject it and may even influence neighbouring choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428803">Kozak, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1356766711428803">
<title>Satisfaction and intention to revisit</title>
<p>As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428803">Kozak (2001</xref>: 789), ‘satisfaction or dissatisfaction can be regarded as a measure of performance and the ability to manipulate it is an important source of competitive advantage’. The concept is not new and has been recently discussed also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356766711428803">Meng et al. (2008</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356766711428803">Andriotis et al. (2008</xref>). The rationale for analysing the level of satisfaction with destination facilities and services in tourism-based consumer behaviour studies lies in the fact that satisfaction is expected to affect the intention to return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356766711428803">Naylor and Bardi, 2002</xref>); thus, increasing satisfaction will result in increased repeat visits in the absence of counter moves by competitors. To this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356766711428803">Cole and Illum (2006</xref>) state that: <disp-quote>
<p>It is commonly believed that high level of service quality will produce satisfied visitors who are more likely to spread positive word-of-mouth, and to be repeat visitors. Without continued and/or increased participation, many of these festivals will have a difficult time to justify the required financial support from the communities where they take place. (p. 161)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, as stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711428803">Lee and Beeler (2009</xref>), nowadays festivals and events have been recognized as important factors in the development of tourism destinations, and the number of local events will increase and lead to heightened competition. Therefore, in order to remain competitive event managers must identify the factors that not only attract and satisfy new visitors, but also create repeat attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711428803">Lee and Beeler, 2009</xref>). In Lee and Beeler’s study, these factors proved to be service quality and involvement in the event. Festival attendees resulted to be more satisfied when they perceived higher quality in cleanliness and visual appearance of the festival site and a feeling of safety. Moreover, when visitors where highly involved in the programs and activities offered by the festival, they were more likely to be satisfied and express intention to return in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356766711428803">Lee and Beeler, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>When studying repeating visitation to a holiday destination, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766711428803">Alegre and Cladera (2006</xref>) found that repeat visitors are more likely to revisit it again than first timers; however, this probability also depends heavily on their declared level of satisfaction. For repeat visitors, an unsatisfactory experience has a slightly less negative effect on a possible future visit than for first timers. The reason for this could be that previous experiences and a possible sense of place attachment lessen the impact of an unsatisfactory visit. Those involved in tourism planning and management should be conscious of this factor. That is to say that although a bad experience considerably reduces the probability of a further visit by a repeat visitor, prior experience of the destination or a sense of attachment to it can lessen the impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356766711428803">Alegre and Cladera, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711428803">Rittichainuwat et al. (2002</xref>) provide an insight on the correlation between satisfaction and likelihood to revisit Thailand. They found out that travellers’ satisfaction on the quality, service, value of lodging and restaurant had a positive impact on the likelihood of revisiting. It can be concluded that the higher satisfaction travellers have toward their trip, the more likely they would revisit a travel destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356766711428803">Rittichainuwat et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings confirm the results of previous studies indicating that there is a positive relationship between product satisfactions and repurchase intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766711428803">Chi and Qu (2008</xref>) provide a brief overview of past research conducted on satisfaction and post-purchase behaviour demonstrating a well-established link between the two dimensions. They further assert that satisfaction leads to repeat purchase and positive word-of-mouth recommendation in the post consumption phase. This is because the intention to repeatedly purchase a product or a service also depends upon the level of customers’ satisfaction with the product or service: if customers are satisfied with a product, service or destination, they will be more likely to continue to purchase; similarly, if they are dissatisfied, they will be more likely to change brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766711428803">Oliver and Swan, 1989</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356766711428803">Kozak, 2001</xref>). As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356766711428803">Chi and Qu (2008</xref>), general marketing literature has paid much attention to the relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356766711428803">Anderson and Sullivan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356766711428803">Hallowell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356766711428803">LaBarbera and Mazursky, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356766711428803">Newman and Werbel, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356766711428803">Oliver 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356766711428803">Oliver and Swan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356766711428803">Rust and Zahorik, 1993</xref>).

<p>The data collection was performed by means of a questionnaire delivered during the Biathlon World 2009 championship in Anterselva–Antholz, a small mountain town located in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. Biathlon is a popular winter sport in Nordic countries in which competitors’ cross-country ski over a prepared course, pausing at intervals to shoot at targets with a rifle. In 1975 Anterselva–Antholz was awarded for the first time the task of organizing the Biathlon World Championships, and a biathlon arena was built. At that time, biathlon was regarded as a fringe sport. However, as far as winter sports are concerned, through the years biathlon has grown steadily, especially in Europe, and TV coverage introduced millions of new and enthusiastic spectators to biathlon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356766711428803">Pechlaner et al., 2003</xref>). The World Cup competition runs over five days, from Wednesday to Sunday, and in 2009 on Sunday only the World Cup in Anterselva–Antholz attracted over 18,000 spectators. Besides the races, the five days of events offer a wide array of entertainment activities at the biathlon arena and in the nearby villages. Tour packages are organized for visitors, including travel, accommodation and ticket entry. During the five days of this sporting event, visitors from the region and foreigners were randomly selected in the venue of the event. The data collection took the form of a self-administrated survey. Interviewers were placed in areas of high passage and each third person to pass by was stopped, given the questionnaire, a pen and a board, and asked to complete the questionnaire on the spot. Only one person for each household or travelling group was asked to complete the questionnaire. The interviewer was available for queries or further information. Altogether 500 visitors were stopped, 353 questionnaires were collected and 343 were still usable for further processing. Ten questionnaires were considered invalid as only a minimal part of the questionnaire was completed or because of inconsistency in some answers. </p>
<p>The questionnaire was composed by statements (except for the part on the socio-demographic profile of visitors) and, in order to allow people to express different intensity degrees in their attitudes, a six-point Likert scale was applied to each claim. On one side of the scale was value 1 indicating total disagreement, total opposition or not likely at all; on the other side of the scale was value 6 indicating total agreement, total support, or very likely.</p>
<p>For the first step, a Chi-square test of equal variance was used to check the independence between loyalty and the probability to return to the event and its nearby destinations, and to recommend them to friends and relatives.</p>
<p>To explain the variability and to summarize the 12 statements regarding satisfaction, a Factor Analysis with Varimax rotation was applied. Factor Analysis was used for different reasons: we don’t know if there exists an underlying structure among the variables, we want to reduce the number of variables and find a small number of new uncorrelated variables (factors) explaining the phenomenon. Varimax rotation was used to maximize the differences among the dimensions extracted and to maintain the uncorrelation between factors.</p>
<p>Only factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 and individual items with a factor loading of 0.50 and above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356766711428803">Hair et al., 1998</xref>) were selected. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356766711428803">Cronbach, 1951</xref>) was computed to evaluate the internal consistency of each factor. The suitability of the factor analysis was determined by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356766711428803">Kaiser, 1974</xref>) measure of sampling adequacy and by the Bartlett’s test of sphericity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356766711428803">Bartlett, 1954</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, numerous Logit models were estimated to assess our four hypotheses. Each model was estimated using as dependent variables the likelihood to revisit the event, the destination hosting the event (Anterselva) and the nearby destinations (Val Pusteria and South Tyrol), and the likelihood to recommend them to friends and relatives. The independent variables used were the factors extracted from the satisfaction statements and the dummy variable indicating loyalty to the event (1 = loyal visitors; 0 = new visitors).</p>

<sec id="section6-1356766711428803">
<title>Empirical results</title>
<p>Of the 343 respondents, the majority are loyal customers who have visited the event before (83.09%). A deep analysis of repeat behaviour implies not only the intention to return to the event and recommend it to friends and relatives, but also the intention to revisit for leisure purposes the destination that hosts the event (the town of Anterselva), the nearby destination (the valley of Val Pustería), and the entire surrounding region (South Tyrol), and to recommend them to friends and relatives. Generally, respondents are highly likely to return to the event the following year and to recommend it to friends and relatives. However, they are less inclined to come back to the destination hosting the event (Anterselva) and to the nearby destinations (Val Pusteria and South Tyrol), and to recommend them to friends and relatives. </p>

<p>In order to reduce the 12 variables that represent visitors’ satisfaction with the event, a Factor Analysis with Varimax rotation was conducted. The initial procedure produced a three-factor solution with eigenvalues greater than 1 representing 93.46% of the total variance. One item, with factor loadings less than 0.50, was removed from further analysis. A revised factor solution with 11 remaining items was generated consisting of three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1, representing 95.99% of the total variance of the variables. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy (KMO = 0.929) and the Bartlett’s test (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) confirmed that the analysis is appropriate. Cronbach’s alpha showed acceptable reliability. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356766711428803">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the rotated factor analysis.</p>

<p>The results show that the willingness to return to the event next year is positively affected by loyalty to the event and satisfaction with the event services. The willingness to recommend the event to friends and relatives is positively affected by satisfaction with the services of the event, the accessibility and the price. Loyalty to the event influences the willingness to return to the event; however, it does not influence the recommendation of the events to others; it is satisfaction with event that causes positive word of mouth. </p>
<p>As the coefficients of the independent variables shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1356766711428803">Table 4</xref> have no direct interpretation, the marginal effects were calculated (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1356766711428803">Appendix A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1356766711428803">Table 1</xref>). Among the three satisfaction factors, services and accessibility have a higher influence than price on the likelihood to recommend the event. </p>
<p>As we have mentioned above, price is not significant for the intention to return and only marginally for the intention to recommend; therefore, we can conclude that price could be slightly increased with no repercussion on future loyalty and only with a small influence on good word of mouth. </p>
<p>To summarize, we can observe that H3 can be accepted, while H1 only partially: the hypothesis that loyalty positively affects recommendation cannot be accepted. </p>
<p>Following the above structure, to test H2 and H4, six robust Logit models were conducted in order to determine the dependence of the likelihood to recommend and return to the destination hosting the event and its surrounding areas upon loyalty and satisfaction levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1356766711428803">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1356766711428803">6</xref>). </p>

<p>The results show that the willingness to return to the destination hosting the event (Anterselva) is positively affected by satisfaction with event services and prices. The willingness to return to the nearby destinations (Val Pusteria and South Tyrol) is positively affected by satisfaction with services and accessibility. Loyalty to the event has resulted to have no influence on the likelihood to return neither to the destination hosting the event nor to its surrounding areas. Also in terms of recommendation, loyalty to the event exerts a limited influence. In fact, only in the recommendation of the destination hosting the event, loyalty is significantly positive. Satisfaction level with all of the aspects of the event is the main aspect that determines the willingness to recommend the destination hosting the event and its nearby areas. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1356766711428803">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1356766711428803">3</xref> in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1356766711428803">Appendix A</xref> show that the factors exerting higher influence on the recommendation behaviour is satisfaction with services and accessibility. This is consistent with what tested in H1 and H3.</p>
<p>To summarize, we can observe that H2 and H4 can only be partially accepted, as the hypothesis that loyalty positively affects recommendation is true only in the case of recommendation of the town Anterselva. Furthermore, loyalty does not affect any return visits to the destination or its surrounding areas.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Satisfaction levels and future behaviour is of great interest to both researchers and practitioners due to intense competition among the wider range of sporting events and festival possibilities. Hence, this study has the potential to highlight the theoretical and practical implications of several significant findings. </p>
<p>The main contribution of this study is the investigation of the influence of event loyalty and satisfaction on: i) visits to the destination and its nearby attractions for leisure purposes in other periods of the year; ii) recommendation to friends and relatives to visit the destination and the surrounding areas. The literature describes events as catalysts and affirms that a place hosting an event increases destination appeal and stimulates tourists’ arrivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711428803">Allen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766711428803">Getz, 2007</xref>). One of the aims of this article was to determine whether an international sport event in a mountain community is capable of promoting the destination and attracting repeat visitation to the area also in other periods of the year. The results of this research show that although there is an important effect of event loyalty on the event itself, the same loyalty does not exist for the destination. Tourists that are coming year after year to attend the event are not likely to return to the destination hosting the event or its surrounding area for leisure purposes in other periods of the year. Additionally, it is interesting to note that repeat visitors to the event are neither more inclined than first time visitors to communicate good word-of-mouth promotion of the destination and nearby areas. Spectators are coming to attend the event, and some of them come repeatedly year after year; however, loyal spectators are interested solely to the event and they don’t return to, or recommend, the destination for leisure purposes in other periods of the year.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of this article is the investigation of the influence of satisfaction on revisits and recommendation of the destination and its nearby areas. Satisfaction level positively influences such behaviour, suggesting that event organizers have great responsibilities in increasing destination appeal not only for the town hosting the event, but also for its surrounding areas. In this study, three satisfaction factors were obtained using Factor analysis: Services, Price, and Accessibility. These factors were considered as independent variables in numerous Logit models in order to estimate: the willingness to return to the event and recommend it to friends and relatives, and the willingness to revisit and recommend Anterselva (the town hosting the event), Val Pusteria (the nearby valley), and South Tyrol (the surrounding region). The models reveal that satisfaction with the event positively affects the behavioural intention to return and recommend both the biathlon and the surrounding area (Anterselva, Val Pusteria, and South Tyrol). </p>
<p>So far, past research works have concentrated mainly on the impact of satisfaction on the intention to revisit and recommend the event; this article takes the analysis a step further to assess the impact of satisfaction on the intention to come back to the town hosting the event and its nearby areas. The literature states that events act as catalysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356766711428803">Allen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356766711428803">Getz, 2007</xref>) for repeat visitations to the destination and positive word of mouth; however, no empirical results were associated with these statements. </p>
<p>The findings of this study have significant marketing and managerial implications for event and destination managers. In terms of events, as promoters of the destination, loyal attendees to the event are not so loyal to the destination and do not recommend or return to the destination for other leisure purposes. This information should help event organizers and DMO managers to coordinate better marketing activities in order to turn loyal event attendees into loyal destination visitors. In the case of the Biathlon World Championship, most of the attendees are foreigners (72% from Germany and 5% from Norway) and enthusiasts of the biathlon. Some of them could be drawn to the destination in other months of the winter to personally ski on the course (outside the event, the course is open to the public) or in summer to enjoy the course with roll-skis or through walks in the wood. </p>
<p>Furthermore, managers should establish a higher tourist satisfaction level to create conditions for a repetition of the visit, both to the event and to its hosting destination. This will improve and support destination competitiveness. In particular the Factor Analysis showed three variables affecting almost 96% of the total variance. Event organizers and destination marketers should use these satisfaction factors as fundamental aspects in increasing satisfaction level and consequently reaching destination loyalty and positive word of mouth. The results show the importance that event satisfaction plays in marketing the destination. For this purpose cooperation between event organizers and DMOs is extremely important for a positive legacy of events in terms of tourism impact.</p>
<p>A limitation of this research is that only event attendees have been interviewed and no promotion of the destination through the broadcasting of the race (the race is broadcasted live in Germany and Norway) and newspapers and magazines has been investigated. Future research can include the analysis of visitors to the destination out of the period of the biathlon competition in order to understand if there is a correlation between the participation in the event (as a TV or in situ spectator) and being a tourist at this destination. This could reveal the overall impact of the Biathlon Championship on tourism demand to the destination. Similar studies should be replicated with other events and in other destinations. The research should also extend to other types of events, including cultural festivals and business events.</p>
