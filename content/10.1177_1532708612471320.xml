<abstract>
<p>In this autoethnographic essay, the author explores the possibility of healing, understanding, and moving toward a more comprehensive and honest assessment of self through an examination of “narrative inheritance” and “hindsight.” Motivated by an unexpected correspondence, the author asks questions intended to assist in this examination. In particular, the author confronts deep family issues and secrets that have shaped the stories he tells about himself and his family, stories initially dictated by his mother but through recollection and subsequent investigation, become called into question. The author concludes by attempting to reframe the narrative about himself and his family.</p>

<body>
<p>Somewhere around Ypsilanti, the familiar anxiety sets in. It is part of the same script that plays out during many of these visits. It is my physical reaction to the story my mother, the director, wishes to tell each time I visit. It usually begins in the form of a previsit phone call, in which I discover the relative or relatives who are currently out of favor.</p>
<p>“Your sister thinks I don’t know she’s going to move out. She must think I’m stupid or something, because she doesn’t seem to remember that this place is in <italic>her</italic> name.”</p>
<p>“It’s so goddamned funny how your cousin and those fucking hillbillies on your dad’s side are so tight when they’re not even blood related. The only reason she talks to them is to piss me off.”</p>
<p>“Your aunt can’t even tell me the truth about something as simple as where the fuck she ate dinner. I <italic>know</italic> she wasn’t at home last night, and she lied to my face and told me she wasn’t feeling well and stayed in bed.”</p>
<p>As I drive, responses that will never make it into the final script float around in my mind. Imagining her sitting next to me, I ask her why she cares so much about what my aunt, her half-sister, does or does not do.</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t care,” is what I can hear her saying.</p>
<p>I ask her if she realizes that my cousins resent her for the way she treated them when they were younger and under her supervision because of my aunt’s difficulty in raising them.</p>
<p>“Not once have they ever thanked your father and I for all we did for them,” is the answer I hear back from her.</p>
<p>I ask her if she realizes that my sister is guilt ridden about leaving her alone with my father, confined to a bed since a stroke, and that she doesn’t want her children exposed to the same treatment we received as children.</p>
<p>“What is this treatment you’re talking about?” she says, defensively.</p>
<p>I ask her if she is aware that just about everyone knows the truth of my birth and that the more she clings to her version of the past, the more sad and ridiculous she looks. Silence.</p>
<p>We try on old clothes. We look at old photos and replay old videos. We reminisce. We trace our family trees. We look back in many ways and for many reasons. Engaging with our pasts can be a pleasant experience, conjuring old memories or discovering unknown connections. When deeper answers are sought, however, looking to the past can uncover memories that are not based in sentimentality and discoveries that are far from trivial. This is particularly true when family history or questions of “narrative inheritance” are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612471320">Goodall, 2005</xref>). Why then, would one venture to look beyond the surface when looking into the past? Often, those for whom personal identity or family relations are not issues are the ones posing such a question. There are those, however, for whom looking back, especially within the context of the family, is necessary to move forward. An unexplained pattern of behavior or a newly discovered family secret can be the spark that ignites the search into the past. With regard to family secrets, the search for the “why” is fruitless. We can never know any definitive why. The best we can hope for is the realization that “family secrets are used to adapt to what has happened in a way that leaves control and power in the hands of members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532708612471320">Brown-Smith, 1998</xref>, p. 31). Thus, if control is in the hands of those who hold the secrets, it does not serve us to continually batter the wall of “why.” Simply put, examining family background also enables us to “make peace with our past” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532708612471320">DeGenova &amp; Rice, 2006</xref>, p. 106).</p>
<p>Assuming we have a past to “make peace with,” what is the purpose? Certainly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532708612471320">Goodall (2005)</xref>, in recounting his father’s secret life as a CIA agent, had a past to make peace with. Goodall’s motives, however, extended beyond biographical revelations. In looking to his past, he was addressing his own identity issues, in addition to presenting a more truthful narrative for his son and his future. As Goodall notes, when we look at our past, our narrative inheritance, we can see that “there are narrative reasons for what we do and narrative motives locked into who we are” (p. 504). So if we are seeking answers relating to our identities, that is the purpose. In addition, this act of looking back, apart from helping us to move forward, allows us a perspective on identity that is not concrete. It allows us to realize that identity is in constant flux. “What determines personal identity on this view,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532708612471320">Guignon (2004)</xref> writes, “is not the static self-sameness of a pregiven thing though time, but the continuous, ongoing, open ended activity of living out a story over the course of time” (p. 127). Without this realization, we experience what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471320">Mark Freeman (2010)</xref> refers to as “narrative foreclosure, the conviction that the story of one’s life, or life work, has effectively ended” (p. 125).</p>
<p>Though those in the grip of narrative foreclosure may argue that the past (and, to a certain extent, the future) is already written, it is written on the multiple tablets of multiple perspectives. The potential to read into these tablets and gain even broader perspectives exists within each of us and, in that sense, the past is not as concrete as we might believe. Also, as we grow, we ideally develop a sense of the tools necessary to “read” the past in ways that were not previously possible. Whatever the tool may be, theory, therapy, and so onz, using it to examine our narrative inheritance can serve to attend to our identities more comprehensively, more honestly, as well as understand, accept, and possibly heal.</p>

<p>Are we falsifying the past by projecting meanings onto it that don’t rightly belong there? Possibly. But not necessarily. What we are doing is remembering and narrating, which means situating the experiences of the past in relation to what has happened since, as understood, and reunderstood, from the present, via hindsight. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532708612471320">Mark Freeman, 2010</xref>, p. 60)</p>

<p>Two years apart and extremely close, my sister and I bond over many things, primarily the shared berating and beatings from our mother, a petite Latina whose size masks her ferocity. We are each other’s protectors. I fend off anyone who so much as teases her and she doesn’t think twice before jumping on the back of anyone I happen to fight with. We are never closer than when we do a special dance together. Called the “fuck you” dance, it is performed after our mother has beaten us both with the belt. The choreography consists of us hopping up and down with our middle fingers extended in the direction of our mother. It is done behind closed doors, of course. The dance is never performed in honor of our father. Although he spanks us with a belt as well, his discipline is somehow more rational. Unlike our mother, he does not whip himself into a frenzy when spanking us. He does not use the neon fiberglass rod when a belt is nowhere to be found. For this, we love our father, a big, Italian, bear of a man. He is playful and loving. He is gentle. Yet we resent him for not standing up to our mother and putting a stop to her anger. We begin to think he is afraid of her—we are.</p>
<p>During the summers, we spend weeks at our grandmother’s home. We love her. My mother does not. She can’t stand anyone from our father’s side of the family. Their names become synonymous with all things negative. She uses my grandmother’s name, Louise, to ridicule my sister. “Way to go, Louise!” or “Why don’t you wipe your filthy face, Louise?” Apart from making my sister feel like shit, this confuses me. We never discover the source of our mother’s animosity.</p>
<p>Our cousin joins us during some of these visits. During an argument over a torn Slip-n-Slide, she yells at me, “you’re adopted!” I do not know this word. I ask my grandmother. She says nothing. I tell my parents. My mother’s anger has the effect of making me feel wrong for bringing it up. She tells me my cousin is ignorant. Granted, I know that I can read better and know my numbers better than she does, but this is not a curse word or ridiculous claim and I struggle to equate it with ignorance. Nevertheless, my parents argue and place loud phone calls. Serious discussions are held and I forget the incident.</p>
<p>“Dirty spic!” The words come from behind the window of a home I have been in before. It is the home I once was in for a Cub Scout meeting, my first and last. At the meeting, I punched the son of the den mother for saying something mean. I was kicked out of the home and the Cub Scouts. I have to walk past this home each day to and from school. I know the word dirty. Spic, on the other hand, is new. I ask my mother what it means. Again, through an anger that somehow implicates me, she tells me. The difference I feel is magnified. It is not a positive magnification. I retreat into books, and other singular activities.</p>
<p>I am sent to a Catholic school where I know no one. I am alone and feel even more alien. I do not do well. My grades slip, and with each lower grade I receive, my mother becomes angrier and more threatening. One day, fearing the beating I will get as a result of a poor progress report, I decide to run away. I pack a bag, and instead of going to school one morning, hike to a wooded area near a local park. My plan is to hop on a train that passes near the park and ride it as far away as I can. I have no idea where I’ll end up or what I’ll do once I get there, but it still seems better than the alternative. I hide in the park all day, reading books, eating the snacks I’ve packed, and waiting for a train that never comes. As night begins to fall, I hear cries of “Dale!” I dejectedly crawl out for a look and see my parents. In my father’s eyes, I see relief. In my mother’s, only scorn. “Where the hell do you want to go?” she says. “I’ll take you there right now.” I say nothing. I am filled with fear. They take me home. Strangely, I am not beaten. I am relieved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1532708612471320">
<title>Developing Patterns</title>
<p>After managing to finish middle school, I attend a Catholic high school. I am an average student. I make friends. I join the track and cross-country teams. I am good at this. Running comes naturally. I begin to feel a sense of worth. My dad, initially disappointed at my decision to give up baseball, is incredibly supportive, attending most of my track meets and cheering me on. My mother never attends.</p>
<p>I choose to take a language class, French. Spanish is offered, but I refuse to take it. I am too self-conscious. Everyone assumes I speak it anyway, and I’m afraid of being seen as some kind of fraud. My mother is fluent, but only speaks Spanish when she speaks with my aunt and doesn’t want anyone to know what she says. I wonder why she never taught my sister and I the language. I suspect that it’s so she can hide things from us. Asking her why she never taught me the language only adds to her general resentment. She seems annoyed at the question and replies, tersely, “I did, but you never wanted to learn.”</p>
<p>In a theatre class taken as an elective, my best friend and I perform a scene from <italic>Zoo Story.</italic> It is the stabbing scene at the end of the play. My friend, a horror movie fanatic, suggests using a blood pack for the scene. We do, and the blood spurts over the entire stage, causing the class to erupt in laughter. The teacher is amused, and amazed that neither of us has broken character. I am emboldened and turn the class into my own private comedy hour, doing anything I can to get a laugh. The teacher notices and challenges me to try out for the fall play, <italic>Romeo and Juliet</italic>. I accept the challenge and get the part of Romeo. My love of acting is born.</p>
<p>Though I have found something I love and am enthusiastic about, my mother remains indifferent. She seems to harbor resentment, threatening me with taking away this newfound love should I falter in any way. Classmates are not so indifferent. I am called “faggot” for being involved in theatre. I fight in the hallways with those who taunt me. I begin to hate school, home, life.</p>
<p>Escape. The thought of it consumes me. I imagine college as that escape, and begin applying to schools that are as far away as possible. However, most of the schools I apply to either reject me because of my grades or my family cannot afford the tuition. The most distance I can put between my family and me is 45 minutes away, in Ypsilanti, Michigan. After graduation, I spend the summer working 6 days a week as a plumbing apprentice. My days are miserable and what little social life I have is limited. Any attempt to enjoy myself is met with derision and guilt from my mother. One evening, I have some friends over for a swim in our pool. The noise we make wakes my mother who directs my father to dispense punishment. He tells me I am not allowed to have anyone over or go anywhere for the remainder of the summer. I spend the time holed up in my room, avoiding her as much as possible. Mercifully, the day arrives when I leave for college.</p>
<p>Escape. It never dawns on me that this escape is also an opportunity to learn, and, as a result, I don’t, at least not much. My education is purely social. I join a fraternity and spend as much time as I can drinking, doing drugs, and catching up on all the sex I was too terrified to have in high school. New and elaborate excuses for missing class are concocted. Short of money? No problem. Purchasing items on a credit card and returning them for cash is a simple solution. Homework? It can wait. Theatre department auditions? There will always be more.</p>
<p>Eventually, my parents get a letter from school stating that I am failing. My father visits me one day unannounced and offers to take me to lunch. As we wait for our pizza, he takes out the letter and places it on the table in front of me. I read it and almost throw up. It says that I will not be allowed to return due to my low GPA. He stares at me and tells me that I am on my own. He says that my mother wants nothing to do with me. Our pizza is delivered but I have lost my appetite. Despite the fact that I am now truly free, that is not the feeling that washes over me.</p>
<p>I do not handle freedom very well. After sinking so low as to sell plasma for fast food, I decide to get a job. I have been kicked out of the fraternity house and need income for rent. Most of my time is spent earning money. Finding a way to return to school is secondary. My social life switches from campus to the restaurant I am employed at. Nothing has really changed, except now I don’t seem to remember how I came to be in this place.</p>
<p>I begin a relationship with a girl whose insecurities are nearly equal to mine. We only speak of them when we fight, which is often. I am a good fighter. I know well how to yell and verbally attack with precision. When she cries, I have won. We break up and get back together again and again. I get her pregnant. She has an abortion. We remain close until she discovers a letter I have written to her in my journal. It is a letter filled with attacks on all of her weaknesses and vulnerabilities. She never speaks to me again.</p>

<title>Returning to the Battlefield</title>
<p>“I’m on the phone!” Though she is on the other line, I yell it as loud as I can so she’ll know how pissed I am. She, predictably, slams the other line down.</p>
<p>“So when can you get me?” I ask Amy, who is picking me up.</p>
<p>“About an hour.” She says.</p>
<p>I don’t have a car. I commute to Eastern Michigan University, a 45-minute drive. I have pissed away my first 2 years of college, flunking out and returning after boosting my GPA at a community college. I can no longer afford to live near campus and have moved back in with my parents. My former room has been turned into a barely-used exercise room for my mother. I sleep on a pullout bed in the basement. I am miserable. I am back in a place I thought I had escaped, dealing with the same shit I had learned to dread. Her silent treatment. Slamming things to let everyone know how pissed she was. The drinking. Vicious comments about my sister’s hair or my dad’s smoking. All of it is back, and on this particular morning, I have had enough. “See you then,” I tell Amy, and hang up the phone. I stomp up the stairs, my heart racing in anticipation of the conflict I am determined to have.</p>
<p>She stands there, at the kitchen sink, and ignores me. I navigate around her to grab a bowl of cereal, HER cereal, my eyes locked on her the entire time, waiting for an opening. I slam the cupboard door shut. She bites. “What the fuck is your problem?” she says. Inside, I shake. I am at the moment I have waited for. I know I’m about to step over a line I never could. “Judging from the way you slammed the fucking phone down, it seems like you’re the one with the problem, you bitch.” Though I expect a physical response, she catches me off guard and lunges at me like a snake, her hands flailing wildly at my face. Through her swinging arms, I see the same frenzied look she used to have while applying one of her beatings after telling me to “march upstairs cause we’re gonna dance.” I finally do what my preadolescent self could only dream of and yell, “fuck you!” while shoving her back.</p>
<p>She is stunned. I know she did not expect this and I feel victorious. She starts breathing heavily and crying. “I’m going to call your father!” she screams as she runs up to her room. “And you better be out of this goddamned house FOR GOOD before he gets home!” The feeling of victory is gone. I didn’t plan this far ahead.</p>
<p>I get to campus and spend the entire day calling friends, desperately trying to find a place to stay. After a few nights on various couches, I end up moving in with a friend who owns a house and needs a housemate in order to make the mortgage. On a weekend when my parents are gone, I return to their house to gather the rest of my things. Though I am living only a quarter mile away, I do not see them or speak to them for 3 months. A Christmas reconciliation is negotiated. We meet, cry, talk, and apologize. However, she cannot resist a final dominant display, saying, as things are being resolved, “don’t ever think I can’t cut myself off from you completely.” My father remains silent. I nod in agreement, not wanting to start another argument, but as I look in her eyes and see that she means it, I think of spitting at her and walking out.</p>
<p>In time, I decide to call her bluff. I drop out of school and begin saving money. I decide to move to Chicago. It’s not that far, but far enough. With each shift I work and each dollar I save, I feel closer to freedom. I have a goal, a destination, and I am happy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1532708612471320">
<title>Free</title>
<p>I live in Chicago. The fear of having to return keeps me working. I call home every now and then, usually speaking to my sister. She is miserable. She tells me how much she hates living there. She tells me of our mother’s continuing emotional abuse and our father’s growing gambling habit. I feel relief at not being there. I tell my sister that she too, will one day be free.</p>
<p>Though I am living life on my own terms, scraping by as an actor and bartender leaves me feeling uncertain and insecure. Many of the roles I read for contribute to my insecurity. I am asked if I speak Spanish. Jokes and comments about my name not sounding “Mexican” persist. I make it a point to clear this issue up with my parents, but somehow always forget. Not until I am 30 do I find out how I came to have this name.</p>
<p>During a holiday visit, I catch my mother in an open, talkative mood. There are other guests, and she has been relating the same tired stories that I have heard change throughout the years. Tonight, it is the story of her glorious childhood in Texas. “The ranch I grew up on was SO beautiful,” she tells her friend. “We had horses, cattle, and it was simply one of the most wonderful places on earth.” I sigh to myself. I know better than to challenge her, especially in front of her friends. Two nights earlier, I crossed one of her countless lines. She was talking about cleaning products and mentioned how she doesn’t use Pine-Sol like “all those Mexicans.” “But you’re Mexican,” I replied. “Or are you something else now?” I couldn’t hold my tongue. I was sick of her self-loathing. I hated the way she inflected words like “moozarelle” and dropped Italian words like “capisce” and “stai zitto” in an effort to pass herself off as Italian. I hated how she tried to appear more Italian than my father. She did not speak to me for the rest of that night.</p>
<p>Thinking of this at dinner, I decide to finally address the issue of my name. If we’re so Italian, I think, where does the name, Dale, come from? So, I ask. To my surprise, she answers. “When your father and I were just starting out and I was pregnant with you, things were kind of rough,” she begins. “We were living in Detroit and we had a close friend who helped us out a lot. He was killed shortly before you were born, so we decided to honor him by naming you Dale.” I’m stunned. I can’t believe it has taken 30 years to hear this story. I feel different about the name. I now have a story to tell when asked, and I do so until 12 years later, when, in a way my mother could have never predicted, I find out another truth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1532708612471320">
<title>Reframing the Narrative</title>
<p>I return to Chicago. I act. I meet the woman who will become my wife. I return to school to finish my bachelor’s degree. We have a child. My wife, in order to deal with issues with her own mother, decides to see a therapist. After a few sessions, her therapist suggests that I come along. I’m open to the idea. I still have significant anger issues and we have both decided that our children will not be the victims of negative patterns. The sessions help and in time I come to accept much of what I have hated about my mother, and, by extension, myself. I begin to understand that I can never know why she is the way she is, or so I think. The understanding does not stop the speculation. Was she abused? Is there some deep, horrible secret that chased her away? Is this unknown secret the root of her being? Why else did she leave home at such a young age? It doesn’t matter. What does matter is that I have a wife and young daughter and I’ll be damned if my home is anything like the one I grew up in. I can’t let that happen. I won’t let that happen. I want to change this narrative. I want a new narrative inheritance for my children, one more loving and complete than mine.</p>
<p>After finishing my degree, I accept a role in a play that takes me to Louisville, Kentucky for 2 months. One month before I leave, my father has a stroke. It is not my mother who calls to tell me this, but rather the husband of my cousin. I head home and go to the hospital. My father looks horrible. His head is shaved and misshapen from where a chunk of his skull has been removed. Given that he has already had a heart attack, a broken hip, complications from obesity, and a near 3-pack-a-day smoking habit, I am not optimistic about his recovery. Knowing that I am heading to Kentucky for 2 months and will not be able to see him, I say my goodbyes and tell him how much I love him. I don’t know if he can hear me, but I feel better. The feeling does not last long, as my mother is angry about how I found out about the stroke.</p>
<p>“Who called you?” she asks.</p>
<p>“Joe,” I say.</p>
<p>“Everybody has to get involved. No one can mind their own goddamned business.”</p>
<p>“ I’m glad <italic>someone</italic> bothered to call,” I say, too tired to remind her that I deserved to know and that perhaps Joe was being helpful. After staying for one more night, I head back to Chicago, and then to Kentucky.</p>
<p>The difficulty in being away from my wife and daughter is somewhat lessened by the play I am in and the role I am playing. The role intrigues me. The character, a Latino border guard in southern New Mexico, struggles with questions of identity, disrespected by those he has grown up with and viewed with suspicion by those he works for. He is “in between.” I can relate. I have spent much of my adult life juggling half-developed facets of my identity and I am tired. My wife and child have given me a new, more secure sense of self. I feel comfort. I feel ready to handle, not only this role, but my own.</p>
<p>“Daddy!” my daughter shouts as she runs toward me in the parking lot. She and her mother are visiting for the weekend. Clearing the tears from my eyes, I scoop her up, hug her tightly, and carry her into the building where I am staying. We have a great weekend, our little triad together again. After a trip to the zoo, we return to my apartment to put my daughter down for a nap. My wife and I lounge on the couch and she watches television while I decide to check messages on my computer. I open my Facebook page and see that I have a message from a woman whose name I do not recognize. For a moment, I consider deleting it, thinking it is some sort of spam, but my curiosity gets the better of me and I read,
<disp-quote>
<p>HELLO. I KNOW YOU DON’T KNOW ME, BUT I AM WONDERING IF YOU ARE DALE RIVERA FROM MICHIGAN, MOTHERS NAME RACHEL? IF YOU ARE I HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO TELL YOU.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I find the message strange. My mother’s name was Rachel, but she had legally shortened it to Rae years before. Also, the phrasing and all capital letters make me wonder how often this woman corresponds via Facebook. Looking at her photo, I am no nearer to recognizing her, so I decide to respond. I tell her that I think I am the person she wants and ask what her contact is all about. When she responds, I am stunned. She tells me she is my half sister and that the man who raised me, is not my biological father. She tells me that <italic>her</italic> father, a man who left her family when she was a child, is my biological father. His name, like mine, is Dale.</p>
<p>I begin to piece together fragments of memory from my childhood. Some things begin to make sense, while others do not. The woman tells me the man who raised me adopted me. I think of my birth certificate. The only father I have ever known is the name on the document. I am confused, excited, angry, depressed, and slightly lost. Insecurities long dormant come flooding back. As my wife and daughter prepare to return to Chicago, my wife asks if I’ll be okay. I say yes. I spend half of the next afternoon lying in bed, paralyzed, trying to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>Months later, I tell my mother what I know. “It’s not true,” she says.</p>
<p>“But how is it I’m named after him?”</p>
<p>“Well, I dated him, but when we broke up, he refused to accept that we were over and tried to say that you were his. He wouldn’t leave me alone and even came to the hospital when you were born. Your delivery was so complicated and I was so out of it that he told the nurses he was your father and went ahead and named you.”</p>
<p>“Where was dad during all of this?”</p>
<p>“Viet Nam,” she says.</p>
<p>“Really” is all I can muster. The ridiculousness of her explanation leaves me speechless. I don’t even bother with the glaring inaccuracies. The way that she looks me in the eye while telling me this makes me think she’s been waiting for this moment and has rehearsed thoroughly. As she continues this new narrative of how I came to have my name, I begin to tune out. In some twisted way, I admire her steadfastness in sticking to her story and her ability to show nothing that gives her away. I think to myself “you should have been a spy.”</p>

<title>Confirmation</title>
<p>I try to find out more information. My new half sister sends me a letter with some photos and mostly trivial information, like how we are related to the creator of <italic>The Waltons</italic>, and how my biological father now lives in a trailer in Texas, cutoff completely from his entire family. I send him a letter, though he never responds. I disclose everything to my wife, her family, and our friends. I call my sister, the only sibling I have ever known, and tell her the story. She is amazed, but assures me that, half brother or not, she still loves me as much as ever. This disclosure is oddly freeing. Though the details are difficult to process, I feel I am moving toward a more honest existence. I feel like I am becoming free.</p>
<p>Sifting through this “new past” a trend begins to emerge. Family members I speak to confess they have known of this secret for years. They wonder why I haven’t been told. They all say “sorry.” I tell them there’s nothing to be sorry about. Apart from being connected to me, the one thing they each have in common is that they no longer speak to my mother. I wonder about this lack of contact. Was it the secret of my birth that cut her off from her family? Or, were there too many secrets for her to keep? In any case, she seems to have an excuse for every damaged or broken relationship, and, like her version of my past, I choose to let her live with her own narrative.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is my uncle, a man I have not spoken to in more than 20 years, who offers more insight. I tell him what I know and as I’m about to tell him the name of my biological father, he blurts out, “Dale Hammond. I knew him when he met your mom. He was from Kentucky or something. You’re a White boy, nephew.” Though he’s off a bit on the last name, he’s close enough that I believe him. He goes on to tell me of my mother begging him to take her with him when he left Texas 45 years ago. He tells me of my mother’s hatred for her own father, a man who left his family because of his wife’s infidelity. He tells me of my mother’s hatred for her grandmother, a tyrannical woman who stepped in to raise my mother when it became evident her own mother could not. He tells me how cruelly her grandmother disciplined my mother. He tells me of my mother’s flight to Michigan and meeting the man who would father me. He tells me how much I look like the man. He tells me how my mother pushed this man away after I was born in order to be with the man who raised me. He tells me of how the man who raised me, adopted me, and called me his own. His disclosure opens a door into my mother’s psyche. Pieces begin to fall into place and a picture emerges of a woman who never has and never will look back.</p>
<p>I always wonder about those who say they never look back. On one hand, I envy the perspective of constantly looking forward, viewing the past as nothing more than a page in a book that has already been committed to memory. Yet I can’t help but wonder if, like when reading a book for the second or third time, there aren’t new truths to consider or clues to uncover. This is certainly true in my case. The question of identity also resonates when looking to the past. By looking to the past, I do not mean searching for the genetic ties that one can find on any number of websites. While those resources have their benefits, they tell us little about who we are. Certainly, one can find an answer or two as to why we behave the way we do or have an innate talent or interest not explained by immediate nurturing or exposure. But, to find answers as to one’s own identity, whatever that may be, one must look back at the narratives that have paved the way.</p>
<p>To interpret these familial narrative inheritances is no easy task. As children, we lack the tools necessary to place what we see in a context that makes sense. In response, we theorize. “Living in childhood without a sense of home,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532708612471320">bell hooks (1994)</xref> writes, “I found a place of sanctuary in “theorizing,” in making sense out of what was happening. I found a place where I could imagine possible futures, a place where life could be lived differently” (p. 61). While this approach may be consistent, unfortunately it is, all too often, where the attempt to make sense of things ends. As hooks further states, “Theory is not inherently healing, liberatory or revolutionary. It fulfills this function only when we ask that it do so and direct our theorizing toward this end” (p. 61). Assuming we have this capability does not necessarily mean the attempt to make sense of one’s past is an easy task. In many cases, it is seen as a treasonous act. How dare we question what we’ve been told? How dare we look beyond the truths that are presented to us? How dare we seek honesty, both in our pasts and for ourselves? Attempting to be honest about the connection between narrative inheritance and identity is just one of the many difficulties. Pain, sadness, depression, anger, and fear are all potential pitfalls. However, as with any difficult task, the outcome is in direct relation to the level of difficulty. In cases of narrative inheritance, the potential for personal honesty, familial harmony, and the establishment of positive rather than negative relational patterns far outweigh the pain and difficulty involved in the search.</p>

<title>A Beginning</title>
<p>There is no singular resolution. I gain much, despite knowing little. I think of my father and am in awe of how he remained committed to his choice of my adoption. I am resentful that I have never been told. I am grateful at how the choices two people made worked out. I am angry at being lied to. From a distance, I can reconcile her choices as inherently positive; motivated by what was best for me, her son. Proximity, however, forces me to see her in finer detail. Up close, I recognize the parallels between her life and mine and I am unnerved. I rethink identity, both the concept and mine. I wonder why it took so long to realize that the largest part of who I am is a woman whose patterns I repeat like lines from a play, without even being aware of it. I try to understand. I struggle to identify what I am trying to understand.</p>
<p>I look back in order to move forward. I look back in order to gain insight into who I am. The fact that I am a descendant of slave-owning southerners, or am more “White” than I believed while growing up is trivial compared to the fact that I am my mother’s son. I am my father’s son as well, but it is her narrative, her story, however unclear, that I have retold throughout much of my life. It is the rest of her story, the parts that are clear to me, which I do not want to repeat. I want a different narrative for my children and myself. I want this because I am and will always be the son of a woman who, though she loved me, may have lacked certain emotional tools necessary to raise me. I want this because I have spent my life grasping at her story in order to gain insight into my own. I want this despite the fact that I may never know the entire story or her version of it. I want this despite the possibility of having to one day say to my own children, “I don’t know, but it’s okay.” I want this so they can know their father, with his less than perfect history, as genuine, loving, accepting, supportive and authentic. I want this so that my family will be okay.</p>
