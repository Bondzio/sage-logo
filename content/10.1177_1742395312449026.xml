<abstract>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To understand doctors’ impacts on the emotional coping of patients, their stories about encounters with doctors are used. These accounts reflect meaning-making processes and biographically contextualized experiences. We investigate how patients characterize their doctors by voicing them in their stories, thus assigning them functions in their coping process.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 394 narrated scenes with reported speech of doctors were extracted from interviews with 26 patients with type 2 diabetes and 30 with chronic pain. Constructed speech acts were investigated by means of positioning and narrative analysis, and assigned into thematic categories by a bottom-up coding procedure.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Patients use narratives as coping strategies when confronted with illness and their encounters with doctors by constructing them in a supportive and face-saving way. In correspondence with the variance of illness conditions, differing moral problems in dealing with doctors arise. Different evaluative stances towards the same events within interviews show that positionings are not fixed, but vary according to contexts and purposes.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Our narrative approach deepens the standardized and predominantly cognitive statements of questionnaires in research on doctor–patient relations by individualized emotional and biographical aspects of patients’ perspective. Doctors should be trained to become aware of their impact in patients’ coping processes.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1742395312449026"><title>Patients’ perceptions of their doctors: two different approaches</title>
<p>How patients perceive their encounters with doctors has been a major topic in the medical field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312449026">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312449026">2</xref></sup> Methods range from questionnaires about mutual perceptions and evaluations, where patients' views and evaluations of their doctors show up as condensed judgments on lists preset by the research paradigm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312449026">3</xref></sup> to video analysis of real encounters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312449026">4</xref></sup> as objective approaches.</p>
<p>Narrative medicine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312449026">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312449026">6</xref></sup> in contrast, favors storytelling as a means of reconstructing patients’ subjective experiences and their emotional impact. Narratives draw from the tellers' own relevancies and provide biographically contextualized meaning-making processes. We want to contribute to the discussion about the patients' perspectives on their doctors and their roles in dealing with illness by supra-analyzing (p. 38)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312449026">7</xref></sup> narrative data from a corpus of in-depth interviews with patients with chronic pain and diabetes 2. The narratives contain many accounts about meetings with doctors. Looking closely at meanings given to these accounts and rhetorical strategies provides a personalized and many-layered picture of how doctors are perceived. A narratological approach can deepen the standardized and predominantly cognitive approach of questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742395312449026"><title>Reported speech as a display of tellers’ own emotions and their feelings towards other actors in storyworlds</title>
<p>As ‘narrative is not merely a looking back at action, but is itself an action’ (p. 9),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312449026">5</xref></sup> not only the content, but also the way stories are constructed as performances in an interaction can give insights into the teller’s world. How patients verbally <italic>construct</italic> their doctors by literally giving them a voice in narrated scenes of encounters shows us how patients make them appear as specific actors in their experiences of illness. <italic>What</italic> the doctors are made to say in reported discourses with the patients and <italic>how</italic> their remarks are evaluated by way of contextualization cues lead to insights about their perceived characters, functions and roles in patients' worlds.</p>
<p>Reported talk in oral storytelling has been given a lot of attention under various perspectives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312449026">8</xref></sup> ranging from Bachtin’s notion of polyphony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312449026">9</xref></sup> to performative aspects of storytelling as re-enactments of experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312449026">10</xref></sup> In everyday storytelling, attributing quotations to actors within a storyworld is a powerful means of bringing them to life and displaying authenticity. For the listener, the re-enactment of the story provides an illusion of ‘factuality’. As it claims to re-stage the event ‘just as it happened’, quoted speakers of the storyworld position and unveil themselves by their own voices. Not only what they (seemingly) say, but also how they say it (or, respectively, how the narrator vocalizes their quotes) – both aspects serve to characterize and position the speakers by way of giving their voices a special mode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449026">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312449026">12</xref></sup> The listeners can form their own opinion about the doctor on the basis of ‘what he or she actually said’.</p>
<p>But, as Tannen points out, “Even seemingly ‘direct' quotation is really ‘constructed dialogue', that is, primarily the creation of the speaker rather than the party quoted” (p. 103).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312449026">12</xref></sup> As our memories of events are never sufficiently precise to guarantee the correctness of quotes, tellers of reported speech actually make up what they think they remember, using the fuzziness of their memories to construct their actors in a way which fits with their emotional situation and strategic aims in the very moment of storytelling. Thus, patients' reconstructions of doctors' speech acts are polyphonous and convey meaning into the doctor's quote, namely they reveal the patients’ evaluation of the doctor. The doctor's impact in patient experiences is shown not by labelling, but actually by performing. As this kind of characterization has significantly more to do with emotions than abstract judgements, it provides a key to understanding patients' experiences concerning their doctors beyond abstract categorizations and standardized evaluations.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1742395312449026"><title>Data</title>
<p>We conducted in-depth interviews with patients with chronic pain and diabetes type 2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312449026">13</xref></sup> focussing on patients' experiences with the illness, with its diagnostic and treatment procedures and with its impact on daily life. Purposive sampling strategies sought a maximum variation of experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312449026">14</xref></sup> Significant parts of the interviews presented patients’ experiences with health care institutions and with their doctors. From the interviews, we extracted all the narrated events which contained quotations of doctors in direct speech.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742395312449026"><title>Analysis</title>
<p>In a first step, doctors’ voices were analyzed according to their linguistic form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312449026">15</xref></sup> To characterize the epistemic status the doctors’ utterances were given, we examined the origin of the reported speech (a specified doctor or group of doctors versus doctors in general), distinguished between direct and indirect quotations and analyzed whether the quotes were narrated as singular events or as repetitive utterances (what doctors usually say). Doctors' voices were analyzed in a word-by-word procedure based on conversation and narrative analysis by means of the transcripts and the prosodic and emotional characteristics from audiotape. Our main analytic focus was on the positioning aspects of the quotations based on positioning analysis in stories,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312449026">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449026">17</xref></sup> which draws from narrative as well as conversation and discourse analysis. In this analytic approach, a ‘position’ is characterized as the social space a person claims for himself and assigns to the addressee through utterances. Within the story, these positionings as part of the reported speech convey a characterization of the doctor and his actions. After close linguistic and positioning analysis focussing on content and function of doctors' voices, the clips were grouped according to an established method (18) in a bottom-up procedure into themes of positionings and their evaluative function within the story. This technique ensures that each item is represented in the final summary. Analysis and coding were discussed and elaborated within the research group.</p>

<p>Due to the open interview style, many anecdotes and re-enacted stories of encounters with their doctors were given spontaneously, enfolded in longer story lines. Sometimes they were rendered in little dramas with the whole array of narrative structure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312449026">16</xref></sup> sometimes in the form of ‘small stories’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449026">17</xref></sup> with just a few narrative clauses. Some of the speech acts were assigned to a ‘generalized’ voice of doctors, displaying a typicality of ‘what all doctors usually say’ (Example 5). Other stories were presented as iterative, pointing out that ‘this is what the doctor always says’ (Example 6).</p>
<p>Our analysis showed that voicings were able to render precise characterizations of doctors' actions and attitudes and of the tellers' feelings towards them.</p>
<p>As results, we will discuss the prevalent themes illustrated by original extracts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1742395312449026"><title>Doctors' typical activities and their testimony of the impact of the illness</title>
<p>In both samples, part of the quotes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395312449026">Table 1</xref>) can be summarized as stereotypical acts, category-bound activities (p. 241)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312449026">18</xref></sup> of doctors which occur in medical consultations: telling a diagnosis, prescribing, referring to a hospital, etc.</p>
<p>Characteristically, these speech acts were performed in a neutral manner with matter-of-fact voicings and without emotional content. They highlighted important moments of the medical history and its turning points. However, there was a smooth transition to quotes which served yet another function: to highlight dramatic events and significant moments in the course of the illness. In the following example, the representation of the way the doctor intensifies the diagnostic procedures conveys that a serious condition must be managed. She becomes an expert witness to the dramatic state the patient was in, thus endorsing the patient’s view of his illness as an outstanding experience.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1742395312449026"><title>Negative positionings: interpretative authority, dominance and insensitivity</title>
<p>In about one-third of both samples, doctors' utterances bear rather negative emotional characteristics. This impression is conveyed by the content and manner of the utterance, the negative tone is often underscored by the making the enacted voice sound demeaning, rude or aggressive or by the use of contextualization. We found consistent differences in the main topics of dispute between our two samples.</p>
<p>In the sample of patients with diabetes, they report doctors' voices as uttering recurring reproaches and exhortations: they are critical of their patients' body weight, demand weight loss, and push patients authoritatively to do more exercise. More often than not, the doctors' voices are presented as rude and patronizing, if not openly humiliating.</p>

<p>Mrs M complains that doctors order her to lose weight without acknowledging her as a person. In direct speech, which is already categorized at the start as inappropriate by its lack of politeness (line 7), Mrs M portrays the doctor as attacking her with a humiliating question and referring to her weight condition by the demeaning word ‘fat’. Her experience is supported by many other patients' stories in which anger is expressed that doctors emphasize their patients’ weight problems while ignoring their personal situations and problems with shedding the extra pounds. The voices constructed to characterize the doctors are uniform: they state the condition (being overweight) and proclaim weight loss and exercise in lackadaisical tones of voice. The orders are presented as exasperating for the patients, and their (reported) retorts mirror their frustration.</p>

<p>None of the diabetes patients in our sample suggested that they doubted the appropriateness of their doctors' order to reduce their weight. In contrast to Example 3, some of them re-stage their doctor's reproaches of overweight, without any indication of whether they felt affronted or even took it as sign that their doctor was appropriately concerned. The doctors' self-positionings in the voice reconstructions show a smooth transition from anger to acceptance, ranging from impertinence or provocation to plain speech, genuine concern and interest in their patients' health. In the following example, the doctor makes the condition a shared problem:</p>

</p>
<p>Whereas the diabetes patients struggle with what some perceive as their doctors' insensitive violations and authoritative attempts to override their problems with control and healthy behavior, the main concern of the chronic pain patients is the acknowledgment of their medical condition by the doctors. In the patients’ accounts, doctors' voices often declare that they are at their wit's end or that they doubt the physical origin of the complaint.</p>

<p>The re-staged recommendations to see a psychiatrist (Example 5) or to consider a psychological explanation are sometimes presented as offensive, as in another example when a doctor’s voice maintains that a patient sticks to her pain because she needs something to hide behind.</p>
<p>In several stories the doctors’ voices openly proclaim their helplessness. They are punctuated by aggressive and derogatory attacks against their patients or culminate in simplistic recommendations, as in Example 6.</p>

<p>So, the negative evaluations both of the patients with diabetes and the pain patients have one point in common: the feeling of not being recognized as persons of moral integrity and thus being considered as incapable of disciplining their body or their psyche. Some of the utterances attributed to the doctors' convey the impression that they see their patients as a nuisance, as people who willingly sabotage the doctors’ sphere of competence and claim undue attention with their unjustified suffering.</p>
<p>Several stories of trouble with doctors characterize the practitioners as unreliable and unwilling to acknowledge their patients' efforts to cope and to comply.</p>

<p>In this story, the patient's willingness to comply with what he describes as his doctor's ‘order’ is undermined by another doctor at the same practice. He contrasts his own feeling of pride (line 08) of having done well with the doctor's sharp retort, voiced with an angry and slightly contemptuous affect (lines 13–15). Mr M’s attempt to put things right by pointing out that he was just trying to follow medical advice falls flat as the doctor discounts his explanation (line 18). So, the doctor in this patients account positions himself not only as the one who is entitled to criticize and devalue the patient's efforts, but also to decide on which version of reality is appropriate and which is not. The angry and arrogant voice quality and his blatant negation of what the teller positions as the truth contextualize the doctor’s utterings as offensive.</p>
<p>Similarly related events of feeling ‘stabbed in the back’ by doctors responses to patients efforts to contribute to the healing process create an impression that the teller was not taken seriously, or rendered incompetent, and punished for setting out to show initiative and responsibility.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, in both samples there is a balance of doctors' voices between positive and negative evaluations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742395312449026">Table 1</xref>). While the points of issue of the negative positionings differentiate clearly between patients with diabetes and with chronic pain, the positive positionings are more similar. The doctors in these positive accounts are presented as sympathetic and interested in their patients’ well-being and acknowledge their predicaments. They are willing to respect the patients' own expertise and displays of competency. Most of all, the doctors’ reactions are portrayed as ‘simply’ human, beyond role restrictions, and claims of hierarchy.</p>
<p>With the diabetes patients, the positive accounts of doctors’ voices reflect concerns about matters of weight, but they also suggest that they understand how difficult it is to shed the extra pounds. So they are willing to allow exceptions to be made on extraordinary occasions or even mention their own struggles with cravings.</p>

The re-evaluation in hindsight, however, puts the unkind remarks into the wider biographical horizon of its facilitation of acceptance.</p>

<p>Whereas in the first version the doctor is introduced as a ‘good doctor’ (line 1) who recognizes his own limitations, refers the patient to a special clinic and offers a correct prognosis, in the second version he is portrayed as being inept and disinterested; he even skips the examination and stupefies the patient by announcing that she will not be able to continue with her sales job. In the first version, the doctor’s actions are considered appropriate when he ‘looked at the paperwork and folded it together’ (line 2 and 3), while in the second version he ‘flew over the paperwork….wham closes the file boom’, thus acting out his disinterest and gruffness. So, the very same quotations get different meanings by different contextualizations. In the first example they play a positive (‘I was lucky’) role in the context of the course of the illness. His referral to the appropriate institution provides the turning point in her illness career. In the second version however, when the doctor affronts her with his unkindly prognosis of her future life, the words convey negligence and offence. Even the act of referring her to the clinic is no longer positive, but it rather shows that he just wants to get rid of the patient (line 21). So, different storylines can present incidents and persons differently depending on the contexts and emotional perspectives at stake in the narrative.</p>

<sec id="sec26-1742395312449026"><title>Narrative retaliation and reconciliation</title>
<p>Reconstructing conflicts can also offer the opportunity for the teller to compensate for negative emotions and share them socially with the listener. This can serve to restore the patients’ sense of dignity (REF), either through legitimating the patient’s position or by discrediting the doctor’s voice. Positioning the doctors by voicing them can alleviate the burden of health instructions that cannot be accomplished or of the frustration of living with a condition which is denied acceptance by the medical profession.</p>

<p>Here, the offence attributed to the doctor's yelling is overcome by the teller's sarcastic remarks. By degrading him as a ‘boy’ and indicating his lack of interpersonal skills, the patient gains autonomy and emancipates herself from his authority. Similar compensatory activities can be shown in Examples 2, 6 to 8, and 12 or, by using the doctor in a reinforcing way, in Example 10.</p>

Beyond their related actions, they are symbolic key figures in the context of feeling either understood and respected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312449026">19</xref></sup> or contested and disparaged. They may unsettle or validate their patients' grip on reality and identity constructions. Although at first sight their positionings in patients accounts seem to easily divide them into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ doctors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312449026">4</xref></sup> close analysis shows that their evaluation can show many facets within a narrative according to different local stakes and interests. The very same behavior may be judged differently by different patients and for different reasons; the ‘bad’ or a doctor presented as abusive, for instance, can also indirectly help a patient by initiating an act of emancipation or insight, as in Examples 12 and 14. This is not to say that the same doctor did not find (or might not have found) a more effective way of communicating.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>From our social interactionist and constructionist point of view, the narrations of encounters are themselves coping efforts to come to terms with the emotional impact of doctors on self-understanding and moral status of their patients (especially in Examples 2, 6 to 8 and 10 to 13), thus confirming the need to listen and to take patients’ stories seriously in the medical consultation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312449026">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312449026">20</xref></sup> By means of their narrative strategies and stylistic devices, patients endow the narrated doctors and their own narrated selves with attributes and actions according to the moral of the story. Through narrative elaboration, creating distance and interactively acting out feelings they can cope with the emotional impact of the encounters and their illness experience. The constructed stories (which often bore the traces of having been told many times) can help patients maintain self-respect, agency and self-esteem. Tensions between patients and doctors with respect to expertise and supremacy of interpretation are retrospectively negotiated. Our point is that the re-stagings of patient–doctor encounters are emotionally significant moral compensations and vindications. They create a new interactive reality and make up for the humiliations and loss of dignity which may, on occasion, underlie the experience of chronic illness or encounters with medical professionals.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec30-1742395312449026"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title>
<p>A consideration of our results has to take into account that they are not based on observations of clinical interactions, but on stories about patients’ subjective experiences of them. As such they represent patients’ efforts of meaning making and they shed light on the underlying moral problems which the illness itself introduces into the doctor–patient relationship. They also point out how the patients handle the emotional problems of their encounters with doctors in an unrestricted, biographically significant and non-responsive way. Compared to results from standardized scales, they draw on different psychological processes rooted in biographical meaning-making procedures and show situational goals of identity negotiation. So they deepen the predominantly cognitive approach of questionnaires. The impact of the here-and-now of storytelling, on the other hand, makes the data vulnerable to situational influences and offers a rather momentary and iridescent picture than the seemingly solid structure of patients’ evaluations. Many of the accounts in the interviews, however, seem to be canonical as they bear the traces of having been told many times.</p>
<p>The limited range of medical conditions treated in this paper relativises the results and suggests further research into different diseases using the approach discussed here.</p>

<sec id="sec31-1742395312449026" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We could show that the two illness conditions presented in this paper raise different challenges for the patients, which are reflected in their stagings of encounters with doctors: while diabetes patients have to vindicate their lifestyle habits, chronic pain patients have to cope with the problem of legitimizing their suffering. Their accounts provide insight into their efforts to defend their moral identity. Our data not only confirm the often registered need of the patients to be recognized and respected as human beings;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312449026">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312449026">21</xref></sup> they also show that patients actively cope with their frustrations, regardless of whether they stem from the illness itself or from unsatisfactory encounters with doctors, by re-constructing them in a compensative and meaning-making way in their storyworld. To be effective doctors’ efforts to help with self management and self control need to be administered from the perspective of the patients, and not only from the standpoint of health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312449026">22</xref></sup> Clinicians and researchers need to be aware that patients’ stories are not simple representations of underlying ‘facts’ which may be adequate or distorted, but psychologically significant constructions from the inner world of patients. Accordingly, health professionals can learn from these stories about their patients’ experiences and needs by the ways they perceive and construct them in their narratives as helpful or as destructive.</p>
<p>They should take these insights into the patients’ perspective into account in order to help them maintain their self respect and moral dignity and to avoid frustrations and humiliations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312449026">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395312449026">24</xref></sup></p>
