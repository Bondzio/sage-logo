<body>
<p>The incidence of small multiple ventricular septal defects (VSDs) is 12% in patients with VSDs only and 2% in patients with VSD and transposition of great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, or atrioventricular defects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112443074">1</xref>
</sup> Various surgical techniques have been described to close multiple muscular defects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112443074">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112443074">3</xref>
</sup> These defects are conventionally closed by single horizontal mattress suture with or without pericardial pledgets on either side. As muscular VSDs are notorious for a single left-sided opening giving rise to multiple openings on the right-side aspect of the interventricular septum, any superficial right-sided suture technique has the potential of leaving residual defects.</p>
<sec id="section1-2150135112443074">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The ventricular septum is exposed through the right atrium after commencing cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp, and cardioplegic arrest. A right-angled clamp is negotiated through the suspected location of the muscular VSD gently without the use of any force except for the weight of the right-angled clamp. A forceps is held in the left ventricle through the larger perimembranous VSD (if any) or through the interatrial septum. The metallic sound of two metal tips touching indicates that the right-angled clamp has negotiated the muscular defect. Exposure is improved by looping any overlying muscle bundle/papillary muscle/moderator band with a silicon vessel loop to retract the latter out of the way. A whitish fibrotic edge generally denotes the true neck of the VSD. In the tortuous tract, this fibrotic edge is sought for and the suture needles are negotiated through the defect it surrounds. Since this technique involves transmural placement of the sutures, one must avoid this technique in closing muscular VSDs in the vicinity of the conduction tissue.</p>
<p>Pledgets are prepared from autologous pericardium treated with 0.6% glutaraldehyde solution for 10 minutes. A double end suture is passed through an oversized pericardial pledget (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112443074">Figure 1</xref>, pledget 1) and the needles are negotiated into the left ventricle (LV) through the VSD and brought from the LV to right ventricle (RV) across the septum on either side of the VSD. One of the needles is then passed (with the loop supported by a pledget [pledget 2]) through partial thickness of the septum, across the location of the VSD, to emerge in the vicinity of the other needle. Both ends are then tied over a pledget (pledget 3). The pledget in the LV aspect of the inteventicular septum serves as a plug in the mouth of the VSD where its opening is usually single. The dominant VSD if present is closed next. The adequacy of the VSD closure is checked by saline injection in the left ventricle through the interatrial septum across the mitral valve. We have used this technique to expose and close small (&lt;5 mm) muscular defects and recommend its use in small or moderate size muscular defects that may have multiple openings on the right side of the septum and where simply using a direct suture or conventional mattress suture may miss the other openings.</p>
<p>During the period from January 2007 to August 2011, 56 patients with multiple VSDs underwent surgery (this includes defects associated with both normally related and malposed great arteries). Of these, 45 had small VSDs (&lt;5 mm) in the trabecular and apical portion of septum. Three-pledget technique was used to close all these VSDs. The adequacy of the VSD closure was evaluated by RA to pulmonary artery (PA) oxygen saturation step-up of more than 5%, and a significant residual defect requiring revision was detected in two of these patients. The VSDs were successfully closed using the three-pledget technique in the remaining 43 patients.</p>
<p>We submit this technique as a useful addendum to the armamentarium of congenital heart surgery dealing with multiple VSDs.</p>
