<abstract>
<p>The study focused on the influence of forensic evidence on the case processing of assault and robbery incidents. The study utilized a prospective analysis of official record data that followed cases in five jurisdictions from the time of police incident report to final criminal disposition. The results indicated that forensic evidence was collected in less than a third of all robbery and assault cases. Forensic evidence did not impact case outcomes for either robbery or assault cases. Cases in which there is physical evidence are no more likely to reach conviction than those without such evidence. However, the availability of victim and/or witness accounts were found to predict movement through various stages of the criminal case process. Thus, locating and encouraging victims and witnesses to provide testimony appears to enhance case solvability. In addition, variables associated with the perceived seriousness of the offense impact case progression.</p>

<p>The 1990s were pivotal in fueling broad interest in the role of forensic evidence<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887403410395576">1</xref></sup> in the justice system. It was during this decade that one of the first realistic-fiction dramas, Law and Order, premiered, the first Innocence Project was founded, and the courts finally woke up to the possible fallibility of scientific evidence in the Daubert case. The start of 2000 saw the proliferation of <italic>CSI</italic> programs, bestsellers that promoted the use of forensic science in solving crimes, and the relative snubbing of Daubert in criminal cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0887403410395576">Neufeld, 2005</xref>). By the end of that decade, the public as well as prosecutors and defense attorneys came to assume that forensic evidence was the sine qua non of criminal case processing.</p>
<p>Although citizen perceptions of the importance of forensic evidence continued to grow, researchers turned toward exploring the “CSI Effect.” Studies were conducted that explored whether the public, due to exposure to crime shows, expected forensic evidence to be present at all criminal trials and whether its absence affected decisions to acquit. Results were equivocal. A few studies found support for some variant of the “Effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887403410395576">Baskin &amp; Sommers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887403410395576">Maricopa County District Attorney’s Office, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0887403410395576">Watkins, 2004</xref>) whereas others did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0887403410395576">Podlas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0887403410395576">Tyler, 2006</xref>). One study attributed public expectations of forensic evidence to a more general fascination with anything “tech” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0887403410395576">Shelton, Kim &amp; Barak, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a number of researchers focused on the “CSI Effect,” others turned toward assessing the validity of the actual techniques used in the forensic sciences to analyze and interpret data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0887403410395576">Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0887403410395576">Turvey, 2009</xref>). And, in 2005, Congress, concerned with the state of forensic science, instructed the Attorney General to provide funds to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to assess the field. In 2009, the NAS published a seminal study that called into question the scientific underpinnings of all but DNA evidentiary analyses, going as far as to ask “whether and to what extent there is <italic>science</italic> [italics added] in any given forensic science discipline” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0887403410395576">NAS, 2009</xref>, p. 8.). Of equal significance, it raised concerns about the ability of forensic scientists to expertly report on forensic evidence.</p>
<p>In 2006 and consistent with the federal government’s concern over the probative value of forensic science, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) launched a program to study the impact of scientific evidence on criminal case processing and to provide recommendations that would enhance the forensic sciences. The present study reports on data collected as part of that effort. It focuses on the influence of forensic evidence on the processing of assault and robbery incidents.</p>
<sec id="section1-0887403410395576">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Despite both the lure and concern over the use of forensic evidence across many domains of society and the criminal justice system, very little published research exists that explores its impact on the various stages of the criminal justice process. If we trace the available literature back to Parker’s survey of forensic laboratories done in 1963, we find that in only 1% of all crimes was scientific evidence used despite being present in almost 90% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887403410395576">Parker &amp; Peterson, 1972</xref>). Similarly, a study conducted by the RAND Corporation supports the finding that forensic evidence plays an insignificant role in criminal case outcomes, and again, notwithstanding its availability in the majority of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403410395576">Greenwood, Chaiken, Petersilia, &amp; Prusoff, 1975</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887403410395576">Feeney (1983)</xref> finds that nonscientific evidence, specifically, eyewitness identification of the suspect, best predicts conviction. Similar conclusions regarding the negligible and oftentimes nonexistent role of scientific evidence are also indicated in studies of charging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403410395576">Briody, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403410395576">Peterson, Ryan, Holden, &amp; Mihajlovic, 1987</xref>), plea bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403410395576">Briody, 2004</xref>; Heumann, 1978; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0887403410395576">Rosett &amp; Cressey, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403410395576">Peterson et al., 1987</xref>), and in bringing about convictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403410395576">Briody, 2004</xref>; Lassers, 1967; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0887403410395576">Peterson et al., 1987</xref>), except when there is strong DNA evidence in homicide cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403410395576">Briody, 2004</xref>). However, even findings regarding the role of DNA in bringing about convictions are equivocal in that it has no effect on securing guilty pleas from defendants but seems to increase the likelihood of reaching court and of affecting juror decisions to convict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887403410395576">Briody, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It can be said that most studies that examine the processing of criminal cases are often limited to clearance by arrest of homicide incidents, focus on the influence of extralegal factors, and either do not include specific forensic variables (only the presence/absence of evidence) or use very limited measures. In addition, confounding an understanding of the role of scientific evidence in criminal case processing is the lack of specificity regarding what constitutes “evidence.” As a result, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of scientific as compared to tangible and nonphysical forms of evidence on case processing. Most research lacks an operational definition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887403410395576">Forst, Lucianovic, &amp; Cox, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403410395576">Roberts, 2007</xref>) or combines all forms of evidence such that the role played by scientific evidence is obscured (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887403410395576">Eisenstein &amp; Jacob, 1977</xref>). Furthermore, research related to the impact of forensic evidence is stunted by the need for large samples so that analytical power can be attained. As forensic evidence is examined in only a small percent of cases, studies would need to begin with a large enough sample so that criminal case mortality would not inhibit the use of appropriate statistical tools to trace the role of scientific evidence through the various stages of case processing. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that a vast majority of cases in which a charge is filed are actually resolved through plea bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887403410395576">Boylan, 2005</xref>). Thus, the ability to track the utility of forensic evidence through to the end of the criminal justice process has been restricted.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite these limitations, prior studies on criminal case processing are instructive. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887403410395576">Wellford and Cronin (2000)</xref> consider the collection of weapons, bullets, fingerprints, and clothing at the crime scene (but not whether they were submitted and analyzed by crime laboratories). They find that the variables most closely related to clearance by arrest are related to nonforensic law enforcement practices, such as the speed with which officers respond to the scene and with the identification and interviewing of witnesses, neighbors, and friends. Nondrug cases are also more likely to result in arrest than those incidents that involve drug evidence. The use of criminal information databases for checks on weapons, victims, and suspects is also found to affect clearance by arrest. Therefore, homicide cases in which police resources are sufficient and quickly utilized result in an increase in the collection of evidence, including witness testimony and in a reduction in its loss and contamination. But, other than the use of databases, no other forensic variables are found to increase the probability of arrest.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887403410395576">Keel, Jarvis, and Muirhead (2009)</xref> also explore the clearance of homicides through arrest and much like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887403410395576">Wellford and Cronin (2000)</xref> find that police investigative techniques are more powerful predictors of arrest than the availability of forensic evidence. For instance, formally trained homicide detectives improve clearance rates. As for scientific evidence, the study includes voice stress analysis, statement analysis, blood spatter, and a vaguely labeled category called “criminal investigative analysis.” These variables are found to affect clearance rates but only marginally. In neither of these studies are victim and offender characteristics significant in predicting clearance. The failure to support the role of victim and offender characteristics is consistent within the literature on homicide clearance, except in terms of cases in which both parties are known to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403410395576">Alderden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403410395576">Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887403410395576">Marche, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403410395576">Roberts, 2008</xref>). Instead, the literature demonstrates that the mere presence of evidence and testimony by witnesses and by the victims premortem are stronger predictors of arrest than are extralegal factors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a review of the literature fails to uncover published research related directly to the impact of forensic evidence on the processing of assault and robbery cases. By and large, and much like homicide studies, the focus is on comparing the influence of legal and extralegal variables on arrest in cases of nonlethal violence (e.g., rape, assault, robbery). Results are inconsistent with some research finding no effect for extralegal variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0887403410395576">Roberts, 2008</xref>), an effect when the victim is White or female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0887403410395576">Snyder, 1999</xref>), no effect for robbery yet one for assault, with Black females more likely to be arrested than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0887403410395576">Stolzenberg &amp; D’Alessio, 2004</xref>). As for legal variables and much like research on homicide, the seriousness of an offense seems to increase the likelihood of clearance by arrest for nonlethal violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403410395576">D’Alessio &amp; Stolzenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0887403410395576">Snyder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0887403410395576">Stolzenberg &amp; D’Alessio, 2004</xref>) as for cases in which the victim and suspect are known to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403410395576">D’Alessio &amp; Stolzenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403410395576">Eitle, Stolzenberg &amp; D’Alessio, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Method</title>
<p>To address the limitations of prior research and assess the impact of forensic evidence on the charging and conviction of assault and robbery cases, the current study prospectively analyzed official record data in five jurisdictions: Los Angeles County, California, Indianapolis, Indiana, Evansville, Fort Wayne, and South Bend, Indiana. Sites were selected to exemplify city, county, and state/regional crime laboratory services (see NIJ Final Report for a detailed description of the study sites, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231977.pdf">http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/231977.pdf</ext-link>). Data were collected from the time of police incident report to final disposition.</p>
<sec id="section3-0887403410395576">
<title>Sample Design</title>
<p>Data for the study were derived from a random sample of the population of reported assault and robbery incidents, stratified by jurisdiction, for the year 2003 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887403410395576">Table 1</xref>). The year 2003 was selected as it represented the greatest likelihood of having most cases at their completion and therefore provided the richest data set.</p>

<title>Study Variables</title>
<p>Data were collected from three sources: Police incident and investigator reports, crime laboratory reports, and prosecutor case files. A unique case identifier linked police incident and crime laboratory reports and for most crime incidents, connected the case with the prosecutors’ databases. For cases that could not be linked in this manner, number, suspect name, race/ethnicity, and birth date were used to tie the case with prosecutor records.</p>
<p>Using these data, the present study explored the effect of forensic evidence on criminal case processing from arrest to conviction, and for both assault and robbery. The metaphor of a funnel is particularly appropriate for understanding the criminal justice process as it portrays the flow from incident to conviction as an ever decreasing volume of cases. Unfortunately, the funneling of cases as they make their way through the criminal justice system can impact research. Such mortality of cases at each stage of the process can affect the ability to detect true statistical differences, that is, it can result in the loss of power. Consequently, all analyses for the present study were based on data pooled across the five sites. Three dummy-coded variables related to the sites were included: Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and the combined outcomes for the three smaller Indiana sites. Although analytical power was preserved, site-specific elements were lost. Important factors such as sentencing guidelines, police culture, prosecutorial attitudes toward various crimes, and other dynamics varied across study sites. However, sufficient data to test their impact on dispositional outcomes were unavailable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0887403410395576">
<title>The Correction of Selection Bias</title>
<p>Criminal justice case processing can be thought of as a multistage process. First, there is a decision whether to arrest a suspect. Second, if arrest is selected, a decision is made whether to refer the case to the prosecutor. Third, the prosecutor decides on issuing a charge. And, then if charged, there are decisions revolving around adjudication and conviction. Oftentimes, research treats these decision points as separate occurrences. However, this approach suffers from three weaknesses: (a) the phases of the case process are left disconnected, whereas in practice they are not; (b) the separate results make it difficult to reach summary judgments about the overall influence of explanatory variables; and (c) the parameter estimates for the separate analysis of each decision point will be biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403410395576">Berk, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887403410395576">Heckman, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, the decision to refer a case to the district attorney results in a selected pool of offenders who exceeded a threshold on the criteria that determine the choice of case referral. When such selection occurs, the decision to charge a case will be a function not only of the linear combination of regressors ordinarily considered, but also of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887403410395576">Heckman (1979)</xref> terms the “hazard rate,” or risk of not being selected into the referral population, that is, the risk of exceeding or not exceeding the threshold. Estimation procedures which fail to take into account the “hazard rate” will yield biased and inconsistent estimates of the structural coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887403410395576">Berk, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>To avoid these problems, a procedure is required that provides information about the two decisions, referral and charging, but that also allows us to combine this information in a meaningful way. One type of correction for selection bias involves calculating the likelihood of reaching a particular stage of case processing (using a probit model), and then entering this likelihood as a control variable in the model predicting an outcome at the next possible stage of case processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887403410395576">Heckman, 1979</xref>). In the present study, this two-stage procedure was followed by first estimating probit models predicting district attorney case referral (for all arrested suspects), formally filed charges (for all case referrals), and convictions (for charged defendants), and then entering the likelihoods (i.e., inverse Mills ratio) calculated from these equations into the appropriate models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0887403410395576">
<title>Analytical Models</title>
<p>As discussed above, a modified Heckman two-stage correction estimate was applied to analyze criminal justice outcomes. The first step used probit analyses to estimate selection into the respective processing stage (i.e., the selection models). These models included victim and suspect sex and race/ethnicity, victim age, victim and suspect relationship, victim and witness reports to police, and length of time to report the crime incident to the police. Likelihood estimates (inverse Mills ratio) were subsequently used in the two-stage logistic regression models (the substantive or outcome models) to correct for selection bias.</p>

<title>Aggravated Assault</title>
<p>The data for the sample of assaults indicate that the victims (69%) and suspects (86%) were typically male. The majority of victims were Black/Latino (62%) as were the suspects (69%). In terms of age, most of the victims and suspects were younger than 30 years (58% and 73%, respectively). In addition, 62% of the cases involved people who knew one another before the offense took place with more than half (57%) of the assaults occurring in private residences. At least 37% of these cases were domestic in nature. Approximately half of the assault victims received medical treatment for injuries. Although at least one witness was identified in 64% of the cases, only slightly more than half of them provided reports to the police. In contrast, victims gave eyewitness accounts to the police in 80% of the cases. By and large, incidents were reported to the police within 2 days following the event and it took an average of 22 days for an arrest.</p>

Firearms/weapons were the most often collected form of evidence with a fairly equal distribution among guns, bullets, and shell casings. Other weapons (mostly knives) were gathered in approximately 9% of the cases. Natural/synthetic materials, typically clothing, and generic objects, such as vehicles and home furnishings (doors, flooring) were collected in about 6% of cases whereas biological evidence (primarily blood) was collected in only 4% of assaults.</p>

<p>Although some physical evidence was collected in 30% of the cases, only 12% of these cases had the evidence submitted for examination. This is not surprising as forensic evidence is not submitted automatically but may be held until an investigator or prosecutor requests an examination. Firearms/weapons were the principal forms of evidence submitted to the laboratories. Examinations took place in only 9% of submitted cases and predominately involved firearms/weapons (74%) and/or drug (94%) evidence. Of all cases with examined evidence (<italic>n</italic> = 79), there were 15 searches of the NIBIN database. Only one search produced a hit.</p>

<title>Tracking Assault Cases Through the Justice System</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403410395576">Figure 1</xref> tracks the movement of assault cases through the justice system, controlling for the presence/absence of collected physical evidence. Bivariate analyses indicate that the contrasts between rates of arrest with and without physical evidence are statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> = 4.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The data also show significant differences for the movement of cases to higher decision levels. About 42% of cases with physical evidence were referred to the district attorney as compared to 33% of cases without physical evidence (<italic>t</italic> = 2.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001). A total of 39% of cases with physical evidence were charged as compared to 27% without physical evidence (<italic>t</italic> = 3.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Bivariate results also were significant at the stage of conviction. Approximately 27% of cases with physical evidence resulted in a conviction compared to 18% for cases without such evidence (<italic>t</italic> = 2.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). It is important to note, however, that only 48% of convictions with crime scene evidence actually had evidence that was examined in crime laboratories. Thus, the majority of convictions occurred without an examination of physical evidence.</p>

<p>The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403410395576">Table 3</xref> indicate that several extralegal and legal factors increased the probability of arrest. Among the extralegal factors were White male and White female victims and Black or Latina female suspects. In addition, crimes involving intimates were twice as likely to lead to an arrest as compared to those between strangers. Site of the event also had an impact on clearance, with arrests nine and two times more likely in Los Angeles County and in Indianapolis, respectively, than in the smaller Indiana cities.</p>

<p>In terms of legal variables, the existence of a victim account of the crime made arrest approximately three times more likely as did incidents involving guns. Crime scene evidence also was a significant predictor of arrest. Cases with physical evidence collected at the scenes were two times more likely to have an arrest than incidents without physical evidence. As the focus of the present study is on understanding the impact of forensic evidence on criminal case processing, further analyses were conducted in an attempt to better understand why physical evidence might contribute to higher rates of arrest.</p>
<p>Establishing a predictive relationship between physical evidence at a crime scene and a subsequent arrest requires, first, that the police send the collected evidence to the crime laboratory for analysis. Second, the resulting analysis must successfully link the suspect with the crime scene or victim. The study examined this time order relationship and found that evidence was actually examined prior to arrest in only 4.3% of cases. The study then attempted to untangle various forms of evidence (tangible vs. scientific) and of arrest (direct as compared to descriptive) in an attempt to explain why the collection of evidence at the crime scene seemed to predict arrest. Tangible evidence is a physical item that, without scientific analysis, is of evidentiary value to the case (e.g., stolen property, driver’s license). Direct arrest is operationalized as a suspect admission, suspect surrender, suspect arrest in another case, police observation of the crime, suspect naming, traffic stop leading to an arrest, or recovery of property related to the incident that links the suspect with the crime (descriptive arrest is that which occurs as a result of victim or witness testimony). The data indicate that an additional 7.5% of cases had tangible evidence that led to an arrest. More importantly, 21% of arrests for cases with physical evidence were based on direct arrest techniques compared to 12% for cases without physical evidence. Thus, it is not clear that we are witnessing an impact for forensic evidence, per se, but rather the fact that in cases with evidence collected at the crime scene, direct arrest was also employed more often than in cases without forensic evidence. Although we did not have data, it is possible that other, unobserved attributes of the offense or the offender (such as their criminal skill) also may be predictive of arrest but may be distributed unequally between cases with and without evidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0887403410395576">
<title>Referral</title>
<p>Cases with arrests were more likely to be referred to the district attorney if witnesses and victims provided descriptions of the incident and offender (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887403410395576">Table 3</xref>). Cases from Indianapolis were more likely to be referred as compared to cases in the smaller Indiana sites. Significant inverse relationships were found for victim medical treatment and direct arrest variables. A closer look at the data revealed that these cases involved intimate relationships between the suspect and victim. Thus, prosecutors may have been reluctant to proceed with assault cases where the suspect and victim had a relationship despite the seriousness of the offense (victim received medical treatment) and/or the strength of law enforcement’s presentation of the case.</p>
<p>A number of extralegal factors also were significant. Cases involving older adults as compared to teens and cases with White male and female victims as compared to Latino and Latina victims were more likely to be referred to the district attorney. No forensic variables were found to influence referral.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0887403410395576">
<title>Charging</title>
<p>The previously referenced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0887403410395576">Figure 1</xref> highlights the funneling of cases through the justice system. The funnel begins with 49% (<italic>n</italic> = 424) of reported assault incidents resulting in arrest and continues to narrow after arrest. Although the majority of cases with an arrest were referred to the district attorney (71.9%), an additional 119 (28.1%) cases were filtered out postarrest. Overall, only 35.5% of all assault incidents were referred to prosecutors. Based on analyses of the pooled data, a very high percentage (85.9%) of cases that were referred to the prosecutor led to charges being filed. However, this was driven, to a great extent, by prosecutorial practices in the Indiana sites where close supervision of the case selection process was initiated at the start of a criminal investigation. As a result, most cases were declined before referral to the district attorney and, therefore, the remaining cases led to charges. In comparison, Los Angeles County prosecutors screened cases after referral, thus resulting in a lower percent (58.6% ) of referred cases leading to a charge.</p>
<p>Results from the logistic regression analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0887403410395576">Table 4</xref>) demonstrate that extralegal variables were significant predictors of the decision to charge. Assault cases involving strangers and those cases in which the suspect was represented by a public defender increased the likelihood of being charged. In addition, White females were more likely to be charged than their Black counterparts as were cases in Indianapolis as compared to the smaller Indiana sites. Again, there were no forensic variables that predicted the filing of a charge by the prosecutor’s office.</p>

<title>Conviction</title>
<p>Overall, 20.5% of all reported assaults resulted in a conviction. Of those cases ending in conviction only 18.8% had evidence that was examined in crime laboratories. And, of the cases with examined evidence, firearms/weapons (42.4%), biological (33.3%), and latent print samples (27.3%) were the principal forms of forensic evidence that were analyzed. However, none of the forensic variables predicted conviction. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0887403410395576">Table 4</xref> shows that three variables were significant predictors: Descriptive arrest, cases from the smaller sites in Indiana, and victim medical treatment.</p>
<p>Of all convictions, very few resulted in a trial. The vast majority, almost 90% of the convictions, were obtained through the plea process. Pleas were the dominant mode of resolution in 77.3% of the cases in which physical evidence was collected as compared to 92.7% of cases lacking such evidence. Bivariate analyses demonstrate that this difference is statistically significant with cases having physical evidence collected more likely to resolve via trial (<italic>t</italic> = 2.83, <italic>p</italic> = .005). However, the examination of such evidence did not differentiate plea from trial. Logistic analyses (not shown), though, found that forensic evidence variables were not significant predictors of plea/trial. Instead, type of attorney was the only significant predictor (not shown) with cases involving privately retained attorneys less likely to be resolved by plea as compared to those in which the defendant was represented by a public defender.</p>

<title>Robbery</title>
<p>The study database included 1,081 robberies. The data indicate that males accounted for two thirds of the victims and almost all of the suspects (93%). Approximately three quarters of all suspects and less than one half of victims were younger than 30 years of age. A little more than half of the victims were either Black or White and the overwhelming majority (87%) of suspects were Black or Latino. Los Angeles had a slightly higher percentage of Latino than Black suspects. Almost three quarters of the suspects were strangers to their victims. A small percentage of victims received medical treatment (10%). Robberies took place primarily on the street (36.4%), followed by retail stores (21.1%), houses/apartments (17.9%), or other public locations, such as hotels and restaurants (15.8%). Close to half (48.1%) of robberies had witnesses. Nonetheless, less than a quarter of robbery incidents were cleared by arrest. The average time from incident to report of the crime was 2.38 days and the mean time from incident to arrest was 56.16 days.</p>
<sec id="section17-0887403410395576">
<title>Physical Evidence Collected, Submitted, and Examined</title>
<p>Physical evidence, mostly latent prints (9.3%) and natural/synthetic materials (7.8%) were collected in slightly under a quarter of all robberies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0887403410395576">Table 5</xref>). The substrate, clothing, was the principal type of material that was collected. Materials and objects provided latent print, biological, and trace evidence.

<p>The fall off from collection to submission was substantial. Fewer than 11% of the incidents and less than half (44%) of the collected evidence were submitted to crime laboratories; when submitted, latent prints was the main form of evidence (8.6%). Natural and synthetic materials and firearms/weapons saw sizeable decreases (90% and 70%, respectively) in submission.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a very high percentage of physical evidence that was submitted to laboratories was actually examined (84%). Latent prints were, by far, the form of physical evidence most examined with 87 cases. However, this accounted for only 8% of all robberies. The next most frequently examined types of evidence were firearms/weapons (14 cases or 1.5% of all robberies), and drug evidence (11 cases or 1% of robberies). There were a total of 43 cases with individualizations of physical evidence, most of them based on an examination of latent prints.</p>

<p>Incidents with physical evidence collected at the crime scene resulted in an arrest in 48.1% compared to 14.1% of cases lacking such evidence. Much like the analysis undertaken for assault, a closer look at the time order relationship between the collection of physical evidence at a crime scene and a subsequent arrest demonstrated that evidence was actually examined prior to arrest in only 16.3% of cases. Again as was done for assault, analyses examined the various forms of evidence as well as the mode of arrest. For cases with physical evidence present at the crime scene, 17.8% of them also contained tangible evidence and approximately a quarter were based on direct arrest techniques. Thus, the impact of forensic evidence, as for assault, is not clear. Instead, in cases with evidence collected at the crime scene, the presence of tangible evidence and apprehension through direct arrest were also at play and their impact may have been obscured in the logistic regression model.</p>

<title>Referral</title>
<p>Interestingly and inconsistent with findings regarding assault cases, analyses related to the referral of robbery cases to the district attorney did not uncover any significant predictive variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0887403410395576">
<title>Charging</title>
<p>Unlike assault, the only significant predictor of whether the prosecutor would file a charge was the availability of witness reports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0887403410395576">Table 7</xref>). The odds of issuing a charge were over 6 times greater when witnesses provided statements to the police and prosecution. Importantly and similar to assault cases, none of the forensic variables played a role in the decision to bring charges.</p>

<title>Conviction</title>
<p>With regard to conviction, assault and robbery cases diverged greatly in terms of predictive variables. For robbery, witness reports were the strongest predictor, making conviction 22.25 times more likely (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0887403410395576">Table 7</xref>). Another strong predictor, incidents in which a gun was present, increased the probability of arrest 20.25 times. Finally, one extralegal variable was related significantly to conviction. Cases with White male victims were a little over one and a half times more likely to result in conviction as compared to those with Latino victims.</p>
<p>The percent of cases resulting in conviction that did versus did not have physical evidence was 83.9% as compared to 89.2%, respectively. In total, 44.9% of convictions (<italic>n</italic> = 35) had physical evidence that was examined in crime laboratories. Only 1.9% of all cases with physical evidence (<italic>n</italic> = 5) linked the suspect to the victim or crime scene and 80% of these (<italic>n</italic> = 4) resulted in an arrest, referral, and charge. However, only 60% led to a conviction (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</p>
<p>Slightly more than half of charged cases were resolved through pleas. The difference between robbery cases resolved through trial versus plea was statistically significant (<italic>t</italic> = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> = .000). Unlike assault, robbery had a much higher percentage of cases adjudicated through trial and a significantly higher percent of cases with crime scene evidence (68%) resolved through plea as compared to cases without evidence (36%). Like the results for assault, forensic evidence variables were not significant predictors of plea/trial in a logistic regression analysis (not shown). In fact, the only significant predictor of plea bargaining was the number of victims. Cases with multiple victims were over 7 times more likely to result in a plea than cases with only one victim.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the importance of forensic evidence in the postconviction exoneration of over 250 innocent people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887403410395576">Innocence Project, 2010</xref>) its role in the everyday processing of assault and robbery cases is minimal. In considering the funneling of cases through the criminal justice system, criminal case mortality is significant for both of these crimes. Even at the stage of prearrest, forensic evidence is collected in less than a third of all robbery and assault cases. And, as indicated in the current study, regression analyses demonstrate that the retention of cases as they flow through the rest of the process is not driven by any forensic evidence variables. Forensic evidence appears not to impact arrests, referrals, charges, or convictions for either robbery or assault cases. Thus, cases in which there is physical evidence are no more likely to reach conviction than those without such evidence. The findings from the present study contribute to the limited literature on this issue by extending analyses beyond arrest and to offenses other than homicide. And, at the same time, it supports the seemingly general consensus that, to date, forensic evidence has limited utility in bringing cases to justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887403410395576">Greenwood et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887403410395576">Keel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0887403410395576">Parker &amp; Peterson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887403410395576">Wellford &amp; Cronin, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>If the presence, examination, and use of forensic evidence do not influence the processing of assault and robbery cases, then what does? Much like the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887403410395576">Keel et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0887403410395576">Wellford and Cronin (2000)</xref>, the present study suggests that good police practices are pivotal influences. For cases in the present study, the availability of victim and/or witness accounts were found to predict movement through various stages of the criminal case process. Thus, locating and encouraging victims and witnesses to provide testimony appears to enhance case solvability. This finding is consistent with a wide range of studies that have explored police practices related to case clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887403410395576">Geberth, 1996</xref>; Riedel &amp; Jarvis, 1998; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0887403410395576">Riedel &amp; Rinehart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0887403410395576">Reiss, 1971</xref>; Wellford &amp; Cronin, 1999).</p>
<p>Law enforcement’s ability to garner testimony from the victim that then leads to arrest or from the community so as to influence later stages of the process, appears to be enhanced in cases in which the victim and suspect are known to each other. Again, this finding is supported in the literature on arrests in homicide cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887403410395576">Alderden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887403410395576">Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887403410395576">Marche, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403410395576">Roberts, 2007</xref>). In the present study, the impact of the relationship variable disappears immediately after arrest for robbery. However, for assault, cases involving strangers are more likely to increase the likelihood of referral and charging, and then lose significance for conviction. It is possible that, for assault and much like in rape cases, law enforcement actors, including prosecutors, may be reluctant to go forward when the victim and suspect know each other. Studies suggest that a prior relationship with the offender may raise questions about the truthfulness of the victim’s story and may lead the victim to withdraw cooperation as the case moves forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887403410395576">Albonetti, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403410395576">Myers &amp; Hagan 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0887403410395576">Simon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0887403410395576">Spohn &amp; Holleran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0887403410395576">Vera Institute of Justice, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>During various stages of the processing of assault and robbery, variables associated with the perceived seriousness of the offense impact case progression. Once again, this finding is consistent with the literature across a wide variety of nonlethal violent offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887403410395576">D’Alessio &amp; Stolzenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887403410395576">Eitle et al., 2005</xref>; Gray-Eurom, Seaberg &amp; Wears, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0887403410395576">Snyder, 1999</xref>; Stolzenberg &amp; D’Alessio, 2003). In the present study, the presence of guns and victim receipt of medical treatment are considered as proxy measures for crime seriousness. One and/or the other of these variables positively influenced law enforcement decision making with regard to arrest and jury and/or judge choice of verdict. They may be considered as symbolic of both event seriousness as well as of victim credibility in terms of the gravity of the incident.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most substantial body of literature regarding criminal case processing examines the relative effects extralegal factors, mostly in terms of sentencing decisions. By and large, findings diverge in terms of the role that race, age, sex, or socioeconomic status play. Some studies find that the race/ethnicity of the offender exerts a strong influence with minority offenders receiving harsher sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887403410395576">Albonetti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887403410395576">Bridges &amp; Crutchfield, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403410395576">Bushway &amp; Piehl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403410395576">Demuth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887403410395576">Demuth &amp; Steffensmeier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887403410395576">Lizotte, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0887403410395576">Ulmer &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>) whereas others suggest more lenient punishment for people of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887403410395576">Feimer, Pommeshein, &amp; Wise, 1990</xref>). Yet other research finds no effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887403410395576">Klein, Petersilia &amp; Turner, 1990</xref>). Surprisingly, in two studies, Whites were found to receive harsher sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887403410395576">Gibson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887403410395576">Bernstein, Kelly &amp; Doyle, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar inconsistencies are indicated in research relative to age. Several studies demonstrate that older offenders are treated more severely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403410395576">Curry, Lee &amp; Rodriguez, 2004</xref>) whereas at the same time, there are studies that find the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887403410395576">Champion, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887403410395576">Kempf-Leonard &amp; Sample, 2001</xref>). Analogously, there are studies which fail to find an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887403410395576">Bushway &amp; Piehl, 2001</xref>) and one that finds a curvilinear relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0887403410395576">Steffensmeier, Kramer, &amp; Ulmer, 1995</xref>). As for sex, the results seem to consistently point to a gender bias with female offenders receiving lighter sentences than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887403410395576">Bishop &amp; Frazier, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403410395576">Curry et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887403410395576">Farnsworth &amp; Teske, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0887403410395576">Zatz, 2000</xref>). As for the gender of the victim, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887403410395576">Curry et al. (2004)</xref> find that when the victims are female, the offenders receive harsher sentences, especially when the offenders are male. Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0887403410395576">Myers and Hagan (1979)</xref> and Spohn and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887403410395576">Katz (1995)</xref> find no such effect.</p>
<p>Research related to socioeconomic status and sentencing is scarce and interpreting the results is confounded by the significant differences in offender characteristics depending on whether the study used state or federal level data, where the latter includes more white collar offenders. Nonetheless, a focus solely on state level data does suggest that offenders from disadvantaged communities are treated more harshly than their financially better off counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0887403410395576">Ulmer &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0887403410395576">Wooldredge &amp; Thistlewaite, 2004</xref>). Relatedly, some research reveals a significant effect for type of legal representation with those retaining a private attorney receiving a more lenient sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887403410395576">Holmes, Horsch, Daudistel, Perez, &amp; Graves, 1996</xref>) whereas other studies uncover no relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0887403410395576">Wheeler, Weisburd, &amp; Bode, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887403410395576">Clarke &amp; Kurtz, 1983</xref>; Wilbanks, 1984).</p>
<p>Although most of the literature on criminal case processing focuses on sentencing, arguments have been well made concerning the need to examine these issues at earlier stages when there has been less filtering of cases that may be due to extralegal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403410395576">Demuth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887403410395576">Feeley, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887403410395576">Hagan &amp; Bumiller, 1983</xref>). For the few studies that have taken up that challenge, once more, we fail to find consensus. Where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0887403410395576">Roberts (2007)</xref> finds no effect for demographic variables on clearance by arrest for crimes of nonlethal violence, others suggest some effect. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0887403410395576">Stolzenberg and D’Alessio (2004)</xref>, for instance, demonstrates that Black offenders are less likely to be arrested for a wide range of violent crimes, except for Black female suspects in cases of aggravated assault.</p>
<p>A few studies explore the influence of race on prerelease decisions and outcomes, and again, the results are equivocal and run the gamut from no direct effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887403410395576">Albonetti et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887403410395576">Holmes et al., 1996</xref>) to evidence of an effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887403410395576">Demuth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0887403410395576">Patterson &amp; Lynch, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887403410395576">Spohn&amp; Katz, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study found that in the case of assault, being a White male/female victim or being a Black or Latina suspect increased the probability of arrest. White victims (male and female) and victims who were 30 years of age and older increased referrals to the district attorney; and White female assault suspects as well as those suspects with a public defender (suggesting indigence) were more likely to be charged. For robbery, the impact was more limited in that crimes with White male victims more often resulted in referral and conviction, only. These findings do suggest some limited support for a racial “discrimination thesis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0887403410395576">Mitchell &amp; MacKenzie, 2004</xref>) in that women of color were more likely to be arrested for assault than their White female counterparts and cases with White victims influenced referral for both assault and robbery and conviction decisions for robbery, alone. However, a consistent pattern was not uncovered in these data.</p>
<p>Overall, the data from the present study consistently demonstrate that forensic evidence does not play a crucial role in the processing of robbery and assault cases. Much of the success in bringing these cases to conviction rests with good policing and its trickle down, especially as it concerns witness and victim cooperation. The importance of effective policing seems clear in the case of robberies. The present study results show that most robberies went unsolved, mostly because of a lack of witnesses. When police are conducting investigations, they are heavily dependent on the willingness of victims, witnesses, and area residents to provide information regarding a case, particularly the offender’s identity. Given that most robberies occur between strangers, cooperation between the police and the community is particularly important. Witness reports were one of three key variables related to the successful prosecution of robbery cases. Similarly, we can see the impact of victim and community cooperation in assaults. At almost every stage (except charging), some aspect of victim and/or witness testimony moved the case along. Furthermore, descriptive arrest, which relies on such accounts, was seminal in bringing about a conviction. Thus, in relation to witness and victim cooperation, it seems that forensic evidence is auxiliary and nondeterminative for assault and robbery cases. Finally, despite conflicting reports on the effectiveness of community policing, the current study suggests that bolstering the community’s trust in the police would go along way toward solving crime.</p>
