Such an attempt does not exclude, in the first place, an immediate anachronism. The Qur’an, the holy scripture of Muslims, historically belongs to the beginning of the 7th century AD. As we talk about the content of the Qur’an and that of modern democracy per se, therefore, we do not have much opportunity to build a direct and easy comparison between the two.</p><p>Before I proceed in the pursuit of dealing with the Qur’an and democracy together I think that it would be convenient to brief on the nature of the Qur’an and other principal sources of Islam beside it. The Qur’an is an interlocution that was directed by God, as Muslims believe, through the Prophet Muhammad to the people of the mid-western part of the Arabian Peninsula, namely <italic>Hijaz,</italic> on many different occasions in between AD 610 and AD 632. Hence, each of the qur’ānic statements had a specific historical context. The first interlocutor of the words, the Prophet, received and conveyed them, as they were, to his people. Muhammad and his Companions, therefore, learned the revelation pieces and kept them both in their minds and in written documents. Then, later Muslim generations could hold out the revealed and recorded speech of God, the Qur’an, to man. Beside the fact that the members of the first Muslim generation were the receivers of the speech they were also those who lived within the occasions of revelations. Their life-stories, their accounts on the historical setting of the revelation era and their particular descriptions of the revelation settings provide to later Muslims invaluable information about what really happened during the revelation and what later recorded words of the God really meant. With Paul Ricoeur’s approach, as soon as the revealed word passed from the Prophet’s lips to the ears of his audience it entered a process of removal both from its original nature as word and its historical context and the narrations from its interlocutors and witnesses are merely the way to recapture the moment of revelation itself. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0191453713478379">1</xref></sup> Hence, the Qur’an is not a text in nature but rather it is a recorded compilation of many different interlocutions by God and to know what they meant to its listeners one needs to have their historical accounts from the Prophet and his Companions.</p><p>The other main sources of Islam took shape as the Qur’an was gaining the form of a book. The unique place and nature of the words and practice of the Prophet, the first receiver, preacher and interpreter of the Qur’an, <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> the word of God, is recognized. As the Prophet and his Companions were the first interpreters of the Qur’ānic revelation, their experience plays a defining role in the way in which the Qur’ān is understood. In the Islamic tradition this hermeneutic necessity has also been recognized theologically. Primary Islamic sources are arranged and listed in accordance with this very hermeneutic fact. According to the Muslim tradition the understanding and the practice of the Prophet as well as the first Muslim generation [<italic>Sunnah</italic>] determine how we as the members of the later generations would understand the Qur’an since the information provided by the first Muslim generation is the only way to reach the historical setting of the Qur’anic revelations. Hence, the Muslim scholarship holds that the <italic>Sunnah</italic> is authoritative over the Qur’ān in determining its meanings, not the other way around.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0191453713478379">2</xref></sup> It is the way in which the Prophet and his Companions understood and practised the Qur’an that has exercised a strong role in the creation of the Islamic tradition.</p><p>The consented <italic>praxis</italic> of the first Muslim generation, the students of the Prophet, as community makes up another source of Islam, i.e. <italic>ijma</italic> [consensus]. First Muslims learned the word of God and its prophetic interpretation directly from the prophet himself and applied it in their community life. Therefore, the way in which the first generation, the constructive community of Islamic tradition, understood the Qur’anic revelation and practised as a whole was recorded and transmitted as the primeval practical sample for later Muslims.</p><p>Given the fixed and numerable status of the documented sources Muslims still had to deal with the task of addressing innumerably diverse cases that life brings about almost every moment. On the basis of all these documented sources the practical judgments needed are derived through analogy [<italic>qiyas</italic>] for new cases. Muslim tradition turned to analogy, as a fourth main source and method, in order to address countless developments in Muslim society on the basis the Qur’ān and the other documented primary sources. In order to deal with new issues various analogical methods [<italic>ijtihad</italic>] have been developed. What we call Islam, therefore, is, in a sense, what Muslim generations have lived or applied on the basis of the sources of Islam. It can be said that Islam is constituted by an interpretation of the sources, namely, <italic>Kitab</italic>, <italic>Sunnah</italic>, <italic>ijma</italic> and <italic>qiyas</italic> altogether by the disciplines <italic>tafsir</italic> [Qur’anic exegesis], <italic>hadith </italic>[discipline of narration from the Prophet], <italic>kalam </italic>[theology] and <italic>fiqh </italic>[jurisprudence], on the ground of a living tradition started with the first Muslim generation.</p><p>Before I come to the main topic of the work, I would like to refer to a crucial concept from H.-G. Gadamer’s hermeneutics. To him the understanding process ends eventually at the point of <italic>application</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0191453713478379">3</xref></sup> Any earlier phase like the work of a historian or even that of a legal theorist does not exhaust the process. Rightly warning against the ideological and textualist reading of the sources regarding gender issue, for instance, Nikkie Keddie, a prominent scholar on Middle Eastern women’s studies besides other areas, refers to this very hermeneutic principle. For Keddie, one of the obstacles hindering the profound study of women's history in the Middle East has been a philosophically idealist bias which assumes that the Qur'an, <italic>hadith</italic> and the writings of theologians and jurists were the main determinants of women's position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0191453713478379">4</xref></sup> The documented sources such as the Qur’an and <italic>hadith</italic> including the massive secondary texts, therefore, fall short of providing any thorough picture of Islam and Muslims. The process of understanding, however, is only finalized by the <italic>praxis</italic> of a Muslim <italic>phronimos</italic> who translates the interpretation as a practical judgment into an actual human situation. Hence, in order to see the authentic position of Islam as regards law and order, civil society and minority groups as well as their relation to governmental authority, one should study the actual Muslim life-setting prior to the modern theories of the Islamic state, either liberal or totalitarian, which originally emerged within an extremely unauthentic situation as far as the Islamic tradition is concerned. Accordingly, a study of ‘cultural history’ that finds out what really took place at the ‘lowest’ possible level in a Muslim society would reveal a truer picture of it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0191453713478379">5</xref></sup></p><p>If we return to the main issue of how much democracy can be related to the Qur’an or, in a broader sense, to Islam we will need, then, something more than finding out some evidences and listing them from the primary or secondary Islamic sources. The question whether Islam is compatible with modern democracy has been repeatedly visited in the last two centuries or so. Muslim intellectuals from a wide geography having encountered western effects extensively discussed the compatibility of Islam and contemporary Muslim societies with the modern governing models such as constitutionalism, republicanism and democracy after one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0191453713478379">6</xref></sup> Rushing to an apology for Islam they have taken it that the Qur’an has already heralded modern democracy from its first days. Presumably adopting the Protestant principle of <italic>sola scriptura</italic> they have chosen the way of swiftly showing that the Qur’an, which must be the sole textual source of Islam for them, simply affirms modern democracy. <italic>Shura </italic>[consultation] (Q.3:159; 42:38) and <italic>bay’ah</italic> [oath of allegiance] (Q. 48:10, 18; 60:13), as assured related Qur’anic terms to democracy, have been repeatedly treated mostly through semantic endeavors to show what matches to parliamentarian democracy in Islam.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0191453713478379">7</xref></sup></p><p>If textual work, on its own, does not reflect a thoroughgoing understanding and any earlier phase than <italic>application</italic> like the work of a historian or even that of a legal theorist does not exhaust the process of understanding, then one should go to the <italic>praxis</italic> of Muslim society with a view to see some qualities of modern democracy rather than the texts of Islam. If law and order, separation of the state authority and the public sphere, observing the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, are to be counted as the inseparables of democracy, then, here, I will search whether the pre-modern Muslim societies developed their own model of having these very values as a result of an understanding of Islamic sources and tradition. Hence, in order to see the authentic position of Islam as regards law and order, civil society and minority groups as well as their relation to governmental authority, one should study the actual Muslim life-setting which originally emerged within an authentic situation. Accordingly, a study of ‘cultural history’ that finds out what really took place in a Muslim society would reveal a truer picture about how its members understood and applied the sources of their religion. What did actually take place in Muslim society as regards high values such as law and order, civil society and rights of minority groups as well as their relation to governmental authority? Through such a study, therefore, I aim at finding out the potentiality of a kind of democracy that Muslims societies instituted in their original settings.</p><sec id="section1-0191453713478379"><title>A class between state and society:<italic> Ulama</italic></title><p>A careful study of Muslim society reveals that, in a relatively early stage of Islamic history, the state and religious society separated from each other despite the hastily given idea of total integration of state and religion in Muslim states. In the middle of the 8th century <italic>ulama</italic> gained victory in a struggle against the authority of the caliphate. From then on the caliph would suffice with being the the official head of the Muslim community and the symbol of Muslim unity. No longer would he be accepted as a religious authority. Therefore, religious communities under the leadership of <italic>ulama</italic> evolved independently of the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0191453713478379">8</xref></sup> Muslim communities developed independent forms of socio-religious life independent from that of states and empires.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0191453713478379">9</xref></sup> The main character of the Abbasid, Seljuq and Ottoman states was the separation of the state and religious institutions and the central problem was to define the relations of the two in them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0191453713478379">10</xref></sup></p><p>The acknowledged constructive position of <italic>ulama</italic>, in an authentic Muslim society, has been on the top up until the modern age. The members of <italic>ulama</italic> were in charge of the intellectual and social life, the law and its application. They were the scholars, the <italic>qadis</italic>, i.e. the judges of a shariah court who were in charge of the application of Islam in day-to-day reality and the <italic>muftis, </italic>specialists in shariah who give authoritative legal opinions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0191453713478379">11</xref></sup></p><p>The <italic>ulama </italic>came from and had representatives in all segments of the society including the ruling elite. The heterogeneous character of <italic>ulama</italic>’s socio-economic background and networks, and their close ties with the urban populace, provided a strong position to them as intermediaries between the rulers and their subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0191453713478379">12</xref></sup> The moral influence of them was great in society, and their right to participate in matters of government was recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0191453713478379">13</xref></sup> The esteemed position for <italic>ulama</italic> was held in reserve within the ruling elite who sought their advice and support as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0191453713478379">14</xref></sup> They also could act as leaders of local groups and spokesmen of the populace. <italic>Ulama, </italic>therefore, constituted a bridge between rulers and the ruled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0191453713478379">15</xref></sup></p><p>The position of <italic>ulama</italic> in Muslim society was a natural result of their independent and civic role in relation to the state machinery. The overwhelming majority of the 11th- and 12th-century Baghdadi <italic>ulama</italic>, for instance, was not employed by the state and did not hold any official religious or administrative position. Many of them lived on individual donations and gifts or sustained their teaching activities with other professions, notably trade. The authority of <italic>muftis</italic> was based on their reputation as learned and pious men. Their opinion had no official sanction, and a layman might resort to any scholar he knew and in whom he had confidence. Once a scholar was appointed to the post of <italic>mudarris</italic> in <italic>madrasa </italic>he seemed to enjoy complete freedom in the admission of students, the sequence and method of instruction, and the choice of treatises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0191453713478379">16</xref></sup></p><p>State patronage allowed the <italic>ulama </italic>to carry out their social roles independently of the official sphere. Due to their centrality in the public sphere, the <italic>ulama</italic>, both those who benefited from state patronage and those who refused any endowments or gifts from the rulers, could put pressure on the political authorities to enforce the norms of the Islamic community laid down in the shariah, of which they were the acknowledged interpreters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0191453713478379">17</xref></sup> Hence, their unique position in the society enabled them even to form an opposition to the ruling elite when this was needed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0191453713478379">18</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section2-0191453713478379"><title>Sultan, <italic>qadi</italic> and <italic>s</italic>hariah</title><p>Cultural studies carried out on Muslim societies have done much to dispel such old theories as regard the pre-modern Muslim states as the product of unbridled oriental despotism.

Weber’s type of <italic>qadi </italic>justice that is an informal adjudication based on generalized ethical-political considerations rather than on a systematic reasoning is more famous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0191453713478379">21</xref></sup> The picture that emerges from the documentation that reveals the Muslim <italic>praxis</italic>, however, exhibits that the application of Islamic law was neither sultanic nor patrimonial, but more reminiscent of Weber’s own model of bureaucracy that is characterized by objective rules and predictability. Contrary to the simplistic modern supposition the sultan was severely restricted by the concept of justice<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0191453713478379">22</xref></sup> since the imperial authority was by no means considered above the law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0191453713478379">23</xref></sup></p><p>With its long history the <italic>qadi</italic>’s office was an exception within Muslim state bureaucracy in comparison with other positions. Although more dependent than the <italic>mudarris </italic>on the political rulers for his employment and status, the <italic>qadi </italic>enjoyed no less freedom in the administration of the shariah court and the judicial procedures than did the <italic>mudarris </italic>in the instruction of the law in the <italic>madrasa</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0191453713478379">24</xref></sup> <italic>Qadis</italic> had a greater freedom of action within the scope of their offices than did bureaucratic and military appointees whose positions were defined entirely by the writ of the sultan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0191453713478379">25</xref></sup> Every <italic>qadi</italic> had full authority to enforce the law and it was exempted from the intrusion of the sultan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0191453713478379">26</xref></sup></p><p>Though nominated by the sultan the <italic>qadi’</italic>s authority did not derive from the ruler but from much deeper cultural sources. The <italic>qadi </italic>is subject to the ruler only administratively; otherwise, as far as the law applicable in court was concerned, he was subject to the shariah alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0191453713478379">27</xref></sup> The sources of the legitimacy of the <italic>qadi</italic>'s authority were tripartite like the sources of the law he enforced. That the Islamic law is legitimized by the charisma, the tradition of Islam and the power of the sultan was the basis of the system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0191453713478379">28</xref></sup> Therefore, the authority of the <italic>qadi</italic>’s office partakes of all three kinds of ‘legitimate authority’, namely the rational-bureaucratic, the traditional and the charismatic as analysed by Max Weber.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0191453713478379">29</xref></sup></p><p>The people knew that the legal system guaranteed them a number of divinely ordained inalienable rights like the right of life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and rights of property which no official could take away. Every inhabitant had an unequivocal right to a public hearing before an impartial judge and to the due process of law. He or she was considered innocent until proven guilty. Even the fiat of the sultan did not alter these rights. The law was predictable and the <italic>qadi</italic> was charged with defending both the law and the people of his district against any transgressor. Hence the <italic>qadis</italic> dared to challenge high officials and even the imperial authority on the basis of the law. Consequently, the people were ruled by law, not by imperial prerogative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0191453713478379">30</xref></sup></p><p>The <italic>qadi </italic>not only had a monopoly over the judicial function, he was also the chief administrator of the Muslim city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0191453713478379">31</xref></sup> The <italic>qadi</italic>’s roles and prerogatives made him a crucial figure in the Muslim public sphere. Apart from his strictly judicial functions, the <italic>qadi </italic>was responsible for the administration of the affairs of orphans, widows and others legally incapacitated. Moreover, the chief <italic>qadi </italic>[<italic>qadi al-qudat</italic>] was usually entrusted with the ‘general supervision’ [<italic>nazar ′amm</italic>] of pious endowments, mosques and the estates of orphans and other persons as well as with the supervision of officials in the legal administration, notably the market inspector [<italic>muhtasib</italic>].

The local community, headed by the <italic>ulama</italic>, exercised a supervisory function in every step of running a <italic>waqf</italic> although the manager of a <italic>waqf</italic> was nominated by the central government. The discretion of the managers was severely restricted by the deed and by considerations of Islamic equity and decorum. If the manager failed to provide food measuring, for instance, up to the traditional standard in a <italic>waqf</italic>’s kitchen, he immediately found himself sued in court by a group of respectable citizens, invariably headed by <italic>ulama</italic>, usually teachers in <italic>madrasas</italic>, the real public opinion leaders in a city. To guard against accusations of corruption, managers carried out necessary renovations only with the prior detailed authorization of the court based on inspection of the site by a special committee in which <italic>ulama </italic>always took part. The <italic>qadi </italic>records overflow with cases where citizens brought cases involving the <italic>waqf.</italic> Local communities saw themselves as having the de facto right to ensure that the affairs of the sultanic <italic>waqfs</italic> were run in the interests of the city’s inhabitants by themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0191453713478379">39</xref></sup></p><p>The records of <italic>waqfs</italic> also show that they had been one of the platforms of community relations in the society.

When a woman’s property was sold by her husband or son without her consent the sale was rendered null and void and the property was returned to her immediately.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0191453713478379">48</xref></sup> Husbands were brought to court to defend themselves against charges made by their wives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0191453713478379">49</xref></sup> Women could attach special favorable conditions to marriage contracts and might take the initiative in divorce. They were able to resist imposed marriages by their families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0191453713478379">50</xref></sup> Women could represent themselves in the court and make accusations, bring lawsuits and defenses against them, and take oaths in exactly the same way as men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0191453713478379">51</xref></sup><italic>Dhimmi</italic> women like <italic>dhimmi</italic> men also used the courts in the same manner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0191453713478379">52</xref></sup> Women were also present in the market and had a considerable share in the economies of Muslim cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0191453713478379">53</xref></sup> Then, it can be clearly shown through the court records that women enjoyed a remarkable participation in social life as a result of the active support of the shariah court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0191453713478379">54</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section5-0191453713478379"><title><italic>Dhimmis</italic> – non-Muslims in <italic>qadi</italic> court</title><p>In the beginning of Muslim history the non-Muslim <italic>dhimmi</italic> population mostly was composed of Christians and Jews from different denominations in Muslim land.

To see a <italic>dhimmi </italic>who was the neighbor of an <italic>imam</italic>, a <italic>muderris</italic> or even a <italic>qadi</italic> was always easy. The villages were no exception.
