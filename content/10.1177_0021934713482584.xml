<abstract>
<p>This article addresses what justice is and how it is perceived by members in the Black community. The Black community is composed of people of all races and ethnicities who live and/or work in predominantly Black areas. Interviews were conducted and analyzed focusing on this question: “What is justice?” The Black community does not have a monolithic view of the meaning of justice, nor of the process. We interpreted participants’ definition of justice in terms of Eurocentrism, Afrocentrism, or simply cultural sensitivity (“enculturated”). The goal of this article is to lay the framework and groundwork for dialogue among and to provide recommendations to scholars and professionals in the allied fields of education, legal studies, and criminal justice.</p>

</speech>
<p>As the eldest participant in this research, Grace pinpoints the nature of the problem to be explored in this article: What constitutes justice, from diverse viewpoints with diverse experiences? Can a more complex understanding of “justice” move us, as a society, toward effectively solving problems like the school-to-prison pipeline and the overpopulation of prisons by Black men? Our dialogue toward justice needs to include ordinary citizens with a variety of backgrounds as well as scholars who have analyzed systems of justice, particularly restorative and retributive, and have suggested the systems reflect and grow out of different worldviews. These formal systems can help bring order to diverse understandings; however, the systems are too abstract without reference to individuals’ experiences and understandings. We need examples of talking about justice, as well as practice talking about justice, in order to understand what justice is.</p>
<p>As authors of this article, we have examined our own subjectivities and acknowledge that our experiences bring us to this topic and, we hope, enable us to understand the data we collect and interpret it meaningfully. Demographically, we are two White females and one Black male, all comfortably middle class, and all having lived all our lives in various parts of the upper Midwest. Hamer, an associate professor of education, grew up White in a predominantly White community, attending public schools where “justice” was mentioned only within context of the Pledge of Allegiance’s “with liberty and justice for all” and the three branches of government. Justice was understood as meted out in courts, and people got what they deserved. Experiences in the past half decade, with students who have been cited for “loitering” as they paused on the sidewalk, and with colleagues who have worked their lives but now cannot support themselves in their elder years, as well as exposure to the school-to-prison pipeline, have pushed her to think more about the concept “justice.” Moore, a legal educator, grew up White in a rural Midwestern community with a traditional social studies curriculum that in her memory did nothing to develop multicultural awareness. Working in legal studies in an urban university, her questioning of “justice” has evolved from work in a community program researching lead exposure and its effects on educational achievement and involvement in the juvenile justice system. Jenkins, a criminal justice professor, grew up Black in a large northern metropolitan area where his awareness of justice was through judicial and police abuse of justice. His work focuses on restorative justice and particularly the use of citizen circles to resolve issues. He is known in the community for his involvement establishing citizen circles in marginalized neighborhoods.</p>
<p>At the time of this research, we were colleagues in a college that encompassed education, human service, and health science, and felt fortunate to be in an academic setting and to do applied work in communities where we had been helped to challenge our definitions and explicate them in conversation. As scholars and teachers in education, criminal justice, and legal studies, we believe this conversation needs to be broadened and institutionalized, and that it should be part of the schooling of all preprofessionals in our fields. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934713482584">Rawls (1999)</xref> notes, “[J]ustice is the first virtue of social institutions” (p. 3). Thus, if we are to be responsible in the institutions we serve and create, we had better have a complex understanding of justice.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this article describes and analyzes ideas about justice held by a sample of members of the Black community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021934713482584">1</xref></sup> We focus on the Black community because that is a point of view underrepresented in the literature and in popular culture, where justice is determined by the dominant culture police and court systems, as well as in K-12 and postsecondary coursework that relates to justice; however, we believe that similar research should be carried out with all communities. The research design was based on the assumption that participants would describe justice in ways that could be termed both restorative and retributive, and that their discussions would exhibit ideas associated with Afrocentric and Eurocentric worldviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713482584">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). Retributive justice characterizes the current criminal justice system in the United States. Restorative justice, particularly when its cultural roots are made explicit, has been put forth as an alternative paradigm for addressing criminalization and justice within marginalized communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934713482584">R. King, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934713482584">Skotnicki, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934713482584">Hudson (2006)</xref> maintains that new models that account for cultural differences, orienting to the particular, rather than the general, must be integrated into the current system to get “beyond white man’s justice” (p. 29). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021934713482584">W. King, Holmes, Henderson, and Latessa (2001)</xref> specify Afrocentric treatment and prevention as more effective than Eurocentric treatment in African American communities (p. 559). Thus, scholarly frameworks exist and can be useful to facilitate dialogue among citizens, scholars, practitioners, and ultimately policy makers.</p>
<p>We begin with literature that helps define types of justice and worldviews. We next present the data, thematically analyzed according to definitions of justices, sources of justice, and who are decision makers in the justice system. We conclude with our interpretations of how participants defined justice in terms connoting Eurocentric, Afrocentric, or culturally sensitive (“enculturated”) views, and recommendations for scholars and professionals.</p>

<title>Social Justice and Retributive Versus Restorative Philosophies of Justice</title>
<p>Establishing a basis for dialogue about justice is usefully framed within social justice and the differences between retributive and restorative justice, current practices of restorative justice, and extant work on delineating an Afrocentric framework for restorative justice. Philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934713482584">John Rawls (1999)</xref> provides the broadest formal framework for our consideration of justice: social justice. Rawls asserts,<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he primary subject of justice is the basic structure of society, or more exactly, the way in which major social institutions distribute fundamental rights and duties and determine the division of advantages from social cooperation. . . . Taken together as one scheme, the major institutions define men’s rights and duties and influence their life prospects, what they can expect to be and how well they can expect to do. (pp. 6-7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934713482584">Tonry (2011)</xref> brilliantly makes the connection between justice, or lack thereof, and political, economic, and legal systems. Within Rawls’s and Tonry’s definitions, that encompasses all social institutions rather than only the justice system. Therefore, a broader base of discussion about justice exists. We suggest that retributive justice has the greatest direct negative effect on the Black population due to mass incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021934713482584">Alexander, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021934713482584">Unnever and Gabbidon (2011)</xref> provide convincing data demonstrating the disparity in arrests of African American men relative to their numbers in the broader U.S. society.</p>
<p>The dominant U.S. justice system is a retributive, punitive system. The adversarial court system involves the offender and the state, concerning the offender’s act and a determination of guilt or innocence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021934713482584">Caplan &amp; Stringham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934713482584">Doolin, 2007</xref>). This system is based on the philosophy that because the victim has suffered, the offender should suffer as well; offenders are thus defined as evil people, deserving of punishment. A restorative justice system is an integrative, holistic system that addresses all stakeholders to a crime; it acknowledges individual perspectives and cultural differences. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021934713482584">DeLisi, 2010</xref>). Its advocates argue that restorative justice must be integrated into the U.S. justice system if our nation is to achieve a balanced, productive society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021934713482584">Doolin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021934713482584">Gavrielides, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The current U.S. justice system is Eurocentric and patriarchal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021934713482584">Hudson, 2006</xref>). Research documents that most Americans, as they live surrounded by this dominant discourse even if they do not enjoy the benefits of being mainstream, echo this construct: If asked to define “justice,” most Americans use words such as <italic>fairness, similar or equal treatment, lack of discrimination, due process</italic>, and <italic>equal opportunity</italic>. Yet when asked what is meant when we hear that someone has been “brought to justice,” we inevitably think first of punishment—often severe punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934713482584">Bazemore, 2007</xref>, p. 652). In contrast, restorative justice “focuses on the victims’ harms and needs,” “emphasizes the responsibility of the offender to make things right,” and promotes “a process of creative problem solving” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021934713482584">Blevins, 2006</xref>, pp. 291-292). Restorative justice involving all stakeholders is currently practiced through community circles, victim–offender mediations, and family group conferencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934713482584">R. King, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021934713482584">Rundell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021934713482584">Skotnicki, 2006</xref>). Restorative justice requires a clearly defined community, rather than state, need. Restorative justice “emphasizes the healing of victims and communities harmed by crime as a primary objective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021934713482584">O’Hear, 2009</xref>, p. 488) and “attempt[s] to reach a more complete understanding of justice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021934713482584">Thesnaar, 2008</xref>, p. 58). The adversarial features of the U.S. justice system conflict with the communal nature of restorative justice.</p>

<title>Eurocentric Versus Afrocentric Origins of Ideas About Justice</title>
<p>Although evidence suggests that early civilizations in Africa and Asia incorporated many of the reparative practices that are now labeled restorative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021934713482584">Bazemore, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021934713482584">2007</xref>), restorative justice is said to have “Western” origins, and the earliest instances of its use are usually cited as within the past half century and in North America, as in the often-cited incident in Ontario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021934713482584">Yeh, 2008</xref>, pp. 669-671). Usually, when the literature refers to an African-based restorative justice system, it is also within the past half century, with the South African Truth Reconciliation Commission. Even though the commission addressed “past injustices . . . where victims of apartheid [were] given the opportunity to confront their perpetrators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934713482584">R. King, 2007</xref>, p. 1291), this commission did not explicitly name traditional African processes at its roots.</p>
<p>Many indigenous groups have recognized deep historical roots to current restorative practices. For example,<disp-quote>
<p>In the 1960s, colonized peoples in North America, Australia, and New Zealand started to suggest that they be permitted to use their own justice systems based on native customs and values. This movement grew, and by 1989, New Zealand had radically overhauled its juvenile justice system by adopting traditional Maori customs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021934713482584">R. King, 2007</xref>, p. 1291)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When the historical depth and integrity of restorative justice systems are recognized, it becomes much more difficult for the dominant culture justice system to dismiss practices of restorative justice as a fad, or as a way to excuse socially reproachable behaviors. More recently, Rwanda’s <italic>Gacaca</italic> courts have provided a postgenocide example of restorative justice in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021934713482584">Kirkby, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Afrocentric Theory as a Framework for Restorative Justice</title>
<p>The Eurocentric explanations to social problems and criminality tend to support an individualistic approach to crime. In this individualistic approach “[s]tate-based tribunal decisions often follow the ‘winner takes all approach,’ which goes against the principles and values of the African justice system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934713482584">Elechi, Morris, &amp; Schauer, 2010</xref>, p. 78). Afrocentric explanations do not focus on the same individualistic objectives and goals as Eurocentric thinking does; rather, Afrocentric theories privilege communal objectives and goals, and “African-centered psychologists have contested the universality of Eurocentric theory and practice for working with persons of African descent, and they acknowledge the diversity of the cultural experience and its effect on psychological functioning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934713482584">Cokley &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>, p. 828). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021934713482584">Asante (2006)</xref> explains, “What matters to [the Black community] is the ability to write [its] own story and to cooperatively set the terms of [its] engagement with the larger White and often dominating-seeking world” (p. 657).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021934713482584">Elechi (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021934713482584">Elechi (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934713482584">Elechi et al. (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021934713482584">Jenkins (2004b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713482584">Jenkins (2006)</xref> argue that restorative justice has its roots in the principles of Afrocentric theory and demonstrate how Black cultures in both Africa and the United States use the principle to resolve many disputes. The Afrocentric approach differs from current Eurocentric restorative justice approaches in three major ways. First, the explanation for the “crime” is viewed from an African-centered perspective. Crime is not a violation of a state rule but a disruption of the spiritual harmony of the community. Whereas a Eurocentric restorative justice approach would assume that the individual is in need of rehabilitation to conform to Eurocentric standards, the Afrocentric perspective does not assume that the Eurocentric standard is the proper “rehabilitative objective.” The primary goal is the liberation of the community through emancipatory knowledge of all community members. Second, priority is given to the community rather than the individuals involved in the dispute: The Afrocentric perspective is more communal than individualistic. Third, the Afrocentric perspective emphasizes the spiritual as the main source of knowledge, so that morals and justice supersede the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021934713482584">Elechi et al., 2010</xref>). Clearly retributive justice and restorative justice are based on entirely different worldviews of what justice is, and these views are aligned with the dominant culture system based in Eurocentric philosophy and an alternative system based in Afrocentric philosophy. These frameworks can be used to bring order to multiple descriptive understandings of what justice is in each realm and some basic principles on which to build dialogue and to engage all citizens.</p>

<p>Past studies, through both qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021934713482584">Ginwright &amp; Cammarota, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713482584">Jenkins, 2006</xref>) and quantitative methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021934713482584">Cokley &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021934713482584">Jenkins, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021934713482584">Leary, Brennan, &amp; Briggs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021934713482584">Obasi, Flores, &amp; James-Myers, 2009</xref>), have shown that ethnicities, genders, and occupations have differed on their perceptions and approaches to justice. Though it does not utilize a fully developed grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934713482584">Charmaz, 2006</xref>), this study takes a grounded theory approach to describing and analyzing ideas about justice and interpretations about the sources of those ideas held by members of the Black community.</p>
<p>All participants live or work in urban Black communities (with Black communities identified by zip codes that had a more than 50% African American population as identified by census data from 2000). The sample is purposeful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021934713482584">Marshall &amp; Rossman, 2010</xref>), targeting a broad representation of occupation and age recruited from community-based organizations, courts, police stations and substations, educational institutions, local prisons, victims’ advocate groups, and offender reentry programs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021934713482584">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Data were collected using semistructured, open-ended interviews. When possible, interviews were audiotaped and transcribed; otherwise, the interviewer took notes during the interview, capturing as much verbatim quotation as possible. Interview transcripts were analyzed using standard grounded theory methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021934713482584">Charmaz, 2006</xref>), with all researchers first independently coding data, using in vivo codes, then meeting to compare their coding and resolve differences of interpretation.</p>

<title>What Is Justice?</title>
<p>One’s definition of justice is concerned with values learned through and deeply embedded in culture. Answers fall into four categories: individual rights through the workings of the justice system, appropriate consequences, social justice, and fairness. Only a few participants referred to justice as being about protecting individual rights. At the most basic level, Danielle said, “[Justice is] being heard, getting your voice across.” Willis cited <italic>Roe v. Wade</italic> as exemplifying justice as the right of “an individual to choose what they think is best for their personal body.” Isabella described a shift from individual rights to upholding law and order, as she explained how having a child “changed my definition of justice because before I had a child I always thought it was freedom everywhere, but as I had to look at what I’ve got to do to keep my child safe, I have to do the same thing or more [be able to have child protected from dangerous adults] to keep my child safe.” The primacy of the individual is squarely within a Eurocentric framework.</p>
<p>The greatest number defined justice in terms similar to Isabella’s changed idea, focusing on enforcement of laws through the civil/criminal justice system. Tyrone said simply “upholding the law,” while Bella said, “Whatever the judge says is like the final word.” After listing “crime, jail, and judges” as the three words coming to mind, Goldtooth explained that justice is “keeping the law and order . . . [and] to correct people’s care to fix crimes.”</p>
<p>Some cited injustice in the way the justice system deals with individuals. Washington spoke of a local example in which an elderly woman with mental disabilities was killed by police when she pulled scissors in defending herself against law enforcement officials when, he noted, “there should have been some crisis intervention.” Mustafa similarly called,<disp-quote>
<p>Let’s go back to the law and people: people in power. . . . If a man has money, he can buy his freedom. . . . I look at the system downtown, for example. . . . Let’s ay you accidentally have your license plate on the wrong side or accidentally ran a red light or you parked in the wrong place. Instead of they talk to you or giving a warning first, they write a ticket and keep raising the price, people don’t have that kind of money and they’re looking at money rather than looking at the life of a human being.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Smith compared individuals’ and businesses’ treatment in the system: “Corporations, sometimes, do way more fraudulent activity than individuals. . . . But individuals get jail time that destroys their lives, their family’s lives.” While these latter examples indicate that justice should be fair and equitable, they are Eurocentric, endorsing the system itself as central. However, these latter examples also reference a larger community and imply involvement. Thus, while the definitions are Eurocentric, the critique is Afrocentric.</p>
<p>In a third category, many exemplified justice as appropriate consequences for behavior in order to protect and punish individuals. Willis described “where a teacher had accosted a student” and was disciplined, whereas Isabella told how “my auntie and my sisters [had] been [involved in] . . . domestic violence relationships and the police did step up and did arrest their boyfriends.” Grace and Danielle both focused on individuals as well: In Grace’s words, the “falsely accused then released,” and in Danielle’s, “a young man that was falsely accused of murder and . . . they found out that he didn’t do this and he was released back into society.” PA told of a case he had worked on for over a decade in which “eventually stars aligned” and “the system worked.”</p>
<p>In contrast, as an example of injustice, Isabella stated that not only do “the people that commit crimes” sometimes go unpunished, “but also the people that are in the justice system [who] do wrong things, too, and sometimes they don’t get that [same] discipline as the people doing crimes.” Similarly, Alicia and Danielle emphasized that justice involves holding people accountable at all levels of society. Grace’s statement provides a good summary: Society should “give them the same opportunity to choose to do right” and to be “informed about consequences,” as well as “equal chances . . . just treated equally.” The emphasis in this category on punishment and protection of individuals reveals a Eurocentric valuing of the individual. Appropriate consequences, however, is an enculturated view, quasi-individualistic, focusing on the relationship between victim and offender. Finally, an Afrocentric system is implied in that all examples (child abuse, domestic violence, murder, and abuse of official rights) implicate the broader society.</p>
<p>Many made the role of society explicit, describing justice as involving social justice that is part of institutions outside the civil and criminal systems, including education, social services, job opportunities, and health care. Most cited was education. Alicia simply stated, “Justice is equal education for every child.” Grace focused on education and “how those little kids have to keep going on despite everything.” Alicia drew parallels between justice in education and justice in the justice and social services systems as well:<disp-quote>
<p>If we just look at the curriculum for students versus [urban] versus [city] versus [inner city] district, that’s your injustice in education. If we look at the criminal convictions with that same spectrum, there’s your injustice for the criminal system. If we look at the fathers that are in jail for child support, it’s that same system. If you look at the representation for the aid to dependent children of welfare system and we both understand that the welfare system does not just mean money, and food stamps for families who need, it’s also for the rich; there’s welfare for them. They get tax write offs, that’s welfare, that’s welfare reform.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bella also drew connections between justice in social services and justice in societal attitudes and the role of education in shaping it: “I think when you ask anybody on the street like what should happen to someone who’s been a victim that they should receive help and they should get everything they can in the form of resources. But that isn’t happening.” Mustafa and Oscar both expounded on “equal pay” as core to justice, and Smith noted justice as the government’s providing a safety net for all citizens in “health care [and] unemployment.” Smith noted he was “stay[ing] on the political aspect of things” and related injustice in health care to injustice perpetrated in the media.</p>
<p>The word <italic>fairness</italic> was prominent in discussions of justice and was used in both criminal and civil systems and beyond it, in other social institutions. This category relates to consequences, but fairness is societal. Oscar said,<disp-quote>
<p>The first word that comes to my mind is being fair, fairness. And what I mean by being fair, in the sense of justice during the civil rights movement, if a person bought a ticket on a bus, he is entitled to have a seat on the bus, especially if that person happened to be the first person on the bus or the second person, he has the right. If he paid five dollars to sit on the bus he has just as much right to sit on the bus as another person, regardless of race or religion, he has that right. The same with a job. If a female takes a job and she is doing the same amount of work as a male, she’s entitled to get paid the same amount of money as that male is being paid.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others described a lack thereof. Bo explained, “First of all, justice is not always fair. . . . In other words, those that are rich, I think they get more than their share of justice.” Jan related social justice issues to budgetary decisions:<disp-quote>
<p>There was this woman and she had got raped, and there was a lot to do with money to run the kit. . . . They didn’t have enough money to run it. And so, you know . . . they had boxes upon boxes of swabs that people had got raped, and they couldn’t even look into it because they didn’t even have enough money in their state to look into it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An emphasis on fairness connotes the enculturated model, suggesting relationships within a community. Willis’s description of the process of achieving justice elucidates the value of fairness as within the enculturated framework: “The act of trying to bring fairness to a situation, you know, trying to reconcile two opposing views of the situation.” This is quasi-individualistic: Although individuals are ideally the recipients of the fair treatment, “fairness” can be determined only through process, comparison, and compromise within the community.</p>
<p>However, examples of justice as fairness can call on a higher order of justice. Smith stated that justice should be proactive rather than reactive: “I think there is a great injustice when it comes to the mere fact that people are hurting and dying and starving, and poverty has spread so gigantically through the world and at the same time they are throwing away food.”</p>
<p>Mustafa alone explicitly named a spiritual power: “There is another justice that we call a Universal Justice, or Divine Justice, the Almighty Judge, you know. . . . I think that God Himself has the final say of all.” This is particularly significant given his comment, noted above, that judgment in the secular court is highly fallible. Invocation of spiritual authority is Afrocentric.</p>
<p>This emphasis on fairness as being ultimately decided by a higher order and a “universal bank” and the importance of the community in creating a “just society” connotes an Afrocentric orientation.</p>
<p>In sum, defining “justice” called forth most explicitly values that are Eurocentric, focusing on individual rights and official processes within the justice system. However, as participants also discussed justice as involving accountability and consequences, and justice in systems other than the specifically criminal and civil systems, they also invoked values that are enculturated. Finally, in their consistent emphasis on justice as fairness within society, participants’ values connoted an Afrocentric framework.</p>

<title>What Are Sources of Knowledge About Justice?</title>
<p>The question of where beliefs about justice originate draws on individuals’ epistemologies, or sources of knowing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713482584">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). In general, a Eurocentric epistemology validates knowledge through the self, that is, individual, rational thought. Epistemology involves the scientific method, with no spiritual underpinning. An enculturated model has as its epistemological sources both the self and, secondarily, spirituality. In an Afrocentric model, the spiritual source is primary.</p>
<p>One source identified was media. Jan said, “I would say TV and observing things in real life.” A more commonly cited source was school. Isabella was most direct: “It’s my education and the way I was taught to define justice.” And PA elaborated on specific school-learned knowledge, saying, “Children start young and are explained about how America developed and the justice system from the Constitution.” Alicia pointed to positive knowledge about justice gained from her coursework at the university where, she stated, she received alternative ideas about justice. This knowledge is part of the explicit or intended curriculum. Both media and schooling are Eurocentric sources of knowledge in that they are dominant culture institutions.</p>
<p>Others, however, referred to their own experiences in school as being moments when they had had insights into justice. In these cases, learning justice was part of the hidden or unintended curriculum, that is, knowledge that they gained but was not an intended lesson. Willis noted, “I work in education . . . that comes up a lot in education. What’s fair, what’s not fair? Something that happens with a student, whether it is to another student or teacher.” Grace said, describing a graduate course, “I’m trying to go along with the program, but I never did hear nobody say nothing about the Black people, and I said, ‘I guess I’m in the wrong place and I don’t even exist.’” Knowledge as coming from individual experience and reflection on that experience centers the self as the source of knowledge. Even though there is a recognition of some communal influence on understanding, this is more of an enculturated model.</p>
<p>All participants cited life experiences as crucial sources of their knowledge. For example, Danielle described “just dealing with people, knowing they have been involved in different things in their lives, and learning how to work and advocate for myself.” Two participants cited experience “doing time in prison,” with Tyrone noting this helped develop “my internal belief.” Several specifically noted childhood experiences and parents. Smith explained,<disp-quote>
<p>I am mixed race . . . but at the time I was growing up, it was a big net to just put all those people in one room, one neighborhood, one community and call them African American. And a lot of injustice occurred, prejudice and civil rights problems occurred to that large group of mixed mulatto individuals, as if they were just one group, and so therefore just for the sake of survival. I think that a lot of code information in the culture itself, or how to deal with “the man” and how to prevent being victimized by the justice system itself, that colored—that created great color in the way that I look at justice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mustafa and Oscar narrated similar experiences, Oscar remembering,<disp-quote>
<p>Once as a young boy I traveled from the South to the North and my mother paid for a ticket and we was assigned to sit in a certain area, and other people paid for a ticket and they were assigned to sit in a certain area. But their area was much more up to date than what we had, and we had paid the same amount.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He related that experience to a historical observation, where “for every dollar they gave per student to the schools where African Americans went to, they gave 13 dollars to the other school where Whites were going at that time.” In both situations, he summarized, “I thought about this, and I thought, That’s not fair.”</p>
<p>Two referred to “common sense” and critical thinking as their primary source of knowledge. Mustafa said, “You don’t have to go to school for that, you learn that at home. Common sense will tell you that.” Washington expounded,<disp-quote>
<p>Now, however, you always are going to find men in positions that may use any type of book to subjugate one group. It’s done with Islam, it’s done with Christianity, it’s done with Judaism. That’s where the people have to stand up and say, “Wait one minute!” Since when—the Bible never taught that women shouldn’t vote. . . . There’s nothing in the Quran that says that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Active reflection on life experiences connotes an enculturated epistemology: Knowledge from these experiences depends on the individual self’s interpretation within a larger communal context.</p>
<p>Three participants spoke about learning from forebears and ancestors. Mustafa invoked “my people,” naming leaders in the civil rights movement. Grace extended this immediate circle of influence back through history:<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a different justice system, a different system of measurement, and how is that going to work? And it’s not just started. It’s been going on for centuries. And if it’s not started taking a different look, start a different process, put them all in there because both people get hurt.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Washington described,<disp-quote>
<p>My ideas of justice come from when I was introduced to the teachers of the honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam. Although those teachings have been portrayed negatively in the media and in different segments, someone would be hard pressed to find where one member of the Nation of Islam has denied anyone the right to liberty, freedom, justice housing, a place to work, any business, so that’s the way we deal with each other and that’s how we’re instructed to deal with those in our community and those outside of our community.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mustafa’s, Grace’s, and Washington’s sources cross between an enculturated model and the Afrocentric model: The idea of “my people” or a larger, ancestral knowledge is certainly spiritual, extending their immediate self to their ancestral heritage and a wider community.</p>
<p>Sources of knowledge about justice were evenly spread across the Eurocentric, enculturated, and Afrocentric models. Considering sources of knowledge promotes cross-cultural discourse. In the participants’ words about how they learned justice, we see the importance of intimate personal experience, at home with families, but also the impact of compulsory (school) or voluntary (religious) learning. Conversation about integrating instruction within the existing educational system may prove invaluable in addressing our justice system.</p>

<sec id="section9-0021934713482584">
<title>Who Are Decision Makers in the Current Justice System?</title>
<p>Worldview includes understandings of right relationships between individuals as well as social organization through institutions and the roles individuals are assigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021934713482584">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). In the Eurocentric model, relationships involve control of others and third-party decision makers. In an enculturated model, decisions are made within institutions, but attention to individuals dominates: victims’ needs and offenders’ responsibilities. In the Afrocentric model, all parties make decisions equally, and community decisions are supreme.</p>
<p>The majority saw decision makers as being officials within institutions, including elected officials, judges, and the police. Isabella named the U.S. president, mayors, and boards of education, while Jan expanded, “The mayor should be over the city and if he over the city, that’s his job to protect the families.” Mustafa claimed, “The people that make the law should see that that is done.” It is notable that all three specified this <italic>should</italic> be the case, implying that it was not always. Three named the police as significant decision makers, but by far the most said court officials were <italic>the</italic> decision makers. Willis summed up, “The court system . . . the judge and the jury ultimately being the decision makers, to go as high as the Supreme Court.” Mustafa added an “ought” factor to this, emphasizing that the judge is “supposed to determine the good and the bad . . . how the person should be punished . . . how to serve justice.” And Bella emphasized the need for more police training. Smith expanded on the number of roles involved:<disp-quote>
<p>The basic justice system: police who go after those who have a warrant submitted by a judge; your judge; your jailors; your prison guards; your defense counsel, prosecutors, and then you have your family as an advocate and support for either the victim or the person who is the perpetrator.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, these participants espoused a Eurocentric model of justice, wherein decisions are clearly and exclusively the realm of judges, with some input from other members of the legal system.</p>
<p>Significantly, however, there is a pronounced degree of skepticism as to how well this system serves true justice, and Smith introduces that in reality, one’s community support system is an important component—not going so far as to say they have decision-making powers, but certainly implying that their presence affects the decisions made. This view edges into an enculturated model.</p>
<p>Participants also named individuals as decision makers, describing an informal system of justice that exists outside the formal justice system. Asked who makes decisions, Bo stated simply, “Those in power, the rich.” Mustafa’s response brought the power of decision making based on individual resources into the realm of daily life:<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the thing here is all about money. Everything about it, the jury sitting up there, “I’m going to punish you.” In other words, making you pay all this kind of money out of your pocket. . . . Not everyone is able to pay that. I got a ticket one time and sent the money, and they sent me a nasty letter. . . . If you don’t have the income, you serve time in jail.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Grace also referred to daily life, but at a less commonly visible level: “If you’re not in the meeting, you don’t have the power.” Thus, both Mustafa and Grace place the most important decision makers as those individuals who wield the personal influence to create a system that supports their own interests. Washington brought this full circle:<disp-quote>
<p>It depends on who’s been offended, and sometimes the offender is the one that’s in the power position to deal justice, so sometimes people don’t get justice. . . . So when I think about justice, I’d like to see justice dealt out even, even if it means that friends or associates would be the offender. Even they aren’t immune to justice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Washington’s explanation highlights the individual’s involvement, acting as an individual influenced by personal experiences, cultural beliefs, and cultural groups, in making decisions about justice—and points out that this often results in a lack of justice. Willis described “the informal structures of justice that one might take into their own hands to get justice, so I think individuals also . . . are decision makers in that regard as well.” These worldviews represent the enculturated model, where individuals are deeply involved in processes to make decisions and enact processes. However, self-interest rather than victim needs and offender responsibilities often motivates decisions, leading to injustice.</p>
<p>The role of the community in making decisions was also prominent, as in Danielle’s didactic description:<disp-quote>
<p>The people. The community. It starts off with yourself first. Then . . . spread abroad, like the criminal justice, the courts. . . . Anybody can [help get] justice. . . done. You have to have a voice and speak out and let people know how you feel and what you want.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jan noted that decision makers “should be more into the people and what they think about it because we have to live here, and we have to deal with stuff like this.” Bo similarly said, “I think some of it may be better community awareness, because the community really is responsible for the people [who] serve the community. I think the problem is the community does not hold the people directly accountable.” Oscar elaborated, bringing in religious leaders and explicitly describing the need for education:<disp-quote>
<p>I always thought that we voted for certain people to legislate those types of policy. I thought that we had people who had evolved religiously so that they could look through scriptures and realize different things should take place among human beings, that it’s not fair for us to mistreat a person, it’s not fair for a person to bully a person, actually, to let a person know what is right, what is fair, and what is not fair. And I think that those people, in those positions, should educate persons about what is right and what is fair.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Community as decision makers is Afrocentric; particularly in Oscar’s elaboration, the active role of individuals in studying for themselves and educating others resonates with an Afrocentric approach.</p>
<p>Again, only Mustafa explicitly named a spiritual power: “There is another justice that we call a Universal Justice, or Divine Justice, the Almighty Judge, you know. . . . I think that God Himself has the final say of all.” This is particularly significant given his comment, noted above, that judgment in the secular court is highly fallible. Invocation of spiritual authority is Afrocentric.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Future Study</title>
<p>Participants from predominantly Black neighborhoods describe justice in terms of values and processes spread across the spectrum of Eurocentric, enculturated, and Afrocentric frameworks. Significantly, explicit answers tend to be in Eurocentric terms, and the Afrocentric aspects were most often implicit in the elaborations. Data suggest that to access the range of cultural understandings of justice, extensive dialogue and attention to detail in answers are necessary. Participants also discussed justice much more in terms suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021934713482584">Rawls (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021934713482584">Tonry (2011)</xref>, bringing examples of justice and injustice from all institutional realms of life, including family, schooling, transportation, employment, violence prevention, and politics as well as from the criminal justice system. While restorative justice and its sense of community may provide an alternative or perhaps a supplement to the current criminal justice system, it must be recognized that not all persons are accepting of the notion of justice within our society. We must work to embrace all cultures and all persons.</p>
<p>This progression constitutes a foundation for discussion of the justice system that does not pit one system against another, but identifies potential complementarity. Further research is necessary on this issue throughout the African diaspora. It is not known whether there is a difference between the influences of slavery as opposed to European colonization and its impact on perceptions of justice.</p>
<p>This article recommends integrating discussion of justice—both social and restorative, as well as the retributive already present—into kindergarten to postsecondary schooling and postdegree professional development. Though this might be most readily implemented in higher education, due to its research base and the flexibility of higher education’s curriculum to respond to new ideas, it will not happen widely until it is recognized and discussed in the dominant culture. Progress is already under way: Federal legislation is being introduced to incorporate restorative justice in the educational system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021934713482584">Restorative Justice in Schools Act, 2009</xref>), and national and international organizations are increasingly emphasizing education of the public about the “school-to-prison pipeline” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021934713482584">American Civil Liberties Union, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021934713482584">Children’s Defense Fund, 2007</xref>). True integration of culturally specific restorative justice can occur only after acceptance of it by the people, and acceptance can occur only through education.</p>
