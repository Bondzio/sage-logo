<bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate the qualitative impact of training in the endovascular era (post-2000) on vascular surgeons’ comfort level and enjoyment with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repairs. <bold>Methods:</bold> A sample of vascular surgeons (n = 1754) were sent a survey pertaining to their fellowship training and practice of AAA repair. The influence of training- and practice-related variables on qualitative outcomes was assessed. <bold>Results:</bold> A total of 382 (22%) surgeons completed the survey. Surgeons who performed more endovascular aneurysm repairs (EVARs) than open AAA repairs were more likely to enjoy EVAR (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Those completing fellowship after 2000 reported a higher level of procedure-related comfort with EVAR (<italic>P</italic> = .001) compared to those completing fellowship before 2000. Conversely, surgeons completing fellowship before 2000 reported a higher level of procedure-related comfort with open AAA repair (<italic>P</italic> = .001). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The advent of EVAR has changed fellowship training of AAA repair and has translated into changes in both practice patterns and comfort level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has radically transformed the field of abdominal aortic surgery over the last decade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411432147">Figure 1</xref>
).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432147">1</xref></sup> Since the introduction of EVAR by Parodi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411432147">2</xref></sup> in 1991 and the subsequent approval of early endovascular devices by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1999, a paradigm shift has been seen regarding the training and practice of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. In 2000, the Residency Review Committee for Surgery (RRC) established endovascular training as a required component of all accredited vascular surgery fellowship programs. The majority of training programs have since added an additional clinical year to the 1-year minimum clinical training required in order to meet the increased demands of training in endovascular surgery.</p>

<p>While much of the academic focus over the last decade centered on the importance of ensuring new vascular surgery trainees became fully competent with these new endovascular techniques,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411432147">3</xref></sup> a paucity of literature addressed the equal importance of maintaining a solid foundation in conventional open vascular skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432147">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411432147"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432147"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411432147"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411432147">8</xref></sup> Trends in vascular surgery training have demonstrated diminished volume of open AAA repairs performed by trainees as a result of the increased utilization of EVAR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411432147">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432147">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411432147">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411432147"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411432147">11</xref></sup> Data from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432147">1</xref></sup> reveal the total mean number of open infrarenal AAA repairs performed per vascular surgery trainee has steadily declined from 36.1 in 2000 to 16.8 in 2010. Over the same time period, vascular surgery trainees reported their mean operative experience with EVARs to increase by over 260%, from 16.9 to 44.2 procedures per trainee (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574411432147">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The shift toward a less-invasive approach to the surgical management of AAAs reflects a national trend, with one recent report citing EVAR to comprise over two thirds of all AAA repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411432147">12</xref></sup> Such trends are likely to continue well into the foreseeable future as subsequent generations of stent grafts expand the applicability of EVAR to more patients and more long-term studies are published confirming EVAR as a safe and durable therapeutic alternative to conventional open AAA repair. As a result of this trajectory in the management of AAAs, there has been legitimate concern whether there will be ample volume of open AAA repairs to adequately train current and future vascular surgery trainees to perform these highly technical operations. This apprehension appears justified given the finding that, despite the overall decline in open aortic surgery, the level of complexity for open AAA repairs appears to be increasing as the more straightforward cases are selectively treated endovascularly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432147">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432147">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411432147">7</xref></sup> The related topic of whether this decrease in open surgical volume permeated into the more subjective realms, namely those pertaining to surgeons’ perceptions and attitudes, has not yet been explored.</p>
<p>We undertook this study in order to define how the paradigm shift in the training of AAA repair has impacted practicing vascular surgeons’ perceptions of operative volume, enjoyment, and level of comfort with both open and endovascular AAA repairs. We hypothesized that vascular surgeons trained in the endovascular era (those completing training in or after 2000 when the RRC requirements for endovascular training where implemented) would feel less comfortable and receive less enjoyment performing open AAA repair compared to EVAR as a result of the decreased open surgical volume observed during their period of training.</p>

<sec id="section2-1538574411432147">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>An online-based survey was developed by the authors containing questions (See Appendix) pertaining to the training in and practice of AAA repair. Survey participation requests were sent to a randomly selected sample of 1754 practicing Society of Vascular Surgery (SVS) members. Responses were solicited on 2 separate occasions in August 2010 and were considered complete as of October 2010.</p>
<p>Primary outcome measures were perceived changes in open and endovascular AAA repair volume since starting practice, enjoyment from open versus endovascular AAA repair, and level of comfort with open and endovascular AAA repair. Study variables included both training- and practice-related factors. Training-related variables included fellowship completion date (pre- vs post-2000), length of fellowship training (1 vs 2 years), and hospital setting (university vs community). Practice-related variables included operating style (alone vs with a partner), practice type (academic vs private), and number of EVARs versus open AAA repairs performed as primary surgeon since fellowship completion. The influence of training- and practice-related variables on the outcomes was assessed using Pearson chi-square test, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, and Kruskal-Wallis test for univariate analysis, as appropriate. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression and multiple regression, as appropriate. All tests of significance were at the <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 level, and all statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Open AAA repair has traditionally served as an index procedure to evaluate the adequacy of vascular surgery training. The combination of increased utilization of endovascular techniques and diminished open AAA cases currently available to trainees represents a modern reality in the training and practice of vascular surgery. While the gradual decline in open aortic surgery has been well documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411432147">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432147">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411432147">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411432147"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411432147">11</xref></sup> the present study serves as the first to investigate the qualitative ramifications of this paradigm shift on vascular surgeons.</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that training in the endovascular era is associated with less comfort in the performance of open AAA repairs. While these results are based on subjective survey responses, they underscore the underlying issue of whether current trainees are receiving adequate training in open AAA repair. Not surprisingly, surgeons with more open AAA cases reported a higher comfort level with performing open AAA repairs. It is certainly logical (and expected) that increased experience leads to increased comfort with performing a given task or operation. The relationship between comfort level and operative outcome, however, has not been established. One would intuitively suspect that increased volume of experience would generate enhanced comfort and, together, these would yield superior outcomes. Indeed, surgeon-related variables have been shown to influence surgical outcomes.</p>
<p>In a recent report, McPhee and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574411432147">13</xref></sup> queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to determine the relative effects of both surgeon and institution volume on mortality after open and endovascular repairs of nonruptured AAAs. After adjustment for all patient and hospital level characteristics, individual surgeon volume was found to be a more critical determinant of mortality after open AAA repair than hospital volume alone. The study noted that low-volume surgeons had mortality rates nearly double that of high-volume surgeons (5.1% vs 2.8%) even at high-volume institutions. Similar findings were noted in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 6 studies (n = 51 453) conducted by Young et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574411432147">14</xref></sup> Elective AAA repairs performed by higher volume surgeons conferred a survival advantage in their analysis.</p>
<p>The Vascular Surgery Board of the American Board of Surgeons has developed multiple new training paradigms in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411432147">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411432147"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411432147">17</xref></sup> In addition to the traditional 5 + 2 paradigm, new paradigms include a direct track starting immediately upon medical school graduation (0 + 5), an integrated training program with general surgery (3 + 3), and an early specialization program (4 + 2). These distinct training paradigms aim to address multiple concerns surrounding how to best prepare the next generation of vascular specialists. Such paradigms allow the opportunity for more vascular surgery-specific training in open and endovascular techniques, as well as vascular medicine, noninvasive laboratory, and vascular imaging.</p>
<p>Despite the disparity in comfort level with open and endovascular AAA repairs seen in our study, surgeons reported no significant difference in enjoyment performing these 2 procedures. This finding is reassuring not only because these 2 procedures are at the core of our field, but also because they are what attracts the next generation of trainees. A recent survey of applicants to the nation’s integrated vascular surgery programs indicated endovascular technology and challenging open vascular surgical operations as the most influential factors affecting their decision to choose vascular surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411432147">18</xref></sup> In an earlier study, Calligaro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574411432147">19</xref></sup> demonstrated technical aspects and complex decision making involved in vascular surgery are the 2 most important reasons vascular surgery fellows chose vascular surgery as a specialty.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the question arises as to whether future vascular surgeons will be adequately trained to perform open AAA repair. Naturally, with branched and fenestrated devices on the horizon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574411432147">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411432147"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574411432147">22</xref></sup> the need for open AAA skills may decline significantly. However, until the feasibility and long-term durability of these devices as well as applicability to all anatomic variations is proven, open AAA repair will still be necessary. In addition, in light of recent literature suggesting potential issues with EVAR durability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574411432147">23</xref></sup> the need for open AAA repair remains clear.</p>
<p>In short, the number of open aneurysm repairs has declined and may continue to decline as the technology of EVAR evolves. Furthermore, the majority of open AAA repairs are becoming concentrated at tertiary centers and the training for these repairs is following suit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574411432147">24</xref></sup> While the future necessity of open AAA repair will likely decline due to endovascular techniques, the immediate and mid-term future still require this technique. Clearly, as evidenced by the present study, not all vascular surgeons will feel comfortable performing this procedure. This will lead to the continued natural gravitation of open aneurysm repairs to selected centers of excellence. Ultimately, open AAA repair may become a niche skill practiced by those specially trained in this technique.</p>
