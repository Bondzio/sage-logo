<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory progressive disease of the vascular wall characterized by the progressive accumulation of lipids, macrophages, mast cells, smooth muscle cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311423780">1</xref></sup> Rupture of the atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque represents a key process that initiates acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The vulnerability of plaques is characterized by the presence of a soft, lipid-rich core that is covered by a thin cap of fibrous tissue. The accumulation of inflammatory cells and ECM degradation are associated with plaque rupture. By inducing matrix metalloproteinase-mediated ECM degradation, extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is reported to have a role in the destabilization of atheroma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311423780">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>EMMPRIN is a 58-kDa cell surface glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Originally, EMMPRIN expression was described in tumor cells, where it can induce the synthesis of MMPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311423780">3</xref></sup> Recently, EMMPRIN expression has been described in macrophages and in human atheroma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311423780">4</xref></sup> EMMPRIN is up-regulated on monocytes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Furthermore, EMMPRIN regulates the activity of MMPs in cardiovascular cells in AMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311423780">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main active peptide in the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), regulating cellular and physiological responses in the cardiovascular system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311423780">6</xref></sup> Tissue culture and animal experiments have demonstrated a variety of mechanisms by which Ang II, an effector of the RAS, may promote atherogenesis by induction of cell growth and proliferation, oxidative stress, adhesion and chemoattractant molecules and cytokines. Ang II is also implicated in pathophysiological processes related to vascular injury and repair, by promoting oxidative stress in the vascular wall, which leads to endothelial dysfunction, endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis, and lipoprotein peroxidation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311423780">7</xref></sup> In addition, it was demonstrated that Ang II could upregulate the expression of MMPs in vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311423780">8</xref></sup> Moreover, the results of many clinical and experimental trials have verified the pathological contribution of Ang II to plaque instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311423780">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311423780">10</xref></sup> Ang II signals through G protein-coupled angiotensin receptor subtype-1 (AT1) and subtype-2 (AT2) based on their selective afﬁnity for peptide and non-peptide ligands. Speciﬁc non-peptide antagonists, such as valsartan, block AT1 receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311423780">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>As factors of atherosclerosis, Ang II and EMMPRIN have been shown to mediate plaque destabilization in myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311423780">5</xref></sup> However, the mechanism and the signaling pathway between them in aortic atherosclerotic plaques are not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined the expression of EMMPRIN in apolipoprotein E knockout mice, a model of aortic atherosclerotic plaque induced by fat-feeding, and investigated the effect of AT1 by which Ang II affects EMMPRIN expression in aortic atherosclerotic plaques.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>Ang II and A9525 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St Louis, MO, USA). Goat anti-EMMPRIN polyclonal antibody sc-9757, dithiothreitol (DTT), aprotinin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), Tween 20, and Nonidet 40 (NP-40) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Bio Inc. (CA, USA). The mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody, NB600-501, was from Novus Biologicals (CO, USA). Animal RNAOUT was purchased from Santa Cruz Bio Inc. (CA, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the diaminobenzidine color reagent kit were purchased from Zhongshan Golden Bridge Bio Co. (Beijing, China). The one-step RT-PCR Kit and the SYBR Green 1 Real-time RT-PCR kit were purchased from TaKaRa Bio Inc. (Dalian, China). Valsartan was a generous gift from Novartis.</p>

<sec id="section4-1470320311423780">
<title>Mouse model</title>
<p>Apolipoprotein E knockout male mice (six weeks of age) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. (Beijing, China). All 21 mice were fed with a normal rodent diet with a high-fat content which contained 21% fat from lard and was supplemented with 0.15% (w/w) cholesterol for 16 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311423780">12</xref></sup> Diet and water were provided ad libitum. At 12 weeks the mice were distributed randomly and evenly into the control group, the Ang II group, and the valsartan group. The Ang II group and the valsartan group (<italic>n</italic> = 7) received a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump (Alzet Model 2004) containing Ang II at a dosage (of 750 µg/kg per day), the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 7) received normal saline. The valsartan group simultaneously received intragastric administration of valsartan suspension (40 mg/kg).</p>

<sec id="section6-1470320311423780">
<title>Specimen collection</title>
<p>Animals were surgically anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbitone. Ascending aortas were removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde, then sliced into a 4-µm thick continuous line of paraffin sections starting from the aortic root in the three groups of ApoE−/− mice (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Other sections of the aortas (from the descending aorta to the abdominal aorta) were stored at −70°C.</p>

<sec id="section7-1470320311423780">
<title>Pathology and evaluation of plaque composition and lesion size</title>
<p>Aortic paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to observe atherosclerotic plaque morphology. Each cross-sectional area of each plaque was analyzed using computer assisted morphometry (IPP6.0). Maximum lesion area, maximum lesion thickness, maximum percent stenosis and maximum area of the necrotic core per animal were identified and used for a subsequent statistical comparison of the three groups. In each group, five sections were randomly selected, taking the average for statistics.</p>

<sec id="section8-1470320311423780">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Serial 4-µm paraffin sections were dewaxed and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide. After sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), they were incubated for 30 min at 4°C, then incubated with goat anti-EMMPRIN polyclonal antibody in 1% (w/v) BSA in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) overnight, which was diluted 1:00 in 1% BSA in PBS. Sections were then incubated at room temperature with the peroxidase-conjugated affinipure rabbit anti-goat secondary antibodies for 20 min, which was diluted 1:500 in 1% BSA in PBS. Sections were colored with diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a substrate and afterstained with hematoxylin to reveal nuclei. Brown particles seen under the light microscope were considered positive. The positive staining integrated optical density (IOD) was measured by IPP6.0 color microscopic image analysis software for semi-quantitative analysis. In each group, five DAB stained paraffin sections were randomly selected, taking the average of five measurements of the IOD values for each group.</p>

<title>Protein isolation and Western blot analysis</title>
<p>For Western blot analysis, mouse aorta (<italic>n</italic> = 7) was homogenized and ground in liquid nitrogen, then lysed by RIPA lysate and 100 µl PMSF in ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4°C, the protein was obtained as the deposition. The protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie brilliant blue method using BSA as a standard. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gels). The protein was subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting for 0.5 h at 50 V. The membrane was blocked in a 6% non-fat milk solution in TBS with 0.5% Tween 20. The membrane was allowed to react with a speciﬁc antibody and the detection of speciﬁc proteins was carried out by enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer’s instructions. X-pressed exposure, protein expression was evaluated by EMMPRIN and β-actin band integral area ratio of absorption with the GSD8000 density scanning system. β-Actin was used as a loading control.</p>

<title>EMMPRIN expression and localization in aortic atherosclerotic plaques</title>
<p>EMMPRIN expression in macrophages was investigated in vitro. Aortic atherosclerotic plaques contained brown particles positive for the expression of EMMPRIN. Treatment with both Ang II and valsartan induced EMMPRIN expression. Both the Ang II group and the valsartan group showed increased expression of EMMPRIN in aortic atherosclerotic plaques compared with the control group (A). However, treatment with Ang II alone (B) up-regulated EMMPRIN expression in aortic atherosclerotic plaques; this effect was decreased by valsartan (C). In order to analyze the tissue localization of EMMPRIN, the aortic atherosclerotic plaque paraffin sections were subjected to DAB staining: EMMPRIN was localized predominantly in the aortic atherosclerotic plaques, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470320311423780">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated an Ang II-mediated increase in MMPs expression in some cell lines. In addition, recent immunohistochemical analyses revealed a colocalization of MMPs and EMMPRIN in macrophage-rich areas in human atherosclerotic plaques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311423780">4</xref></sup> Moreover, Ang II provides a direct stimulating effect by promoting the induction of vulnerable plaques probably via an AT1R-dependent pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311423780">13</xref></sup> However, our knowledge of the exact mechanism is incomplete and this study focused on the signaling mechanisms involved in the Ang II-mediated EMMPRIN expression in aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE-knockout mice in vivo. The results demonstrate that Ang II induced EMMPRIN expression via AT1 in aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE-knockout mice.</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that plaque rupture in ApoE-knockout mice can occur either by feeding with normal chow or a fat-enriched diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311423780">14</xref></sup> After eight weeks of fat feeding, the development of unstable plaques was observed in male ApoE-knockout mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311423780">15</xref></sup> Most of these mice developed atherosclerotic plaque rupture associated with luminal thrombus. The ruptures were characterized by fragmentation and loss of elastin and smooth muscle cells in the fibrous caps of relatively small and lipid-rich plaques overlying large complex lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311423780">16</xref></sup> Our study suggests that Ang II increased the plaque vulnerability in ApoE-knockout mice. Ang II promotes plaque progression which indirectly increases lipid deposition and the expression of MMPs inducing degradation of the ECM.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrated that Ang II upregulates the mRNA and protein expression of EMMPRIN in aortic atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE-knockout mice. In the last few years, experimental research has demonstrated that Ang II induces EMMPRIN expression in human macrophages, and a clinical researcher demonstrated that EMMPRIN is upregulated on monocytes in AMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311423780">17</xref></sup> Zhu et al. reported that EMMPRIN expression was signiﬁcantly increased in a mouse model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia. These authors also proved EMMPRIN localization in the peri-infarct cortex by immunohistochemistry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311423780">18</xref></sup> These findings suggest that Ang II can induce EMMPRIN within the plaque, which can stimulate MMPs to digest the ECM and promote atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability. In cardiac disease, EMMPRIN, MMP-2, and MMP-9 levels are increased in patients suffering from AMI, but not in patients with stable angina. MMP-9 activity levels are increased in unstable plaques, whereas MMP-2 activity levels are higher in stable plaques. The expression of MMPs was associated with different glycosylated EMMPRIN forms. Differences in EMMPRIN forms are also observed among plaque phenotypes;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311423780">19</xref></sup> therefore, N-linked glycosylation is critical to EMMPRIN and is postulated to serve as a regulatory mechanism of EMMPRIN function which regulates MMPs transcription and advanced plaque instability. Thus, EMMPRIN glycosylation may serve as an important therapeutic target for the treatment of arteriosclerosis.</p>
<p>In the cardiovascular system, MMPs are mainly produced by EC, smooth muscle cell, and macrophages. Moreover, MMPs participating in post-infarction left ventricular remodeling are produced by cardiomyocytes. One of the MMP-9 gene variants was found to cause increased activity of this MMP and to correlate with three-vessel coronary disease and higher susceptibility to acute coronary events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311423780">20</xref></sup> The striking feature of MMPs is that their genes are inducible. And our study revealed that Ang II also increased the activity of MMP-2, MMP-9 in aorta in ApoE-knockout mice, and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) reversed the effect of Ang II. It has been proven that MMP activity in non-stenotic unstable plaques is higher than in stenotic ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423780">21</xref></sup> The progression of an atherosclerotic lesion to the unstable phenotype is accompanied by some specific changes in its structure: the content of the lipid core is decreased while the concentration of inflammatory cells increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311423780">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent clinical studies, such as LIFE and the Jikei Heart Study, demonstrated that an ARB prevented the onset of stroke beyond blood pressure-lowering effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311423780">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311423780">21</xref></sup> These data suggest that inhibition of Ang II signaling by ARB could act as anti-inflammatory therapy. Our results showed that AT1R is partially involved in Ang II-induced EMMPRIN expression, and the ARB (valsartan) reversed this effect. Other studies showed that nuclear factor- kappaB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) are involved in Ang II stimulation of MMP secretion in human vascular smooth muscle cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311423780">22</xref></sup> Recently, Yang et al. reported that angiotensin II induces EMMPRIN expression via the NF-kappaB pathway in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320311423780">23</xref></sup> Therefore, we speculate that NF-κB may partially participate in Ang II-induced expression of EMMPRIN by AT1. These findings provide further support for the possibility that AT1 antagonists might provide a novel form of therapy for plaque stabilization in patients with atherosclerotic disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study examines the stimulation of EMMPRIN expression by Ang II in aortic plaques in ApoE-knockout mice via AT1R. In addition, EMMPRIN is located in aortic atherosclerotic plaque and Ang II induces atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability. Further research is required to elucidate details of the mechanism involved.</p>
