<abstract>
<p>This article reviews and critiques the literature on mentoring functions and roles in education and business to inform the use of mentoring as a developmental tool in both fields. Specifically, in an effort to expand the current notions of the different mentor roles, this review synthesizes studies exploring teacher mentoring in schools and organizational mentoring in business settings to identify the varied ways in which mentors provide challenge and support to protégés. As the fields of education and business explore mentoring from different lenses, an integrative perspective as offered by this article is required to allow both fields learn from each other and to make mentoring research more inclusive of the diverse perspectives originating from multiple disciplines.</p>

<p>Mentoring has long been acclaimed to be a human resource development (HRD) tool in organizations. Quite a few scholars have examined the processes and outcomes of mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312465608">D’Abate, Eddy, &amp; Tannenbaum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312465608">Hegstad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312465608">Hegstad &amp; Wentling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534484312465608">Mullen, 1998</xref>), and some have even delineated the relevance of mentoring for career development, organizational development, and training and development, the three domains of HRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312465608">Hezlett &amp; Gibson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312465608">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312465608">McLagan, 1989</xref>). However, being an often-recognized HRD tool does not imply that it is a deeply understood one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534484312465608">McCauley, 2005</xref>). While there can be several ways to expand our understanding of mentoring, one critical gap in our inquiry about mentoring, which if addressed can increase our knowledge concerning its use as an HRD tool, is the lack of a multidisciplinary focus. Given that there is wide consensus on the multidisciplinary nature of HRD as a field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312465608">Chalofsky, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312465608">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312465608">McGuire &amp; Cseh, 2006</xref>), and benefits of mentoring are reported to be pervasive in multiple fields as diverse as business, nursing, education, accounting, law, engineering, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312465608">de Janesz &amp; Sullivan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; Cotton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1534484312465608">Smith, McAllister, &amp; Crawford, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1534484312465608">Wallace, 2001</xref>), this lack of attention toward integrating our understanding of mentoring across different disciplines warrants immediate consideration. Integration of mentoring literature across disciplines can be invaluable toward helping HRD professionals develop a broader repertoire of knowledge on mentoring and better apply their knowledge in multiple kinds of organizational settings.</p>
<p>Toward this end, there is need for integrative literature reviews that can compare and critique the expanding knowledge base on mentoring as it continues to develop in different disciplines. A few salient attempts include the critical review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534484312465608">Merriam (1983)</xref> synthesizing mentoring concepts from the fields of adult development, business, and academia; the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312465608">Galvez-Hjornevik (1986)</xref> informing the scholarship and practice of teacher mentoring about mentoring research in business and adult development; the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312465608">Ehrich, Hansford, and Tennent (2004)</xref> integrating the benefits and pitfalls of mentoring across the disciplines of education, medicine, and business; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312465608">Eby and Allen’s (2008)</xref> special issue assimilating extant scholarship on mentoring different populations ranging from the youth to young adults in college settings, and workplaces.</p>
<p>In reviewing the conceptualizations of mentoring, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534484312465608">Merriam (1983)</xref> concluded that the phenomenon of mentoring represented different things to different fields. While the developmental psychologists saw mentoring to be an intense emotional relationship contributing to adult development in all aspects of life, the business world primarily focused on how the mentor can guide the protégé’s career, and the world of academia viewed the mentor’s role to be similar to that of a teacher. She concluded with a call for future research to clarify the muddy concept of mentoring by continuing to integrate studies scattered across several disciplines and systematically examining for common findings, trends, and generalizations. Similarly, the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312465608">Galvez-Hjornevik (1986)</xref> questioned the extent to which the meaning of the word “mentor” as identified in other fields is applicable to the mentor teachers participating in teacher induction programs and advocated for broadening the boundaries of teacher mentoring by utilizing knowledge acquired on mentoring in other professions. The review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312465608">Ehrich et al. (2004)</xref> listed similarities and differences in the outcomes of mentoring in education, business, and medicine and concluded with an emphasis on synthesizing the sheer volume of literature on mentoring across a variety of disciplines. And the assortment of seven articles edited by Eby and Allen in the 2008 special issue of <italic>Journal of Vocational Behavior</italic> exemplified a scholarly effort toward transcending disciplinary silos and capitalizing on the decades of mentoring research in different disciplines. The work of these scholars is a testament to the critical need for interdisciplinary research in mentoring that helps to generate novel insights and solutions to understanding the complexities of developmental relationships that may not relent to simplistic approaches of any one specialty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312465608">Eby &amp; Allen, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Purpose and Significance of the Study</title>
<p>Continuing this important line of scholarship, the purpose of this study is to review how “mentoring functions” are conceptualized and described in the disciplines of education and business, specifically for mentoring provided/received by teachers in schools as reported in education and by employees in organizations as reported in business. For purposes of this study, “mentoring functions” refers to the different roles played by mentors in helping protégés in organizational settings. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312465608">Kram’s (1983)</xref> description of mentoring functions provided by managers acting as mentors, there have been few attempts at expanding our understanding of the different roles that mentors can play in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312465608">Dreher &amp; Ash, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312465608">Fowler &amp; O’Gorman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312465608">Levesque, O’Neill, Nelson, &amp; Dumas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1534484312465608">O’Neill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534484312465608">Ragins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; McFarlin., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1534484312465608">Scandura, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534484312465608">Scandura &amp; Ragins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1534484312465608">Shen &amp; Kram, 2011</xref>). However, these attempts lack an interdisciplinary focus. Barring some preliminary glances into comparing the concept and outcomes of teacher mentoring and mentoring in business by a few scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312465608">Ehrich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312465608">Galvez-Hjornevik, 1986</xref>), no study has tried to extend the boundaries of our current notions of different mentor roles through comparing the “mentoring functions” reported in education and business. As mentoring has long been proclaimed to be a developmental tool that can contribute to career and organizational development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312465608">Egan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312465608">Hezlett &amp; Gibson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1534484312465608">Wanberg, Welsh, &amp; Hezlett, 2003</xref>), an interdisciplinary inquiry on how the scope of “mentoring functions” can be expanded will benefit human resource development (HRD) professionals by informing developmental initiatives such as formal mentoring programs in different kinds of organizational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312465608">Hezlett &amp; Gibson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Specifically, exploring the different ways that <italic>challenge</italic> and <italic>support</italic> manifest in “mentoring functions” provided/received by teachers in schools and by employees in business settings can contribute toward broadening the understanding of mentor roles. A brief look at the literature suggests that scholars in both fields of education and business advocate a dual focus on challenge and support in mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312465608">Daloz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312465608">McGowan, Stone, &amp; Kegan, 2007</xref>). For instance, in his seminal book, <italic>Effective Teaching and Mentoring</italic>, Daloz describes the characteristics of support and challenge and the ways in which they might combine to foster learning in mentoring. He describes support as an affirming activity that makes the protégé feel cared for and challenged to consist of actions that can stimulate cognitive dissonance through introduction of ideas that contradict those of the protégé or question the protégé’s tacit assumptions. Following a similar line of thought, the chapter by McGowan et al. in the <italic>Handbook of Mentoring</italic>, edited by Belle Rose Ragins and Kathy Kram, the pioneering scholars of mentoring in business, explains how mentors need to provide contradiction (i.e., challenging the protégé to let go of a stationary balance) and confirmation (i.e., acknowledging, affirming, and supporting protégé’s evolution) in order to contribute toward their protégé’s development. Thus, a review exploring the nature of challenging and supportive mentoring functions provided by teacher mentors and mentors in business can enlighten HRD professionals about the various ways mentors can be trained to benefit protégé’s development.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The integrated literature review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1534484312465608">Torraco, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1534484312465608">Yorks, 2008</xref>) method was chosen as the primary lens to synthesize the streams of literature on “mentoring functions” in the fields of education and business. For mentoring in education, this review specifically focused on studies published in peer-reviewed education journals describing the “mentoring functions” performed by teacher mentors in schools. For mentoring in business, studies published in peer-reviewed business journals describing “mentoring functions” performed by mentors in business organizations were reviewed. An integrative literature review is a “form of research that reviews, critiques, and synthesizes representative literature on a topic in an integrated way such that new frameworks and perspectives on the topic are generated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1534484312465608">Torraco, 2005</xref>, p. 356). A focused integrative review limited in chronological and conceptual scope can yield new insights and significant reconceptualizations of mature and long-standing topics like “mentoring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312465608">Callahan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1534484312465608">Torraco, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Following this guideline, this study focused the scope of the integrative review in two ways. First, for the purpose of exploring how “mentoring” is understood and conceptualized in the fields of education (teacher mentoring in schools) and business (mentoring in business organizations), the researcher presented and discussed the definitions of “mentoring” (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534484312465608">Tables 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534484312465608">2</xref> for definitions) through a chronological review of the seminal work on mentoring in both fields in approximately the past three decades (i.e., from 1980 to 2012). Second, for the purpose of examining how the “mentoring functions” providing challenge and support are conceptualized in the fields of education (teacher mentoring in schools) and business (mentoring in business organizations), the researcher developed two concept matrices (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534484312465608">Tables 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">4</xref>) that list the key “mentoring functions” reported in the two fields in the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1534484312465608">Webster &amp; Watson, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>To be included in the concept matrices (e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534484312465608">Tables 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">4</xref>), the study needed to present original conceptualizations or descriptions of the different functions or roles performed by mentors. For example, quantitative studies developing scales that estimate different challenging and supportive functions performed by mentors or qualitative studies giving in-depth descriptions of the different roles played by mentors to challenge and support their protégés met the criteria of “original conceptualization or description” for inclusion in the concept matrices. Studies validating or using previously developed scales of “mentoring functions” to examine the relationship between mentoring functions provided/received and various outcome variables related to work attitudes or career success were excluded from this review on grounds of lack of originality in conceptualizing or describing different functions performed by mentors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, conference presentations and proceedings were not included to stay true to the criteria of using peer-reviewed studies published in education and business journals. Online databases such as EBSCO, ERIC, ProQuest, PsycARTICLES, PsycLIT, JESTOR, Sociological Abstracts, and Business Source were systematically searched using the combination of following keywords: teacher mentoring, mentoring functions/roles in organizations, mentoring for beginning teachers, mentoring function scales. Although the initial search yielded thousands of articles, most of these studies did not meet the criteria of “original conceptualization or description of mentoring functions” as these studies were conducted with scales that have been developed and validated previously. For the purpose of this review, the researcher conducted a thorough screening to access the original sources of those “mentoring function’ scales and identify qualitative studies exploring and describing the nature of different roles played by mentors.</p>
<p>This review included studies presenting original descriptions of both formal (e.g., a program designed and developed by the organization to facilitate structured mentoring relationships) and informal mentoring (e.g., naturally occurring relationship based on attributes, attraction, and similar interests) functions provided/received by teachers in schools and employees in business organizations. In total, 45 studies were deemed to be relevant to be included in the concept matrices (e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534484312465608">Tables 3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">4</xref>), providing original descriptions of “mentoring functions/roles.” An inductive analysis procedure was used to compare and critique the challenging and supportive mentoring functions reported by the studies included in the concept matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312465608">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). First, following the description of “challenge” and “support” in mentoring provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312465608">Daloz (1986)</xref> in the field of education and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312465608">McGowan et al. (2007)</xref> in business, the mentoring functions reported by the studies included in the concept matrices were sorted into the categories of “challenging” and “supporting.” Then, this categorization guided the researcher to compare and critique the boundaries of mentoring functions in both fields and outline how future research on mentoring can be more inclusive of the diverse perspectives originating from multiple disciplines.</p>

<title>Mentoring Defined</title>
<p>This section summarizes the major similarities and distinctions in conceptualizations of teacher mentoring and mentoring in business by (a) providing a summary of the ways the fields of education and business define mentoring, and (b) making connections to integrate these definitions to outline insights gained from this inquiry.</p>
<sec id="section4-1534484312465608">
<title>Mentoring in Education</title>
<p>The origins of mentoring initiatives for teachers in schools can be traced back to the school reform movements in 1980s. During these movements, policy makers and educational leaders advocated for mentoring as a strategy to retain the newly qualified teachers by allowing them access to capable senior teachers who could mitigate the “reality shock” that beginning teachers commonly experienced when they started teaching in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312465608">Hobson, Ashby, Malderez, &amp; Tomlinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1534484312465608">Veenman, 1984</xref>). A quick glance at the history of mentoring in education indicates a significant role played by the state governments in initiating formal mentor programs for the purposes of teacher certification and induction. Mentors were paid a stipend to help prepare beginning teachers satisfy the state’s criteria for certification in different competency areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312465608">Little, 1990</xref>). Given the obvious benefits of mentoring in teacher retention, several scholars have studied the nature, effectiveness, limitations, and advantages of mentoring for teachers since the 1980s. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534484312465608">Table 1</xref> presents a chronological overview of the definitions of mentoring, giving a snapshot of the varied ways in which teacher mentoring has been conceptualized over the past three decades approximately.</p>
<p>As evident in the definitions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534484312465608">Table 1</xref>, the expectations and the applicability of mentoring are varied. Echoing this thought, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1534484312465608">Wildman, Maggliaro, Niles, and Niles (1992)</xref> suggest that imposition of any one definition of mentoring upon teachers who work in different settings is a mistake as every mentor–protégé pair is likely to adapt the mentoring concept to their own needs. Despite the variability, some central themes can be identified from the definitions listed. For instance, some definitions explicitly indicate that mentoring among teachers is a multidimensional concept that requires the mentor to play several roles ranging from being a role model to a counsel, teacher, guide, and a friend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312465608">Adey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312465608">Anderson &amp; Shannon, 1988</xref>). Other definitions focus on the nature of a mentoring relationship in terms of specifying that the relationship is dynamic, interactive, personal, reciprocal, and collaborative leading to growth for both the mentor (veteran teacher) and the protégé (novice teacher; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312465608">Boreen &amp; Niday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312465608">Lindgren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312465608">Lopez-Real &amp; Kwan, 2005</xref>). Some make clear that the mentoring relationships are embedded within the context of the teaching profession in schools with the primary purpose of attending to the socialization and learning needs of the novice teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312465608">Fairbanks, Freedman, &amp; Kahn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312465608">Hobson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534484312465608">Lee &amp; Feng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1534484312465608">Smith &amp; Ingersoll, 2004</xref>). Last, a few indicate the transformational value of mentoring in terms of the mentors sharing a vision and principles of good teaching while helping the novice teachers learn at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312465608">Feiman-Nemser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534484312465608">Jacques, 1992</xref>).</p>

<title>Mentoring in Business</title>
<p>Similar to mentoring in education, the concept of mentoring started gaining popularity in the field of business due to the growing need of retaining managers in early career stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534484312465608">Schein, 1978</xref>). This critical need to retain and develop managers to replace those who were about to retire led organizations to invest in career development processes such as mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312465608">Burke, 1984</xref>). Since the 1980s, studies on mentoring have proliferated in the business literature due to the substantial benefits of mentoring reported for the mentor, protégé, and for the organization. Several areas of managerial and organizational functions that mentoring is reported to influence include job performance, early career socialization, career management, retention of high potential talent, and leader development to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312465608">Chao, Walz, &amp; Gardner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; Cotton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1534484312465608">Scandura &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>). Thus, given these wide range of benefits, business scholars have attempted to define the phenomenon of mentoring in ways that reflect its varied scopes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534484312465608">Table 2</xref> presents a chronological overview of the definitions, giving a snapshot of the different ways in which mentoring has been conceptualized in business over the past three decades approximately.</p>
<p>Similar to our review of definitions of teacher mentoring, the definitions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534484312465608">Table 2</xref> represent a wide range of conceptualizations related to mentoring in business. In spite of the expected variations, the definitions reviewed inform us of some central themes. First, the definitions seem to indicate that mentoring entails the mentor to play multiple roles that serve the overarching purposes of supporting both career and psychosocial development of the protégé (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312465608">Chao et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312465608">Fowler &amp; O’Gorman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312465608">Kram, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534484312465608">Olian, Caroll, Giannantonio, &amp; Feren, 1988</xref>). Second, although some definitions emphasize the reciprocal nature of mentoring leading to benefits for both the mentor and the protégé (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312465608">Levesque et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534484312465608">Ragins, 2009</xref>), others specify protégé’s career development to be the primary focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312465608">Eby, Rhodes, &amp; Allen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312465608">Godshalk &amp; Sosik, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312465608">Hunt &amp; Michael, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1534484312465608">O’Neill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; Kram, 2007</xref>). Third, almost all definitions agree that the organizational status of the mentor needs to be influential and senior for purposes of supporting protégé’s development within the career context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312465608">Eby et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312465608">Godshalk &amp; Sosik, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312465608">Hunt &amp; Michael, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1534484312465608">O’Neill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; Cotton, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Integrating Mentoring Definitions in Education and Business</title>
<p>A comparison of the various definitions of teacher mentoring and mentoring in business listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534484312465608">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534484312465608">2</xref> clearly shows several common themes in the ways that scholars in both fields conceptualize the phenomenon of mentoring. For instance, both fields agree on the multidimensional nature of a mentoring relationship in acknowledging the different functions provided by the mentors. Furthermore, scholars in both fields note reciprocity to be inherent in the way a mentoring relationship manifests over time between the mentor and the protégé. In addition, both fields situate the mentoring relationship within the professional context with a primary focus on protégé’s development in order to specify its scope and distinguish mentoring from other kinds of supportive relationships. Thus, in light of this finding, it makes all the more sense to conduct a detailed comparison of the nuances of the different mentor functions reported in both fields so as to explore whether such an inquiry can inform the scholarship and practice of mentoring in education and business. The following section presents the concept matrices depicting the commonly cited mentoring functions in the fields of education and business followed by a detailed discussion of the conceptualizations of each kind of challenging and supportive mentoring functions in the two fields.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534484312465608">
<title>Mentoring Functions in Education and Business</title>
<p>Only empirical studies providing “original conceptualization or description” of various functions performed by teacher mentors in schools and mentors in business organizations informed the concept matrices (e.g., <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534484312465608">Tables 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">4</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534484312465608">Table 3</xref> shows the 10 mentoring functions reported by the review of empirical studies conducted on teacher mentoring in education. The functions are (a) encouraging reflection, (b) coaching, (c) counseling, (d) assessing, (e) role modeling, (f) being a colleague/fellow learner, (g) parenting, (h) mediating, (i) making friend, and (j) teaching. A comparison of these findings with our review of mentoring in business organizations informs us about some similar and distinct mentoring functions. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">Table 4</xref>, the 11 mentoring functions reported by studies in business are (a) challenging assignments, (b) coaching, (c) counseling, (d) role modeling, (e) sponsoring/advocating, (f) protecting, (g) providing exposure/visibility, (h) making friend/colleague, (i) acceptance/confirmation, (j) parenting, and (k) motivation/inspiration.</p>
<p>As scholars researching mentoring in business primarily use the scaffold of career development and psychosocial mentoring functions identified by the seminal qualitative study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312465608">Kram (1983)</xref>, the number of empirical studies proposing original conceptualization and description of mentoring functions in business are relatively much less in comparison to education. Furthermore, it is important to note that even though the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1534484312465608">Noe (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312465608">Cotton, Shen, and Livne-Tarandach (2011)</xref> provide original descriptions or develop scales measuring “mentoring functions’ and are published in peer-reviewed journals in business, they are excluded from the concept matrices because these studies do not explore mentoring functions provided/received by teacher mentors or by employees in business organizations, the two target groups defining the scope of this review. Specifically, Noe examined mentoring among educational administrators and Cotton et al. explored mentoring among baseball players.</p>
<p>At this juncture, it is important to acknowledge certain stand-alone mentor functions identified by some of the studies reviewed in business that are not listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">Table 4</xref>. They are (a) learning facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312465608">Fowler &amp; O’Gorman, 2005</xref>), (b) mutuality and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312465608">Thomas, 1990</xref>), (c) material support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312465608">Levesque et al., 2005</xref>), (d) information sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312465608">Levesque et al., 2005</xref>), and (e) support for cross-cultural transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1534484312465608">Shen &amp; Kram, 2011</xref>). The first four are considered stand-alone as they were reported by only one study and are in need for further validation as distinct functions in future research and the fifth function is specific to an expatriate population and hence not generalizable to all employees in business organizations. Although the parenting function is also reported by only one study (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; McFarlin, 1990</xref>) in the business literature, it is noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">Table 4</xref> because it featured in two studies on mentoring functions in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312465608">Abell, Dillon, Hopkins, McInerney, &amp; O’Brien, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1534484312465608">Rajuan, Beijaard, &amp; Verlook, 2007</xref>), thereby allowing a point of comparison between the two fields.</p>

<title>Mentoring Functions Providing Challenge in Business</title>
<p>Coming to business, among the 11 functions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">Table 4</xref>, providing <italic>challenging assignments</italic> qualifies to be the challenging function performed by mentors in business organizations as it has the potential of contradicting the protégé’s perspectives by disturbing their stationary balance or status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312465608">McGowan et al., 2007</xref>).

<sec id="section10-1534484312465608">
<title>Comparing Between Challenging Mentoring Functions in Education and Business</title>
<p>A comparison between the <italic>challenging</italic> mentoring functions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1534484312465608">Table 5</xref> informs us of some distinct differences in the way challenge manifests in the functions performed by teacher mentors and mentors in business organizations. According to the extant studies reporting mentoring functions in business, mentors primarily focus on experiential tasks (i.e., <italic>challenging assignments</italic> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1534484312465608">Table 5</xref>) to stimulate a cognitive dissonance that might disturb the protégé’s status quo and force them out of their comfort zones. Instead, the thematic descriptions of how teacher mentors <italic>encourage reflection</italic> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1534484312465608">Table 5</xref>) inform us about a keen focus on stimulating critical reflective dialogues with protégé teachers so that they are stirred to probe deeper to understand and develop their own philosophies of teaching. Moreover, unlike teacher mentoring, the challenging functions of <italic>assessment</italic> and <italic>teaching</italic> are not reported in the mentoring function scales developed and widely used in mentoring research in business.</p>
<p>These differences imply an opportunity for the fields of education and business to expand their current operationalizations of mentoring functions providing challenge to protégés. For instance, in addition to exploring the teacher mentor’s role in stimulating critical reflection through conversations, mentoring scholarship in education might benefit from studying how teacher mentors nudge the protégé teachers to try out novel or unconventional instructional strategies in classrooms and learn from the challenges of carrying out this task. Doing so would be similar to taking an experiential learning focus to providing challenge in mentoring as seen in the field of business. Although this theme was reflected to some extent by two studies included in the concept-centric review of mentoring functions performed by teacher mentors, it was not as widely reported as the focus on critical reflective dialogues in teacher mentoring. Similarly, mentoring function scales used in studying mentoring in business can include items on mentors questioning their protégé’s assumptions, biases, expanding their horizons by encouraging them to disagree with conventional ways of thinking, and stimulating them to develop distinct and unique identities. Doing so would be similar to operating from a critical reflective stance as evident in teacher mentoring.</p>
<p>It is important to note two instances where the critical reflective approach is represented to some extent in the mentoring literature in business. First, one of the items measuring the stand-alone function of learning facilitation reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312465608">Fowler and O’Gorman (2005)</xref> shares some similarity with the teacher mentoring function of encouraging reflection. Obviously, mentoring function scales in business can benefit from adding similar items. Second, recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534484312465608">Ensher and Murphy (2010)</xref> developed a scale titled Mentoring Relationship Challenges Scale that includes some items that are similar to the actions characterizing the encouraging reflection function found in teacher mentoring. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312465608">Ensher and Murphy (2005)</xref> define a mentoring relational challenge as a unique test or a series of challenges posed to assess the protégé, which can be used as a means to determine further investment into the relationship. Thus, even if mentors in business organizations responding to these items might report actions that can encourage reflection in protégés, the underlying intent is to test whether it is worthwhile to continue investing into the relationship instead of stimulating the protégé’s development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to discuss the absence of the <italic>assessment</italic> function as a means by which mentors can challenge their protégés in the mentoring functions list reported in business (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">Table 4</xref>). Although apparently this implies that mentors take a nonevaluative approach to mentoring in business organizations, few mentoring scholars in business have explored a supervisor’s role in mentoring their subordinates, thereby reporting the coexistence of supervisor’s evaluative role and other mentoring functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312465608">Burke, McKeen, &amp; McKenna, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312465608">Burke, McKenna, &amp; McKeen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534484312465608">Fagenson-Eland, Marks, &amp; Amendola, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534484312465608">Mullen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; McFarlin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1534484312465608">Scandura &amp; Schriesheim, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1534484312465608">Scandura &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>). Some of these studies report supervisory mentoring to provide higher levels of career and psychosocial mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534484312465608">Fagenson-Eland et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; McFarlin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1534484312465608">Scandura &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>) compared to nonsupervisory mentoring where the mentors are organizationally distanced. As provision of challenging assignments is one of the components of career mentoring, it can thus be concluded that supervisor mentors are reported to provide greater level of challenge to their subordinate protégés in business organizations. However, despite the benefits of supervisory mentoring, there are concerns regarding integrating mentor’s evaluative function with actions representing other supportive and affirming functions of mentoring. The concern relates to possibilities of protégés being reluctant in sharing their vulnerabilities with anyone who would evaluate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312465608">Mountford, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534484312465608">Rippon &amp; Martin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1534484312465608">Williams, 1993</xref>). Nevertheless, contrary to this argument, scholars in both business (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312465608">Burke et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312465608">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534484312465608">Mullen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312465608">Ragins &amp; McFarlin, 1990</xref>) and education (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534484312465608">Rippon &amp; Martin, 2006</xref>) point out that supervisors having first-hand knowledge of their protégé’s immediate work environments, and hence greater involvement and credibility needed to impact protégé’s performance, may be more suited to be mentors. Perhaps, studies examining supervisory mentoring in business organizations in particular can explore the extent to which the supervisor being an evaluator reinforces or impedes their subordinate protégé’s development to address this ongoing debate.</p>
<p>Coming to the <italic>teaching</italic> function, the literature in teacher mentoring mostly refers it to include mentor actions of analysis based on observation of protégé teachers’ lessons in classrooms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1534484312465608">Table 5</xref>). Although apparently this function appears to be too specific to the teaching profession, there are ways in which mentors in business organizations can engage in observing their protégés when they are performing certain tasks. For instance, mentors can attend important meetings led by their protégés where their protégés enact a leadership role in their interactions with juniors, peers, and seniors. Such observation can help to identify developmental needs of the protégés that the mentors can point out in follow-up conversations, thereby prompting the protégé s to reflect on their competencies. Thus, following this line of thought, mentoring scholarship in business might benefit from exploring whether the mentor’s role in challenging their protégés extends beyond assigning challenging assignments to observing and analyzing their protégés’ performance on those challenging tasks.</p>

<title>Mentoring Functions Providing Support in Business</title>
<p>Coming to business, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1534484312465608">Table 4</xref> lists several functions performed by mentors that acknowledge, affirm, and support a protégé’s evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312465608">McGowan et al., 2007</xref>). They are (a) coaching, (b) counseling, (c) role modeling, (d) sponsoring/advocating, (e) protecting, (f) providing exposure/visibility, (g) making friend, (h) acceptance/confirmation, (i) parenting, and (j) motivation/inspiration. Again, a look at the description of these functions (see primary themes listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">Table 6</xref>) as described by the studies included in the concept-centric review provides an account of the various actions that mentors can take to support their protégés in business organizations.</p>

<sec id="section13-1534484312465608">
<title>Comparing Supportive Mentoring Functions in Education and Business</title>
<p>A comparison between the <italic>supportive</italic> mentoring functions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">Table 6</xref> inform us of several similarities and some distinct differences in the way support manifests in the functions performed by teacher mentors and mentors in business organizations. The supportive functions common to education and business are (a) coaching, (b) counseling, (c) role modeling, (d) making friends, and (e) parenting. In addition to these, there are similarities between the mediating function found in education and providing exposure/visibility function found in business. In regards to supportive functions that are distinct in each field, the review suggests that the being colleague/fellow learner function is unique to education and the functions of sponsoring/advocating, protecting, acceptance/confirmation, and motivation/inspiration are unique to business.</p>
<p>A comparison of the descriptions of <italic>coaching</italic> suggests some differences in the ways this function is conceptualized in education and business. For instance, as per the studies reviewed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">Table 6</xref>), the coaching function in business serves to support the protégé primarily in two ways: (a) career advancement through providing job-related feedback and strategies for career goals, and (b) socialization through providing information on organizational politics and advice on how to navigate the organization. On the other hand, the coaching function of teacher mentors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">Table 6</xref>) appears to provide the following—(a) direct assistance related to particular tasks and skills that the protégé teachers need immediately for survival, which includes straightforward, ready-to-use practical tips and solutions on topics ranging from classroom management and lesson plan preparation to socialization in terms of getting information on departmental and school politics and routines, and (b) emotional support, which includes showing empathy for protégé teachers’ fears and providing positive reinforcement through encouragement and reassurance. These actions are classified under coaching following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312465608">Harrison, Dymoke, and Pell (2006)</xref>, who define coaching as a particular form of mentoring within teacher education, in that it has a more specific focus upon particular tasks, skills, or capabilities and is related to performance in some way. Furthermore, unlike business, the provision of emotional support is included as a component of coaching instead of counseling in education. This classification is guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1534484312465608">Zanting, Verloop, and Vermunt (2001)</xref>, who asserted the affective component of teacher mentoring to be a coaching function, coining the term “coach of evoked emotions” for this role.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, emotional support appears to be a significant component of mentoring both in education and business, whether included in the coaching or counseling function. The provision of socialization-related support and job-related feedback also appears to be central to the coaching role of both teacher mentors and mentors in business organizations. Only, unlike business, the focus on providing “ready-to-use” immediate support material seems to be prominent in teacher mentoring. Even though this is somewhat comparable to the standalone function of material support reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312465608">Levesque et al. (2005)</xref> in business, the need for immediate support is much more pronounced in teacher mentoring. This might be attributed to beginning teachers’ reluctance to learn from mistakes due to the public nature of their learning. As they have the pressure of convincing children in classrooms that they already know everything, they seek explicit instructional support from their mentors to survive their beginning days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312465608">Maynard, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the focus on providing support for career strategizing and advancement seems to be specific to the coaching function reported in business. This can be attributed to the nature of jobs in business organizations where focusing on career goals can help in promotion, and hence, mentors are expected to support the protégés in meeting their career aspirations of rising up the hierarchy. In case of teacher mentoring, the primary focus of support from mentors remains on immediate survival needs (e.g., teaching content or resources and classroom planning or management), and hence, the studies reviewed do not report mentors supporting beginning teachers meet their long-term aspirations for professional development or teacher leadership roles. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312465608">Little (1990)</xref>, “Retention, not advancement, is the stated institutional aim of formal mentoring among teachers” (p. 333). Scholars studying teacher mentoring should address this gap by exploring whether mentoring beyond the beginning years supports teachers in strategizing about their choices in building their teaching careers.</p>
<p>The function of <italic>counseling</italic> appears to share a problem-solving focus and the <italic>role modeling</italic> function is described to include mentor actions that demonstrate the desired self of the protégés for both teacher mentoring and mentoring in business organizations. However, there are some subtle differences in the descriptions of what the mentors need to demonstrate as role models. What distinguishes the conceptualization of role modeling in education from that of business is the explicit focus on modeling a reflective posture, which is not so obvious in business. Several scholars studying teacher mentoring specifically explain how teacher mentors can model a reflective posture by continuing to ask themselves critical questions, through demonstrating different ways of being an ongoing reflective learner and by engaging in “wondering about teaching” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312465608">Boreen &amp; Niday, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312465608">Feiman-Nemser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1534484312465608">Stanulis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1534484312465608">Street, 2004</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312465608">Kyle, Moore, and Sanders (1999)</xref>, an important part of modeling is to reflect on what happened and why, so that the protégé teacher can make the required changes. This explicit focus on incorporating reflection into modeling by teacher mentors implies an inclination toward the social cognitive learning perspective that adds a cognitive component of analysis and comprehension to the strictly behaviorist theory of social learning underlying role modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312465608">Bandura, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312465608">1986</xref>).</p>
<p>For the functions of <italic>making friends</italic> and <italic>parenting</italic>, both fields of education and business give similar descriptions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">Table 6</xref>). In regards to the <italic>mediating</italic> function in education and the <italic>providing exposure/visibility</italic> function in business as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">Table 6</xref>, the similarities are obvious. Both functions describe mentor’s efforts toward building protégés’ connections with important people. However, a closer look at the conceptualizations helps to identify that for mentors in business organizations, there is a focus on experiential tasks providing exposure to important people, which is not so obvious in teacher mentoring. Thus, scholars studying teacher mentoring can explore whether teacher mentors assign certain tasks that result in greater visibility, and hence, greater networking of the beginning teacher in the school. One example of such task that teacher mentors already undertake as a coach is recommending beginning teachers to observe other teachers’ classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312465608">Jones, Reid, &amp; Bevins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312465608">McNally &amp; Martin, 1998</xref>). Although observing other classes is reported to be a task assigned by teacher mentors to enhance the protégé teacher’s knowledge of teaching, the potential of such tasks in helping protégé teachers increase their connections and networks with the teachers whose classes they observe remains to be explored.</p>
<p>The <italic>being colleague/fellow learner</italic> function is somewhat unique to teacher mentoring. As described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">Table 6</xref>, teacher mentors in this role consider their protégés to be equal partners, build a symmetrical rapport with them, and learn from them by engaging in co-inquiry and collaborative reflection. Although the mentoring function scales used in business do not have any items measuring a collaborative partnership, the <italic>being colleague/fellow learner</italic> function shares some similarities with item measuring trust and mutual sharing in the mentoring functions scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312465608">Thomas (1990)</xref>. Nonetheless, scales measuring mentoring functions in business can certainly benefit from including additional items on co-inquiry and collaborative learning. Following this line of thought, few scholars have explored the benefits of reciprocal support, learning, and development in mentoring relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312465608">Allen &amp; Eby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312465608">Ensher, Thomas, &amp; Murphy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312465608">Ghosh, Reio, &amp; Haynes, 2012</xref>), and the construct of relational mentoring has been proposed to exemplify high-quality mentoring that incorporates mutual learning and growth as an integral part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534484312465608">Ragins, 2009</xref>). Future research needs to validate the scale on relational mentoring developed by Ragins and explore the nomological network of this construct to study the outcomes and antecedents of mentors assuming the role of a fellow learner in business organizations.</p>
<p>Last, the functions of <italic>sponsoring/advocating, protecting</italic>, and <italic>motivation/inspiration</italic>, are reported only in the business literature. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312465608">Anderson and Shannon (1988)</xref> proposed protecting and promoting to be salient functions required to be performed by teacher mentors decades ago, the review suggests that the empirical studies exploring teacher mentoring functions do not report any of these functions. The only exception is the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1534484312465608">Schockett and Haring-Hidore (1985)</xref> who applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312465608">Kram’s (1983)</xref> framework of career and psychosocial mentoring in examining mentoring in entry-level teaching situations. They reported teacher mentors to perform the protection function by shielding the new teachers from unwanted attacks by supervisors and other colleagues and the sponsorship function by discussing protégé’s accomplishments with colleagues, nominating the protégé for key positions, and vouching for the protégé’s abilities. Future research in teacher mentoring should explore the role of teacher mentors in sponsoring and protecting their protégés to examine whether such roles are commonplace and, if so, why the extant scholarship on teacher mentoring rarely report these mentor functions. Furthermore, they need to explore the viability of teacher mentors enacting the motivation/inspiration functions where the protégé teachers can significantly benefit from being inspired to reach new heights beyond meeting their immediate needs related to classroom management.</p>

<title>Implications for HRD Scholars and Practitioners</title>
<p>The integrative literature review providing a critical analysis of the commonalities and differences in the ways the fields of education and business conceptualize mentoring functions has significant implications for HRD scholars and practitioners. The following sections present implications of the findings for scholarship and practice in HRD.</p>
<sec id="section15-1534484312465608">
<title>Implications for Scholarship</title>
<p>Through a careful interdisciplinary analysis of the gaps and strengths of mentoring functions in the fields of education and business, this review has posed intriguing questions for HRD scholars in regards to the scope of each mentoring function. As noted earlier, even though HRD is considered to be a multidisciplinary field, developmental tools such as mentoring is seldom researched in a manner that can help to transcend disciplinary silos. There appears to be a disconnect between our awareness of the value that multiple disciplines can add to HRD scholarship and our scholarly efforts that we often restrict to a single discipline, mostly business. The comparative discussion in the review challenges this status quo and points to potential areas where HRD scholars can enable the fields of education and business to learn from each other by broadening their understanding of mentoring functions, most importantly the nature of <italic>challenging</italic> and <italic>supportive</italic> mentoring functions. Although few scholars in each discipline refer to the need for both challenge and support to characterize the developmental nature of mentoring, there have been no efforts to date to assimilate the understanding of this duality in mentoring across disciplines. As neither challenge nor support alone constitutes development, an emphasis on how the apparently contradicting nature of challenging and supportive functions can coexist and contribute toward making mentoring relationships truly developmental as indicated in this review is foundational to using mentoring as an aid in HRD. Toward that end, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1534484312465608">Table 7</xref> summarizes the questions that probe and expand the current boundaries of challenging and supportive mentoring functions as identified from the comparative critique of the mentoring literature in education and business presented in the earlier sections.</p>

<p>These questions along with the detailed descriptions of the mentoring functions reported in both fields as presented in this article provide valuable information for HRD scholars interested in exploring the full potential of mentoring as a developmental tool. For instance, HRD scholars can use the broad repertoire of knowledge on mentoring functions provided by the review to design and develop new scales or refine the existing scales of mentoring functions to make them more exhaustive and representative of the different roles mentors can play. Furthermore, HRD scholars can recruit comparable samples of mentors and protégés from business settings and schools and use the questions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1534484312465608">Table 7</xref> as a guide for exploring the extent to which the notions of challenge and support in teacher mentoring functions are applicable to organizational mentoring in business settings and vice versa.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>As for practice, this review represents an effort toward identifying opportunities for HRD professionals to actively design and implement developmental tools such as mentoring in multiple disciplines and fields. Similar to HRD scholarship, HRD practitioners need to transcend disciplinary silos and benchmark best practices in mentoring across different fields. Comparative descriptions of mentoring functions in the fields of education and business as presented in this review exemplify such benchmarks. Furthermore, this review suggests an opportunity for HRD practitioners to partner with professionals in other fields such as the teacher educators in promoting and developing the practice of teacher mentoring in schools. As the field of HRD is multidisciplinary in nature, such collaborations will enable HRD practitioners to better apply their knowledge of developmental initiatives in multiple kinds of organizational settings.</p>
<p>Last, HRD professionals can use the detailed descriptions of the various mentoring functions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1534484312465608">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1534484312465608">6</xref> as guidelines to describe the mentor roles in the mentoring handbooks that need to be provided as a component of formal mentoring programs in both business organizations and schools. Descriptions of mentoring roles in the mentoring handbook will allow potential protégés to select the mentor functions they seek in mentoring relationships before joining a formal mentoring program. Prior knowledge of the protégés’ expectations about the desirable combination of mentor functions will help to prepare the mentors accordingly. This prior matching of protégé’s needs of particular mentoring functions and mentor’s preparation will ensure better compatibility in mentoring relationships.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In sum, it is obvious that context matters. Thus, developmental initiatives such as mentoring need to be attuned to the exclusive needs of each context defined by the unique cultures of schools and business organizations. Nevertheless, being cognizant of the distinctiveness of different contexts, it is important to discuss, refine, and debate the feasibility of expanding the current conceptualizations of challenging and supportive mentoring functions in the fields of education and business. This review is an important step forward toward initiating that discussion.</p>
