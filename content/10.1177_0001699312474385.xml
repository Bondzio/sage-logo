<abstract>
<p>This study explores the effects of homogamy and heterogamy in socio-economic background and educational level on the marriage rate among cohabitors. Using unique register data and the Cox proportional hazards model, we analyse marriage formation in over 20,000 cohabiting unions in Finland. The large number of observations enables an inspection of the interactive effects in all partner-status combinations. Our results show that homogamy or heterogamy in socio-economic background is of little consequence for the couple’s probability of marrying; homogamy encourages marriage only among cohabitors from farmer families. With regard to education, homogamy increases the marriage rate among cohabitors with a low level of education, but reduces it among the highly educated. Whether educational heterogamy promotes, deters or has no effect on the marriage rate depends on the combination. The results emphasize the importance of a detailed measurement of homogamy and heterogamy when examining the role of group boundaries in union transitions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Family formation patterns have gone through considerable changes in Western countries over the past few decades. Marriage rates have been declining since the 1970s and the mean age at marriage has risen, whereas the prevalence of non-marital cohabitation has increased (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0001699312474385">Kiernan, 2001</xref>). The Nordic countries have been forerunners in this development, and currently there is little social distinction between cohabitation and marriage in these countries, and children are born and raised in both union types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001699312474385">Heuveline and Timberlake, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0001699312474385">Kiernan, 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, even in countries in which cohabitation is widespread and socially approved, people still value marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0001699312474385">Kiernan, 2004</xref>), and many choose to marry eventually. This raises the question of which factors contribute to the cohabiting couple’s decision of progressing to marriage, and thus how cohabitation and marriage differ from each other as union types.</p>
<p>A growing amount of literature has explored the effects of an individual’s social and economic traits, such as education or income, on the probability of converting a cohabiting union into a marriage (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001699312474385">Bracher and Santow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699312474385">Duvander, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001699312474385">Kalmijn and Luijkx, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699312474385">Kravdal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001699312474385">Lemmon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001699312474385">Lichter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699312474385">Manning and Smock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001699312474385">Oppenheimer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001699312474385">Wu and Balakrishnan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0001699312474385">Wu and Pollard, 2000</xref>). However, less is known about the extent to which the transition to marriage depends on the partners’ statuses relative to each other, that is, whether the partners’ characteristics interact. For instance, does similarity and dissimilarity of the partners’ characteristics, in other words, homogamy and heterogamy, affect the choice to proceed from cohabitation to marriage? Is a shared socio-economic status or a shared family background, or perhaps socio-economic complementarity between the partners an incentive to marry? Is homogamy equally important for all status groups or do its effects vary by group?</p>
<p>An extensive social science literature focuses on the tendency towards homogamy in partner selection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699312474385">Blackwell and Lichter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001699312474385">Burgess and Wallin, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699312474385">Coombs, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699312474385">Hamplova, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0001699312474385">Hollingshead, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001699312474385">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001699312474385">Michielutte, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699312474385">Schoen and Weinick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0001699312474385">Trost, 1967</xref>; for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699312474385">Blossfeld, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1998</xref>). The preference for a partner with similar social characteristics has been attributed to the shared cultural resources, such as values, tastes and world-views, which facilitate mutual understanding between the partners and provide a basis for an enduring relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001699312474385">Burgess and Wallin, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699312474385">Coombs, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699312474385">1998</xref>). People acquire their cultural resources in both the parental family and in contexts outside it, such as in educational institutions and peer groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>). The importance of early cultural socialization is thought to be reflected as a preference towards homogamy in ascribed characteristics, which are assigned to one at birth (such as parental social class and ethnic background), whereas the significance of orientations and influences later in life is considered to encourage homogamy in achieved characteristics (such as educational attainment and occupational status) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312474385">Hansen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>). A common conclusion in studies on partner selection is that achievement has become more important while ascription has lost its salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312474385">Hansen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001699312474385">b</xref>). Education in particular is seen as a decisive determinant of an individual’s tastes, values and lifestyles, and therefore as an important factor in partner selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699312474385">Blossfeld, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>).</p>
<p>Assortative mating patterns are thought to reflect the degree of openness of a society: a high degree of heterogamy is seen to indicate that members of different groups accept each other as social equals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699312474385">Blossfeld, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699312474385">1998</xref>). However, partner selection patterns depend not only on individual preferences but also on the structural opportunities to meet and interact with people from different groups. A major advantage in exploring how homogamy and heterogamy affect union transitions after the partner has been selected – proceeding from cohabitation to marriage, or divorcing, for instance – is that these associations are unaffected by the structural opportunities to meet the current partner, and can thus be considered as better indicators of the extent to which people <italic>prefer</italic> a partner from one’s own group (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312474385">Hansen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699312474385">Müller, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study explores the effects of homogamy in ascribed socio-economic status (parental occupational class) and in own achieved educational level on the transition from cohabitation to marriage in Finland. Finland provides an opportunity to explore the effects of homogamy in an intriguing context in which cohabitations are often marriage-like, and the welfare state aims for equality between individuals and genders. In addition, the Finnish population register is an excellent source of large, representative research data, which are valuable for the study on homogamy in particular, given that homogamy is normative in unions and heterogamous couples tend to be rare. With an extensive register data, we were able to examine the marriage rate in each partner-status combination. The results provide new, detailed knowledge on the role of group boundaries in union transitions, and shed light on the relative importance of ascription and achievement in contemporary union-formation patterns and on the characteristics of cohabitation and marriage as union types.</p>

<title>Theoretical background and hypotheses</title>
<p>Theoretical predictions concerning the effects of homogamy on the transition from cohabitation to marriage are scant in the existing literature. However, studies comparing partner selection in cohabitation and marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699312474385">Blackwell and Lichter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699312474385">Hamplova, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699312474385">Schoen and Weinick, 1993</xref>) offer a basis for developing hypotheses. On the basis of three perspectives on cohabitation as a union type, we put forward three hypotheses on how homogamy in socio-economic background and educational level can affect the probability of marrying among cohabitors. The degree of support the hypotheses receive gives further insight into the differences between cohabitation and marriage in the contemporary Nordic context.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699312474385">Schoen and Weinick (1993</xref>) suggest that cohabitation is a ‘looser bond’ than marriage: it involves less commitment, lacks the permanence of marriage, and is less likely to lead to childbearing. Because marriage more strongly binds the partners in a wider family network, ascribed characteristics such as family background and age are more influential in partner selection in marriage than in cohabitation. Cohabitors, on the other hand, are more likely to emphasize achieved status, such as educational attainment, which reflects the socio-economic ability to contribute to the relationship in the shorter term. Given the lower level of commitment, and because the safety net of the legal marriage contract is missing, cohabiting couples are also less likely to develop a gendered division of labour in the household with the male specializing in paid work and the female in domestic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699312474385">Brines and Joyner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699312474385">Schoen and Weinick, 1993</xref>). Cohabitors are thus less likely than married partners to exhibit educational hypergamy (the male being more highly educated than the female), and instead expect economic contributions from both partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699312474385">Schoen and Weinick, 1993</xref>). The ‘looser bond’ theory originally considers how couples entering marriage differ from those entering cohabitation. In contemporary Finland, however, nine out of ten unions begin as cohabitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001699312474385">Jalovaara, 2012a</xref>), and the decision to marry is often made only after a period of living together. Thus, in this context, the differences in partner preferences between cohabiting and married couples are largely manifested in the ways in which couples are selected from cohabitation to marriage.</p>
<p>Although cohabitation is highly institutionalized in the Nordic countries, there are indications of weaker commitment among cohabitors than among marital partners in these countries as well. Cohabiting unions have higher dissolution rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699312474385">Gähler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001699312474385">Jalovaara, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001699312474385">Liefbroer and Dourleijn, 2006</xref>) and lower childbearing intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0001699312474385">Oláh and Bernhardt, 2008</xref>) than marriages. Furthermore, a recent survey study from Sweden and Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0001699312474385">Wiik et al., 2009</xref>) reports that cohabitors are less often serious about their relationships and more often have break-up plans than married respondents. Thus, in our first hypothesis, we apply the idea of cohabitation as a ‘looser bond’ than marriage:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Homogamy in socio-economic background and educational hypergamy increase the marriage rate among cohabiting couples, whereas educational homogamy decreases the marriage rate.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699312474385">Blackwell and Lichter (2000</xref>) provide an alternative to the ‘looser bond’ perspective. Their ‘double selection’ hypothesis argues that people prefer a partner with similar characteristics and cultural resources in general, and homogamous couples are selected first into cohabitation and then into marriage. Thus, homogamy in ascribed as well as achieved characteristics would encourage cohabiting couples to marry. Insofar as proceeding to marriage indicates a stable union, an increased marriage rate among homogamous cohabitors is also what the widely held sociological hypothesis on the effects of homogamy and heterogamy on union dissolution implies: because of their differing values and world-views, heterogamous couples, it is suggested, face an increased risk of breaking up, whereas homogamous couples are presumed to be more likely to stay together (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699312474385">Bumpass and Sweet, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001699312474385">Finnäs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699312474385">Kalmijn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0001699312474385">Tzeng, 1992</xref>). Our second hypothesis is hence the following:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> Homogamy in both socio-economic background and educational level increase the cohabiting couple’s probability of marrying.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>However, it might be that the effects of homogamy and heterogamy are not equal across social strata. It has been argued that social distinction and hence homogamy with respect to socio-economic background is most important for the upper classes of a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312474385">Hansen, 1995</xref>). Thus, because we have the opportunity to examine each partner combination separately, we expect homogamy to enhance the transition to marriage among those from upper-white-collar families in particular. Furthermore, insofar as homogamy is assumed to promote and heterogamy, respectively, to deter the transition to marriage, we expect that the larger the cultural distance between the groups, the greater is the marriage-deterring effect of heterogamy.</p>
<p>The association between homogamy and the transition from cohabitation to marriage may nevertheless be weak in the contemporary Nordic context. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699312474385">Hamplova (2009</xref>) suggests, when cohabitation is highly institutionalized and marriages and cohabitations have begun to converge, there should be no differences in assortative mating patterns between these two union types. In the setting of the current study, this means that homogamy in neither ascribed nor achieved characteristics should affect the probability of transitioning to marriage. Furthermore, the level of gender equality in the Nordic countries is high. Women in Finland are currently, on average, more highly educated than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001699312474385">Statistics Finland, 2010</xref>). The labour-force participation of married women in Finland is among the highest in the European Union, and, compared even with their Nordic counterparts, married Finnish women more often work full time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0001699312474385">Mutari and Figart, 2001</xref>). Hence, marriage in Finland is relatively unlikely to foster the gendered division of labour, and it is therefore possible that hypergamy in socio-economic attributes does not promote the transition to marriage. These features of the Nordic context are the basis of our final hypothesis:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3:</italic> Homogamy in socio-economic background does not affect the marriage rate among cohabiting couples, nor does educational homogamy or hypergamy.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Some studies that compare homogamy in cohabitations and marriages comply with the ‘looser bond’ hypothesis, in that homogamy in ascribed characteristics has been more prevalent in marriages than in cohabitations, whereas cohabiting couples have been more homogamous than married couples with respect to their achieved characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699312474385">Jepsen and Jepsen (2002</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699312474385">Schoen and Weinick (1993</xref>) for the US; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699312474385">Hamplova (2009</xref>) for the Benelux countries and Southern Europe). Others, however, report that marriages are in general more homogamous than cohabitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699312474385">Blackwell and Lichter (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0001699312474385">Schwartz and Graf (2009</xref>) for the US). In line with Hypothesis 3, no differences in educational homogamy between cohabitations and marriages were observed in Sweden and Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699312474385">Hamplova, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Few studies on the actual transition from cohabitation to marriage include indicators of homogamy. Furthermore, they report no significant effect of homogamy in achieved characteristics such as education or earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312474385">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699312474385">Müller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001699312474385">Mäenpää, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001699312474385">Sassler and McNally, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0001699312474385">Smock and Manning, 1997</xref>), or in ascribed characteristics such as religion or age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312474385">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001699312474385">Sassler and McNally, 2003</xref>). The studies have their shortcomings, however. Some are based on relatively small numbers of observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312474385">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001699312474385">Sassler and McNally, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0001699312474385">Smock and Manning, 1997</xref>), which makes the results susceptible to random variation. Others examine the effect of homogamy with difference measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312474385">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699312474385">Müller, 2003</xref>), which have been criticized for various theoretical and methodological reasons, including their incapability to show whether the effects of homogamy and heterogamy vary across groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001699312474385">Eeckhaut et al., 2011</xref>). A couple of studies examine the marriage rate in different combinations of partner statuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001699312474385">Mäenpää, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0001699312474385">Sassler and McNally, 2003</xref>), but despite the advantage of producing more detailed knowledge it often remains unclear whether the relative marriage rate in a particular combination results from a genuine interactive effect or merely from the main effects of the partners’ positions – that is, whether a partner combination produces a marriage rate that is something other than ‘the sum of its parts’. Thus, whether and how homogamy affects the transition from cohabitation to marriage remains unsettled. To our knowledge, no studies on the effects of homogamy on the marriage rate among cohabitors have been conducted in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>This study extends previous research by examining how homogamy and heterogamy in educational level and parental occupational class affect the transition from cohabitation to marriage in Finland. Our use of register data allowed us to avoid many of the problems encountered in studies based on survey data, such as biased samples due to the self-selection of respondents and the misreporting of the partner’s characteristics. The large number of observations enabled a more detailed measurement of homogamy and heterogamy than in prior studies. Furthermore, we introduce a simple analytical strategy for locating the specific partner-status combinations that interact.</p>

<title>Data and method</title>

<title>Data and study population</title>
<p>The data are an extract from the so-called <italic>Palapeli</italic> research register compiled at Statistics Finland. The register covers all individuals in the population of Finland between 1970 and 2000, and data on their socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics as well as on all their unions, partners and children have been followed up until the end of 2003. <italic>Palapeli</italic> was formed by linking data from the population register and for instance censuses and employment statistics by means of personal identity codes. Data on the partners’ characteristics are symmetrical, which is a major advantage in the study of homogamy. The extract analysed here is an 11 per cent random sample of individuals born before 1986.</p>
<p>Exceptionally, <italic>Palapeli</italic> includes detailed data on cohabiting unions from 1987 onwards. Unlike registers in Sweden and Norway, which identify cohabiting couples only when they have shared children, the Finnish registration system enables the inference of all cohabitations through the so-called domicile code, which identifies the dwelling in which the person lives. Cohabiting couples are defined in <italic>Palapeli</italic> as a male and a female who have been domiciled in the same dwelling for over 90 days, who are not married to each other, who have no more than a 20-year age difference (this rule does not apply if there are shared children), and who are not siblings or a parent and a child. In the sample, the dates of events (e.g. union formation and dissolution) are presented to the precision of a month.</p>
<p>We selected cohabitations formed during the period 1995–2002 involving women born in 1960–1977 for the current study. During this period, 24,823 women entered a cohabiting union. About 20 per cent of them had formed more than one cohabitation, in which case the first of them was selected for the analysis. Only unions in which both partners were born in Finland were included because data on individuals born abroad are often deficient as regards time preceding immigration. This excluded 1,921 couples from the analysis. Women whose partner was born before 1956 were also excluded (<italic>n</italic> = 1,039), because parental occupational class can be inferred only for birth cohorts from 1956 onwards. Furthermore, because people under 20 years of age are often still in education, cohabitations formed when the women were under the age of 20 were excluded (<italic>n</italic> = 1,615). The final number of cohabiting unions was 20,452.</p>
<p>Cohabitations were followed for transition to marriage from their start to the end of the year 2003. Couples were censored at separation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0001699312474385">1</xref>
</sup> at moving abroad, at either partner’s death, and at the end of 2003. During the follow-up, cohabitations contributed 674,316 months at risk in total, and 31.5 per cent of the couples married (<italic>n</italic> = 6,448), 36.5 per cent separated, 0.4 per cent were censored through migration or death and 31.6 per cent still cohabited at the end of 2003.</p>

<sec id="section5-0001699312474385">
<title>Covariates</title>
<p>
<italic>Socio-economic background.</italic> Socio-economic background was measured in terms of parental occupational class. This can be inferred from data on each person below the age of 15, when the household’s reference person (i.e. the person who is interpreted as having the primary responsibility for its subsistence) determines the occupational class. Occupational class is available in <italic>Palapeli</italic> for every fifth year since 1970, and the measures were taken when the partners were 8–14 years old, depending on their year of birth. Five categories are distinguished: (1) upper white collar, (2) lower white collar, (3) manual worker, (4) farmer and (5) other. ‘Farmer’ refers to self-employed people and employers in farming, forestry and fishing. The residual category ‘Other’ includes self-employed people other than farmers, as well as students, pensioners and those with missing data on occupational class. Months at risk by the partners’ parental occupational classes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699312474385">Table A1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0001699312474385">Appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>
<italic>Educational level.</italic> Educational level is a monthly updated time-varying covariate. The value at time <italic>t</italic> is the partners’ educational levels in the previous month. Individuals with no post-comprehensive, non-compulsory education registered are interpreted as having a basic-level qualification (1), which means at most nine years of education. Education up to the upper-secondary level (2) lasts 11–12 years and includes the matriculation examination (i.e. the final examination at the end of upper-secondary school that yields eligibility for higher education) and certain vocational qualifications. Lower-tertiary education (3) includes the lowest level of tertiary study (2–3 years following the upper-secondary level) and the lower-degree level (3–4 years following the upper-secondary level, e.g. polytechnic degrees and Bachelor’s degrees from universities). Upper-tertiary education (4) includes the higher-degree level (5–6 years following upper-secondary education, e.g. Master’s degrees from universities), as well as doctorate or equivalent education. Months at risk by the partners’ educational levels are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312474385">Table A2</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0001699312474385">Appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>
<italic>Control variables.</italic> We controlled for four basic factors that could have distorted the analysis of the association between homogamy and the transition to marriage. Months at risk according to these variables are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0001699312474385">Table 7</xref>. Seven categories of <italic>age homogamy</italic> are distinguished: (1) female 8 or more years older, (2) female 4–&lt;8 years older, (3) female &gt;0–&lt;4 years older, (4) male 0–&lt;4 years older, (5) male 4–&lt;8 years older, (6) male 8–&lt;12 years older and (7) male 12 or more years older. <italic>The female partner’s age at entry into the cohabitation</italic> is classified in five categories: (1) 20–24, (2) 25–29, (3) 30–34, (4) 35–39 and (5) 40–42 years. A couple’s <italic>place of residence</italic> is a yearly updated time-varying covariate. The value at time <italic>t</italic> is the couple’s place of residence at the end of the previous calendar year, categorized as follows: (1) the Helsinki metropolitan area, (2) other urban, (3) semi-urban and (4) rural. <italic>Parent status</italic> is a monthly updated time-varying covariate. The value at time <italic>t</italic>is the couple’s parent status in the previous month. We formed 10 categories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0001699312474385">Table 7</xref>) according to whether the couple had shared children or not, whether the child was the couple’s first, second or later child, and whether the woman was pregnant, the child was 0–12 months old or older than 12 months. Pregnancy was deduced from the registered birth dates, and defined as seven months preceding a birth.</p>

<title>Method and analytical strategy</title>
<p>We used the Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates to analyse the transition from cohabitation to marriage. To assess the detailed effects of homogamy and heterogamy, we examined the interactive effects in all partner-status combinations. When we analysed the interactions of the partners’ parental occupational classes we controlled for the combination of their educational levels, and vice versa, in order to determine the independent effects of these two dimensions of homogamy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0001699312474385">2</xref>
</sup> We also included the control variables introduced above in all the analyses. The results are presented as hazard ratios (HR). We describe our analytical strategy below.</p>
<p>We first fitted a model that included the <italic>main effects</italic> of each partner’s position in order to see the average effects of their respective statuses on the marriage rate. These main effects serve as a baseline for evaluating whether any interactive effects between the partners’ statuses exist. We then formed a <italic>combined variable</italic> of the partners’ statuses that produced the hazard ratios of marriage in each possible partner-status combination. These hazard ratios incorporate both the main effects and the interactions of the partners’ statuses, which can make it difficult to assess the presence and precise location of any interactions over and above the main effects. On the basis of the combined variable we could, however, estimate roughly whether the partners’ statuses interacted by examining how well the effects of one partner’s position in the categories of the other partner’s position conformed to the main effects. We also tested whether the overall partner-status interaction term was statistically significant (likelihood-ratio test).</p>
<p>Finally, to overcome the problem of confusing the interactive effects with the main effects, we used <italic>dummy variables</italic> to locate the specific partner-status combinations that interacted and to determine the statistical significance of these interactions. We created a dummy for each combination (coded as 1 if the couple belonged to the combination in question and 0 otherwise), and added each dummy one at a time to the main-effects model, so that for each combination we had a model that included the main effects and the corresponding dummy. The hazard ratio of this dummy variable reveals <italic>whether there is an interactive effect between these particular partner statuses after the main effects of the partners’ positions have been accounted for</italic>. A hazard ratio greater than 1.00 indicates an interactive effect which increases the marriage rate, whereas a hazard ratio smaller than 1.00 indicates that homogamy or heterogamy in this specific combination decreases the rate.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0001699312474385">Table 2</xref> gives the marriage rates in the various combinations of parental occupational class. These hazard ratios conform quite well with the main effects in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474385">Table 1</xref>, although there are some exceptions. For example, among women from manual-worker families the marriage rates vary somewhat differently from what would be expected on the basis of the main effects of the male partner’s parental occupational class, and among women from upper-white-collar families the marriage rate is particularly high when the partner has farm origins.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0001699312474385">Table 3</xref> displays the interactive effects of parental occupational class more clearly. Homogamy increases the marriage rate only among cohabitors with farm origins (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10). Heterogamy statistically significantly decreases the probability of marrying only when the female comes from a manual-worker family and the male from an upper-white-collar family (HR = 0.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Unexpectedly, heterogamy increases the marriage rate when the female comes from the category ‘Other’ and the male from an upper-white-collar family (HR = 1.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10), and when the female comes from an upper-white-collar family and the male from a farmer family (HR = 1.22,<italic> p</italic> = 0.16), although this latter effect fails to attain statistical significance. A similar but slighter effect is observed when the female comes from a manual-worker family and the male from a lower-white-collar family (HR = 1.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, the overall picture is that the hazard ratios of the dummies are fairly close to 1.00, and the overall interaction term of the partners’ parental occupational classes is not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>= 0.25).</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0001699312474385">Table 6</xref> confirms that the interactive effects almost exclusively pertain to the extremes of the educational hierarchy. Homogamy does indeed increase the marriage rate among cohabitors with a basic education (HR = 1.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and a very slight marriage-promoting effect is observable among those with a lower-tertiary education as well (HR = 1.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10). In contrast, homogamy reduces the marriage rate among cohabitors with an upper-tertiary education (HR = 0.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Extreme educational heterogamy increases the probability of marrying, although these effects are not statistically significant (HR = 1.35, <italic>p</italic> = 0.26 for extremely hypergamous couples and HR = 1.21, <italic>p</italic> = 0.33 for extremely hypogamous couples). Hypogamy promotes marriage also when the female is educated to the upper-tertiary level and the male to the upper-secondary level (HR = 1.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, hypogamy lowers the marriage rate when the female has a lower-tertiary and the male a basic level of education (HR = 0.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), as does hypergamy when the female has a basic and the male an upper-secondary education (HR = 0.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10).</p>

<title>Effects of the control variables</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0001699312474385">Table 7</xref> shows the effects of the control variables on the marriage rate among cohabitors. Age heterogamy deters the transition to marriage when the age difference exceeds eight years, the effect being more evident when the female partner is older. The marriage rate is higher when the female was between 20 and 29 years old when the cohabiting union was formed, compared with when she was 30 years or older, which is in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312474385">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699312474385">Müller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001699312474385">Wu and Balakrishnan, 1995</xref>). Couples residing in rural areas are slightly less likely to marry than those living in more urban areas.</p>
<p>Having children and transitioning to marriage are clearly connected in the study population. The marriage rate among cohabitors has been found to increase during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001699312474385">Bracher and Santow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312474385">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699312474385">Duvander, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699312474385">Finnäs, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699312474385">Manning, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699312474385">Manning and Smock, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699312474385">Müller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0001699312474385">Smock and Manning, 1997</xref>), and in the present study, the first shared pregnancy in particular encourages marriage. Subsequent pregnancies only slightly increase the marriage rate, but it more clearly increases during the first year following the birth of the child. This could indicate that, in the case of the first child, normative reasons for marrying before the child is born carry more weight, whereas if the couple already has children, these motives are weaker, and practical matters may be more decisive (e.g. the wedding is postponed until the baby is born). Nevertheless, regardless of parity, as the children grow, the marriage rate decreases to even lower levels than among couples without shared children. This is in accordance with previous studies reporting that children deter the transition from cohabitation to marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699312474385">Finnäs, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699312474385">Manning, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699312474385">Müller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001699312474385">Wu and Balakrishnan, 1995</xref>), and may indicate that cohabitors with children tend to be those who have chosen cohabitation as a lifestyle (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0001699312474385">Wu and Balakrishnan, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>This study explored the effects of homogamy and heterogamy in socio-economic background and education on the transition to marriage among over 20,000 cohabiting couples in Finland. Our aim was to determine how group boundaries between cohabiting partners in ascribed or achieved socio-economic positions affect their choice of union type. The unique and extensive register data enabled a more detailed analysis of the effects of homogamy and heterogamy than previously achieved. Furthermore, we put forward three hypotheses on the association between homogamy and the transition to marriage that were based on different views of cohabitation as a union type. The results thus provide one perspective to the differences between cohabitation and marriage in the contemporary Nordic context.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 1 (the ‘looser bond’ hypothesis) posited that because marriage involves more commitment and more strongly binds the partners in a family network than cohabitation, homogamy in socio-economic background would be beneficial in the transition to marriage. This hypothesis was supported in that homogamy increased the marriage rate among cohabitors with farm origins. We expected homogamy to encourage marriage among cohabitors from upper-white-collar families in particular, but this proved not to hold. The fact that homogamy is associated with an increased marriage rate solely among people with a farmer family background might stem from the fact that these homogamous couples are relatively likely to have established their own farm or inherited one from either partner’s parents, and marriage provides a more secure basis for a family enterprise than cohabitation. Furthermore, Hypothesis 1 implied that heterogamy in socio-economic background should deter the transition to marriage, and we assumed the effect to be the more substantial the greater the social distance between the groups. For the most part, this did not apply: heterogamy decreased the marriage rate only when the female came from a manual-worker family and the male from an upper-white-collar family.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 1 also expected the gendered division of labour and accordingly, educational hypergamy, to increase the marriage rate among cohabitors and educational homogamy to decrease the rate. In line with this, homogamy was associated with reluctance to marry among highly educated cohabitors, the group with the highest marriage rate in the main effects model. Educational hypergamy enhanced the transition to marriage when the discrepancy between the partners’ educational levels was large, that is, when the female was educated to the basic and the male to the upper-tertiary level. The effect of extreme hypogamy turned out to be parallel, and hypogamy increased the marriage rate also when the male was educated to the upper-secondary level and the female to the upper-tertiary level. Hypothesis 3, which took account of the special features of the Nordic countries, expected that the high level of gender equality in Finland would show up in the absence of a marriage-promoting effect of hypergamy, but instead it seems to appear in these rather symmetrical effects of extreme hypergamy and hypogamy. A gender-neutral effect is not surprising, because educationally hypergamous and hypogamous married couples have also been reported to be at equal risk of divorce in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001699312474385">Jalovaara, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, because of the rarity of union formation between people with highly unequal educational attainments, even with as large a total number of observations as in this study the results concerning extremely heterogamous couples are statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>According to Hypothesis 2 (the ‘double selection’ hypothesis), homogamous couples in general are more likely than heterogamous couples to progress from cohabitation to marriage. Homogamy nonetheless increased the marriage rate only among cohabitors with farm origins, and among those with no education beyond the basic level. Homogamy seems to foster marriage among individuals with only a basic education, in that a previous Finnish study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001699312474385">Jalovaara, 2003</xref>) also found homogamy to decrease the divorce rate among this group. Hypothesis 2 also implied that differing values, attitudes and lifestyles of heterogamous couples should lower the probability of marrying, but heterogamy had surprisingly few marriage-deterring effects in terms of both socio-economic background and educational level; in the case of education, heterogamy lowered the marriage rate only when the female was educated to the lower-tertiary level and the male to the basic level, and when the female was educated to the basic level and the male to the upper-secondary level. The marriage-promoting effects of educational heterogamy outlined above suggest that in these cases the benefits of specialization outweigh the potentially detrimental effects of cultural dissimilarity.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3 posited that when cohabitation is institutionalized, homogamy and heterogamy should not affect the marriage rate among cohabitors. The results on socio-economic background supported this hypothesis in that interactions between the partners’ positions were few in number. Thus, cultural differences between the partners that originate from differences in the socio-economic resources of their parental families seem to be of little consequence for the probability of marrying. However, the partners’ educational levels interacted in several ways, which suggests that educational differences between the partners matter instead in the decision to progress from cohabitation to marriage. The interactions fairly consistently pertained to the lowest and highest educational levels, but no coherent pattern was found in the effects of homogamy and heterogamy: as discussed above, the results contain elements in favour of both hypotheses 1 and 2, depending on the combination. The more substantial impact of educational differences compared with differences in socio-economic background nevertheless complies with the perception that achievement overrides ascription in contemporary partner selection processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312474385">Hansen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474385">Kalmijn, 1991a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001699312474385">b</xref>). The more minor relevance of ascription appeared in the case of age as well: the age difference between the partners has to be quite large to lower the probability of marrying.</p>
<p>Overall, none of the hypotheses received clearly more support than others. The effects of educational homogamy and heterogamy are more in line with the idea that cohabitation is a ‘looser bond’ than marriage in Finland, whereas the results on socio-economic background speak in favour of the similarity of cohabitation and marriage in the contemporary Nordic context. Despite the reasonable logic of the ‘double selection’ hypothesis, this hypothesis received fairly weak support, which is to say that cohabitation does not serve to any great extent as a stage from which homogamous couples progress to marriage. Thus, in marriages preceded by cohabitation, homogamy at the time of marriage is mainly the result of homogamous partner selection already in cohabitation, and group boundaries play only a minor role in the process of converting a cohabiting union into a marriage. It is actually quite interesting, and presumably characteristic of a comparatively individualized and egalitarian society, that although higher educational attainment clearly promotes the transition to marriage, the partner does not need to share the same level of education. The fact that barriers between educational groups are not any great obstacles to marriage formation in Finland appears also in the relatively weak tendency towards educational homogamy in Finnish marriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001699312474385">Domański and Przybysz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, our detailed analysis revealed some unexpected associations, in which heterogamy in socio-economic background increased the marriage rate. In particular, despite the statistical insignificance of the interactive effect, the high marriage rate among couples in which the female came from an upper-white-collar family and the male from a farmer family is rather odd in that the cultural distance between these groups could be expected to be quite large. One explanation might be that the men concerned came from wealthy families with large farms, and hence the partners’ socio-economic backgrounds were not that dissimilar. The increased marriage rate among couples in which the female came from the category ‘Other’ and the male from an upper-white-collar family is also likely to result from the heterogeneity of the group ‘Other’. Future research should thus examine the interactions of the partners’ socio-economic backgrounds more elaborately with datasets which include additional information on the partners’ parental families. In addition, all the effects of heterogamy in socio-economic background turned out to be gender-specific in that they did not appear when the genders were reversed. This suggests that similar socio-economic circumstances in childhood may have different implications for the cultural resources and hence adulthood union-formation behaviour of women and men. The differing main effects of the female and the male partners’ parental occupational classes support this interpretation.</p>
<p>A significant contribution of this study was showing that measuring homogamy and heterogamy by only dichotomizing couples into homogamous and heterogamous groups, or even by further assorting hypergamous and hypogamous couples, may be misleading in that such groupings are likely to leave essential associations undiscovered. Large datasets and detailed classifications of homogamy and heterogamy assorting all partner-status combinations are needed to maximize the understanding of the role of group boundaries in union transitions.</p>

<p>Although separation and marriage are competing events (one event prevents the other from happening), we treat separation as a censoring event because we do not examine here how the covariates affect the risk of separation, which is essential information if competing-risks regression is applied. Furthermore, the use of time-varying covariates is problematic in competing risks regression (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0001699312474385">StataCorp, 2011</xref>).</p>
