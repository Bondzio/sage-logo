<p>Forty-five years ago, I was driving home on the Lodge Freeway from an evening in Canada and, with disbelief, saw that the buildings on both sides of the expressway were on fire. My city was on fire! I was witnessing the beginnings of the 1967 riots in Detroit. That vision of seeing my city destroyed has left me deeply ingrained with the desire to understand social injustice and be a part of rebuilding and repairing a city in trauma.</p>
<p>Camden, New Jersey, like Detroit, has gone the way of many industrial towns. Once a bustling community offering jobs, culture, and ethnic traditions, Camden has given way to vacant lots, abandoned homes, and poverty. Former residents often speak about the wonderful amenities they used to enjoy, like the pony rides and vegetable trucks that came down the street every week, local movie theaters, bakeries, and small stores. All that has changed.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-2325160312471818" position="float">
<p>The sickness of a dying city translates into sick people.</p>
<p>Diabetes affects 12% of the people who live in Camden, making the prevalence 25% higher than in neighboring communities.</p>
<p>Trauma, violence, poverty, and family difficulties affect one’s ability to care for oneself.</p>
</boxed-text>

<title>Out of the Ashes</title>
<p>Jeff Brenner, MD, a Camden family physician, dreamed of turning this situation from despair into a model for the future of health care. Under his leadership, a diverse group of local health care practices began monthly meetings to discuss challenges and ways to move forward. The group included 3 hospitals, 2 federally qualified health centers, 3 hospital-based primary clinics, a for-profit primary care office, and 3 small private practices. Frustrated by the difficulties of facing huge needs with few resources, the group was inspired to improve the situation. Separately, they were victims of an untenable situation. Together, they became the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers (CCHP), a strong, energized, productive, and creative movement founded by Dr. Brenner.</p>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2325160312471818-fig1.tif"/>
<p>The catalyst for this diverse coalition was an analysis of 2002-2008 discharge data for over 62,000 visits to Camden emergency departments and hospitals. Data showed that 80% of Medicare costs were for the care of only 20% of the patients. Furthermore, the leading causes for hospital admissions were upper respiratory infections, sprains, and abdominal pain—all issues that are easily managed in routine primary care visits. The hospitals earned $46 million for the care of 1% of the patients over 5 years, which would be enough to hire 50 additional primary care physicians in Camden.</p>
<p>A follow-up analysis of hospital records for the year 2011 show that the trend continued in the wrong direction, with 84% of hospital charges spent on 20% of the patients. Clearly, money that could be available for primary health care was used instead to provide that care in emergency rooms. So not only is the current health care model in Camden exceedingly difficult for providers, it is wasteful, inefficient, and ineffective.</p>

<title>Camden Citywide Diabetes Collaborative Grant</title>
<p>In 2008, Merck awarded a 5-year grant to CCHP to address diabetes care in Camden based on the city’s manageable boundaries (9 square miles), its visionary understanding of process, access to an integrated data collection system called Health Information Exchange, and a willingness to collaborate.</p>
<p>The Camden Citywide Diabetes Collaborative (CCDC) grant provides support to transform the primary care practices in Camden. It is part of an overarching effort to convert community-based, primary care practices into patient-centered medical homes and to keep patients out of emergency departments and hospitals by improving the quality of care provided in primary care offices.</p>
<p>CDCC objectives include:</p>
<list id="list1-2325160312471818" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>increase the capacity of community-based, primary care practices to provide comprehensive, proactive care to patients with diabetes;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>increase diabetes self-management education (DSME) for residents of Camden with diabetes;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improve the coordination of care for patients with diabetes across health provider practices, hospitals, and health systems in Camden.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>DSME and diabetes educators are essential elements of this transformation effort. Ongoing, long-term care for diabetes, as well as other chronic illnesses, needs to occur within the primary care setting. Only with diabetes education can practices provide comprehensive, proactive care for patients with diabetes.</p>
<p>For the past 4 years, CCDC has implemented the strategies and achieved the results described in the following.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2325160312471818">
<title>More Health Care Workers Specializing in Diabetes Care</title>
<p>CCDC conceived and designed a citywide DSME structure to support practice transformation for the 12 providers in Camden, a city of 77,283 people. Five years ago, the community offered 30 DSME classes annually, taught in 2 locations. We now have more than 4 classes weekly in 3 locations and 2 hospital-based programs that meet 4 to 6 times a year. We went from 30 classes a year to over 130 classes a year serving 6,711 patients with diabetes. In addition, we went from 1.2 certified diabetes educators (CDEs) to 3.2 CDEs in the city and now have 1 CDE for every 2,097 adult patients.</p>

<sec id="section4-2325160312471818">
<title>Strong Administrative Support</title>
<p>CCHP prides itself in designing management structures to optimize the clinical effectiveness of providers. The administrative structure allows CDEs to focus on providing diabetes care and education. This includes self-management counseling; teaching problem-solving skills; nudging practices, patients, and providers to resist clinical inertia; tracking and monitoring patient care; initiating and titrating insulin; and helping practices manage patient metabolic control using CCDC protocols. Current administrative support includes:</p>
<list id="list2-2325160312471818" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>DSME Program Manager</bold>: This role supports the needs of the CDE and reviews data generated from classes and clinical interventions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Outreach DSME Coordinator</bold>: This position is a bilingual community resident with strong organizational skills. Responsibilities include preparing handouts; calling sales representatives for samples; arranging for class locations, times, and dates; blood work; obtaining complete medications lists; and encouraging people to come to classes. This person also receives referrals from providers, calls patients, practices motivational interviewing, builds relationships with those referred, removes obstacles to care, and supports people to take the first step in utilizing DSME. The outreach coordinator keeps a list of all people who have been referred and touches base with them continuously. Sometimes it takes a year to get a patient interested. One patient said she heard our outreach coordinator’s message so often that she told her husband she is going to attend. After all, if someone is so interested in her health, she needs to find out what this is all about. This person brought her husband and together they worked on healthy eating.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Champion</bold>: Each office has a designated “champion” who demonstrates strong interest in helping people attend diabetes classes. This is usually the person who talks to patients about attending diabetes classes and assists the program manager with missing information for the referred patient.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Community Health Worker</bold>: Since there are not enough CDEs, we are training community health workers or peer educators. Our peer educator, who lives in the neighborhood of the DSME site, uses her own personal experience with diabetes to guide and support her neighbors to better self-care. She is currently being trained in teaching classes and will be taking over instruction within the next 6 months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Endocrinologist</bold>: Our endocrinologist is an advocate for DSME in Camden and supports CDEs in providing evidence-based DSME. In addition, the endocrinologist serves as a catalyst for change within primary care practices and helps reinforce CDE messages with providers and practices.</p></list-item>

<title>A Single Referral</title>
<p>This was our first and one of our best accomplishments. For continuity, providers in the city use the same referral form for DSME. Every diabetes educator contributed to the development of this referral form and every DSME site agreed to use FAX.</p>
<p>Even so, forms can get lost in the everyday chaos of an office. The diabetes referral form is one of hundreds of forms received on any given day in a provider’s office. Our outreach coordinator makes routine visits to providers’ offices as a reminder of the face of DSME, explaining the 7 DSME sites in the city and minimizing obstacles to providing education.</p>

<p>Diabetes educators meet monthly to strategize how to enhance professional and leadership skills, improve citywide diabetes education, and build teamwork.</p>

<title>Collegial Support</title>
<p>Diabetes educators meet monthly to strategize how to enhance professional and leadership skills, improve citywide diabetes education, and build teamwork.</p>
<p>Registered nurses and registered dietitians each have unique skills, but all must have the baseline diabetes management skills necessary to lead providers in clinical decisions related to medication adjustment, insulin administration, titration, and problem solving. In the monthly CDE meetings, we discuss and demonstrate our own experiences with best practices for teaching insulin correction dosing, how to start on a pen, and how to switch from premix insulin to a physiologic regimen. Our skills are fine-tuned through quarterly reviews with our endocrinologist. We have citywide practice guidelines for medication adjustment and soon will have practice guidelines for hypertension and lipid management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2325160312471818">
<title>Patient Competencies</title>
<p>The CDEs have agreed on 8 competencies for patients:</p>
<list id="list3-2325160312471818" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Bring recorded blood glucose (BG) logs to the health care provider. The CDE will observe the patient’s ability to use a glucometer, read results, and record correctly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bring all medications and nonprescription medications to health care provider visits. The CDE will conduct medication reconciliation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Demonstrate correct insulin administration technique.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>See their health care provider every 3 months or sooner if their blood glucose is changing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Avoid regular soda, juice, flavored sugary drinks, and flavored milk.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Attend a diabetes class.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Check their feet.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Know their A1C and understand that diabetes is a lifelong condition.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These same competencies are reinforced in the primary offices through a program called “Teachable Moments.” Medical assistants are trained and supported in using scripted messages when rooming a patient with diabetes. The program curriculum is on the CCHP website.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2325160312471818">
<title>Primary Provider Participation and Support</title>
<p>We have learned DSME is most effective when patients are referred by their providers. DSME is not community education. People with diabetes do not just walk into our classes. It necessitates a CDE-provider collaboration in which the CDE has a physical presence in the office, ongoing communication with the provider, and attendance at CCHP practice meetings. DSME becomes incorporated into the practice, and patients see diabetes educators as part of the practice.</p>
<p>In the past, primary providers would send all patients on insulin and many of their patients on oral hypoglycemic medications to the endocrinologist. Referral to an endocrinologist is a real obstacle to good care in South Jersey due to a 3- to 6-month wait, poor transportation, difficult follow-up, and poor care coordination. CDEs in Camden work closely with the CCHP endocrinologist so that most diabetes can be managed in the primary care provider’s office. CCHP wants to support providers to do their own insulin starts, titration, and correction dosages. The endocrinologist serves as a consultant to primary care providers.</p>
<p>We are also working with providers to understand the DSME approach. CDEs identified the following as key learning needs for providers in Camden:</p>
<list id="list4-2325160312471818" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>preventing hospital admissions for high blood glucose;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>correcting inaccurate medication lists;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>performing appropriate lab tests;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>revising approach for teaching insulin;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>underutilization of insulin;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>using unusual combinations, such as basal + premix (sliding scale or PRN), R + N + basal, or premix HS;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>changing insulin, for example from basal to basal + bolus, or from basal to basal + premix;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>teaching correction factor and insulin dosage adjustments;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>failure to examine feet.</p></list-item>

<p>I want to end with a patient story that shows you a glimpse of the courage and dignity I see daily in Camden.</p>

<title>A Camden Case Study</title>
<p><bold>NW sat quietly amid a circle of 12 people gathered for weekly class at the Fairview Community Center. Would she come back? We have noticed that people with double digit A1Cs may not be ready for self-management. A new attendee usually uses the first few classes to explore their own willingness to engage. I can see the struggle as a person sits in the first few classes wanting better diabetes care, but clearly knowing this will mean lifestyle changes. Would NW be willing to continue working with us as she hears about insulin and about the many complications that others discuss?</bold></p>
<p>NW did return to the class and by the end of the 4-week session she talked about using a tea cup to measure her rice. During the fourth class, in a very soft, gentle voice, she told us her story. Every time she visited her family doctor, she saw the same words, “uncontrolled diabetes,” on the bill. She would leave the office feeling frustrated and condemned to a life of uncontrolled diabetes. Her doctor would say, “You must stop eating and take your medicine or diabetes will kill you.” Finally, he began to threaten, saying, “I cannot work with you anymore. You are not taking care of your diabetes.” Then she received the letter. Your doctor will no longer be working with you. She looked down at the table, her classmates surrounding her, and said, “I was fired. I was humiliated and felt hopeless.”</p>
<p>During the next few sessions, it became clear that NW had difficulty taking her insulin. She agreed to examine her own insulin administration. As a left-handed person, NW was a contortionist as she demonstrated her technique by inserting the syringe in the vial, removing air bubbles, and then injecting on a sample pad. To add to the difficulty, NW had visual limitations. She talked about blurry eyes and knew this was due to her high blood glucose. But she also had other eye problems that limited her vision. Did she see the markings clearly on the pen?</p>
<graphic id="img5-2325160312471818" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_2325160312471818-img5.tif"/>
<p>NW was using a 30 cc syringe, but she was told to take 32 units of insulin. A little timid and always frugal, she told us she pulled up a little more than the 30 on the syringe. Needless to say, she was not a good candidate for syringe and vial administration and would benefit from a pen. Unfortunately, NW had private insurance from her husband’s employer and the insurance would not cover pens. We asked her primary care provider to write a letter to her insurance for an exception to their policy. In the meantime, we gave her 50 cc syringes. NW practiced a new approach to insulin administration.</p>
<p>NW began bringing BG logs to class. So the next 4 weeks she practiced the art of diabetes management–recording blood glucose, taking medications, and noticing patterns related to food intake and medication administration.</p>
<p>After NW graduated from DSME, she and a classmate started 8 weeks of nutrition classes offered by the Camden County Expanded Food and Nutrition Program (EFNEP), a local food pantry. EFNEP provides a wonderful hands-on, patient-centered approach to healthy eating taught by peer educators. As a bonus, all attendees get a bag of food.</p>
<p>At this point, I felt reasonably satisfied that I had done my job and had contributed to complex problem solving. The patient made small changes and engaged in self-care. We have connected her to long-term support for healthy eating as well as a weekly exercise program.</p>
<p>In most cases, this would be the end of the DSME story. But, NW’s story did not end here. CCDC regularly examines outcome data. Six months later, I noticed NW’s A1C had not come down even a little bit. She continued to have a double digit A1C.</p>
<graphic id="img6-2325160312471818" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_2325160312471818-img6.tif"/>
<p>We invited NW back to the program. I scheduled an individual appointment to reassess her DSME needs. In that appointment, NW talked about not taking her insulin regularly. But the good news was that her husband had new insurance and she now qualified for pens. In addition, she hinted her lack of organization affected her self-care.</p>
<p>In the next 4 weeks, NW cancelled 3 appointments because of a cold, a gas leak in her car, and babysitting issues. She finally showed up to the class when we arranged for transportation to pick her up and take her home. During that class, I noticed that NW knew what to do. A classmate complained that her BG had increased significantly and unexpectedly. NW asked her several questions: Did you take your insulin? How long have you been using your vial? Sure enough, she helped her classmate discover that her vial of insulin should only be used for 28 days. Her classmate was using the same vial until the insulin was gone—up to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>NW had a fairly good understanding of the education behind DSME, but something prevented her from taking care of herself. NW talked about her concern about portion sizes and snacking at night. She suspected that her snacks at night without insulin coverage made her blood glucose high in the morning.</p>
<p>She continued to miss classes. She admitted she still had not filled her pen prescription because her regular pharmacy closed and her prescriptions were transferred to a Target about 5 miles outside of Camden. She had to find a ride to this store at least 4 times a month to get her prescriptions refilled. She needed to know her copayment before filling the prescription. In the confusion of picking up other prescriptions, she left the insulin script with the technician. She returned the next day to find out that that the new technician had misplaced the script. So now she needed to call the endocrinologist and pick up a replacement script.</p>
<graphic id="img7-2325160312471818" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_2325160312471818-img7.tif"/>
<p>We talked a little more on the phone and I asked her to tell me the size of the pen needle. She apologized and said, “I cannot find the pen needles. I have to hide them from my 4-year-old granddaughter (who gets into everything) and I don’t know where I put them.” She promised me she would get a plastic bin for all her diabetes supplies. In the course of the conversation, she said she sometimes had a hard time seeing things.</p>
<p>We talked about transferring her prescriptions to the pharmacy her husband used, which was within walking distance from her house. I explained that the pharmacist could make all the arrangements. She said, “That’s a good idea!”</p>
<p>What was really happening? Was this an issue of disorganization? Uncontrolled eating? Health literacy? Was this visual impairment? How much do finances affect her decisions? Was it a memory, cognitive, or depression problem? What was going on in the family that was making it so difficult for her to follow through?</p>
<p>I informed her provider about my concerns, and our community health worker suggested a home visit. I look forward to seeing NW again. And I am grateful for the opportunity to provide patient-centered, long-term diabetes care. Nothing means more to a patient than hearing the words “I am here for you—for the long haul.”</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text2-2325160312471818" position="float">
<p>THE BOTTOM LINE</p>
<p>This case is just one illustration of our firsthand experience witnessing and working with the effects of social injustice on health and health care in underserved communities. As clinicians, we are peeling away layers of obstacles, lack of education, and years of mismanagement.</p>
<p>In NW’s case, DSME occurred in the home, at the pharmacy, with medical assistants, and through our community health worker. Perceptions of time and space have to be reexamined. DSME cannot be confined to a doctor’s office or DSME location. DSME requires a lifetime of support and collaboration between patient and providers. ■</p></boxed-text>
