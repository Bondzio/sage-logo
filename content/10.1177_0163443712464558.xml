    <body>
        <p>Contemporary surveillance practices by both corporate and state actors increasingly rely
            on information and communication technologies to be able to categorize, process and
            analyse vast amounts of data. This is especially true of complex government projects
            created to manage entire populations.</p>
        <p>One set of technologies, generically referred to as ‘biometrics’, is being developed and
            implemented in different contexts in order to read characteristics of people’s bodies
            and physical behaviours with the aim of fixing identities, or authenticating or sorting
            them, based on pre-determined categories and logics. Some of the more recognizable
            examples of biometric technologies include digital fingerprinting, facial recognition,
            iris scanning and DNA profiling, but the list of technologies is long and constantly
            growing.</p>
        <p>Part of the allure of using biometrics to organize and segregate people is that our
            bodies are thought to provide an objective and verifiable source of truth about our
            identities, motivations and intentions and these technologies give access to these
            ‘truths’. Biometrics are also believed to be capable of ‘securing’ or ‘fixing’ identity
            in a way that makes fraudulent or multiple identities much more difficult, if not
            impossible, to maintain. Through the use of biometrics, organizations aim to individuate
            entire populations and then fix identities to administrative markers such as unique
            identification numbers.</p>
        <p>In India, for example, the government is currently embarking on a nationwide effort to
            provide every resident with a ‘unique’ identity by recording their fingerprints and iris
            biometrics and assigning them a unique identification number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712464558">Romero, 2012</xref>). The (laudable) intention is to
            harness technology to stimulate India’s economic development by reducing public sector
            corruption and fraud and make it easier for poor people to open bank accounts and
            interact with official agencies.</p>
        <p>Scholars interested in issues such as surveillance, identity and power have studied the
            technologies of biometrics extensively in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712464558">Lyon, 2008</xref>). The fusion of bodies,
            organizations, hardware, software and information that comprises biometrics makes them a
            fascinating object for academic pursuit. All too often, however, sociological and
            cultural studies of technologies such as biometrics struggle adequately to conceptualize
            and make sense of the technological artefacts that underlie the identification and
            surveillance practices that they deem problematic. That is, the tensions associated with
            the materiality of biometrics are frequently underplayed, if not ignored.</p>
        <p>Exploring the technologies of biometrics – that is, as collections of specific hardware,
            software and practices that can do some things and, importantly, not others – is
            necessary to grasp the context-dependent ethical implications of the use of biometric
            technologies and to assess the extent to which biometrics are able to fix
            identities.</p>
        <p>The article begins by reviewing some basic concepts of biometrics before noting certain
            problematic analytical trends in sociological studies of the technologies. Then we
            explain the case of the National Identity Scheme, which was a UK government attempt at
            collecting and using several types of biometric information to safeguard the identities
            of the entire UK population. The subsequent analysis section explores some of the
            technological and policy complexities that arise in projects that seek to fix identities
            through the use of these technologies.</p>

            <title>Biometrics and technological reification</title>
            <p>A basic process applies to all systems that seek to identify individuals using
                biometrics – this is the <italic>enrolment</italic> process. This includes the
                initial capture of biometric data from a person and the subsequent processing or
                conditioning of these data for storage and operational purposes. Enrolment involves
                the extraction of certain features in the data and the generation of a biometric
                template. A template can be defined as ‘a compact description of a biometric sample’
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712464558">Ross et al., 2007</xref>:
                544). In other words, it is not the ‘actual’ fingerprint (or iris image, etc.) that
                is stored and used, but rather a digital code (i.e. the template – although, in
                practice, the ‘raw’ image may also be stored for administrative purposes, such as
                the need to re-generate alternative templates). In use, a ‘live’ biometric is
                collected and the template for this is also produced. Depending on the context, the
                new template is compared with the stored template in one of two different modes:
                verification or identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712464558">Jain et al., 2004</xref>: 4).</p>
            <p>Biometric <italic>verification</italic> is the process by which a claimed identity is
                authenticated against a previously recorded biometric template. An individual
                presents her/himself as being someone (e.g. ‘I am Elizabeth Yap’) and, in response,
                the biometric system seeks to answer the query: ‘Is this person who s/he claims to
                be?’ In other words, verification is the one-to-one comparison of the captured live
                data against the enrolled biometric template for Elizabeth Yap. Wayman associates
                this mode with what he calls ‘positive recognition’, the aim of which is to prevent
                multiple people from using the same biometrically fixed identifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712464558">2001</xref>: 93–4).</p>
            <p>Biometric <italic>identification</italic> involves the comparison of live biometric
                data against a larger database of biometric records. It aims to answer the question:
                ‘Whose biometric information is this?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712464558">Jain et al., 2004</xref>: 5). Identification
                therefore seeks to establish identity by means of a one-to-many comparison.
                According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712464558">Wayman
                    (2001)</xref>, this method is important in ‘negatively recognizing’ individuals.
                Through a process of negative recognition, the system establishes whether a person
                is someone who s/he denies being. The purpose of negative recognition is to prevent
                a person from using multiple identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712464558">2001</xref>: 94). Importantly, this sort of
                negative recognition is only possible if the person’s biometrics have been
                previously enrolled on a database. One particular example of this mode is the use of
                biometrics to ‘guarantee uniqueness’. Here, a newly presented biometric is compared
                against all the previously collected biometrics to ensure it has not been previously
                registered, under a different name. Within the technical literature it is generally
                agreed that a bodily measurement must satisfy certain requirements before it can
                qualify as a ‘biometric’: it must be (1) universal, (2) distinct, (3) relatively
                permanent and (4) collectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712464558">Jain et al., 2004</xref>: 4).</p>
            <p>‘Universality’ means that all participants in a given population possess the
                characteristic; otherwise, not everyone can use the system. If a certain biometric
                is not universal across a population of users, then multiple biometrics might be
                used. The ‘distinctiveness’ requirement aims to avoid cases in which more than one
                individual shares the same characteristic. For example, to rely solely on height as
                a biometric identifier would make it difficult to distinguish between otherwise
                unique people in any moderately sized population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712464558">Cole, 2009</xref>). ‘Permanence’ is important as a
                rapidly changing identifier would result in a live biometric not matching the
                enrolment record, thus requiring the regular re-enrolment of biometric information,
                which is a costly and inconvenient process. ‘Collectability’ refers to the
                quantitative measurability of a characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712464558">Jain et al., 2004</xref>: 4). Most biometric
                measurements are of external characteristics and thus are easily measured, but
                biometrics may also use ‘internal’ features of the body, such as measuring the vein
                patterns inside one’s hands, and hence are more complicated to use.</p>
            <p>The social science literature on biometrics is rich and expansive, spanning many
                issues including privacy and civil liberties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712464558">Clarke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163443712464558">Davies, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163443712464558">Zorkadis and Donos, 2004</xref>), international
                security and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712464558">Amoore,
                    2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163443712464558">Zureik and
                    Hindle, 2004</xref>), surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712464558">Ball, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712464558">Lyon, 2001</xref>) and ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712464558">Alterman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712464558">Wickins, 2007</xref>). These
                analyses are diverse in their approach and content and it would be unfair to treat
                them as homogeneous. Nevertheless, within this literature there is a general
                tendency to reify biometrics in a way that detracts from the analyses (for a notable
                exception see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712464558">Magnet,
                    2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>This reification trend is the tendency to treat biometric technologies as stable
                objects or fixed practices whose outcomes are well-defined and predictable. Once
                this assumption has been made, authors are then able to move on to some of the
                important discussions about their potential social and ethical implications. Indeed,
                as Alterman acknowledges in his ethical critique of biometrics, certain of these
                analyses are based on ‘the ideal assumption that biometric systems can uniquely
                identify an individual within an arbitrarily large population’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712464558">2003</xref>: 144). The problem
                arises, however, when, time and again, the practicalities of biometrics lead to this
                fundamental assumption being questioned.</p>
            <p>Thus, when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712464558">Wickins (2007)</xref>
                argues that because all biometrics are exclusionary (that is, by design they
                categorize and sort populations) they are unequivocally unethical, his ethical
                critique ignores many important subtleties of biometrics that affect their ethical
                impacts, such as how Muslim women may prefer being fingerprinted over having their
                faces digitally scanned, for the latter involves removing head coverings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712464558">Wickins (2007)</xref> speaks of
                biometrics as though they were a single, unified practice, when in fact they are a
                series of different technologies and techniques that will pose different social and
                ethical quandaries based on the particularities of the technologies involved in the
                case at hand.</p>
            <p>Studies that reify the technologies of biometrics also, at times, reify the contexts
                of use by simplifying or neglecting the important details of the assorted arenas in
                which the technologies are proposed, implemented and used. For example, sociological
                and ethical critiques tend not to distinguish between the issues that arise around
                biometric systems mandated for use at the workplace (for attendance or performance
                management) and those that accompany biometric schemes that form part of
                standardization initiatives such as those for international travel documents.
                Schools (to track teachers or students) and nurseries (for child protection) are yet
                further contexts where these issues and debates take on a different character.</p>
            <p>A related tendency in the literature is to downplay, underestimate or misunderstand
                important features of identification or surveillance technologies. In the case of
                biometrics, the sociological and cultural literature largely overlooks the important
                differences between different types of biometric system (fingerprint, iris and
                facial recognition, DNA, etc.) as well as within the same types of system (e.g.
                still-face facial recognition systems as opposed to recognition-from-video systems;
                single fingerprint biometric systems that store only templates and 10-fingerprint
                systems that record original images). Authors tend to merge these different
                technologies together under the umbrella of ‘biometrics’ before launching into their
                critique and, in doing so, miss out on distinguishing features of the technology
                that matter to the substance and outcomes of the analysis.</p>
            <p>Aiming to overcome these tendencies to reify or downplay aspects of technology and
                context in social science treatments of biometrics, we advocate a different
                approach. Focusing specifically on the technologies and expected practices around
                biometrics (as articulated by politicians and civil servants) in a particular case –
                the National Identity Scheme in the United Kingdom – we critically examine how
                discourses about biometrics within a particular policy proposal tried to capture the
                nuances of the different technologies and their varying performance capacities, as
                well as how they accommodated complexity and uncertainty around these issues. We
                specifically focus on discourses about how biometrics fix identity in order to draw
                out some interesting tensions and problems.</p>

                the Identity Cards Act on 30 March 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712464558">Wadham et al., 2006</xref>). On 1 April 2006 the
                Identity and Passport Service (UKIPS) an executive agency of the Home Office was
                formed and given the responsibility for implementing the first national identity
                card programme in the UK since the Second World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712464558">Agar, 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p>This new scheme was different from previous national identification programmes in
                several ways. The proposals were for a system of unprecedented size and complexity,
                comprising a centralized National Identity Register (the ‘Register’) (the electronic
                database on which the population’s identity data would be held), the collection and
                recording of over 50 pieces of personal information from individuals, and the
                issuing of identity cards and passports based on multiple biometrics, including
                fingerprints, irises, digital photographs and signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163443712464558">Whitley and Hosein, 2010</xref>).</p>
            <p>The government’s programme for identity cards and biometrics went through various
                transformations after the bill became law. For example, the original
                conceptualization of the Register saw it as a brand new, central store of data. This
                changed in the <italic>Strategic Action Plan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712464558">UKIPS, 2006</xref>) released in December 2006. The
                plan separated out the biographic, biometric and administrative information from the
                Register and stored them on different databases. Later still, the government
                proposed reusing an existing government database (known as CIS) for the biographic
                data but this idea was also dropped.</p>
            <p>The government’s plans for biometrics as part of the scheme were never fully explicit
                or certain. For example, when the Labour government first proposed entitlement cards
                in a 2002 consultation paper, the use of biometrics was considered simply an
                ‘option’ within a much larger proposal for an entitlement scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712464558">Office of Government Commerce,
                    2003</xref>). The inclusion of biometrics was said to be ultimately dependent on
                the feasibility, cost–effectiveness and, importantly, public acceptance of the Home
                Office’s proposals.</p>
            <p>Eventually this ‘option’ for biometrics became a requirement, enshrined in the
                Identity Cards Act 2006, although the specifics around biometrics in the scheme
                would remain fuzzy throughout the life of the scheme. For example, the decision
                about which biometrics the government would use to identify citizens was never
                finalized. It was deliberately technology-neutral. While facial photographs were
                always considered the most viable and practicable option, they were not always
                spoken about as ‘biometric’ and instead were sometimes treated differently (arguably
                owing to the fact that photos are already widely included on photo IDs and are not
                perceived as an innovative technology).</p>
            <p>Fingerprints, the most publicly recognizable biometric, were also subject to
                uncertainty in the government’s plans. For example, the original thinking was to
                collect only four fingerprints from citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712464558">Home Office, 2002</xref>), then 10 fingerprints
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712464558">UKIPS, 2006</xref>) but
                later leaked documents suggested that even a policy to enrol 10 fingerprints was not
                necessarily set in stone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712464558">NO2ID,
                    2008</xref>).</p>
            <p>Iris biometrics, on the other hand, were explicitly mentioned in the Identity Cards
                Act 2006 (‘biometric information is data about [an individual’s] external
                characteristics, including, in particular, the features of an iris or of any other
                part of the eye’). The December 2006 <italic>Strategic Action Plan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712464558">UKIPS, 2006</xref>) downplayed the
                role of irises, noting that ‘When you enrol into the Scheme, your fingerprint
                biometrics (all 10 fingerprints) will be recorded and stored in the National
                Identity Register.… The introduction of iris biometrics also remains an option’
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712464558">UKIPS, 2006</xref>: 16).

                technologies at all. This was despite many bold claims made by government officials
                about what the programme was supposed to achieve – claims which many experts agreed
                were impossible without incorporating robust and scalable technology such as iris
                biometrics from the outset. For example, claims about effective uniqueness checks
                based on one-to-many biometric searches using fingerprint records in a fully
                populated Register were deemed far-fetched by experts, who argued that only iris
                biometrics were capable of performing on this scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712464558"><italic>BBC News</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712464558">Spiller, 2007</xref>).</p>

            <p>The question of whether and how biometrics are capable of fixing identities becomes
                especially interesting in this socio-political context when the material specifics
                of the proposed biometrics are taken into consideration. Here we focus on just some
                of the technological and public policy complexities that arise around these
                issues.</p>

                <title>Technological concerns</title>
                <p>During the early proposals for national identity cards in the UK, the generic
                    term ‘biometric’ provided government spokespeople a degree of cover from
                    critical questions about which technologies would specifically be used and their
                    capacity to secure or fix identity. For example:<disp-quote>
                        <p>Biometrics will tie an individual securely to a single unique identity.
                            They are being used to prevent people using multiple or fraudulent
                            identities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712464558">UKIPS,
                                2006</xref>: 10)</p>
                    </disp-quote></p>
                <p>Yet not all biometric technologies can effectively fix identities. Facial
                    recognition systems are notoriously fickle and have proven poor at identifying
                    people, particularly in large-scale applications. Mathematically, fingerprinting
                    systems perform better but are by no means foolproof (they can be forged and not
                    everyone has fingerprints that are readable by computers). Iris recognition
                    systems are believed to provide a ‘stronger’ identity fix (albeit not perfect)
                        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712464558">Kabatoff and Daugman,
                        2008</xref>), but the technological infrastructure required to support this
                    form of biometric identification is both complex and (still) expensive. Noting
                    these continuing deficiencies, there was even some debate in Parliament about
                    using DNA in the National Identity Scheme in order to securely fix
                    identities.</p>
                <p>By 2007, when it became apparent in government discourses that iris biometrics
                    were no longer an immediate option in the scheme, the stated aim of securing
                    unique identities for everyone in the UK was weakened, not least for reasons of
                    costs. It is plausible that, had the government excluded iris biometrics from
                    its proposals prior to the parliamentary passage of the Identity Cards Bill, it
                    would have been much more difficult to make a convincing case that the choice of
                    biometrics was capable of achieving the aim of fixing identities for the entire
                    population. Iris biometrics thus provided the rhetorical and technological means
                    for fixing identity and uniqueness (as well as conveying a sense of modernity)
                    but the implementation issues associated with iris biometrics (and their
                    associated costs) were also significant in causing this form of biometric to be
                    dropped from the scheme.</p>

                    fixed. Rhetoric on the necessity of locking people to an identity misses out on
                    several important exceptions. We note just four here.</p>

                            their identified sex). In the UK case, identity cards and biometrics for
                            transgendered people were issues of special concern (see, for example,

                            by issuing transgendered individuals with two identity cards (one in
                            their gender at birth and the other in their legally acquired ‘gender of

            <title>Concluding discussion</title>
            <p>Building exceptions such as those identified above into an identity policy that aims
                to securely fix identities to a set of biographic markers would require rules that
                are likely not easily implementable, while also introducing considerable complexity
                into the system. They may also result in the public questioning the underlying
                motivations behind such rigid policies to fix everyone to a singular and unchanging
                identity, for there may be good reasons (political, cultural, etc.) that others
                would want to challenge such efforts (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712464558">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). Depending on the
                context, however, citizens may not be in a position to speak out against such
                policies and practices (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712464558">Ackerman, 2011</xref>).</p>
            <p>In this article we have critically analysed the extent to which biometrics may be
                used to fix or secure identities, as well as the policy motivations for doing so.
                However, we are not arguing that biometrics cannot or should not be used to support
                identity policies and programmes. Rather, our point is that there are various issues
                that will inevitably arise when trying to do so and these issues should not be
                ignored because they perplex – they ought to be confronted and understood. There may
                be perfectly justifiable reasons to include some form of biometric technology in a
                new identity system, and these may very well be less concerned with uniqueness.
                Moreover, these material aspects of biometrics should cause us to question whether
                issues of uniqueness and the fixing of identities should be the main driver for
                emerging identity systems.</p>
