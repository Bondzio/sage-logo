<p>‘We are not here to focus on the good journalists. We don't need an inquiry for them. We are here to consider the bad ones. The Press is on trial here, and not simply in this room but also out there in the court of public opinion. And they know it. That is why they are so scared of what evidence has been heard here.’</p>
