<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of an intensive psychosocial intervention on the executive functioning (EF) in children with ADHD. The treatment was carried out in a coordinated manner over a period of 10 weeks with 27 children with ADHD aged 7 to 10, their parents, and their teachers. A battery of neuropsychological tasks was applied to evaluate attention, interference control, verbal and visuospatial working memory, planning ability, and flexibility. The comparative analysis of the treated group of ADHD children and an untreated ADHD group showed significant differences that were especially important in visuospatial memory and planning in favor of the treated children, even when the scores in the pretreatment phase were included as covariables. Likewise, improvements were observed in the parents’ and teachers’ behavioral ratings of hyperactivity or impulsivity and inattention. The conclusion was drawn that psychosocial interventions with children with ADHD can have a positive effect on some executive functions.</p>

<body>
<p>In spite of the difficulty involved in its definition, the executive function construct generally involves a series of components—planning, flexibility, inhibition, attentional control, and verbal and visuospatial working memory—that work independently in many ways but are closely related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411427349">Biederman, Petty, Fried, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411427349">Friedman et al., 2008</xref>). The executive functions (EF) are related to “planning or programming future actions, holding those plans or programs on-line until executed, and inhibiting irrelevant actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411427349">Pennington &amp; Ozonoff, 1996</xref>, p. 55). This cluster of functions seems to be mainly associated with the frontal lobes, which work in coordination with both the posterior and subcortical structures, involving the striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits and the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411427349">Castellanos &amp; Tannock, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the past decade, parallel to the advances made in the development of neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging techniques, the explanatory model of ADHD based on executive dysfunction has been formulated. The specific proposal is that the symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and lack of impulse control, which characterize the disorder, are caused by underlying deficits in the EF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411427349">Barkley, 1997</xref>). This conceptualization of the disorder has been solidly supported by the evidence gathered on the differences between children with ADHD and controls on different executive system processes. Thus, in a recent review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411427349">Doyle (2006)</xref> concluded that consistent evidence shows the existence of EF alterations in ADHD, specifically in the components of inhibitory control and working memory. Along the same lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219411427349">Willcutt, Doyle, Nigg, Faraone, and Pennington (2005)</xref>, in a meta-analysis of 83 studies, found impairments in the ADHD group on tasks that evaluated different aspects of EF (inhibitory control, vigilance, planning, verbal and spatial working memory, and cognitive flexibility), with effect sizes ranging from 0.46 to 0.69.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the relationship between EF and ADHD can vary considerably. In other words, a large number of people with ADHD have deficiencies in EF, but not all executive system components or all people are affected equally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411427349">Castellanos, Sonuga-Barke, Milham, &amp; Tannock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411427349">Doyle, Biederman, Seidman, Weber, &amp; Faraone, 2000</xref>). Moreover, the degree of EF impairment in ADHD does not reach that of a clinical marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219411427349">Zakzanis, 2001</xref>); therefore, their evaluation cannot replace a formal clinical evaluation in diagnosing ADHD. However, the data indicate that EF is useful in better understanding frequent comorbidities associated with ADHD and in predicting the results in the evolution of the disorder, a primary concern in the practical realm.</p>
<p>Indeed, the presence or absence of deficits in EF helps to explain the academic difficulties of children with ADHD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411427349">Biederman et al. (2004)</xref> estimated that respondents with significantly low scores on two or more measures from a broad battery of tests had EF problems. In comparison to the respondents who had no EF problems, the children and adolescents with ADHD and executive dysfunction were more likely to repeat a grade (42% vs. 19%), be diagnosed with learning disabilities (44% vs. 20%), and have a lower IQ (98 vs. 109). In addition, the presence of executive dysfunction negatively affected the academic performance of children with ADHD, regardless of their social class or IQ. Similarly, other studies have shown that respondents with ADHD and mathematics learning disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411427349">Miranda, Meliá, &amp; Marco, 2009</xref>), or ADHD and deficiencies in lexical access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411427349">Bental &amp; Tirosh, 2007</xref>), showed greater EF impairment than those who presented ADHD without learning disabilities.</p>
<p>One extremely interesting issue with repercussions in the area of clinical and educational practice involves the possibility that ADHD treatments, whether pharmacological or psychosocial, can improve EF deficits. Valuable information is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411427349">Pietrzak, Mollica, Maruff, and Snyder (2006)</xref>, who reviewed 40 studies that analyzed the cognitive effects of methylphenidate (MPH) in children with ADHD. Summarizing, the most noteworthy conclusion was that 4 of the 8 (50%) studies that used working memory and divided attention tests found a statistically significant improvement. Furthermore, 5 of the 7 (71.4%) studies that had applied planning or flexibility tests found that pharmacological treatment produced significant improvements.</p>
<p>Studies focused on determining the efficacy of pharmacological treatment on the working memory (WM) deserve special attention because of the important role of this function in school learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411427349">Swanson, Zheng, &amp; Jerman, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411427349">Bedard, Jain, Hogg-Johnson, and Tannock (2007)</xref> analyzed the effects of MPH on the WM of 50 children and adolescents with ADHD and found that the psychostimulant improved the ability to store auditory-verbal information. As Bedard et al. concluded, the MPH probably strengthened aspects of the WM more related to mathematics or sciences than to other academic subjects. Further information comes from another recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411427349">Bedard and Tannock (2008)</xref>, in which the authors’ aim was to identify individual factors that might influence the response to treatment with MPH. The results showed that MPH produced positive effects on visuospatial WM, but only in those children who suffered from comorbid anxiety.</p>
<p>The effect of the most widespread standard pharmacological treatment for ADHD, psychostimulant medication, on EF deficits is a question that requires further research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411427349">Biederman et al., 2004</xref>). However, not all children benefit from stimulant drugs to the same degree. Although very few cases are refractory to the treatment and develop side effects, approximately 30% of children treated with this type of medication do not present significant clinical improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411427349">Barkley, 1998</xref>). Along with the aforementioned considerations, the fact that the possible long-term effects of psychostimulant drugs have not been thoroughly analyzed is also a cause for concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411427349">Ashton, Gallagher, &amp; Moore, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The above-mentioned limitations of psychostimulant treatment, along with the recognition of the importance of EF deficits in ADHD, have produced a growing interest in finding solutions by investigating the possibilities of other nonpharmacological treatments. The study on neurocognitive training by Klingberg and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute makes a promising pioneering contribution in this direction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411427349">Klingberg et al. (2005)</xref> carried out 20 computerized training sessions in WM with nonmedicated 7- to 12-year-old children with ADHD. Their results indicate that the training produced significant improvements in the performance of memory activities similar to those included in the treatment as well as improvements in response inhibition and reasoning. The neurocognitive intervention also produced a reduction in the symptoms of inattention rated by parents between the pre- and posttreatment. However, the generalization effects to other adaptive tasks are debatable, and an attempt should be made to involve people or contexts that are significant in the child’s development in this type of intervention.</p>
<p>In different reviews and meta-analyses, psychosocial treatments have been considered to be well-founded and evidence-based treatments for managing the main symptoms of ADHD and dealing with the many problems associated with the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411427349">Antshel &amp; Barkley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411427349">Chronis, Jones, &amp; Raggi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411427349">DuPaul &amp; Weyandt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411427349">Hoza, Kaiser, &amp; Hurt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411427349">Miranda, Jarque, &amp; Tárraga, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411427349">Pelham &amp; Fabiano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411427349">Swanson et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022219411427349">Trout, Lienemann, Reid, &amp; Epstein, 2007</xref>). The majority of the studies coincide in highlighting the validated empirical efficacy of behavioral training. Curricular interventions in the schools, although less common, are also considered by many authors to be quite important, as they allow the teachers to make appropriate accommodations to improve academic performance in school, relations with classmates, and the acquisition of skills in different areas. Finally, for some of these reviews and meta-analyses, promise has also been shown by social skills training, which helps the child to establish and maintain relations, solve interpersonal problems, and become aware of substitutes for aggressive behavior toward peers.</p>
<p>A key aspect pointed out in these review studies is the need for the active participation of parents and teachers to enhance the effectiveness of the psychosocial interventions. The family context is important because the presence of ADHD in children is frequently associated with problematic family functioning and high levels of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411427349">Miranda, Marco, &amp; Grau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022219411427349">Whalen et al., 2006</xref>). Parent–child relations can be conflictive, especially in children with associated behavior problems, and the parents usually present specific patterns of deviated cognitions about the children’s behavior and reduced self-efficacy to control it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411427349">Deault, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411427349">Johnston &amp; Mash, 2001</xref>). Such adverse family climates may serve to increase children’s problematic behaviors and mediate treatment responsiveness and long-term outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411427349">Hoza et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Behavior modification programs for parents, a paradigmatic example of which is the program by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411427349">Barkley (1987)</xref>, have been shown to produce changes in children’s behavior, in parent–child relations, and in family functioning in general. Likewise, programs developed for the schools increase the teachers’ and educators’ knowledge about the disorder and enable them to engage actions designed to improve the many problems their students with ADHD have with both learning and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411427349">Anhalt, McNeil, &amp; Bahl, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411427349">Kotkin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411427349">Miranda, Presentación, &amp; Soriano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411427349">Pelham et al., 2005</xref>). An additional but fundamental reason for involving the schools in the treatment of ADHD is the greater involvement of parents in school-based services than clinic-based services, as a recent study points out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411427349">Atkins, Graczyk, Frazier, &amp; Adil, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, some conclusions from the reviews on ADHD intervention highlight the need to perform more studies to determine the best treatment procedures as well as the benefits of psychosocial interventions and the effort made to combine different intervention strategies and implement them in children’s developmental contexts. The results obtained have shown that multimodal behavioral treatment programs that include school-based behavioral interventions, child-focused therapy, and/or parent behavioral training are more effective than either treatment modality alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411427349">Pelham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411427349">Reddy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022219411427349">Wells et al., 2006</xref>). However, most of the time the objective has been to analyze the efficacy of the treatment on the basic symptomatology of the disorder and, to a lesser degree, the associated adaptive problems. Few programs have rated the benefits in the EF domains in which, as mentioned earlier, children with ADHD usually present problems. This important topic has rarely been addressed, except in a recent study with adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411427349">Solanto, Marks, Mitchell, Wasserstein, &amp; Kofman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This study is designed to provide answers to questions about the evaluation of psychosocial treatments. The first aim was to test the effects of an intensive psychosocial intervention for children with ADHD on the EF. EF were evaluated by means of neuropsychological tasks of attention, interference control, verbal and visuospatial WM, planning, and flexibility. The second aim of this study was to analyze the efficacy of this kind of intervention on the core symptoms of ADHD perceived by the parents and teachers as reflected in their attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity ratings.</p>
<p>The family and school were involved in applying the behavioral, behavioral-cognitive, and academic techniques included in the intervention program to aid in generalizing the results. Natural settings facilitate the application of regulation strategies in response to real situations rather than merely hypothetical ones. Thus, they can increase the efficacy of the interventions, given that one basic failing of children with ADHD is that they do not give the right answer at the right time, even when they know it.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>To recruit children with ADHD, the psychopedagogy services and parent associations were asked to refer us to families with primary school children who had been diagnosed with combined subtype attention-deficit disorder or exhibited typical ADHD behaviors. The definitive diagnosis was made based on the information provided by the parents and teachers in individual interviews held by one the authors of this study, a specialist in developmental disorders. Specifically, the criteria followed were those established in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411427349">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>): (a) presence of at least six symptoms in each of the sections (inattention–disorganization and hyperactivity–impulsivity) of the ADHD questionnaires for parents and teachers adapted from the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411427349">APA, 2000</xref>), (b) duration of the symptoms of at least 1 year, (c) appearance of the problem before age 7, and (d) absence of psychosis or neurological damage or sensorial or motor deficits. All the children had normalized vision and hearing and an estimated IQ of 80 or greater, based on the vocabulary and blocks subtests (Vocabulary, Block Design) of the <italic>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Revised</italic> (WISC-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411427349">Wechsler, 1993</xref>). These two subtests are frequently used to estimate IQ because the resulting IQ score correlates at .90 with full-scale IQ based on all subtests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411427349">Spreen &amp; Strauss, 1991</xref>). None of the children who participated in the study were receiving medication or any other systematic treatment modality during the time the study was going on. The fact that the sample was community based is a factor that might explain this situation to a large extent.</p>
<p>Of the 136 cases from 24 schools referred for evaluation, only 42 children met the diagnostic criteria for combined subtype ADHD. The parents of these 42 children were informed in a meeting that inclusion in the intervention program was still not ensured. Once the parents had accepted the conditions and signed the informed consent, the children were randomly assigned to one of two groups using a random number generator, 27 children to the treatment group and 15 to the group without treatment. The decision was made to make the treatment group larger than the no-treatment group, as this asymmetrical distribution would offer the intervention to the greatest number of children possible while maintaining a large enough control group to perform the proposed statistical analyses. For ethical reasons, the parents of the children in the no-treatment group participated in a 3-hr session after the posttest evaluation, where they were given general information about the disorder as well as procedures to control their children’s behavior.</p>
<p>The treated group was composed of 23 boys (85.2%) and 4 girls (14.8%). The same distribution by gender was observed in the control group, with 86.7% boys compared to 13.3% girls. The ages of the participants ranged from 7 to 10 years, although the majority of them (63.0% of the experimental group and 66.7% of the control group) were aged 7 to 8. The average IQ of the experimental group was 102.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.1), and the average IQ of the control group was 97.4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.0). There were no significant differences between the two groups on any of the aforementioned variables. All of the participants were Caucasian. The majority of the parents were working professionals with a medium socioeconomic status. The parents’ educational level ranged from some high school to a doctoral degree. In 73.1% of the families, at least one of the parents had earned a bachelor’s degree.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The neuropsychological tasks selected in this study have been commonly used to rate the EF of children with ADHD (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411427349">Doyle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219411427349">Willcutt et al., 2005</xref>), and their validity has been reviewed in various analyses and meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411427349">Miranda, Félix, &amp; Ávila, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219411427349">Van Mournik, Oosterlaan, &amp; Sergeant, 2005</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0022219411427349">
<title>Attention measure: Continuous Performance Test (CPT)</title>
<p>For the CPT (adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411427349">Ávila &amp; Parcet, 2001</xref>), on a computer screen 300 white letters (A, B, F, G, H, J, K, N, T, V, and X) are randomly presented on a black background. The children are told to press the space bar every time an X appears preceded by an A on the screen. Each possibility (AX, X without the A, and A without the X) appears 50 times. In addition, the children are told not to press the space bar at any other time. Before beginning the test, the children participate in a practice session lasting 2 min.</p>
<p>As other authors have done previously, in this study attention was operationalized using the omissions and commissions scores together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411427349">Biederman, Petty, Doyle, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022219411427349">Tsal, Shalev, &amp; Mevorach, 2005</xref>). The omissions score is the number of errors the respondent makes by not responding when the established sequence appears. The commissions score reflects the responses the respondent makes to the A or the X alone as well as the responses made to any other stimulus. Both measures were transformed into <italic>z</italic> scores, averaged, and inverted, so that high scores indicated a greater capacity to pay attention to the tasks, maintain vigilance for a prolonged period of time, and inhibit responses to other different stimuli.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022219411427349">
<title>Measure of interference control: Stroop test</title>
<p>This test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411427349">Golden, 1994</xref>) rates the respondent’s capacity to keep nonrelevant information from interfering in the WM during a task in progress and the ability to suppress information that was previously relevant but is no longer. It consists of three subtests. In the first, the child must read words (names of colors) written in black letters as quickly as possible. In the second, the child must rapidly name the color of the ink with which the letter X is printed. In the final subtest, the Color–Word subtest, the words (names of colors) are printed in different colored ink from the color named by the word. In this case, the child must name the color of the ink. This Color–Word subtest is an example of an interference control task. The combination of the word <italic>red</italic> written in green ink creates a conflict when the task consists of saying the color of the ink (green) because the overlearned response strongly evokes the response based on the meaning of the word (red).</p>
<p>The present study used the adaptation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219411427349">Temple, Carney, and Mullarkey (1996)</xref>. Their version contains three types of cards (which correspond to the conditions of Color, Word, and Color–Word) with 50 stimuli each. The dependent variables used were interference error and interference time. The interference error was calculated by subtracting the errors on the subtests of Color and Color–Word. The same procedure was used to find the scores for interference time. Both measures were transformed into <italic>z</italic> scores, averaged, and inverted, so that high scores indicated better performance.</p>

<title>Working Memory Sentences (WMS)</title>
<p>The WMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411427349">Siegel &amp; Ryan, 1989</xref>) includes 42 sentences with the last word missing. These sentences are distributed in a series of three trials divided into four levels of complexity according to the number of sentences included (2, 3, 4, or 5 sentences) in each series. The experimenter reads each of the sentences in the series aloud and tells the child that once each sentence has been read, he or she must provide the missing word. At the end of each series, the child is asked to recall the words and repeat them in the same order as the completed sentences. The task administration begins with the presentation of the series of two sentences, and once the three trials have been presented, the level of complexity is increased. Even if the child makes errors in one of the series, no feedback is provided, and the task is terminated when the child makes a mistake on the three trials at the same level.</p>

<title>WISC-R, Inverse Digits subtest</title>
<p>This task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411427349">Wechsler, 1993</xref>) consists of remembering, in reverse order, series of numbers with increasing difficulty. The examiner reads aloud a numerical series of digits at a rate of one item per second, and he or she asks the child to repeat the sequence in the inverse order. The test begins with a series of two items and continues until a maximum of eight. There are two trials in each series, and the test continues until the participant makes a mistake on the two trials in the same series. One point is given for each correct trial, with 30 being the maximum total score on the subtest. The memory score consists of the maximum number of digits the participant is able to recall.</p>
<p>In the present study, the scores on the WMS and the digits task were transformed into <italic>z</italic> scores and averaged to find the verbal WM score.</p>

<title>Visuospatial working memory: Temporal Spatial Recall Task (TSRT)</title>
<p>The TSRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411427349">Dubois et al., 1995</xref>), a computerized test, analyzes visuospatial WM based on three main processes: recognition, spatial recall, and temporal recall. The task includes 33 trials (3 practice and 30 evaluation), in which 12 randomly distributed squares appear on the screen. The squares progressively change color. In 50% of the cases, the screen remains dark for 5 s (delay stage). The child must reproduce the sequence of appearance of the modified squares by indicating it on the screen with his or her finger. The dependent variable of visuospatial memory was the total number of correct answers, that is, the total number of points earned by the child in the two presentation conditions (with and without delay) in <italic>z</italic> scores.</p>

<sec id="section10-0022219411427349">
<title>Planning measure: Tower of London (TL)</title>
<p>The TL material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411427349">Shallice, 1982</xref>) consists of a wooden base with three vertical bars and three balls of different colors that can be inserted into them. The child is asked to put the balls in a specific position, following certain rules. The test has three levels of difficulty that depend on the number of moves necessary to perform each item (3, 4, and 5).</p>
<p>As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411427349">Marzocchi et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411427349">Oosterlaan, Scheres, and Sergeant (2005)</xref>, in this study the total score, the reaction time, and the performance time were combined. The total score is the sum of the scores obtained on the different items that make up the test. On each item, the score varies between 3 and 0 points, depending on the attempt when the child correctly resolves it by following the test requirements. The reaction time is the amount of time that elapses from the initiation of the test until the participant performs the first movement. The performance time is the time from the first movement until the item is finished. The scores on both times were transformed into <italic>z</italic> scores and inverted, and then later averaged together with the total score measures. In the resulting planning score, high scores indicate good performance.</p>

<title>Flexibility measure: Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</title>
<p>The WCST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411427349">Heaton, Chelune, Talley, Kay, &amp; Curtiss, 1993</xref>) measures the capacity of the child to classify objects in diverse categories, that is, his or her ability to elaborate and evaluate different hypotheses with the purpose of deducing a correct and changing classification rule. The test consists of 128 cards that must be matched on color, form, or number based on four model cards. After each attempt, the examiner indicates to the child whether his or her response was correct or not. If it was correct, the child must repeat this strategy in the next 10 tries. Once the 10 tries have been completed satisfactorily, the examiner changes the category, and this process continues until completing a total of six categories.</p>
<p>In agreement with other investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411427349">Scheres et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219411427349">Toupin, Déry, Pauzé, Mercier, &amp; Fortin, 2000</xref>), the perseverative errors, which are produced when the child makes a mistake and perseveres in it, were combined with the perseverative responses, which are those responses that are repeated from the previously concluded category in the context of a new category. As in the previous cases, these measures were transformed into <italic>z</italic> scores, averaged, and inverted, so that the resulting flexibility measure indicated a good performance.</p>
<p>Before beginning the intervention and once it had ended, all the children were tested individually in two 1.5-hr sessions, counterbalancing the order in which the tasks were applied. The testing was administered by one of the authors of this study and by two PhD-level psychology students who were trained in administering EF tasks.</p>

<title>Intervention Programs</title>
<p>The multicontextual and multicomponent approach used in this study integrated three different programs implemented with the children, the parents, and the teachers during a 10-week period (for a more complete description of the program, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411427349">Presentación, Siegenthaler, Miranda, &amp; Martí, in press</xref>). The main feature of this packet was the communication among all the participants, so that the parents and teachers knew what techniques were being worked on with the children at all times to facilitate the generalization of what was learned. The therapist was in contact with the children, the parents, and the teachers in the weekly meetings and by telephone. Likewise, the parents and teachers were in contact daily by means of the home-school card.</p>
<sec id="section13-0022219411427349">
<title>Intervention program for the children</title>
<p>This program consisted of a set of cognitive-behavioral techniques introduced successively in small groups by the specialist in 16 sessions lasting 45 min each. The basic core of the program was the teaching of the self-instruction technique (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411427349">Camp &amp; Bash, 1980</xref>), with the purpose of fostering inhibitory control. To work on an interpersonal plane, the self-instruction was combined with problem-solving techniques, anger management, and the teaching of social skills (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411427349">Miranda &amp; Presentación, 2000</xref>). The program was complemented with a token economy system.</p>
<p>The methodology used to implement these techniques included dialogue, debate, commentary, modeling (of mastery, of coping, and in correction), and dramatization. To orient the children in their performance, feedback and reinforcement (external and self-reinforcement) were used. Tasks were also designed to maintain and generalize the skills learned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022219411427349">
<title>Intervention program for the parents</title>
<p>This program (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411427349">Barkley, 1987</xref>) consisted of 10 weekly sessions lasting 2 hr each, which included a set of behavior modification techniques the parents learned to foster attention and obedience in the home context.</p>
<p>The program began by providing information about the disorder (first and second session) to keep the parents from placing responsibility for the problem exclusively on their child and to make them aware of rewarding aspects of parent–child interactions. The parents were given a home-school card, prepared so that parents and teachers could be in daily contact, and where the teachers had to rate the children’s class behaviors that had been established as objectives. Sessions 3, 4, 5, and 6 were dedicated to the behavior modification techniques. During these sessions, the parents also acquired knowledge about the self-instruction and self-evaluation techniques. Session 7 focused on orienting parents about how to support school learning from home. Sessions 8 and 9 were directed toward improving the parents’ emotional well-being. By means of diverse strategies and techniques (anger management, relaxation, and problem solving), the parents learned to cope with complex situations that arise in raising their children. The program ended with a follow-up session. To teach the parents the different techniques, debate, commentary, and modeling were used, and they were practiced by means of dramatization and the analysis of cartoons.</p>

<sec id="section15-0022219411427349">
<title>Intervention program for the teachers</title>
<p>The postgraduate course for teachers (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411427349">Miranda et al., 2002</xref>), whose purpose was to broaden the teachers’ training in the behavioral and academic management of the child with ADHD in the classroom, also took place in 10 weekly sessions.</p>
<p>The first three sessions dealt with general knowledge about ADHD. Session 4 was dedicated to the application of behavior modification techniques in the classrooms, and the teachers were also asked to encourage the students’ use of the self-instruction technique they were practicing with the specialist. Sessions 5 and 6 taught reinforced self-evaluation to develop the children’s use of evaluation and regulation skills in following the class norms and doing their tasks. The teachers were also informed about how their students were using the problem-solving and anger management techniques as well as the need to generalize these techniques to the classroom context. Sessions 7, 8, and 9 dealt with the physical and organizational adaptations in the classroom for children with ADHD as well as instructional modifications according to the specific curricular areas. The last session focused on the follow-up to the application of the program techniques. The procedures used to transmit the techniques to the teachers were debate, commentary, modeling, role-play, cartoons, and filling out observation and activity planning forms.</p>
<p>In the case of the children, the intervention was implemented with seven groups of four children during nonschool hours, with an average attendance of 88.4%. Likewise, in the seminar for parents, the 27 couples were divided into two groups. The attendance was 76.4%, although in 59.7% of the cases only one member of the couple, normally the mother, attended. The course for the 27 teachers took place during 70 theory-practice hours, with an attendance level of 93.1%.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>In the statistical analyses, six measures of EF were used that combined scores from one to three variables: (a) attention (CPT omissions, CPT commissions), (b) interference control (Stroop error interference, Stroop time interference), (c) verbal WM (WMS total score, WISC-R Inverse Digits), (d) visuospatial memory (TSRT total score), (e) planning (TL total score, TL reaction time, TL performance time), and (f) flexibility (WCST perseverative errors and WCST perseverative responses). Parents’ and teachers’ ratings of both attention and hyperactivity or impulsivity were also assessed.</p>
<p>After calculating <italic>z</italic> scores and averaging them for each domain evaluated, the normality and homogeneity of the variances were calculated using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Levene tests, and a linear relationship was observed between the pre- and posttreatment moments for all of the variables. Later, analysis of variance showed the existence of significant differences between the treatment and no-treatment groups in the baseline values of three of the variables being studied (verbal WM, planning, and hyperactivity or impulsivity rated by parents). Given that, in addition, the prettreatment and posttreatment were repeated measures, the decision was made to analyze the pre- to posttreatment changes by performing covariance analysis (ANCOVA), where the group variable was considered as the independent variable and the pretreatment measure was introduced as the covariable. The initial proposal was that the change experienced in the posttreatment moment could be the result of the group variable, which contained information about the groups with and without treatment, but it could also be affected by the baseline score for each of the variables. The effects of the group (treated and not treated) × baseline interaction were not significant (homogeneity supposition pending) in any case, with the exception of cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>To better understand the change produced, linear regressions were performed. They specifically evaluated the significance of the change that took place between the observed and predicted measures in each of the variables for the treated and untreated groups. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 18.0.</p>

<p>The comparative variance analyses between the groups at the baseline moment reflect differences in verbal WM, <italic>F</italic>(1, 42) = 5.822, <italic>p</italic> = .021, with higher scores in the treatment group, and planning, <italic>F</italic>(1, 42) = 6.143, <italic>p</italic> = .018, with higher scores in the control group.

In both cases, the treated group has more value added (Δ attention = 0.312, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .338; Δ visuospatial WM = 0.754, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .344) than the untreated one (Δ attention = −0.418, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .386; Δ visuospatial WM = −0.433, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .719), so that there was more progress than expected. In the case of cognitive flexibility and verbal WM, one of the two groups does not fit a significant regression model. For flexibility, although the value added in the treated group is not significant, in the untreated group it was less than expected (Δ flexibility = −0.209, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .568). On verbal WM, no significant regression model appears in the untreated group, although the improvement in the treated group is superior to what was predicted by the model (Δ verbal WM = 0.296, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .375). Finally, with regard to interference control and planning, there is no regression equation for either of the groups that would make it possible to reliably predict the posttreatment behavior based on the pretreatment scores.</p>
<p>The efficacy of the program was shown even more clearly in the behavioral ratings of the parents and teachers, the results of which can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022219411427349">Table 3</xref>. The comparative analyses in the pretreatment phase show significantly higher scores in the treated group only on hyperactivity or impulsivity according to parents, <italic>F</italic>(1, 42) = 16.730, <italic>p</italic> = .000. After the intervention, for the parents’ and teachers’ ratings of both attention and hyperactivity or impulsivity, the improvement in the treated group is noteworthy (more than one standard deviation), whereas the untreated group maintained the same baseline scores obtained in the first evaluation.</p>

<p>Two observational variables, attention and hyperactivity or impulsivity rated by teachers, present significant regression equations, with greater improvement detected in the treated group than expected (Δ attention teachers = 0.855, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .205; Δ hyperactivity or impulsivity teachers = 0.736, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .376), whereas in the untreated group the opposite tendency occurred (Δ attention teachers = −0.388, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .424; Δ hyperactivity or impulsivity teachers = −0.146, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .363; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022219411427349">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, on attention rated by parents, the treated group did not fit a significant regression model, whereas the untreated group presented a lower value added than expected (Δ attention parents = −0.570, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .461). Finally, on hyperactivity or impulsivity rated by parents, there is no regression equation for either of the two groups that would make it possible to reliably predict the posttreatment scores based on the pretreatment scores.</p>
<p>Furthermore, bivariate correlations were performed between the EF variables and the behavior ratings of the parents and teachers, as well as multiple linear regressions when appropriate. These analyses show that although some variables of the parents and/or teachers show significant correlations with some EF, no multiple regression equation was found in which the posttreatment scores could be explained not only by the pretreatment scores but also by the variables of the teacher or the parents. These results occurred in both groups, with and without treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first objective of this study was to analyze the effects of a psychosocial intervention on the EF of children with ADHD, evaluated with neuropsychological measures. The results obtained show that the two groups, treated ADHD and untreated ADHD, showed different performances once the treatment was over.</p>
<p>Thus, the mean scores of the group participating in the program improved after the treatment, to a greater or lesser degree, on the variables analyzed. The magnitudes of the improvements in the treated group showed up clearly in the comparison analyses (ANCOVA) with the group that did not receive treatment. The results indicate that there continue to be significant differences between the treated and untreated groups on almost all of the EF variables analyzed, even when the covariable from the pretreatment phase is included. Therefore, in spite of the covariation existing between the two moments (the posttreatment phase is significantly related to the pretreatment phase in all cases), the significance resulting from the group independent variable continues to explain the variance between pre- and posttreatment on all the variables except flexibility. Moreover, the regression analyses confirm, in the variables in which a significant regression equation appears, added values superior to those expected in the treated group and inferior to what was expected in the untreated group. The findings generally agree with those from studies investigating the effects of pharmacological treatment on EF (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411427349">Pietrzak et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The intervention program had a significant effect on planning. After its implementation, the children showed a greater ability to analyze tasks, generate different strategies, and rate them, managing to solve the TL problems in fewer attempts and with greater speed. Especially noteworthy is the effect of the intervention on visuospatial WM, similar to what was obtained with the administration of MPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411427349">Bedard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411427349">Bedard &amp; Tannock, 2008</xref>) or neurocognitive training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411427349">Klingberg et al., 2005</xref>). However, the results for flexibility, because of the significant interaction between the covariable and the independent variable, are not conclusive. It seems that some children can benefit from the intervention, whereas others do not obtain the same improvements. Future studies could examine the nature of this interaction by using more exhaustive analysis procedures (e.g., Johnson–Neyman; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411427349">Johnson &amp; Fay, 1950</xref>).</p>
<p>The results also showed significant differences between the scores on attention, interference control, and verbal WM in the treated ADHD group compared to the untreated group. However, in these cases the differences were the result, at least in part, of a worsening in the untreated comparison group. Deficits in inhibition and attention, generally considered core manifestations of the disorder, may be especially difficult to modify. Moreover, the effect of the treatment on attention may be the result of the characteristics of the task used for its evaluation. The CPT is especially tedious and monotonous because it does not involve problem solving or producing novel answers of any kind (as occurs in the TL or the WCST). On the second CPT performance, the treated group may have produced some type of effort maintenance strategy that allowed them to show a slight improvement in their responses, whereas the untreated group, by not using this type of strategy, worsened. Something similar might have occurred in the case of the Inverse Digits subtest of the WISC-R and on the Stroop test, although the usefulness of this latter test to evaluate the effect of interference has been seriously questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219411427349">Van Mournik et al., 2005</xref>). It cannot be ruled out that these results showing worsening in the untreated group could also be produced by low motivation in performing this type of tasks, partly because of the fact that these children did not participate in the intervention program.</p>
<p>With regard to the second objective, to analyze the effects of the intervention on the behavioral ratings of the parents and teachers, the analyses show important improvements in the treated group that did not occur in the untreated one. Significant differences were observed between the groups on all the variables analyzed (attention and hyperactivity or impulsivity evaluated by parents and teachers), even when the effect of the initial score was controlled. Furthermore, in this case, on the variables that present significant regression equations, the prognostic studies show much greater progress in the treated group than expected, whereas the untreated group presents less value added.</p>
<p>The fact that the program focused on activities related to daily life helps to explain why the results obtained on EF are limited when compared to ratings of parents and teachers. According to both observers, the improvements in attention and hyperactivity or impulsivity are above 1 standard deviation, with important percentages of explained variance. Nevertheless, these differences between neuropsychological and behavioral tests after treatment can vary over time, as occurred in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411427349">MTA Cooperative Group, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411427349">Swanson et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411427349">2008b</xref>). It would be interesting to find out the effects of intensive psychosocial treatment on the EF in the long term. Future studies will have to examine this question.</p>
<p>A modest similitude of results between neuropsychological tests and behavioral questionnaires has been seen in other studies of adults with ADHD, leading to the conclusion that they cannot be used interchangeably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411427349">Biederman, Petty, Fried, et al., 2008</xref>). An alternative explanation for this low level of agreement is that neuropsychological tests have less ecological validity to evaluate the child’s behaviors in everyday life. Behavioral questionnaires for parents and teachers or direct observations of behaviors are probably more sensitive to adaptive modifications occurring in natural contexts. Based on this idea, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411427349">Biederman et al. (2009)</xref> carried out a longitudinal study over a 10-year period (between early childhood and adulthood) with 217 children classified as persistent and remittent ADHD. The study examined the course of different cognitive functions evaluated by neuropsychological tests. Their results show that cognitive deficits are relatively stable in the adult stage, and, curiously, no differences were found between the persistent and remittent groups. As the authors themselves point out, cognitive deficits seem to be independent from the course of ADHD. According to these results, EF deficits can persist over time, even if the child learns strategies and skills that facilitate positive modifications in adapting to developmental contexts. For the same reason, neuropsychological tests (especially some of them) could be less sensitive in evaluating the effects of an intervention carried out in natural contexts. Future studies should look more closely at this question.</p>
<p>The conclusion can be drawn that, in general, a psychosocial intervention can have a positive influence on the EF of children with ADHD, even when it does not focus on activities that provide direct EF training. The program described here also has an extremely practical nature, as it can be incorporated into daily school and home dynamics. The efficacy of the intervention can be noted especially in the parents’ and teachers’ behavioral ratings. One could wonder whether the fact that the parents and teachers participated actively in the intervention program caused their perceptions of the children’s behaviors after the treatment to be much more positive (Hawthorne effects). However, the findings presented in this article are part of the results of an intervention whose efficacy was rated using a multimodal matrix. In addition to EF tasks and questionnaires for parents and teachers, information was gathered from marks in school (by means of criteria-based evaluation of curricular contents) and a sociometric test (evaluated by classmates), both of which reported positive effects of this intervention. These indicators are not affected by possible biases involved in parents’ and teachers’ dual roles as agents and evaluators of the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411427349">Miranda, Presentación, García, &amp; Siegenthaler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411427349">Presentación, Siegenthaler, Jara, &amp; Miranda, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe, however, that parents and teachers, in their daily interactions with the child within the natural developmental contexts, have played a fundamental role in achieving the results of the intervention carried out on the EF. The within-session adherence has probably had a very positive impact on the results of the treatment. Undoubtedly, the sociocultural status of the parents, the supportive and facilitative communication among therapists, parents, and teachers, and the procedures used for teaching the techniques in the therapeutic sessions have facilitated the application of the techniques in natural contexts and increased parent and teacher treatment motivation. Another extrinsic motivational factor was the fact that the teachers obtained points toward their professional advancement.</p>
<p>The feedback obtained showed that all of the parents and teachers, to a greater or lesser degree, rated the program techniques positively and put them into practice in the specific way agreed on with the researchers. After the treatment, the teachers, in a program evaluation questionnaire, recognized that they did not know these techniques or had not used them correctly before the treatment, that the techniques had been quite useful during it (especially the reinforced self-evaluation), and that they would continue to use the techniques with children with ADHD and with other students with problems. The parents reported that they had learned to view their children in a different way and understand and control their behavior more. They also stated that their interactions were more positive and that the family generally functioned much better.</p>
<p>One of the most outstanding contributions of this study is the attempt it makes to construct a bridge between the neuro-scientific and psychoeducational approaches. Nonetheless, future studies should more closely examine the relationships between performance on EF tasks and ability to cope in significant real-life contexts. Likewise, it is necessary to replicate and further examine the effects of the psychosocial interventions in these children, taking into account that this study also has some limitations. The majority of them have been mentioned already, such as the participation of parents and teachers as agents and evaluators of the intervention, the small size of the sample, the solely community nature of the sample, the lack of another type of intervention in the control group, and the use of only the combined subtype, which limits any possible generalization to other subgroups or to children in clinical remission. As there was no follow-up evaluation, we do not have any evidence that the improvement obtained in EF persisted once the intervention was over. However, as we are dealing with a severe and, in many cases, persistent disorder, it would not be realistic to think that a brief treatment, even in natural contexts, could provide the solution. All the evidence indicates that, as with other diseases (e.g., asthma), an appropriate strategy would consist of maintaining effective multicontextual treatments over time.</p>
