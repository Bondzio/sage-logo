<abstract>
<p>During the Spanish transition to democracy, media liberalization mostly affected newspapers and magazines. As for news agencies, the official Efe, founded in 1939, was favored by both dictatorial and democratic governments, which considered it as a strategic instrument to support dictatorship or foster democracy depending on the historical context. Europa Press, a private news agency founded in 1957, became its main competitor and earned high reputation by taking advantage of the news stories that Efe did not dare to cover because of its political ties. The Minister of Information attempted to close down the agency but he finally was dismissed due to internal political struggles. The situation, however, did not change either during the transition to democracy (1975–82) or the first Socialist government (1982–86). In both periods, the ruling parties boosted Efe through different means and sought the economic suffocation of Europa Press. Based on documents from the archive of Antonio Herrero, director of Europa Press between 1964 and 1989, this article analyzes the most significant episodes of government pressures on this agency and the arguments used to justify them. Conclusions on the relationship between news agencies and the State in processes of transition to democracy are also reached.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Press freedom experienced deep changes in Spain after the death of General Franco in November 1975, when democratization started. One of the main consequences was the gradual disappearance of government control over the media, a subject that has been extensively studied. Less attention has been paid, however, to the main news suppliers: the news agencies. Surprisingly, both dictatorial and democratic governments attempted to silence the voice of the main private news agency, Europa Press, through different means.</p>
<p>Media liberalization was not complete in Spain during the transition to democracy. It first affected newspapers and magazines. A new Press and Printing Law, enacted in 1966, had already granted some limited margins of freedom to newspapers and magazines, such that, after the death of Franco, journalists were somehow allowed to write more freely. Radio news services, however, remained under government control until October 1977, which was three months after the first free general elections. Private television channels started to broadcast in 1990. Although Article 20 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 recognized the “right to freely communicate or receive truthful information by any means of dissemination whatsoever,” an examination of what happened in the different media outlets will bring us a more accurate, detailed view of the difficulties encountered to reach that goal.</p>
<p>With regard to news agencies, the state-run Efe was created at the end of the civil war in 1939, and was then granted the monopoly on foreign and domestic news. According to its founding principles, its mission was to serve as a vehicle “to spread the Spanish truth all over the world and provide international news to Spain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212474306">Olmos 1997</xref>: 85).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161212474306">1</xref></sup> It was often used as an efficient instrument to distribute news, articles, and reports to the press, especially during World War II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161212474306">Fernández Areal 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212474306">Olmos 1997</xref>). Although the State initially owned only one-third of the capital, its management was in the hands of the Ministry of Press and Propaganda, which was also in charge of staff appointments.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent liberalization that occurred in the 1960s in the Spanish print media, Efe turned into a mostly state-owned company. Article 48 of the new press law of 1966 established the possibility of granting a monopoly on international news to “a national agency with representation of public entities and printed media.” This requirement exactly matched the capital composition of Efe, which since 1965 was divided into three equal parts: two public entities (<italic>Instituto Nacional de Industria</italic> and <italic>Patrimonio Nacional del Estado</italic>) and several Spanish newspapers in a cooperative regime. A subsequent decree in September 1966 actually granted Efe this exclusive right. Together with this measure, abundant resources from the public budget helped the official agency to develop. This line of behavior would continue after Franco’s death and meant unfair competition to the smaller private agencies existing at the time.</p>
<p>The creation of Europa Press took place in this context. Founded in 1957 as a book distribution company by a group of five monarchist politicians, Europa Press turned into a news agency as soon as the new press law in 1966 permitted it. Since then, stories of Europa Press and Efe intertwined for many years, as the former soon became the most outstanding and influential private news agency in Spain trying to compete with the powerful and officially protected Efe. If Europa Press promoters had thought that Efe’s privileged situation would end with the advent of democracy, they were wrong. Efe continued to be favored by centrist and socialist governments, whereas Europa Press would be the object of new and more sophisticated measures and threats. On more than one occasion, Europa Press was closed to being shut down.</p>
<p>The findings of this case may contribute to a better understanding of the internal mechanisms by which Franco’s dictatorship managed the limited liberalization of the press in the late-1960s and early-1970s. They will also shed some light on the uncertainties affecting the exercise of freedom of the press during the Spanish transition to democracy, especially in media outlets under state control. It therefore intends to provide new knowledge in the field of media and politics, particularly in transitional contexts. The political economy of the media, though predominant in many studies on news agencies, is not our main focus. This study belongs to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett (2000)</xref> labeled as “official, semi-official or non-official histories by academics and others with privileged or negotiated access to agencies” (pp. 11–12). It also tries to clarify the issue he raised on “curiosity and suspicion about ‘hidden hands’ at work behind news agencies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett 2000</xref>: 11–12).</p>
<p>The relationship between news agencies and the State has for a long time been and still is a complex issue. In this sense, the case of Spain provides additional value from the perspective of the competition between a semiofficial, state-run national news agency and an emerging aggressive smaller private one. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen (1998)</xref> wrote that many times “the state has strong interests in news transmission, both domestically and internationally, and these become especially visible in times of national and international crisis which are a threat to the state itself” (p. 104). Those were precisely the circumstances Spain was in, during both the Franco’s regime and the transition to democracy. The uniqueness of this case study, especially due to the significant presence of private news agencies, will be discussed in light of the current literature. Implications for international comparative research on press and politics will also be highlighted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1940161212474306">
<title>First Attempt to Close Europa Press during Franco’s Dictatorship</title>
<p>A press law in force since the beginning of the dictatorship had introduced censorship, orders to editors, government appointment of editors, licenses for newspaper publishers, and control of access to the profession of journalism. It was basically inspired by the Italian fascist model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212474306">Barrera 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161212474306">Sinova 1989</xref>). There was hardly room for pluralism, as its preamble stated, “It is inadmissible that the press can exist outside the State. The press must always serve the national interest.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161212474306">2</xref></sup> No specific rules were given in the field of news agencies, but politicians in charge of press and propaganda soon took the lead and created Efe in January 1939 as a political instrument of the State. A 1938 document that served as the basis for its foundation explained that Spain had been defeated “in propaganda war in spite of its military victory” in the civil war, hence the necessity “to excite and obtain external benevolences and sympathies” against “the leftist propaganda network” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212474306">Kim 1989</xref>: 30).</p>
<p>Most of Efe’s capital (almost 60 percent), however, was initially in hands of the seven most important banks, other industrial companies, several newspapers, and more than two-hundred individuals. They all received an official invitation to participate, which was obviously interpreted as an obligation. For this reason, despite its privately run ownership structure, the agency depended entirely on the government. Three of the six members of the board of directors were appointed according to the procedures established by the press law for newspaper editors. It could be regarded as a “semiofficial” agency, and its founders indeed preferred to call it as such.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161212474306">3</xref></sup> The founding document of Efe referred to itself as an “independent and mercantile” agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212474306">Kim 1989</xref>: 32), and, strictly speaking, that was its nature. More than two decades later, however, in April 1963, the new Minister of Information and Tourism since 1962, Manuel Fraga, decided to increase the participation of the State up to two-thirds of the capital.</p>
<p>On their part, new shareholders joined Europa Press in 1965 through two increases in capital aimed at strengthening the company for future growth. The Spanish news agency signed a contract with the Associated Press (AP) for the distribution of its photo service in Spain starting in August 1965. Only United Press International (UPI) had another similar worldwide service that was distributed by Efe since a contract was signed between the two agencies in 1945 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161212474306">Schulte 1968</xref>). The agreement of 1965 between Europa Press and AP meant the end of Efe’s monopoly on the distribution of foreign photos in Spain. It also constituted a good source of profit for Europa Press, as many Spanish newspapers became subscribers to the service.</p>
<p>The 1966 press law encouraged Europa Press owners and managers to take an important step: writing and selling news to newspapers and magazines but not in the same way as Efe did.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1940161212474306">4</xref></sup> The latter was difficult to do because Europa Press lacked the means to organize such an infrastructure of journalists throughout the country. Antonio Herrero, director of Europa Press since 1964, described it with these words: “We wanted to provide the newspapers with information they longed for and did not have. This would be initially restricted to half a dozen topics. Another matter was how to achieve accuracy and style in news writing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212474306">Apezarena 2011</xref>: 114). According to his analysis, there was a large market for future clients: more than one-hundred newspapers, forty-four of them belonging to the official network; correspondents of foreign newspapers; and finally <italic>Radio Nacional de España</italic> and <italic>Televisión Española</italic>, the state-run radio and television networks, respectively, which were the only authorized to broadcast news.</p>
<p>Apart from the official Efe, other competitors were Logos, a news agency mainly serving some Catholic-run newspapers, although it reached twenty-seven subscribers, and Mencheta, specialized in local news and sport coverage. On its part, Pyresa served the forty-four state-owned newspapers, the so-called “<italic>Prensa del Movimiento</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212474306">Paz 1989</xref>: 354–56). Given this landscape, the way to catch the attention of newspapers focused, as Herrero wrote, on “going ahead and offering them something more useful, cheaper, and less dangerous through coverage of topics that, should they manage them, could lead them to unpleasant situations with the government” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212474306">Apezarena 2011</xref>: 115). So Europa Press adopted a risky policy that took advantage of the broader but still vaguely defined margins of press freedom to offer stories about topics that Efe could not deal with because of its political ties. A close collaborator of Herrero explained it this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Antonio knew Efe in depth. There were two matters of vital importance that Efe did not cover: university and labor unions, fields where opposition to Francoism was more active. He filled this gap and focused on these two topics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1940161212474306">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Newspapers feared the consequences of the new press freedom granted. Thus, to avoid problems of possible fines or disciplinary actions, they usually reported “according to Europa Press,” an expression that became successful. Agency reporters had valuable and reliable news sources to cover these events to such an extent that the police themselves obtained information for their own purposes by tapping Europa Press telephones.</p>
<p>Only two months after starting the news service, Antonio Herrero wrote an internal report summarizing the experience and highlighting two difficulties that would remain in the years to come: Efe’s exclusivity on the news from public administration offices, and the fact that “newspapers publish from Europa Press only potentially conflicting news reports,” which led to some distortion about its news service as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1940161212474306">6</xref></sup> In October 1966, the vice editor of the most important Catalan daily newspaper warned Herrero that “the highest [person] in Madrid has talked to the highest [position] in this house to ask him not to publish news from Europa Press.” Other newspaper editors also wrote or phoned Herrero with similar messages. The correspondent of <italic>Le Monde</italic> talked to him about the threats that a regional editor had received from the director of Efe who tried to convince him not to subscribe to Europa Press: “The editor replied him that Efe was useful for official news but if he wanted real news, Europa was indispensable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212474306">Apezarena 2011</xref>: 130–31).</p>
<p>February 1967 marked the beginning of the first wave of disciplinary actions against the agency. Herrero faced seven administrative disciplinary proceedings in sixteen months. According to the new press law, three gross misconducts in one year signified perpetual disqualification as an editor. These proceedings were often used as weapons to control the policy of newspapers, magazines, and agencies. A report—with no author but very probably written by some civil servant—denounced:
<disp-quote>
<p>Europa Press domestic news service pays preferential or almost exclusive attention to any sort of student protests, industrial disputes, agricultural crises, etc.; topics that have turned it into a specialized agency . . . In general, news gathered and disseminated by Europa Press captures the version of the events offered by the promoters of incidents and conflicts . . . The agency also distributes its collection of negative news to foreign agencies’ bureaus in Madrid; as a consequence many foreign newspapers make those news their own and tend to show a distorted or false outlook of the situation in Spain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1940161212474306">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Antonio Herrero wrote an internal report in October 1968 as a situation assessment after more than two years of limited press freedom. An epigraph titled “Pressures on Europa Press” specified four main types of pressure: exclusion from public subsidies granted to other agencies, prohibition on public radio and television broadcasters to subscribe to the Europa Press news service, a similar order sent to the approximately forty official newspapers, and finally, “direct pressure exerted on private newspapers by the Ministry of Information to cancel their contracts with the agency.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1940161212474306">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This increasing harassment had its peak during the first months of 1969, coinciding with the declaration of the state of emergency in the entire country because of the conflicts with students and workers, and the emergence of the Basque terrorist group ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna [Basque Country and Freedom]). Taking advantage of the temporary restoration of censorship, some official newspapers blamed other private media outlets for helping those subversive movements because of their “obsession for publishing everything that was earlier prohibited” and presenting “always a catastrophic outlook of reality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212474306">Barrera 1995</xref>: 102). No reply could be given to these accusations until the end of the emergency. Meanwhile, the Minister of Information Manuel Fraga tried to close Europa Press through a shrewd combination of pressures on newspapers and majority shareholders, that is, by attacking directly the capital and the main sources of revenues.</p>
<p>Newspapers were told not to publish news from Europa Press on pain of delaying their distribution for several hours and/or canceling the subsidy for consumption of national newsprint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1940161212474306">9</xref></sup> The chief executive officer (CEO) of Europa Press remembers: “Fraga called me and announced that it was his intention to close Europa Press.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1940161212474306">10</xref></sup> During those days, Herrero received many letters from newspaper editors containing all kinds of “excuses” to cancel their subscriptions. Only a few of them dared to disobey the Ministry and continued to pay every month. The objective was the economic suffocation of the company. In fact, Europa Press came to face the dilemma: to accept the Ministry’s proposal of joining Efe or to close the agency. During the most strained moments under these political pressures, Herrero organized a vote among his reporters to know their positions, and a vast majority opted for resistance despite the danger of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>The director of Europa Press recalls the humiliating conditions that the Ministry wanted to impose during the negotiations:
<disp-quote>
<p>They preferred to avoid public controversy. Among the solutions proposed were: the closure of the news service but continuation of the others; some temporary “holidays” for the director; the appointment of a government delegate who would exert censorship and talked to anyone in the newsroom except me.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1940161212474306">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After government pressure, the savings banks incorporated as shareholders in 1965 decided to withdraw their capital by selling the same to the main shareholder, Francisco Heredia, whose personal contacts with some of Franco’s ministers led him to ask them for help. Following the recommendation of one of these ministers, he wrote a letter to the Vice President, Admiral Luis Carrero, denouncing Fraga’s unfair use of the state of emergency to persecute Europa Press for his own political benefit, and seeking protection in Carrero’s statement to justify the emergency declaration: “Any honest and peaceful man wishing to live under the rule of the law will not be disturbed because of this exceptional situation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1940161212474306">12</xref></sup> Surprisingly, Carrero read it (Heredia cleverly introduced himself as the son of a military man who died during the civil war fighting with Franco’s troops), and Franco cleared up the matter with an order to stop the persecution. This is Heredia’s account of what happened later:
<disp-quote>
<p>Fraga met me in his office. He was stood up, very nervous on the other side of the table. He showed me Carrero’s letter and read it: “The chief of State has ordered you not to take any action that, taking advantage of the state of emergency, could go against Europa Press legitimate interests.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1940161212474306">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This way the first serious attempt to stop the development of Europa Press came to an end. The emergency state was lifted in March 1969. Only seven months later, Fraga resigned as minister. Internal struggles and disagreements among different political sectors within the regime obliged Franco to change his government. Carrero convinced the Chief of State to dismiss Fraga by arguing that the Minister of Information had shown an aggressive behavior against some newspapers and other media outlets that he considered linked to the technocratic ministers, who were his main political adversaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161212474306">Fraga 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of owners, managers, and editors of those media outlets were members of Opus Dei, an institution of the Catholic Church, as well as ministers in Franco’s government. Fraga and the Falangist sectors thought that they all shared the same political ideas and strategies to become increasingly influential in the Spain of Franco. This misconception, together with the fact that Europa Press escaped from Fraga’s attempts to control the news flow, led the minister to persecute and punish the agency, as he did with other newspapers as well. He believed that this strategy would undermine the growing power of technocrats that negatively affected his and the Falangists’ political interest. In the end, this arbitrary conduct was meant to deny autonomy and professional freedom to those media outlets and their journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161212474306">Barrera 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1940161212474306">
<title>A “State Matter” against Free Competition</title>
<p>Europa Press was again on the verge of being closed due to government pressures between 1979 and 1981, already after Franco’s death and with a democratic constitution ruling the country. Despite the liberalization of print media, the State seemed to continue to manage Efe as an instrument. During the transition to democracy (1975–82), the agency’s budget was to a great extent covered by public funds. This way centrist governments contributed to sustain and expand Efe all over the world. Luis María Anson, the new president–editor named in September 1976, recently remembered the context in which he was called to guide the agency: “Efe was the only instrument that we had to tell the truth and say to the world that here we wanted to build a real democracy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161212474306">Forcada and Lardiés 2010</xref>: 209).</p>
<p>Efe was used to foster the image of a New Spain and increase its international credibility: In sum, similar to “patriotic” goals as those established in 1939, this is to serve Spain’s political interests, but in the context of democratic changes. Although Article 20 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 stated that “the law shall regulate the organization and parliamentary control of the mass communication means under the control of the State or any public agency,” no specific regulations were issued for Efe despite several requests from the opposition parties claiming to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Anson gave a boost to the agency: a new huge headquarters building in Madrid, the introduction of computers in the newsroom, and the opening of new bureaus in many countries of the world so that they turned into a sort of diplomatic venue to represent Spain’s interests. As has been written, “According to Anson, Efe’s bureaus were a sort of Spanish ‘journalistic embassies’ because their editors-in-chief, like the ambassadors, should devote time to public relations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212474306">Olmos 1997</xref>: 437) with politicians, newspaper editors, and other personalities. Efe bought a number of buildings, some of them possessing high artistic value, in Spanish and foreign cities: a total of twenty-one “property movements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212474306">Kim 1989</xref>: 154).</p>
<p>Anson also changed the nature of the financial relationship with the State. Instead of public subsidies, as from 1978, Efe received an annual amount of money as a “service agreement”: 1,000 million pesetas that year, which became 1,800 million in 1982. Anson explained it this way: “Efe provided services to distribute Spanish news and, especially, those on government activities all over the world: coverage of trips made by the King, the prime minister, other ministers, etc.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161212474306">Forcada and Lardiés 2010</xref>: 215). As majority shares continued to belong to the State, Efe’s budget did not have the problems that other private news agencies had to face. Its capital actually increased from 50 million pesetas in 1977 to 800 in 1981. As a result of this official support, “it became definitely number 5 among the Western agencies, only after the ‘Big 4’: AP, UPI, Reuters, and AFP” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161212474306">Kim 1989</xref>: 135).</p>
<p>As some authors wrote, monopoly on foreign news “had been sufficient for Efe to sign numerous contracts with foreign agencies and Spanish newspapers, and that meant an important obstacle for the development of other private agencies like Europa Press” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212474306">Fernández and Santana 2000</xref>: 87). Despite abundant economic resources available, Anson adopted a belligerent attitude against its main competitor, Europa Press, through different means. In November 1979, Efe signed an agreement with AP for the distribution of its photo service in Spain as from June 1980. Since 1965, Europa Press had been the sole distributor, whereas Efe had contracted the UPI photo service, which also remained in its hands with the renewal of the agreement between both agencies in December 1979.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Efe obtained a de facto monopoly on photo world services, and Europa Press was stripped of a crucial source of profits. The business manager of Europa Press remembers that the 1965 agreement with AP was possible partially because Stanley M. Swinton, who became vice president and director for world services, was fed up with the dictatorship and had many struggles with Fraga. The man who replaced him, however, was moved only by economic reasons, and Efe’s offer was triple the amount that Europa paid.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1940161212474306">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The owners and managers of Europa Press protested against what they considered unfair competition. Europa paid $4,500 monthly, whereas Efe contracted the service for $15,000: an “exorbitant offer,” as a historian described it some years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212474306">Alférez 1986</xref>: 199). Efe knew that its main competitor was not economically viable without this service. Antonio Herrero got in touch with Anson several times to discourage him from carrying out that operation or, at least, to solve the problem created for Europa Press and its personnel working in that department. He tried to convince Anson by arguing that Efe’s monopoly on photo services would be the only case in Western Europe, and the only beneficiary would be AP. He also pointed out that even Fraga, during the dictatorship, did not dare to go so far. In a letter to Anson, he wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>There is no any news agency in free Europe monopolizing both news and photo service . . . because, among other reasons, that situation would be considered as a political, commercial and ethical outrage. Only Eastern Socialist Republics accept that system for obvious reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1940161212474306">15</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This argument appeared to be logical and understandable in a period when Spain was moving toward press freedom. However, Anson replied to him:
<disp-quote>
<p>Things like this happen in any pluralistic democracy with free competition. Associated Press was simply dissatisfied with its relationship with Europa Press and, spontaneously, has decided to cancel a contract and offer its service to other agency. That’s all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1940161212474306">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his answer before a commission of the Spanish Parliament, Anson argued that UPI was undergoing economic difficulties so that its hypothetical closure could mean that Efe would not have a world photo service for its clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161212474306">Olmos 1997</xref>). Herrero’s detailed account of the negotiations between both agencies refuted this explanation: “Anson’s proposal to AP is not related to UPI’s financial situation since it was done in 1978 when he had not any idea that, two years later, UPI would be in a precarious situation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1940161212474306">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The president of Europa Press, José-Mario Armero, wrote a letter to various congressmen on the eve of the state budget debate. He insisted on putting forward political arguments to accuse the official agency:
<disp-quote>
<p>Efe makes use of public funds and takes unfair advantage of its privileged public status to violate fundamental rights recognized by the Constitution. Out of control from Government and Parliament, Efe has got the monopoly on international photo services simply by paying more. Moreover, it maintains monopoly on news from foreign agencies. These accumulated monopolies did not happen even during the dictatorship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1940161212474306">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Europa Press managers tried to convince the government to stop Anson’s intentions. The calculations made actually indicated that the reduction in incomes due to this new situation would put Europa Press on the brink of closure. A high civil servant told the president of Europa Press that the contract with AP was “a State matter,” as were other operations carried out by the agency, and therefore was untouchable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1940161212474306">19</xref></sup> Anson also specified that the agreement allowed Efe to send four photographs that would be included in the AP photo service sent to all its subscribers. Herrero, an experienced news agency journalist, did not take this point seriously, because he wrote, “American agencies usually make such promises to all their state-run agencies which are clients, but do not fulfill them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1940161212474306">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>By way of compensation, Efe was disposed to take on the thirty-six workers that Europa Press would have to lay off after closing its photo service, and buy its photographic archives to the value of fifty million pesetas. There were still some economic loose ends left to completely fulfill the agreement, so a number of meetings were organized to solve those problems. The editor, Antonio Herrero, summarized an encounter he had in February 1982 with the Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo:
<disp-quote>
<p>Europa Press, Ltd. expresses once again that it has been seriously damaged due to unfair competition of other media outlets which have been subsidized with funds coming from taxpayers and have acted with impunity during the term of office of the ruling party. The administration still has not adopted the appropriate provisions to solve it. This situation, however, has not influenced and will not influence our news policy in spite of the grave situation created for the survival and stability of the company.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1940161212474306">21</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some background is necessary to understand why Anson’s Efe bore a grudge against Europa Press. This private agency had gained a notable reputation during the late-Francoism by providing important scoops, including the death of General Franco in the early hours of the morning of November 20, 1975. Its rates were higher than Efe’s, but newspapers paid them because they recognized the additional value that Europa Press news services often offered. Since the beginning of his term of office, Anson boosted an aggressive policy based on the main message that Europa Press was not a real competitor because Efe beat it in all fields. Facts show, however, that he made important efforts to weaken his main rival by means other than fair competition.</p>
<p>Discussions on the money received according to the service agreement for 1981 (1,250 million pesetas) were closely scrutinized and followed by Antonio Herrero, as the episode with AP was very recent. In some internal reports, he criticized how the government disguised the subsidy during the processing of the State budget. One of his main arguments lay on the fact that if Efe had been organized to avoid news colonialism from foreign agencies, agreements for buying services of all main foreign agencies were nonsense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1940161212474306">22</xref></sup> In 1981, approximately two-thirds of Efe income came from the service agreement with the State and only one-third from other clients such as newspapers and other states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161212474306">Fernández and Santana 2000</xref>). This inadequacy between the expected incomes derived from Efe’s worldwide expansion and the actual figures was often an object of controversy.</p>
<p>Another point of discussion was related to a possible case of “espionage.” Since the beginning of the term of office of Luis María Anson, there were suspicions that Efe somehow knew the news transmitted by Europa Press because some of its scoops also appeared in the rival agency’s service. Suspicion became certainty as Efe reporters told about it in the day-to-day work, in places where they met their colleagues from Europa Press. Antonio Herrero kept one file folder in his archive titled “The Mysterious Europa Press Teletypewriter in Efe.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212474306">Apezarena (2011)</xref>,
<disp-quote>
<p>More details were gradually known: the device was hidden in a piece of furniture, and Efe reporters sometimes could see a clipping in the hand of an editor in chief who asked a reporter for a story that he had not published. As the color of the paper containing the copy of the Europa Press teletypewriter was yellow, Efe reporters called those clippings “the yellow fever.” (p. 669)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This episode represented more than a mere anecdote, because Europa Press based its reputation on two characteristics greatly appreciated by many newspapers: speed and exclusivity to be the first to distribute the stories. Sometimes, its reporters checked espionage by inserting small misprints in unimportant details, such as the spelling of a surname or a number within a large figure. If Efe reproduced the same error, the reporters were convinced that this practice was common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161212474306">Grijelmo 1997</xref>). However, they lacked conclusive evidence. This evidence would emerge only on the replacement of Anson by Ricardo Utrilla as Efe director in 1983, already in the first steps of the new Socialist government. The senior editor of national news, Manuel R. Mora, wrote a letter to Antonio Herrero affirming the existence of the teletypewriter and assuring him that he had never used it because he defended “fair competition.” He considered himself “very respectful of Europa Press and you from a professional perspective” and declared that his only ambition was to “offer an honorable news service.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1940161212474306">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>A few days later, José-Mario Armero, president of Europa Press, wrote to his counterpart at Efe, Ricardo Utrilla, informing him of these events. Utrilla answered him, recognizing that “it seems to be certain that there was a teletypewriter of Europa Press in Efe since four or five years ago that was used not only to control news but also as news source.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1940161212474306">24</xref></sup> He added that the device was successively addressed to two Catalan newspapers whose correspondent received the subscription rates later. He also indicated that the news agency staff had eliminated the pirated teletypewriter.</p>
<p>News about the espionage devices appeared in many Spanish newspapers. The only one that defended that practice was <italic>ABC</italic>, whose editor since February 1983 was Luis María Anson. He maintained exactly the opposite, accusing Europa Press of practicing plagiarism of Efe through its part-time correspondents working in radio stations and newspapers with direct access to the teletypewriters of Efe. For this reason, he ordered to have access to Europa Press news service to check the suspicion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1940161212474306">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>Attempts by Socialists to Damage and Discredit Europa Press</title>
<p>A new political era came into the Spanish democratic system after the victory of the Socialist Party in the general elections of October 1982. Under this new administration, Europa Press also experienced some government pressures intending to suffocate its voice. A handwritten note found in Antonio Herrero’s archive shows that Europa Press managers discussed the agency’s position with regard to the political context:
<disp-quote>
<p>I ask the company for the guidelines to follow once Socialists are the ruling party. Pepe A. [José-Mario Armero] remains silent (he seems not to have an answer). Paco [Heredia] says that is a very important matter and tells me: “You should continue to get over them as always.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1940161212474306">26</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore, the principal advice consisted in applying the same policy that had allowed Europa Press to survive in troubled times. Despite its being a professional independent news agency, a number of its managers were known to be rather conservative politically, hence the question discussed during that meeting.</p>
<p>A first inconvenience for the agency was the loss of valuable information sources in the public administration as a consequence of the removal of public officers and the lack of closer contacts within the Socialist Party. The new government also worked hard to avoid the countless leaks allowed by the former centrist administration. Some Europa Press reporters who usually produced news from official sources often received messages like this: “From now on, scoops and exclusives are all over” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212474306">Apezarena 2011</xref>: 585). Nevertheless, for experienced journalists, this was merely a small obstacle as they managed to find new trustworthy contacts for their daily work.</p>
<p>Another decision adopted by the Socialist administration had a major impact, because it affected the incomes of Europa Press: that of reducing drastically the number of subscriptions to the <italic>Economic Summary</italic>, a successful newsletter launched in 1970 and distributed among selected clients mainly belonging to the business world and high public offices of the administration. They received confidential and valuable information at expensive rates. Although it initially focused on economic news, politics was gaining ground, especially after the death of Franco in 1975. Other “confidential newsletters” were also created during the transition, taking advantage of the growing press freedom, but the <italic>Economic Summary</italic> continued to be the main reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161212474306">Apezarena 2005</xref>: 85–100).</p>
<p>The external reason for the reduction was economic: to save expenses on unnecessary items in times of crisis. However, the order did not come from the Ministry of Economics and Finance but from Presidency, and it affected all ministries and public organizations, as well as the rest of confidential newsletters existing. According to a public statement released, “News contained in those newsletters is usually published in newspapers, and moreover is many times mediated by personal or group interests of those who own them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1940161212474306">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the cutback was limited to one issue per ministry or organization instead of the two or three that were distributed before in different offices. This decrease in incomes represented a great blow for the economy of Europa Press, although it was even harder for other newsletters without the backing of a solid news company; in fact, many of them closed down. Europa Press reacted and created another newsletter in January 1983, <italic>Report from Spain</italic>, written in English and addressed to foreign companies and businessmen settled down in Spain. This way, new incomes helped lessen the damage caused by the measure.</p>
<p>A stronger ideological reason was behind the government’s attempt to involve Europa Press in a financial scandal: the so-called “Rumasa affair.” On February 23, 1983, the Socialist government decreed the expropriation of Rumasa, a Spanish holding with four-hundred companies and sixty-thousand workers, due to serious accounting irregularities. One month and a half later, police found a hidden storage place inside Rumasa headquarters containing, among other items, a “folder Europa Press.” Those documents were supposed to remain unseen for whatever reasons. The Spanish public television (TVE) and other media outlets echoed the finding of both the secret storage place and the folder. Europa Press had to distribute a press release pointing out that the news agency did not know the existence of that folder and asking for the publication of its content. Europa Press President Armero, in an interview in TVE, ironically said that he was disappointed because there was only one folder when the agency should be so important as to deserve a higher number of folders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212474306">Apezarena 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the release distributed, the agency supposed that the folder would presumably contain either issues of the <italic>Economic Summary</italic> or invoices corresponding to the payments for them (seventeen-thousand pesetas monthly). It added, “Europa Press states that it had not, and has not, any relationship with Rumasa, their banks and companies, unless the supply of the <italic>Economic Summary</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1940161212474306">28</xref></sup> Three days after the finding, the new general administrator of Rumasa appointed by the government made it clear that the “folder Europa Press” only contained issues of the aforementioned newsletter. The controversy, selfishly publicized, came to an end.</p>
<p>The reasons for this harassment came from hypothetical links between Rumasa and Europa Press based on the fact that the main businessman of the holding company was a member of Opus Dei, as were some managers of the news agency. Some public opinion sectors interpreted the expropriation of Rumasa as a warning to the economic and financial establishment as a whole and, at the same time, as a clue to investigate a supposedly secret financing of Opus Dei through Rumasa. In this context, a folder regarding Europa Press nurtured the existence of a conglomerate of companies in which the agency would also be involved. However, facts proved the falseness of these suppositions. Once again, as happened during the late-Francoism, a personal religious commitment (that of some Europa Press managers who were members of Opus Dei) was used as a political weapon to attack the agency’s legitimate professional and commercial interest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1940161212474306" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The case of Europa Press, the most important news agency in Spain after the powerful Efe, is an example of how political interests of any kind, personal or national, prevailed over independent journalism and press freedom, regardless of the type of political system established. Internal fights during the late-Francoism, State reasons during the transition, and ideological prejudices during the first socialist term of office were motives enough to persecute Europa Press and try its economic suffocation or its closure.</p>
<p>Several attempts to stop its growth were carried out by various means: threats at different levels of the company such as managers, shareholders, editors, and reporters. Even information sources and subscribers were subjects of harassment by different governments. The most efficient instruments were precisely those addressed to make the company economically unviable, and they were applied under both dictatorship and democracy. Punishment for infringing the law due to news content could only work while the restrictive press law of 1966 was in force, not in a democracy.</p>
<p>Preferential treatment toward Efe on behalf of dictatorial and democratic governments contributed to minimize the voice of Europa Press. Efe became so important for the national interests that there was never a real intention to provide the official agency with new regulations. It often lacked transparency. Parliament’s control of its management, accounts, and activities was insufficient. The liberalization that operated during the transition to democracy in other media outlets, such as newspapers, magazines, and radio, did not exist in the official news agency, which was allowed to carry out a number of harassment practices against Europa Press with impunity. Moreover, unfair competition was more than obvious regarding legal privileges and economic conditions that Efe enjoyed, unlike the other agencies.</p>
<p>There were also efforts to discredit Europa Press and its professional independence by making allusions to a supposed influence of Opus Dei in its ideological principles, as some of its managers and shareholders belonged to this prelature of the Catholic Church. This argument was used by the Minister Fraga and the Falangist sectors in the late-Francoism, by Luis María Anson as president–editor of Efe between 1976 and 1982, and by the first Socialist government. The influence of Opus Dei in the professional activities of its members has been and still is a controversial issue among historians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161212474306">Barrera 2012</xref>). Antonio Herrero often strongly defended, publicly or in private, the separation between his religious commitment and his professional work as a journalist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161212474306">Apezarena 2011</xref>), and so did other Opus Dei members linked to Europa Press. After a thorough research on Opus Dei all over the world, Reporter John Allen Jr. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161212474306">2005</xref>) wrote as a conclusion:
<disp-quote>
<p>The basic idea is that outside the spiritual guidance and doctrinal formation offered by Opus Dei, the organization has no “agenda,” and its members are completely free to act as they see fit, taking full responsibility for their choices. (p. 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Europa Press, after playing a prominent role in supporting media freedom during the dictatorship, did not receive much public recognition for their efforts later. On the contrary, it had to face unpleasant situations along with some misunderstandings. It was not the only case in the Spanish media landscape of the time. Other newspapers and magazines that also took some risk and somehow defied dictatorship underwent serious financial problems during the transition, and some of them even had to close down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161212474306">Alférez 1986</xref>). As has been often said in Spain, “we wrote better against Franco.”</p>
<p>These episodes are indicative of some significant limitations on press freedom during the Spanish transition to democracy. The obstacles came from both legal norms and de facto policies. The “right to freely communicate or receive truthful information by any means” recognized by the new constitution was not a universal panacea to change long-rooted practices, especially in state-owned media outlets. Public television and Efe news agency were still subjected to political interferences and enjoyed economic privileges well into the 1980s. As also happened in other sectors of the public sphere, such as politics, justice, or economics, authoritarian propensities did not immediately disappear with Franco’s death in 1975. In print media and radio, however, where private ownership prevailed, journalism was able to act as a fourth state. Although the process of media liberalization was ultimately unstoppable, contrasts and discontinuities were still frequent.</p>
<p>As compared with the evolution of news agencies from dictatorship to democracy in other countries or regions of the world, the Spanish case is rather atypical. A great deal of bibliography is referred to either the state-owned or cooperative agencies, which have been and still are the most powerful in terms of newsgathering and distribution. Greater emphasis has been given, from political economy perspectives, to issues such as information flow among countries, the dominant role of the “Big Four” and Third World’s attempts to avoid or diminish their influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161212474306">Mankekar 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161212474306">Richstad and Anderson 1981</xref>). Other authors who have dealt with the role of the media in democratization processes, especially in Eastern European countries, have barely mentioned news agencies in their works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161212474306">Aumente et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161212474306">Gross 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161212474306">Jakubowicz and Sükösd 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161212474306">Voltmer 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the Spanish transition to democracy took place right in the midst of the global controversy about the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO) and the final McBride report, which recommended the strengthening of national news agencies against the growth of the most powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161212474306">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO] 1980</xref>). Due to its size and development, especially in Latin America, Efe was much closer to the Big Four than to those from the developing countries. Spain had actually turned into one of the most prosperous industrialized countries in the world, and perceived itself more as a colonizer than a colonized country in that discussion. Far from the ideologized approach of this report, we have therefore focused on the role of news agencies in democratization processes.</p>
<p>As also happened in print media and radio companies because of their political alignment with Franco, the dictatorship allowed the existence of some private, independent news agencies. Among them, only Europa Press was able to greatly influence public opinion and challenge governments from 1966 onward. The smaller ones were either sold to Efe (Fiel in 1968), obliged to distribute only feature articles, not news stories (Colpisa in 1972), or confined to deal with sport news (Mencheta); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161212474306">Paz 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161212474306">Sánchez-Tabernero 1989</xref>). Pressures from both the government and the official agency were frequent even during the transition to democracy. This case shows the complexity of relationship between the media and the state in a dictatorship when private ownership is allowed and some media outlets are able to challenge political power. Further research can be conducted to explore other similar cases.</p>
<p>As some authors put it, certainly “political transformations, as it shifts from communism to post-communism or from dictatorship to democracy (Spain), subvert old structures and philosophies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen 2000</xref>: 96). This is a valid general principle for national news agencies, including Efe, but it does not take into account the important factor of competition from the private sector. This was a crucial point of difference in comparison with Eastern European countries. Europa Press news agency defied Efe’s quasi monopoly and was often considered as a troublesome enemy during the dictatorship or an obstacle for the expansion of the official agency during the democratization period. Either in dictatorship or in the way to democracy, the official news agency ultimately served as an instrument of state propaganda similarly to the role played by the largest Western news agencies in times of crisis throughout their history.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett (1998)</xref> highlights autonomy as one of the main criteria to establish a framework for comparative-historical analysis of news agencies, along with diversity, location, competition, clients, and technology. He wrote, “According to western news values, news providers which are government or politically controlled are not trustworthy as impartial sources, and are incapacitated to act as effective sources of criticism or scrutiny of government actions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett 1998</xref>: 23). He especially refers to leading global agencies since the nineteenth century, but this argument can also be applied to other historical contexts. Efe’s dependence on government subsidies undermined its credibility in the Spanish domestic market during Franco’s dictatorship and favored private agencies in the eyes of reporters and editors. The same author pointed out that the “need to maximize audiences in order to earn profit and to satisfy patrons, owners and shareholders” can limit the independence of private companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161212474306">Boyd-Barrett 1998</xref>: 23). However, the small size of Europa Press and some constraints on the free market lowered this risk.</p>
<p>The Spanish transition to democracy, often recognized as an exemplary process, had to cope with serious difficulties regarding freedom of media. Among the three sectors where public ownership was strong—daily press, broadcasting, and news agencies—only the latter lacked specific regulation despite the explicit mandate from the 1978 Constitution. Policies favoring state-owned media outlets, adopted by different governments between 1975 and the 1980s, were a legacy of decades of a dictatorship where private companies’ interests were often seen with suspicion and reticence, as Franco had declared in an interview in 1969, referring to them: “Spanish press has fulfilled its critical duties but there have been some people who have made use of press freedom to serve their own spurious interests.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1940161212474306">29</xref></sup> This mentality prevailed for many years beyond Franco’s death: Some traces remained in the legislation on radio and television, and state-owned daily newspapers continued to publish until 1984. Political pressures on Europa Press exerted by democratic governments need to be understood within this historical framework.</p>
<p>To sum up, this case study shows some elements that should be considered as bases for further comparative research on the role of news agencies during transitions to democracy, including but not limited to immediate historical background; legal framework (or lack of it); competition between private and official agencies; autonomy from political and/or economic powers; degree of influence on domestic public opinion; number of employees, bureaus, and clients; and cooperation and exchange agreements with other leading global news agencies. A close examination of these factors may help to define a theoretical framework to analyze differences and/or similarities in transition processes.</p>
