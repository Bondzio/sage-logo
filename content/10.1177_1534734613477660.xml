<abstract>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is characterized by hereditary sensorimotor polyneuropathy with foot deformity, sensorineural hearing loss, moderate developmental delay, and gait disturbance. CMT presenting with type 2 diabetes and an ulcer has not been reported. This article reports a man who presented with the symptoms mentioned above and also with a leg ulcer and type 2 diabetes. He was diagnosed with CMT disease based on family history and genetic testing. A skin defect in the left leg had manifested for more than 1 year, and results of initial fasting plasma glucose revealed type 2 diabetes. The evolution of these manifestations, coupled with a slowly progressive weakness, numbness, muscular wasting, and sensory impairment, strongly suggested the co-occurrence of 3 different diseases in the same individual.</p>

<p>Chronic ulcers are a growing cause of patient morbidity, and in recent years, they have contributed significantly to the cost of health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613477660">1</xref></sup> The most common etiologies of chronic ulcers include arterial or venous leg ulcers, pressure ulcers, and diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers. Some diseases can cause skin hypoesthesia, which can lead to an inability to avoid skin damage and to difficulties in wound healing. Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is a type of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN); patients with this disease also have significant limb numbness. Very few cases of an ulcer caused by CMT disease have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613477660">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613477660">3</xref></sup> The patient reported in this study suffered from CMT disease and type 2 diabetes concurrently. Therefore, limb numbness and wound healing difficulties occurred together.</p>

<title>Case Study</title>
<p>A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on August 3, 2011, due to a skin defect on the left leg that had existed for more than 1 year. One year before that, the man had fallen, and the skin had become slightly swollen and purple without obvious pain or any bleeding. Serial X-rays had demonstrated no abnormalities. Several days later, it had recovered. However, the skin at that position broke after 1 month for no obvious reason. He went to have the dressings changed at the village local health center and was treated with topical creams, but the wound did not heal after the repeat ulceration. For further diagnosis and treatment, he came to our hospital.</p>
<p>An initial examination revealed a 4 × 4 × 2 cm<sup>2</sup> superficial ulcer on the left leg adjacent to the instep, with edema and hyperemia of the adjacent tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613477660">Figure 1</xref>). There was aging granulation and obvious pigmentation around the wound. He had slowly progressive weakness, numbness, muscular wasting, and sensory impairment predominantly involving the distal legs that had developed over the previous 30 years, and he had a family history of similar symptoms and signs. His grandfather, mother, a brother, and a niece suffered from CMT disease.</p>

</fig>
<p>A neurological examination revealed normal cranial nerves and ophthalmoscopic findings. Examination at that time revealed that his temperature was 37.1°C and that he had a chronic ulcer on the left leg with pigmentation on the external aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613477660">Figure 1</xref>). Both lower extremities had an inverted bottle-shape, and the muscles were atrophied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613477660">Figure 2</xref>). The tendon reflexes were absent in both the upper and lower limbs, and sensory testing showed deficits in all primary modalities distally in the lower limbs to the mid-calf level. He showed steppage gait. Apparent hypoesthesia was observed in the distal legs and feet. The thenar eminence and hypothenar in both hands were also atrophied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613477660">Figure 2</xref>). CMT-II was strongly suspected in this patient with distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, and marked slowing of nerve conduction velocity. Genetic testing and a family history confirmed the diagnosis.</p>

</fig>
<p>Basic investigations revealed a normal complete blood count, B12 levels, and negative VDRL and HIV tests. The results of electromyography and nerve conduction velocity tests showed neurogenic damage and a significant reduction in the conduction velocity of the median nerve. The initial fasting plasma glucose was 7.53 mmol/L and the HbA1c levels 11.4%. The patient had evidence of microalbuminuria (0.3 g/L) and diabetic perineuropathy (increased vibration perception thresholds) but no obvious diabetic retinopathy. He had no family history of type 2 diabetes and no obvious symptoms, such as polydipsia, polyphagia, or polyuria. The patient took Glucophage (metformin) for treatment of diabetes since the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed. Insulin therapy was given in the perioperative period. On 6 August, with no signs of peripheral vascular disease, the patient underwent wound debridement and a skin graft operation, followed by topical negative-pressure wound therapy. He was then administered with anti-infective intravenous therapy and oral treatments of vitamins B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>12</sub>. Four days after the operation, the dressings were opened, and the meshed skin graft healed uneventfully. On 22 August, the patient was cured and discharged.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This patient presented with a 1-year history of a nonhealing ulcer secondary to a previously undetected sensory polyneuropathy (ie, neuropathic or decubitus ulcer). The major differential diagnoses in this case are tabes dorsalis, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia myelopathy, alcoholism, leprosy, HIV, familial interstitial hypertrophic polyneuropathy, and CMTD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613477660">4</xref></sup> The definition of an ulcer is a break in the skin lasting longer than 6 weeks or with frequent recurrence. From an etiologic perspective, comorbid conditions that have a significant impact on patient morbidity should be identified. Many diseases can cause the skin defect mentioned above, and they should be distinguished from the concurrent diseases that were present. The hematologic and pathological examinations revealed a possible diagnosis of CMT disease with diabetes.</p>
<p>CMT disease is a type of HMSN that is classified into types I, II, and III. The current classification is based on the type of neuropathy, which may be demyelinating or axonal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613477660">5</xref></sup> Types I and II are generally autosomal dominant. CMT-I is a demyelinating or hypertrophic form of the disease characterized by progressive peripheral neuropathy. It presents with muscular atrophy of the legs and feet, and later involves the hands, with the peak onset generally occurring within the first 2 decades of life. CMT1A is the most common variant, with a prevalence of 1 in 5000. CMT1A causes a combined motor and sensory neuropathy. Onset is typically in childhood; patients show distal weakness and sensory loss, develop foot deformities, but generally remain ambulant and have a normal life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613477660">3</xref></sup> CMT-II is a neuronal form of the disease that shows delayed onset and less severe weakness than type I. Type II is an axonal disorder, not a demyelinating disorder. Inheritance in most cases of HMSN I and II shows autosomal dominance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613477660">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613477660">7</xref></sup> Orthopedic manifestations in HMSN include cavovarus, scoliosis, and recurrent dislocation of the patella, in addition to findings in the hands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613477660">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613477660"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613477660"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613477660"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613477660">11</xref></sup> In our patient, tendon reflexes were absent bilaterally, and sensory deficits in all primary modalities in the lower limbs and an early onset age were noted, which is similar to the examination findings of CMTD type 2.</p>
<p>The CMT diseases are genetically heterogeneous, with more than 40 loci that have been mapped to different chromosomes and more than 27 causative genes analyzed to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613477660">12</xref></sup> Thus far, 3 modes of inheritance have been described: autosomal dominant, X-linked dominant (CMTX), and autosomal recessive with dominant forms are preponderant in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613477660">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613477660">14</xref></sup> In this patient’s family, his grandfather, mother, a brother, and a niece suffered from this disease, as shown in a genetic map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613477660">Figure 3</xref>). The map indicates that the inheritance patterns may be autosomal recessive.</p>

<p>Neurophysiological testing indicated demyelinating polyneuropathy of uncertain etiology, with only the peripheral nerve myelin affected,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613477660">15</xref></sup> and BAEP testing indicated clearly abnormal changes. The patient suffered from CMT disease and type 2 diabetes concurrently. Posttraumatic healing difficulties occurred in this patient due to leg hypoesthesia, diabetes, or both. It is possible that there are some links between these 2 diseases. Diabetes would definitely cause vascular disease and skin ulcers, such as diabetic foot. The most important factors related to the development of foot ulcers with diabetes are peripheral neuropathy, minor foot trauma, foot deformity, and decreased tissue perfusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613477660">16</xref></sup> The vascular lesions resulting from diabetes are another factor that can lead to insufficient blood supply. Associated inflammation factors include MMP-9, PTP1B, and aberrant growth factor, which are the main factors associated with the formation of a diabetic foot ulcer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734613477660">17</xref></sup> However, in this case, there was no vascular change or that could have caused the abnormal expression of inflammation factors, which in turn might have triggered the formation of skin ulcers. Therefore, the peripheral neuropathy may be the initial factor of this leg ulcer, which could be caused by either or both of the 2 diseases.</p>
<p>The typical signs and family history are the most characteristic differences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613477660">2</xref></sup> Diabetic mellitus would lead to a neuropathy called diabetic neuropathy, which is a neurological complication of diabetes. A typical example is a mitochondrial phenotype, which causes a distal dying-back neurodegenerative process and results in abnormal sensory neurons. Hyperglycemia in diabetes triggers nutrient excess in neurons that mediates a phenotypic change in mitochondrial biology and causes deleterious alterations in expression and abnormal activity of the respiratory chain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734613477660">18</xref></sup> CMT2 is a distal axonal degenerative disease, and almost one third of cases have been linked to mutations in the GTPase and mitochondrial fusion protein, mitofusin II (MFN2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734613477660">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734613477660">20</xref></sup> The role of MFN2 in mediating transport appears to be discrete from its regulation of mitochondrial fusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734613477660">21</xref></sup> A series of studies has demonstrated that overexpression of mutant MFN2 in sensory neurons resulted in a distal-disruption neuropathy. This neuropathy could present in patients primarily as motor dysfunction or motor dysfunction accompanied by prominent proprioception loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734613477660">22</xref></sup> Numerous studies investigating peripheral nerve function in diabetic animals have shown that axonal transport defects were due to altered levels and impaired axonal transport of proteins, whereas the actual transport rates were unaffected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734613477660">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734613477660"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734613477660">25</xref></sup> Therefore, diabetes could exacerbate CMT disease. As the development of CMT disease occurs with amyotrophy and dyskinesia, hyperglycemia would be aggravated for unusual synthesis and storage of muscle glycogen. Sensory neuropathy is associated with a reduction in the sensation of pain, pressure, temperature, and proprioception. Due to the lack of protective sensations, the foot is vulnerable to unattended minor injuries caused by excess pressure or mechanical or thermal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613477660">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734613477660">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several inflammatory, immune-mediated disorders that target the myelin sheaths of peripheral nerves. CMT disease is a hereditary neuropathy with pathological changes, including segmental demyelination and remyelination, onion-like formation, and axonal degeneration. Some researchers have reported sural-nerve and calf-muscle biopsies suggesting the infiltration of obviously inflammatory cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734613477660">27</xref></sup> Other studies have reported that some pathological changes can also be observed in skin biopsies from patients with demyelinating or inflammatory neuropathies in CMT disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734613477660">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734613477660"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534734613477660">30</xref></sup> The delayed occurrence of wounds after trauma was thought to be due to the infiltration of chronic inflammation from the muscle to the skin. The persistence of inflammation in the wound bed is due to fresh granulation, which cannot grow and expand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534734613477660" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As discussed above, there is a detrimental synergism between diabetes and CMT disease, both of which contribute to skin ulcers. The concurrent presence of these 2 diseases in the patient makes him vulnerable to other diseases. Apparently, 3 different factors led to the unhealed skin ulcer, but the combination of these diseases resulted in a complex set of symptoms. Once the surgeon addressed the sensory disturbances of the chronic wounds, the possible coexistence of these diseases was more evident.</p>
