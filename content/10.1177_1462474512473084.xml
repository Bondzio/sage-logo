<sec id="sec1-1462474512473084"><title>Dario Melossi, Mazimo Sozzo and Richard Sparks (eds), <italic>Travels of the Criminal Question: Cultural Embeddedness and Diffusion</italic>, Hart: Oxford and Portland, OR, 2011; 223 pp. (including index): 9781849460774</title>
<p>Melossi et al.’s edited collection, <italic>Travels of the Criminal Question</italic>, seeks to explore questions relating to cultural embeddedness, translation, translocation and diffusion as they relate to primarily penal matters. In particular, the text examines the way in which criminal discourses and practices travel and sometimes take root in previously ‘alien’ contexts. The ‘criminal question’ in the title is borrowed from a 1970's journal <italic>La questione criminale</italic> and later work of critical criminologist, Tamar Pitch, which drew attention to the role of culture in its construction. The collection is the product of a workshop, ‘Discourses and practices of crime and punishment: The question of cultural embeddedness and travels’, hosted by the Onati International Institute for the Sociology of Law in 2003 and convened by the editors themselves.</p>
<p>The book is broken into three parts, each dealing with one aspect of the embeddedness/diffusion theme. These are, respectively: the cultural embeddedness of punishment; diffusion of post-Fordist penality; and travels of discourses of criminology and crime prevention. The first section, with contributions from Garland, Melossi and Nelken, will likely hold much interest for readers following the debate on the relative influence of socio-structural and local factors on penal policy. In it, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474512473084">Melossi expands upon his (2001)</xref> arguments concerning the cultural embeddedness of punishment by considering neo-liberalism’s ‘elective affinities’ in the context of penality, political economy and international relations. It is suggested that there is a complementary and interpretive relationship between the increasingly utilitarian approach to crime and punishment, the notion of ‘individual responsibility’ and also the heavy dose of ‘machismo’ at the heart of the neo-liberal project. Based on this, Melossi ventures the view that it may be possible to understand the sharp rise in imprisonment rates in the USA in recent decades
<disp-quote><p>as an integral aspect of class conflict and. … of international relationships, in so far as the increasing hegemony of a discursive punishment within the borders of the US would then fulfil a pedagogic function also in terms of international relationships. (p. 58)</p></disp-quote>
The remaining two chapters in this part deal with ‘concepts of culture in the sociology of punishment’ (Garland) and ‘theorizing the embeddedness of punishment’ (Nelken). While they approach the topic from different perspectives, both serve to problematize the use of the concept of culture (or its close associates) as an independent variable in criminological research. The authors point to the difficulties replete in such an enterprise, namely, the artificiality of treating culture as a distinct analytical domain; the blurry dividing line between the <italic>explanans</italic> and the <italic>explanandum</italic>; the influence of culture over time as well as the thorny issues concerning the impact of globalization and the appropriate unit of analysis. For Garland these difficulties are such that he ‘thinks it necessary to draw back from theoretical tendencies that are beginning to emerge in this field’ (p. 35) with cultural explication serving only as ‘a preliminary to the social explanation of the phenomenon in question’ (p. 37).</p>
<p>The second part of the book deals with the links between post-Fordism, punishment and globalization. Iñaki Rivera Beiras uses the draconian measures adopted by Spain in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks as an example of how an Anglo-Saxon ‘criminology of intolerance’ may have fused with a Continental ‘culture of emergency’ (p. 106). The author backgrounds this with a discussion on changes in the labour market, processes of economic globalization and the punitive management of poverty arguing that in many ways ‘the foundations were already laid’ (p. 106) for such a response. De Giorgi’s chapter follows similar lines in linking the ‘social surplus’ produced by the neo-liberal economy to the punitive discourses and practices emerging in western societies. He points to the increases in incarceration rates in certain European states together with the strong over-representation of immigrants in European prisons as evidence of the spread of the ‘penalization of poverty’ to Europe.</p>
<p>Staying with the notion of cultural voyages, the final section examines the manner in which ideas relating to crime causation and prevention are received outside of their native context and indeed, how they are altered by the new cultural-historical context. Nicole Rafter, recalling Daems’ vertical technique (see review above), provides an engaging discussion of the cultural circumstances in which Lombroso produced his famous text <italic>La donna delinquente</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474512473084">Lombroso and Ferrero, 1893</xref>) and her recent experience of translating this text into English. She also adds historical depth to the discussion through her observations on the manner in which an earlier English translation of Lombroso’s text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474512473084">Lombroso, 1895</xref>) – while significantly amended – made a similar impact on thinking about female criminality in English-speaking countries as in Italy. The final two chapters provide excellent examples of the tension between the local and the global in the field of crime prevention. Rossella Selmini’s chapter relates how both British and French crime prevention strategies have been adopted and adapted at a local level in Italy to create a mixed model. While the influences may therefore be international, her work also draws attention to the importance of the local: the institutional conflict among different levels of government in Italy, particularly the struggle of local authorities to acquire new competencies and responsibilities, remains, for her, ‘the main factor influencing the shape and style of the policies developed in the last decade’ (p. 178). In a similar manner, local peculiarities such as public distrust of the police in Argentina have significantly altered cultural imports such as Neighbourhood Watch in Argentina, prompting Sozzo to contemplate how ‘cultural translation’ can ‘open a certain field of possibilities for the local translators’ (p. 210).</p>
<p>As may be expected from a collection compiled by such an elite group of thinkers, the book is highly impressive in both its scope and its imagination. The sheer ambition of some of the arguments put forward – I am thinking here particularly of Melossi’s ‘elective affinities’ thesis – is impressive in and of itself. My one criticism relates to the accessibility of the text. I find myself in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474512473084">Findlay’s (2011)</xref> observation that the collection does not represent ‘an easy read’ for those unversed in the literature, though this will probably present less of a problem for readers of this journal.</p>
<p>As a final observation, it is interesting to note that, as with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474512473084">Jones and Newburn (2007)</xref> before them, the editors ultimately appear to favour the culturalist or ‘particularistic’ side of the punitiveness debate:
<disp-quote><p>we remain persuaded that embeddedness in the senses outlined here continues to be a crucial feature of the criminal question wherever we encounter it, and that this imposes fairly stringent conceptual and methodological demands on the ways in which it is proper to theorise and study it. (p. 4)</p></disp-quote>
Certainly, the empirical research on crime prevention presented in the book supports to a significant degree the argument that surface similarities often belie the mediating influence of local politico-cultural environments. Read together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474512473084">Daems’ (2008)</xref> concerns about empirical substantiation (see review above), the book may perhaps be taken as a caution against over-ready acceptance of generalizing arguments about a new punitive <italic>zeitgeist</italic> or hegemonic neo-liberalism.</p></sec>
