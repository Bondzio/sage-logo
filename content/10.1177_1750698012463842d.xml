<p>The most recent volume in Berghahn’s <italic>Remapping Cultural History</italic> series focuses on grassroots memorials, a phenomenon which has grown rapidly and globally since the 1980s. Yet, this is the first book that deals, explicitly and profoundly, with the rise of these “spontaneous shrines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698012463842d">Santino, 2006</xref>), a definition which returns in several contributions. The latter cover a variety of international contexts, although Europe and North America are strongly favored. In addition, the only chapter that discusses grassroots memorials in a non-Western society—post-terrorist Bali, Indonesia—confronts Eastern and Western ways of mourning, most of the 202 victims containing Australian and British tourists. It would be easy to turn this lack of a more trans- or intercultural perspective into a point of criticism, but it may also be exemplary of a new way of dealing with trauma in Western societies. As the editors Peter Jan Margry and Cristina Sánchez-Carretero—two experts in the field of anthropology—observe in their solid and rich introduction, “are we confronted with a ‘new culture of disaster?’ Or, [ ... ], are we witnessing a ‘new public mourning’ [ ... ]?” (p. 32). The role of grassroots memorials in mourning processes, as well as the political and social impact of these memorials and their performative nature, are therefore at the heart of this volume.</p>
<p>After a brief discussion of terminology and an historical overview of the rise of grassroots memorials in Western society, Margry and Sánchez-Carretero explain how different conceptual frameworks such as temporality, space, and media have shaped the studies of grassroots memorials. Here, the concept of spontaneity as developed by Jack Santino—who contributes to the volume with a brief theoretical chapter of his own—clashes with the idea of expectations people have of what memorials should look like, an element which could have been developed further, for example, through a more thorough theoretical and historical exploration of (official) memory sites (e.g. war memorials) in general. Two other key concepts in the study of grassroots memorials which come to the fore in nearly all contributions are negotiation and consensus, on one hand, and materiality and the limitations of physical environments, on the other. Indeed, the first section—“Negotiating Societal Violence”—provides some examples of the negotiative power of grassroots memorials, most notably the case study on mafia victims in Sicily (Puccio-Den), which reveals the tensions between official and “vernacular” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698012463842d">Bodnar, 1992</xref>) memory work and the different materials used to commemorate mafia victims, that is, marble plaques in official commemorations as opposed to transient but more powerful forms of remembering such as writings on paper by local anti-mafia movements.</p>
<p>The difficulty of negotiating traumatic memories comes to the fore in a second chapter, which discusses the controversies about memorials for both victims <italic>and</italic> perpetrators in the dramatic shootings at the Columbine high school, Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University (Grider). Grider’s focalization on the role of perpetrators in the process of memorialization is original, though it draws attention away from another interesting issue that remains unexplored: the absence of debates about gun control and violence—which were predominant in the media—in the memorials set up for the victims of the shootings. Clearly, these “shrines” are to be understood as grassroots memorials not in terms of “foci of protest and resentment, instrumentalized to articulate social or political disaffection” (Margry and Sánchez-Carretero, Chapter 2), but as monuments of mourning solely. This in contrast to memorials that were erected in Madrid after the March 11 train bombings in 2004, discussed by Sánchez-Carretero further on in the book, which did contain political messages.</p>
<p>The third chapter in the first section discusses the Van Gogh memorial site in Amsterdam (Stengs). Although this is an interesting documentation of the emergence and development of a “spontaneous” memorial for the provocative film director and columnist, it is highly descriptive and only in part discusses how the memory of this controversial victim was negotiated in the public sphere. Stengs seems to be more interested in agency and the relationship between (the creation of) memory sites and media.</p>
<p>The second section is entitled “Contesting Objectionable Death,” and again, only some of the chapters really fit into this category. Two highly qualitative contributions by Monika Rulfs and Robert Thomas Dobler explore different types of protests against traffic incidents. Rulf’s chapter about the running over of a 9-year-old girl by a truck in Hamburg (Germany), and the local reaction to this accident, maintains a good balance between theory and descriptive information. Dobler’s essay about the global phenomenon of the “ghost bikes” raises several interesting issues, such as the idea of agency and the “aura of sanctity [which] seems to surround these memorials, rendering them, at least temporarily, inviolable to the realities of the outside world” (p. 183). Ewa Klekot’s analysis of the commemoration of Polish Pope John Paul II in 2005, and Sandrine Revet’s chapter on the 1999 floods in Venezuela, however, slightly fall out of tone. After all, both the Pope’s death and the floods represent “natural” events, in the sense that they were unavoidable and therefore cannot really be said to reflect an “objectionable death.” Yet, the Pope’s religious status, global popularity, and public figure make him an interesting case study of how singular individuals are remembered at a grassroots level. The Venezuela case study, on the other hand, offers original field data and a culturally different perspective, as well as some interesting though largely unanswered questions about the different reactions to “natural” violence as opposed to violence perpetrated by man.</p>
<p>The latter is at the heart of the third section, “Sociability and Reflexive Antiterrorism,” which focuses on collective reactions to terrorism. Both Béatrice Fraenkel and Cristina Sánchez-Carretero take us back to Puccio-Den’s discussion about materials, as Fraenkel explores the power of writing in a chapter on street shrines remembering 9/11 in New York. Sánchez-Carretero focuses on the relationship between emotions and the locus and support (i.e. walls or paper) of materials that were deposited at the grassroots memorials in Madrid. Huub de Jonge, finally, offers an insight into the different ways in which Eastern and Western cultures commemorate, although more attention could have been paid to (disaster) tourism <italic>after</italic> the bombings in Bali.</p>
<p>The final section entitled “Instrumentalizing Repositories of Memory” very clearly and coherently focuses on the ethical and practical issues involved in the archiving of objects contained in grassroots memorials. Written mostly by archivists and researchers involved in archival projects or connected to archives, these chapters read differently but are no less interesting, were it only for the highly different objects of research: grassroots memorials created after 9/11, the death of a young activist during the G8 in Genoa (Italy) in 2001, and the murder of right-wing Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, which links-in with the chapter on the Van Gogh murder.</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite of a few minor flaws, this volume offers a highly qualitative and valuable contribution to the discussion on memory, memorials, and commemorative processes. It theorizes a previously underdeveloped theme, that is, grassroots memorials, using a variety of interesting case studies that open up new perspectives and raise questions for further examination.</p>
