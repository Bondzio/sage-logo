<p>A mycotic aneurysm associated with a covered stent in the thoracic aorta of a 12-year-old child was successfully managed by excision and replacement with aortic homograft. On follow-up, there was unobstructed flow through the homograft. This case highlights the need for high index of suspicion for mycotic aneurysm and prompt surgical intervention in children with coarctation of aorta who present with features of infective endocarditis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mycotic aneurysm of the aorta is uncommon in pediatric patients and may be fatal if not intervened early.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112439079">1</xref>
</sup> We report successful surgical management of a thoracic mycotic aneurysm around a covered stent which had been implanted to treat coarctation of the aorta (CoA) in a 12-year-old boy. He presented with features of infective endocarditis. Although thoracic aortic aneurysms are known to occur in children with congenital aortic pathology,<sup>

</sup> mycotic aneurysm in a child, especially around a covered stent implanted for CoA, has not been reported previously in literature.</p>

<title>Case Details</title>
<p>A 12-year-old boy weighing 29 kg presented with high-grade fever of four weeks’ duration. He had undergone surgical closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD), resection of a subaortic membrane, and ligation of patent ductus arteriosus at six years of age. During follow-up, he was found to have CoA and a small residual ductal shunt. An 8 mm wide 17 mm long Cheatham platinum covered stent was implanted at eight years of age. The procedure was uneventful but the patient was subsequently lost to follow-up for four years. </p>
<p>At the time of presentation, he had fever, was pale, toxic looking, and had features of infective endocarditis. Echocardiography showed a significant gradient across the stent (peak of 38 mm Hg). No vegetations were visualized in association with the stent, the VSD patch, or the valves of the heart. Chest x-ray anteroposterior and lateral view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112439079">Figure 1A</xref> and B) and echocardiography did not reveal malposition or fracture of the stent. Blood culture showed heavy growth of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. Ampicillin 300 mg/kg/d divided six hourly and gentamicin 3 mg/kg/d divided eight hourly were administered based on the sensitivity of the organism.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although the bacteria isolated was a sensitive strain, fever did not respond to antibiotic therapy. His condition was rapidly deteriorating and hence we considered both the covered stent and the VSD patch as the possible source of infection. A 64-slice computed tomography (CT) scan was planned to image the covered stent in the descending thoracic aorta; however, owing to rapidly deteriorating clinical condition with fulminant sepsis and onset of renal failure, we decided to perform an emergency surgery—removal of covered stent with repair of the aorta through a left thoracotomy approach. Intraoperatively, there was a large pseudo-aneurysm measuring 6 cm × 4 cm at the upper descending thoracic aorta extending to the distal arch, caused by infected intra-aortic stent graft, with areas of impending rupture. The metal stent was lying loose in the aneurysm cavity. Excision of the pseudoaneurysm together with the infected intra-aortic stent graft followed by reconstruction of the distal aortic arch and upper descending thoracic aorta with an aortic homograft tube was performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2150135112439079">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>Under general anesthesia, invasive monitoring and right lateral position, left posterolateral thoracotomy was performed. Descending thoracic aortic cannulation and main pulmonary artery cannulation were performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established. The patient was cooled to 28°C. Distally, the descending thoracic aorta below the aneurysm was clamped. Proximally, the left subclavian artery and the distal aortic arch beyond the left common carotid artery were clamped. The aneurysm was opened. The infected stent graft and the associated pseudoaneurysm were excised. The aorta was transected distal to the left common carotid artery. The aorta was then reconstructed using an aortic homograft tube (11 mm diameter) with reimplantation of the left subclavian artery. The size of the aortic homograft appeared appropriate for this small-built child. Cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135112439079">
<title>Postoperative Course</title>
<p>The child’s fever subsided and his general condition improved. Histopathological examination of the excised stent with aneurysm showed recession of the expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) covering with embedding of the sharp edges of the proximal end of the stent in the aortic wall close to the origin of the aneurysm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112439079">Figure 2A</xref>). The ePTFE tube appeared to have migrated downward and was protruding beyond the distal end of the stent. The major part of the pseudoaneurysm was thick and fibrotic. However, there were a few thinned out necrotic areas with neutrophilic infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112439079">Figure 2B</xref>) where the aneurysm had probably enlarged recently due to superimposed infection. However, the tissue from the excised specimen did not show any organisms on culture and the Gram stain was negative. Intravenous ampicillin and gentamycin were continued for 6 weeks and the subsequent blood cultures were negative. At one year of postoperative period, the child was well with no significant stenosis (peak gradient of &lt;20 mm Hg) at the site of homograft implantation in the descending thoracic aorta.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The various pathogenetic mechanisms described for mycotic aneurysm are direct trauma with contamination, local extension of an infected focus, septic microemboli from endocarditis, and hematogenous seeding from a remote unknown focus in the absence of infective endocarditis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112439079">3</xref>
</sup> In our patient, the mechanism appears to be implantation of circulating bacteria from a remote source on the damaged intima near the stent. In children with congenital heart disease, thoracic aneurysms can occur around the site of CoA, especially following surgical or transcatheter interventions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112439079">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112439079">2</xref>
</sup> The high-velocity blood jet initiates the endothelial trauma that encourages microbial adhesion and thus vegetations distal to the site of coarctation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112439079">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>If the diagnosis is first suspected intraoperatively, Gram stain, cultures, and histological specimens of the aneurysm wall along with blood cultures are recommended as done in our case.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112439079">5</xref>
</sup> Patients with positive blood cultures and arterial aneurysms should be considered to have a mycotic aneurysm until proven otherwise. Conversely, negative Gram stain and cultures of blood and aneurysm wall are not sufficient to rule out mycotic aneurysm. The sensitivity may be hindered by concurrent antimicrobial therapy. </p>
<p>Radiological evaluation with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is extremely valuable to plan the high-risk surgery and is recommended in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected mycotic aneurysm.<sup>6</sup> In our case, the planned CT imaging could not be obtained before surgery in this child. The practical difficulty we had was the lack of in-house CT or MRI facility .The child was very sick and hemodynamically unstable. We felt that transfer for radiological imaging carried significant risk. We strongly suspected the covered stent as the possible site of infection. Cardiac catheterization and angiography were avoided to prevent dislodging any vegetation from the infected covered stent. This is a limitation in the management of our case. Going ahead with surgery without proper planning in such high-risk patients might prove catastrophic. However, even in the semi-emergency situation, we anticipated excision of a large portion of aorta and were prepared with an appropriately sized graft for replacement of a segment of aorta. Cardiopulmonary bypass was used to optimize spinal cord protection.</p>
<p>Prompt surgical intervention without prolonging medical management helped in our case. However, this potentially lethal infectious complication and high-risk aortic surgery may possibly have been avoided if there had been close follow-up after the stent implantation. It is much easier to treat complications such as restenosis or aneurysm formation after stent implantation at an early stage, potentially preventing serious infectious complications. This case also highlights the importance of educating parents and patients about the need for life-long close follow-up with periodic imaging after surgical or transcatheter interventions for CoA.</p>
