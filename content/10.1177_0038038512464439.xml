<p>This book addresses issues that are crucial to criminology at the present time, and also to sociology and social science more generally. One of these relates to public role; and, as the title of the book hints, there is a dialogue here with Burawoy’s notion of ‘public sociology’. Another issue concerns how to address the fundamental differences in orientation that exist today among criminologists, regarding the nature and function of their discipline. The relevance of this also extends to other areas of social science.</p>
<p>The authors note how the political climate around crime and justice issues has ‘warmed’ in the past few decades, with the media and many politicians adopting a more punitive approach, and they consider the implications of this for criminology. They discuss the various forms that work in this field has taken in recent times: the moderate, pragmatic, liberal criminology of the 1950s and 1960s; the radical oppositionalism that followed this, along with more recent reinventions such as ‘cultural criminology’, and Wacquant’s attack on the penal character of neoliberal politics; plus other current forms from zemiology to crime science and criminological research for evidence-based policymaking. In the face of this diversity, the authors propose that, while not ignoring fundamental differences, criminologists must work together. Towards the end of their book they present imaginary dialogues with these other positions: anticipating criticisms of their own proposals and offering responses.</p>
<p>Loader and Sparks formulate the task of the criminologist as ‘democratic underlabouring’; an analogy with John Locke’s claim to be a philosophical underlabourer clearing away philosophical rubbish to allow the progress of natural science. They believe that criminologists must engage with external audiences so as to clear away ideological misconceptions, thereby facilitating the emergence and flourishing of ‘a better democratic politics’ (p. 133). Their book is perhaps intended to offer a model for the kind of underlabouring required. Its central rationale is a form of reflexivity: applying sociological analysis to criminology and its socio-political context. At the same time, drawing on the work of Harry Collins and Robert Evans, they emphasise the need for criminologists to develop ‘interactional expertise’: practical and largely tacit knowledge about how to act effectively in the public realm.</p>
<p>There may be a tension between theory and practice here, and this relates to a more fundamental issue. It has been suggested that Locke’s adoption of the underlabourer role was false modesty, and something similar might be said of Loader and Sparks. In effect, they adopt a relatively grand conception of criminology’s role: the task is to contribute to ‘a better politics of crime and its regulation’ (p. 144), indeed ‘to realize the unfulfilled promise of modern politics’ (p. 117). Yet what these phrases mean is open to serious dispute, varying according to whether one is committed, say, to radical socialism or feminism, to some kind of liberalism, or to a conservatism that is pessimistic about mass democracy. Despite nodding early on towards a notion of ‘public interest’ (p. 4), the authors themselves emphasise the conflicting values and interests that characterise modern societies. How are criminologists to overcome these conflicts? And is attempting this part of their legitimate task?</p>
<p>In my view, this goal is quixotic, and its pursuit is not appropriate for a research discipline. Instead, perhaps one of the strategies for ‘cooling’ the hot political climate that the authors dismiss – institutional insulation from political heat – could be applied to social science? This involves insisting that its sole task is to produce reliable knowledge about crime and justice issues. After all, the authors themselves acknowledge that this is its distinctive mission.</p>
<p>Relatedly, I was struck by the fact that Loader and Sparks do not discuss the sociology of deviance, as pioneered for example by Howard Becker. In its classic form this adopted a more detached position in relation to politics, policymaking and practice; even while retaining the idea that it had a long-term progressive role. This sub-discipline adopted a broad disciplinary concern with understanding how actions and people come to be defined as deviant and criminal, the operation of the various institutions involved in this, and so on. For me, this is a better, though by no means perfect, model for academic criminology and social research more generally, than many of the other approaches that Loader and Sparks discuss.</p>
<p>The authors also neglect the fact that criminology’s engagement with policymakers and publics takes place in contexts where a variety of other experts operate: those from other scientific disciplines as well as practitioners of various sorts, from lawyers to police officers. How are we to conceptualise the different types of expertise involved here, and how could they be integrated into a ‘better politics of crime and justice’? Furthermore, what are the significant ways in which any relationship to policymaking and practice is structured by the institutional contexts within which it must currently take place?</p>
<p>That readers will have doubts and questions, as I have, takes nothing away from the fact that this is a thoughtful and illuminating book, drawing on a wide range of literature and speaking to very important issues. The authors’ commitment to open but critical dialogue between different criminological approaches, and their recognition that there is much to be learned from them all, is surely to be applauded.</p>
