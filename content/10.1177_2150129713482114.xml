<p>Hello Association of Asthma Educator Members,</p>
<p>You have spoken and we have heard! In an effort to work toward our strategic goals and meet the needs of our membership, we are offering review courses in different parts of the country. Although being a certified asthma educator is not a requirement for membership in Association of Asthma Educators (AAE), the leadership does realize that certification as an asthma educator may become an integral part of reimbursement in the future. Therefore, we are doing our part to prepare asthma educators for that certification (AE-C).</p>
<p>Also, very recently we rolled out our AAE Mentoring Program. This program pairs a veteran asthma educator mentor with a newer asthma educator and allows them to share information about the asthma education profession in ways that are structured, engaging, and rewarding. For more information about our courses or our mentoring program, please visit our Web site.</p>
