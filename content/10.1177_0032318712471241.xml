<p>This edited volume brings together both distinguished scholars and relative newcomers to the field of foreign policy analysis. Given that many of the contributors are from New Zealand, four of the chapters deal with New Zealand foreign policy issues, and New Zealand-related topics occupy half a page of the index.</p>
<p>This book is one in a long tradition of studies that have attempted to measure the impact of public opinion upon foreign policy. In 1967, the doyen of neorealism, Kenneth Waltz, devoted his only major empirical work to a second-image study of democratic politics and foreign policy decision-making in Britain and the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032318712471241">1</xref></sup> One of Waltz’s major findings was that publics do not necessarily restrain foreign policy decision-makers in democratic states: in other words, in comparison with dictatorships, democracies do not face particular constraints arising from the pressures wrought by their domestic constituencies. Waltz’s other findings demonstrated that foreign affairs are a rarefied and discrete policy domain, largely dominated by government institutions, while remaining relatively autonomous from domestic influences. The implicit question posed by this book is whether Waltz’s thesis still holds in twenty-first-century foreign policy decision-making.</p>
<p>
<italic>Public Participation in Foreign Policy</italic> is divided into four parts. Part I deals with the question of the public’s ability to contribute to foreign policy, and the extent to which publics wish to participate. The debates in the first two chapters revolve around direct democracy and public comprehension of foreign policy issues and decision-making. In Chapter 1, James Headley and Jo-Ansie van Wyk provide a solid review of the extant literature, from élite theory to the ‘democratization’ of foreign policy.</p>
<p>Part II evaluates two case studies: US public opinion before and after the 2003 Iraq conflict and South Africa in the post-apartheid era. In the former, Ole Holsti argues that the Bush administration attempted to control public opinion, as well as to hide the more graphic aspects of Iraq from the US population. However, Holsti does gloss over some widely available facts; for example (p. 66), Bush sought and received the UNSC’s unanimous assent to Resolution 1441 because Blair pushed him to do so. Conversely, in relation to the abortive UNSCR 1442 (the withdrawn draft resolution that dealt with authorizing military force against Iraq), Holsti writes: ‘Washington withdrew Resolution 1442 to avoid an embarrassing defeat when it became clear that most Security Council members would vote against it’ (p. 67). The fact is that the French government asked Washington to withdraw the second UNSCR so that Paris <italic>would not be forced to vote against it</italic>. Some analysts viewed this as President Chirac’s backhanded way of giving Washington the green light to circumvent the Security Council and launch the invasion. Certainly, neither Paris nor Berlin, both of which opposed military action publicly, made any attempt to block Washington’s use of airspace, bases or NATO assets, all of which proved logistically critical to the invasion.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, Van Wyk’s study of a virtual absence of public participation in post-apartheid South African foreign policy is instructive. On the one hand, the volte-face performed by the National Party under de Klerk was widely attributed to the effective internationalization of the apartheid issue by the ANC and other groups from the 1960s onwards, leading to South Africa’s isolation and general condemnation within the UN. Post-apartheid, the Mbeki government, by centralizing foreign policy decision-making within the presidential office, effectively sidelined both its own foreign ministry and potential participants in the policy process. As Van Wyk notes, this issue persists under the Zuma presidency.</p>
<p>In Part III, the book examines peace and disarmament activism (Kate Dewes); New Zealand’s Track Two diplomacy in Southeast Asia (Andrew Butcher); and the China−New Zealand free trade agreement (Matt Crawford, Alasdair Thompson and Peter Conway). Dewes traces New Zealand’s anti-nuclear activism in the 1980s, noting the Lange government’s decisive break with the ANZUS Treaty on the question of US nuclear-armed naval vessels in New Zealand waters. Dewes discusses how Lange mobilized the domestic peace movement to bolster public support for the Labour government’s position. In 1987, the New Zealand government went even further by incorporating public representation into an advisory committee within the Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament and Arms Control Act. The Act also vindicated the opprobrium which the public held for the covert action against the <italic>Rainbow Warrior</italic> in 1984. Where the German Greens in 1981–2 had failed in their opposition to the Pershing II installations in West Germany, despite drawing broad public support, the New Zealand public and government had succeeded in establishing a permanent nuclear free zone, albeit at the cost of the US alliance.</p>
<p>The Crawford, Thompson and Conway analysis of the NZ−China FTA also makes for an interesting case study, not least because FTAs invariably involve not only lowest-common-denominator bargaining, but also because rent-seekers – in the form of business, unions and other interest groups – come to the fore. Unsurprisingly, peak business groups had the greatest access to the policy-making process, while organized labour groups, as trade union leader Peter Conway notes, were often ‘suspicious’ of the FTA process (p. 168). Although the trade unions sought various protections and assurances, particularly with respect of NZ’s ILO commitments, Conway concludes that labour organizations were left with some ‘considerable concerns’ over the likely implications of the FTA (p. 169).</p>
<p>Part IV of the book deals with indigenous peoples (Maria Bargh); foreign policy in the French Pacific (Cameron Diver); and Pacific Island diaspora groups (Alumita Durutalo). Bargh’s chapter discusses the rights and sovereignty of indigenous peoples. However, it is occasionally difficult for readers unfamiliar with New Zealand politics to comprehend the import of indigenous treaties and Maori terms without some guidance; a glossary or notes explaining these terms would have been helpful.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, the editors posit that certain case studies – the chapters by Dewes and Crawford, Thompson and Conway in particular – demonstrate that there are avenues for public participation in foreign policy decision-making and that New Zealand’s experience shows that publics indeed make a difference. However, New Zealand is almost unique in international politics and is not often compelled to face the hard geopolitical and geostrategic realities which states in Europe, Asia and the Middle East are forced to confront on a daily basis. Southeast Asian countries, for example, may declare nuclear weapons free zones; but in Northeast and South Asia, there are no such luxuries available.</p>
<p>The book’s strengths lie in the many and varied case studies, and the editors deserve plaudits for drawing together a range of perspectives from policy practitioners, as well as representatives from peak business and labour groups, rather than relying exclusively upon academic authors.</p>
