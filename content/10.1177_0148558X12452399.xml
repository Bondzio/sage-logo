<abstract>
<p>Motivated by recent studies showing that female CFOs are more risk-averse than male CFOs when making various corporate decisions, the authors examine whether banks take into consideration the gender of CFOs when pricing bank loans. This article finds that in the sample, firms under the control of female CFOs on average enjoy about 11% lower bank loan prices than firms under the control of male CFOs. In addition, loans given to female-CFO-led companies have longer maturities and are less likely to be required to provide collateral than loans given to male-CFO-led companies. The results are robust to a series of robustness tests, such as a firm and year fixed-effect regression, a Heckman two-stage self-selection model, a propensity score-matching method, and a differences-in-differences approach. Overall, the results suggest that banks tend to recognize the role of female CFOs in providing more reliable accounting information ex ante and reducing default risk ex post, and grant firms with female CFOs lower loan prices and more favorable contract terms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past decade, the number of female CFOs has increased dramatically. For example, the total number of female CFOs in S&amp;P 1500 companies was only 4 in 1994, and it was 104 in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0148558X12452399">1</xref></sup> This significant increase in female CFOs has attracted considerable attention from academics. An emerging stream of literature is beginning to investigate the systematic differences between male and female CFOs in terms of their accounting, financing, and investment decision making. For instance, earlier studies find that firms with female CFOs adopt more conservative accounting policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Park, &amp; Wu, 2010</xref>), report higher quality earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148558X12452399">Peni, 2008</xref>), are less likely to manipulate earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148558X12452399">Chava &amp; Purnanandam, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148558X12452399">Wei &amp; Xie, 2009</xref>), and are less likely to make significant acquisitions and more likely to reduce the leverage level than firms with male CFOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X12452399">Huang &amp; Kisgen, 2010</xref>). In this article, we extend this line of research by examining whether the gender of CFOs affects the cost of debt capital in the context of bank loans.</p>
<p>We focus on bank loans for two primary reasons. First, bank loans are a major source of corporate financing, even for large public companies. Each year, the sheer volume of bank loan financing is much larger than that of equity and bond financing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0148558X12452399">2</xref></sup> Given the economic significance of bank loans in allocating capital to corporations as well as the growing number of female CFOs, it is very important to understand whether the gender of CFOs affects the cost of bank loans.</p>
<p>Second, accounting information is a persistent standard that banks rely on to assess borrowers’ credit risk (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148558X12452399">Anderson, Mansi, &amp; Reeb, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148558X12452399">Armstrong, Guay, &amp; Weber, 2010</xref>). Earlier studies find that when banks initiate private debt, they are very sensitive to various attributes of accounting information, such as operating accrual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder, 2008</xref>) and conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148558X12452399">Sunder, Sunder, &amp; Zhang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148558X12452399">Zhang, 2008</xref>). Assuming that female CFOs are more likely to report high-quality and conservative earnings than male CFOs as documented in earlier studies, as inside lenders with in-depth knowledge of their clients (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148558X12452399">Diamond, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X12452399">Fama, 1985</xref>), banks should realize the benefits of female CFOs in providing more reliable and conservative accounting information to lenders. In addition, the incentives of female CFOs to reduce firms’ leverage level and make less risky investments also indicate a lower default risk of the firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148558X12452399">Strahan, 1999</xref>). Collectively, we conjecture that banks should consider the gender effect and reward borrowers with female CFOs with lower bank loan prices and more favorable nonprice loan terms when designing bank loan contracts.</p>
<p>However, extensive existing literature shows that females are discriminated against in the credit market. The discrimination hypothesis simply implies that banks charge higher loan prices and require tighter nonprice terms when lending to female-CFO-led companies because they are biased against women. Empirically, most studies focus on small business firms and their results are mixed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148558X12452399">Alesina, Lotti, &amp; Mistrulli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148558X12452399">Blanchflower, Levine, &amp; Zimmerman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148558X12452399">Storey, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We empirically examine this question. Using a sample of S&amp;P 1500 companies from 1994-2006, we estimate how loan spread, loan maturity, and loan collateral are affected by the gender of CFOs. Following previous studies, we control for firm characteristics and loan characteristics that are likely to shape loan contract terms.</p>
<p>We find that the gender of CFOs does affect bank loan contracts. Specifically, we find that in our sample, firms with female CFOs, on average, enjoy about 14 basis points lower bank loan prices than firms with male CFOs. In addition, loans given to female-CFO-led companies have 9% (3.8 months) longer maturities and are about 8% less likely to be required to provide collateral than loans given to male-CFO-led companies. The results support the hypothesis that banks tend to recognize the role of female CFOs in reducing information risk ex ante and default risk ex post, and reward firms with female CFOs with more favorable loan contract terms.</p>
<p>We also test whether female CEOs and other female top executives affect bank loan prices. However, we do not find that the presence of female CEOs and other female top executives affects prices and nonprice loan terms considered in our article. The results suggest that banks view CFOs, but not CEOs or other executives, as the primary executives who determine the quality of accounting information and the financing decisions of the firms, and in turn, affect their lending decisions. The results are also consistent with recent studies that find a strong relationship between CFOs and the quality of accounting information, and the leverage level of the firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148558X12452399">Chava &amp; Purnanandam, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148558X12452399">Geiger &amp; North, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X12452399">Huang &amp; Kisgen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148558X12452399">Jiang, Petroni, &amp; Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148558X12452399">Matsunaga &amp; Yeung, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148558X12452399">Peni, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Endogeneity is a big concern in the study of gender issues. For instance, female CFOs may not be randomly assigned to firms. Firms with more favorable credit terms may be more likely to hire female CFOs. In addition, unobservable time-variant or time-invariant factors may be correlated with bank loans. Furthermore, the causality problem makes our results hard to interpret. To address the issue of potential endogeneity, we employ a series of econometric analyses. First, we use a firm and year fixed-effect regression to rule out the impact of potential unobservable time-invariant firm-specific and year-specific effects. Second, we use a Heckman two-stage model to control for self-selection bias. Third, we apply a matching sample approach based on the propensity score-matching method to control for sample selection bias. Finally, similar to the approach adopted in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Park, &amp; Wu (2010)</xref>, we trace firms that change their CFOs from male to female (treated group) and from male to male (control group), and apply a differences-in-differences approach to mitigate unobservable time-variant factors that could affect the estimated influence of female CFOs. Our results are all robust, regardless of the econometric methods that we apply. The results of the differences-in-differences approach also indicate that female CFOs bring about, and not merely reflect, a reduced bank loan price and more favorable nonprice loan terms.</p>
<p>Our research is related to the literature on the relationship between accounting information and bank loan contracting. For example, recent studies find that bank loan contract terms are affected by accrual quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder, 2008</xref>), conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148558X12452399">Sunder, Sunder, &amp; Zhang, 2009</xref>), debt-contracting value of accounting information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148558X12452399">Ball, Bushman, &amp; Vasvari, 2008</xref>), internal control weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148558X12452399">Schneider &amp; Church, 2008</xref>), financial restatements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148558X12452399">Graham, Li, &amp; Qiu, 2008</xref>), and earnings predictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148558X12452399">Hasan, Park, &amp; Wu, 2012</xref>). In this article, rather than focusing on firm-level factors, we first relate bank’s lending decisions to the gender of top executives of borrowers and provide evidence that the gender of CFOs also has a significant impact on bank loan contracting, thereby furthering our understanding of its determinants.</p>
<p>Our article also contributes to the gender literature. Despite the proliferation of studies, there is still much debate as to the systematic differences between men and women with regard to their risk attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148558X12452399">Atkinson, Baird, &amp; Frye, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148558X12452399">Dwyer &amp; Gilkeson, 1999</xref>). In this article, by examining how informed private lenders, who are supposed to be very sensitive to the risk attitudes of top executives, react to the gender of CFOs when designing bank loan contracts, we can gain new insight into whether systematic differences exist between male CFOs and female CFOs from sophisticated investors’ perspective. In addition, in our research design, we comprehensively use different econometric methods to mitigate the potential endogeneity concern.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section titled “Related Literature and Hypothesis Development” reviews the related literature and develops our hypotheses. Section “Data” presents the sample selection, summary statistics, and univariate comparisons. The results of the multivariate tests are presented in the section “Results of the Multivariate Tests.” The final section provides conclusions.</p>

<title>Related Literature and Hypothesis Development</title>
<p>Gender differences in attitudes toward risk and risk-related behavior have long been studied in the sociology, psychology, and economics literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0148558X12452399">3</xref></sup> In general, most studies support the notion that women are more risk-averse than men. Because of the dramatic increase in female executives on top management teams over the past decade, more and more studies are beginning to investigate whether the gender of top executives affects various corporate decisions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X12452399">Huang and Kisgen (2010)</xref> investigate how the gender of CFOs affects corporate financial decisions. They find that firms under the control of female CFOs are less likely to make significant acquisitions and are less likely to issue long-term debt. Furthermore, female CFOs are more likely to reduce the leverage level than male CFOs. They also test market reactions to acquisitions and find that acquisitions made by female CFOs exhibit higher announcement returns compared with those made by firms with male CFOs. Their results provide some supportive evidence that female CFOs are more risk-averse than male CFOs when making their financial decisions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Park, &amp; Wu (2010)</xref> examine the impact of gender of CFOs on accounting decision making. By focusing on accounting conservatism, they find that female CFOs tend to report more conservative accounting numbers than their counterparts. They also examine the linkage between risk aversion of female CFOs and corporate decision making. They find that female CFOs make less risky financing and investment decisions compared with their male counterparts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148558X12452399">Peni (2008)</xref> tests the relationship between the earnings quality and the gender of top executives. She finds that the gender of CFOs, but not that of CEOs or other executives, affects the earnings quality. Using a sample of listed Chinese firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148558X12452399">Wei and Xie (2009)</xref> find that female CFOs are less likely to manipulate earnings than male CFOs.</p>
<p>In the bank loan literature, the default risk is the primary determinant of the bank loan price, and banks always rely on accounting information to assess the default risk of their borrowers, as accounting information is the primary resource for banks to evaluate and predict the riskiness of borrowers. Earlier studies find a negative relationship between bank loan price and earnings quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder, 2008</xref>) and conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148558X12452399">Zhang, 2008</xref>). In addition, the capital structure decisions and acquisition decisions are directly related to the default risk of the firms. Earlier studies also find that firms with higher leverage levels and firms with higher takeover vulnerability have higher bank loan prices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148558X12452399">Chava, Livdan, &amp; Purnanandam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148558X12452399">Strahan, 1999</xref>). Assuming that female CFOs tend to report higher quality and more conservative earnings than male CFOs, as inside lenders and delegated monitors who are concerned about the earnings quality and default risk of their borrowers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148558X12452399">Diamond, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148558X12452399">Fama, 1985</xref>), banks should recognize the gender differences of CFOs with regard to their accounting and financing decision making, and reward female-CFO-led firms with lower bank loan prices than male-CFO-led firms.</p>

<p>Bank loan contracts have multiple terms, and they cannot be treated separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148558X12452399">Melnik &amp; Plaut, 1986</xref>). In addition, although interest rates are an effective way to “price” the risk of bank loans, they have adverse effects on the moral hazard problem of borrowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148558X12452399">Stiglitz &amp; Weiss, 1981</xref>). In reality, banks are more likely to set up customized contracts not only on price but also on nonprice loan terms to price risk, facilitate monitoring, and limit potential losses. Therefore, it is important to focus on price and nonprice terms when studying bank loan contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148558X12452399">Qian &amp; Strahan, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Among different loan contract terms, loan maturity and collateral are important nonprice terms that are widely used by banks to limit the downside risk of lenders. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148558X12452399">Barclay and Smith (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148558X12452399">Rajan and Winton (1995)</xref> argue that shorter maturities are a useful way to solve information problems because they can force more frequent information disclosure and timely renegotiation of contract terms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148558X12452399">Berger and Udell (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148558X12452399">Jimenez, Salas, and Saurina (2006)</xref> show that lenders are more likely to use collateral when borrowers have a higher information risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148558X12452399">Rajan and Winton (1995)</xref> discuss how the use of collateral affects banks’ incentives to monitor borrowers. As we expect that female CFOs affect both information risk ex ante and default risk ex post, we expect that firms with female CFOs should enjoy longer maturities and are less likely to be required to provide collateral in bank loan contracts.</p>

<p>The gender information is from the ExecuComp database, which covers most S&amp;P 1500 public companies. The S&amp;P 1500 includes the S&amp;P 500, S&amp;P Midcap 400, and S&amp;P SmallCap 600.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0148558X12452399">4</xref></sup> The bank loan information is from the Loan Pricing Corporation’s (LPC) Dealscan database, which contains historical bank loan data that are compiled from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and self-reporting by banks and staff reporters. The basic unit of loans is the facility, which is the fundamental security that designates a loan in the loan market. The LPC Dealscan database includes detailed deal terms and conditions of loans, such as the interest rate, loan size, maturity, and collateral. Beyond these loan contract terms, Dealscan also includes information on the types and purposes of loans.</p>
<p>The accounting information is from the Compustat database. Following earlier studies, we exclude financial and utility companies.

<p>With regard to bank loan characteristics, we find that the average loan spread is 128 basis points, ranging from 8 basis points to 1,180 basis points. In our sample, the average loan amount is US$774 million with a mean maturity of 42 months. The loan amount and maturity vary considerably across our sample. We also find that about 70% of the loans in our sample use collateral (security). The results of the loan variables are very similar to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148558X12452399">Chava, Livdan, &amp; Purnanandam (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Koetter, and Wu (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12452399">Table 1</xref> also shows that the average value of assets for our sample borrowers is US$9,955 million, ranging from a minimum of US$14 million to a maximum of US$750,507 million. The average market leverage ratio is 0.289, the average tangibility is 0.342, the average profitability is 0.139, and the average <italic>z</italic> score is 1.787. All of these firm variables also vary across our sample.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148558X12452399">Table 2</xref> provides the Spearman pair-wise correlations among the key variables. We find that female CFOs are significantly negatively correlated with bank loan spread and security, and are significantly positively correlated with bank loan maturity. The results provide some preliminary evidence about the effect of female CFOs on bank loan contracts. However, the fact that the loan terms are also significantly correlated with many other loan and firm variables suggests that we need to analyze the relationship in a multivariate environment.</p>

Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that the mean of the bank loan spread for firms with female CFOs is 107 basis points, whereas it is 129 basis points for firms without female CFOs. The mean difference of 22 basis points is significant at the 1% level. We also find that the means of loan maturity and loan security are both significantly different between firms with female CFOs and firms without female CFOs. On average, loans for borrowers with female CFOs are less likely to be secured and have longer maturities than loans for borrowers with male CFOs.</p>

<p>Note: LBO = leveraged buyout; MBO = management buyout. This table presents univariate tests on the differences between firms with female CFOs and firms without female CFOs. All variables are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12452399">Table 1</xref>. The means of the differences between the variables for two subsamples and <italic>t</italic>-statistics are also reported. Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels are indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Although the univariate tests provide some evidence to support our hypotheses, the results do not take into consideration potentially fundamental differences in borrower characteristics and other loan characteristics between these two groups. Therefore, we also compare the borrower characteristics, loan types, and loan purposes of these two samples. We find that on average, firms with female CFOs have higher profitability and a higher market-to-book ratio but a lower leverage ratio than firms with male CFOs. The results are consistent with earlier findings, such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Park, &amp; Wu (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X12452399">Huang and Kisgen (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>In terms of loan types, we do not find significant differences between these two sample firms. For loan purposes, we find that loans for firms without female CFOs are more likely to be used for debt repayment, recapitalization, and takeovers, and are less likely to be used for general corporate purposes compared with firms with female CFOs.</p>
<p>In sum, the results of univariate tests suggest that banks provide more favorable loan terms to borrowers with female CFOs. The results also show that some key borrower characteristics and loan characteristics that may affect bank loans are significantly different across the subsamples, which suggests the need to control for those key firm and loan characteristics in the multivariate analysis.</p>

<title>Results of the Multivariate Tests</title>
<p>In our multivariate regression tests, we begin by testing how female CFOs affect bank loan prices. Next, we examine how female CFOs affect nonprice loan terms. Furthermore, we conduct a series of robustness checks by using different statistical methods, including a Heckman two-stage approach, a propensity score-matching approach, a differences-in-differences approach, and a firm-level analysis. Finally, we explore the channels through which female CFOs affect bank loan contracting by examining how they affect major firm characteristics.</p>

</p>
<p>In the regression, the basic unit of observation is the loan facility, and the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the <italic>loan spread</italic>. To capture the effect of the gender of CFOs, we define a dummy variable, <italic>female CFOs</italic>, which is equal to 1 if the loan is initiated by a firm with a female CFO and is 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>Following previous studies, such as those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148558X12452399">Qian and Strahan (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148558X12452399">Graham, Li, and Qiu (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Koetter, &amp; Wu (2012)</xref>, we control for several firm characteristics that may affect the loan price in the regressions. These factors include the following: log(<italic>assets</italic>), which is the natural logarithm of a firm’s total assets; <italic>leverage</italic>, which is the total debt (long-term debt + debt in current liabilities) divided by the total market assets (total debt + total market value of equity); <italic>profitability</italic>, which is the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) divided by the total assets; <italic>tangibility</italic>, which is the net property, plant, and equipment divided by the total assets; <italic>M/B</italic>, which is the market value of equity plus the book value of debt divided by the total assets; and <italic>z score</italic>, which is the modified Altman’s <italic>z</italic> score.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0148558X12452399">6</xref></sup> In addition, we use the one-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) dummies to control for the potential differences in loan pricing across industries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0148558X12452399">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>We further control for loan characteristics that may affect loan contracting in the regressions. We include log(<italic>facility</italic>), the natural logarithm of the amount of a loan facility, to measure loan size. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148558X12452399">Sharpe (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148558X12452399">Rajan (1992)</xref> emphasize lock-up problems associated with the existing lending relationship that subsequently increase borrowing costs. To control for previous lending relationships, we construct a variable <italic>prior relations</italic>, which is the total number of previous loans established by the same borrower and the same lead lender in the Dealscan database. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148558X12452399">Qian and Strahan (2007)</xref>, we construct a loan rating score based on Moody’s rating unless it is missing, in which case we use the S&amp;P rating. <italic>Debt rating</italic> is a score that ranges from 1 to 7, with 1 indicating an Aaa rating, 2 indicating an Aa rating, 3 indicating an A rating, 4 indicating a Bbb rating, 5 indicating a Bb rating, 6 indicating a B rating or worse, and 7 indicating no or a missing debt rating. We also control for the loan type effect and the loan purpose effect in our analysis. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Koetter, &amp; Wu (2012)</xref>, we separate the loan types into six categories: 364-day facility, revolver less than 1 year, revolver more than 1 year, revolver/term loan, term loan, and others. For loan purposes, we separate the loans into 11 groups: acquisition lines, commercial paper (CP) backup, corporate purpose, debt repayment, leveraged buyout (LBO)/management buyout (MBO), recapitalization, spinoff, stock buyback, takeover, working capital, and others.</p>
<p>As the number of female CFOs has increased dramatically since 1994, one concern is that our sample of female CFOs is heavily weighted to the latter part of the sample. For example, there are 330 female CFO observations in the 2002-2006 period, whereas there are 144 female CFO observations in the 1994-2001 period. In addition, the average treasury rate is significantly different between the 1994-2001 period and the 2002-2006 period, suggesting different macrolevel borrowing environments between these two periods. To mitigate this concern, we first add a year dummy to control for the year effect. Second, we add a dummy for the 2002-2006 period. Third, we construct a dummy variable, <italic>high treasury rate</italic>, which equals 1 if a loan is created on a day when the 1-year treasury rate is more than the median rate for the entire sample period and is 0 otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0148558X12452399">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Table 4</xref>, we first test how the presence of female CFOs affects bank loan prices by using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The estimated coefficient of <italic>Female CFOs</italic> equals −0.108 and is significant at the 1% level, indicating that firms with female CFOs, on average, have about 11% (about 14 basis points) lower bank loan prices than firms with male CFOs. Therefore, the effect of female CFOs on bank loan prices is economically and statistically significant.</p>

<p>Note: This table presents ordinary least squares (OLS) and firm and year fixed-effect regression results on the effect of female CFOs on the price of bank loans. The dependent variable is natural log of <italic>spread</italic>, which is the all-in spread drawn defined as the amount the borrower pays in basis points over London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or LIBOR equivalent for each dollar drawn down. <italic>High treasury rate</italic> (dummy) is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a loan is created on a day where the 1-year treasury rate is more than the median rate for the entire sample period and 0 is otherwise. <italic>Year 2002-2006</italic> (dummy) is dummy variable that equals 1 if a loan is created after 2001 and is 0 otherwise. All other variables are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12452399">Table 1</xref>. Standard errors are adjusted for within-firm clustering. Absolute values of the heteroscedasticity robust <italic>t</italic>-statistics are in parentheses. Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels are indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In terms of control variables, our results are consistent with earlier studies such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148558X12452399">Qian and Strahan (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148558X12452399">Graham, Li, and Qiu (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Koetter, &amp; Wu (2012)</xref>. Specifically, we find that log(<italic>assets</italic>), <italic>tangibility, profitability, M/B</italic>, and <italic>z score</italic> are significantly negatively related to the loan spread, whereas <italic>leverage</italic> is positively related to the loan spread, suggesting that firms with higher information asymmetries and default risk have higher loan prices. We also find that log(<italic>facility</italic>) is negatively, whereas <italic>prior relations</italic> and <italic>debt rating</italic> are positively, related to the loan spread.</p>
<p>In the previous OLS regression, although we control for various observable firm and loan characteristics that are widely used in earlier studies, it is still possible that unobservable time-invariant factors could affect bank loan prices. In addition, it is common for a firm to have several loan facilities each year, and those facilities may not be independent. Treating those correlated loans independently may overstate the statistical significance and lead to biased results. To deal with these two issues, we perform a firm and year fixed regression with standard errors adjusted for heteroscedasticity and within-firm clustering. The results are shown in column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Table 4</xref>. We find that after controlling for firm and year fixed effects, the <italic>female CFOs</italic>’ effect on bank loan prices increases from 0.108 to 0.156 (in column 1), and it remains economically and statistically significant.</p>
<p>As CEOs have the overall responsibility for corporate decision making, and previous studies find that CEOs’ individual styles affect firm policies and firm performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148558X12452399">Bennedsen, Pérez-González, &amp; Wolfenzon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148558X12452399">Bertrand &amp; Schoar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148558X12452399">Levi, Li, &amp; Zhang, 2008</xref>), the gender of CEOs may also affect lenders’ perceptions in their lending decisions. In column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Table 4</xref>, we further test whether the presence of female CEOs affects bank loan prices. The results show that there is no significant relationship between these two, indicating that banks do not take into consideration the gender of CEOs when pricing bank loans. The result is consistent with earlier studies, such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148558X12452399">Peni (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148558X12452399">Jiang, Petroni, &amp; Wang (2010)</xref>, which show that CFOs have more impacts on earnings quality and earnings management than CEOs.</p>
<p>We further test whether the presence of other female top executives affects bank loan prices. The results in column 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Table 4</xref> show that other female top executives are not significantly related to bank loan prices. In column 5 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Table 4</xref>, we specify three testing variables, <italic>female CFOs, female CEOs</italic>, and <italic>female other top executives</italic>, in one regression simultaneously. The results further confirm that only <italic>female CFOs</italic> are significantly negatively related to bank loan prices, and both <italic>female CEOs</italic> and <italic>female other top executives</italic> have no impacts on bank loan prices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0148558X12452399">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>As we stated before, the number of female CFO observations in the 2002-2006 period is larger than that in the 1994-2001 period, and the borrowing environments differ between these two periods. Therefore, we further examine whether the CFO gender effect on bank loan prices holds for both sample periods. We separate our sample into two subsamples based on the time periods, and then rerun the firm and year fixed-effect regressions for these two subsamples separately. The results are reported in columns 6 and 7 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Table 4</xref>. We find that the CFO gender effect on bank loan prices holds for both subsamples, although the magnitude of the coefficient for the 2002-2006 period sample is higher than that for the 1994-2001 period sample.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0148558X12452399">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In sum, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Table 4</xref> support the hypothesis that banks tend to recognize the benefits of female CFOs in providing more reliable accounting information ex ante and reducing default risk ex post, and grant firms with female CFOs lower bank loan prices. The results also suggest that banks primarily consider the gender of CFOs, and not that of the CEOs or other top executives, when making their lending decisions.</p>

<title>Female CFOs, Loan Maturity, and Loan Collateral</title>
<p>If female CFOs convey information about the earnings quality and default risk of the firms, lenders might consider this factor not only for loan prices but also for other contract terms. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder (2008)</xref>, in this section, we focus on how female CFOs affect two major nonprice loan contract features: loan maturity and loan collateral.</p>
<p>Column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148558X12452399">Table 5</xref> reports the results on the impact of female CFOs on loan maturity. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the <italic>loan maturity</italic>. Consistent with our Hypothesis 2, we find that the estimated coefficient of <italic>female CFOs</italic> is 0.090 and is significant at the 1% level, indicating that loans given to firms with female CFOs have about 9% (3.8 months) longer maturities than loans given to firms with male CFOs. We also find that <italic>female CEOs</italic> and <italic>other female executives</italic> have no impact on loan maturity. In column 2, we run firm and year fixed-effect regressions. Again, we find that the estimated coefficient of female CFOs is still economically and statistically significant.</p>

<p>Note: This table presents ordinary least squares (OLS), firm and year fixed-effect, and Logit regressions results on the effect of female CFOs on the maturity and collateral of bank loans. The dependent variables are natural log of <italic>maturity</italic>, which is the maturity time (in months) of a loan, and <italic>secured</italic>, which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a loan is secured by collateral and is 0 otherwise. All other variables are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12452399">Tables 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">4</xref>.

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>We further test the impact of female CFOs on the likelihood of a loan being secured. We estimate a logit model in which the dependent variable is 1 if a loan is secured and 0 otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0148558X12452399">11</xref></sup> The results are shown in column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148558X12452399">Table 5</xref>. The marginal effect of <italic>female CFOs</italic> implies that the probability of a loan being secured is about 8% lower for firms with female CFOs than for firms with male CFOs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0148558X12452399">12</xref></sup> This is consistent with our hypothesis that because the information risk and default risk are lower in female-CFO-led firms than in male-CFO-led firms, banks are less likely to require collateral in loan contracts when lending to female-CFO-led firms. In addition, we still do not find significant impacts of <italic>female CEOs</italic> and <italic>other female executives</italic> on the likelihood of a loan being secured.</p>
<p>In sum, the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148558X12452399">Table 5</xref> indicate that firms with female CFOs enjoy more favorable nonprice loan terms than firms with male CFOs, which is consistent with the literature that shows that banks always simultaneously use both price and nonprice terms to compensate for higher risk, facilitate monitoring, and limit the potential losses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Koetter, &amp; Wu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148558X12452399">Graham, Li, and Qiu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148558X12452399">Qian &amp; Strahan, 2007</xref>). The results on the gender of CEOs and other top executives also confirm that banks primarily consider the gender of CFOs, and not that of the CEOs or other top executives, when designing bank loan contracts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0148558X12452399">
<title>Robustness Checks</title>
<p>So far, we find that firms with female CFOs enjoy more favorable loan contract terms. However, endogeneity is a big concern in the study of gender issues. In this section, we perform robustness checks using different econometric analyses.</p>
<p>The first issue is the self-selection bias. Female CFOs may not be randomly assigned to firms. Firms with more favorable credit terms may be more likely to hire female CFOs. Therefore, a proper evaluation of the effect of female CFOs on bank loan contracts should take into account the endogeneity of the choice of female CFOs. To deal with this issue, we first use a Heckman’s two-stage self-selection model to control for the self-selection bias induced in firms’ choices of female CFOs.</p>
<p>In the first stage, we run a probit regression. The dependent variable is <italic>female CFOs</italic>. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Park, &amp; Wu (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X12452399">Huang and Kisgen (2010)</xref>, we include the firm size, leverage, profitability, tangibility, and market-to-book ratio in the regression. We also control for industry and year effects. In the second stage, we run OLS and logit regressions, as in Model 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148558X12452399">5</xref>, but include the inverse Mills ratio, which is obtained from the first-stage probit regression, to control for the endogeneity of the choice of female CFOs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148558X12452399">Table 6</xref> reports the results. We test log(<italic>spread</italic>), log(<italic>maturity</italic>), and <italic>secured</italic> (dummy) as dependent variables in columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We find that the estimated coefficients of three <italic>female CFOs</italic> in columns 1, 2, and 3 are −0.1210, 0.089, and −0.4105 and are significant at the 1%, 1%, and 5% levels, respectively, suggesting that our results hold after considering the endogeneity of the choice of female CFOs.</p>

<p>Note: This table presents the results of the Heckman two-stage self-selection model on the effect of female CFOs on the price, maturity, and collateral of bank loans. In the first stage, we run a probit regression by regressing the variable <italic>female CFOs</italic> on a set of firm characteristics. The table also reports the second stage ordinary least squares (OLS) and Logit regression results including inverse Mills ratio. The dependent variables are natural log of <italic>spread</italic>, which is the all-in spread drawn defined as the amount the borrower pays in basis points over LIBOR or LIBOR equivalent for each dollar drawn down; natural log of <italic>maturity</italic>, which is the maturity time (in months) of a loan; and <italic>secured</italic>, which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a loan is secured by collateral and is 0 otherwise. All other variables are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12452399">Tables 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">4</xref>.

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In our sample, only around 5% of firms have female CFOs. To compare fairly the two groups of firms (male- and female-CFO-led firms), we construct matched male CFO firms by applying a propensity score-matching approach. The matching begins with a logistic regression of the female CFO dummy variable on industry, year, firm size, and leverage. Then, we use the propensity scores obtained from the logistic estimation and perform a one-to-one nearest neighbor match with replacement. This procedure ensures that each female CFO firm is paired with a male CFO firm. Then, we obtain a new pooled sample that includes 356 observations with female CFOs and 356 matched observations with male CFOs.</p>
<p>The results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0148558X12452399">Table 7</xref>. Similar to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148558X12452399">Table 6</xref>, we test log(<italic>spread</italic>), log(<italic>maturity</italic>), and <italic>secured</italic> (dummy) as dependent variables in columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We find that the estimated coefficients of three <italic>female CFOs</italic> in columns 1, 2, and 3 are −0.117, 0.098, and −0.589, respectively, and are significant at different levels. The propensity score-matching approach results also confirm our previous findings and further mitigate the sample selection bias concern.</p>

<p>Note: This table presents ordinary least squares (OLS) and Logit regression results on the effect of female CFOs on the price, maturity, and collateral of bank loans by applying a propensity score-matching approach. The matching begins with a logistic regression of the <italic>Female CFO</italic> on year industry, firm size, and leverage. Then, we use the propensity scores obtained from logistic estimation and perform a one-to-one nearest neighbor match with replacement. The dependent variables are natural log of <italic>spread</italic>, which is the all-in spread drawn defined as the amount the borrower pays in basis points over London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or LIBOR equivalent for each dollar drawn down; natural log of <italic>maturity</italic>, which is the maturity time (in months) of a loan; and <italic>secured</italic>, which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a loan is secured by collateral and is 0 otherwise. All other variables are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12452399">Tables 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">4</xref>. Standard errors are adjusted for within-firm clustering. Absolute values of the heteroscedasticity robust <italic>t</italic>-statistics and <italic>z</italic>-statistics are in parentheses. Significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels are indicated by *, **, and ***, respectively.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>As we use panel data in our studies, unobservable time-variant factors may be correlated with bank loan terms, which would make our results spurious. To remove the effect of contemporaneous changes, we employ a differences-in-differences methodology. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148558X12452399">Francis, Hasan, Park, &amp; Wu (2010)</xref>, we first trace firms that change their CFOs from male to female (treated sample) and from male to male (control sample). We require each CFO to be in office for at least three consecutive years excluding the transition year. We focus on how male-to-female CFO changes affect bank loan terms, using male-to-male CFO change firms as the control group. The variable <italic>post</italic> is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a year is after a CFO transition year and 0 if a year is before a CFO transition year. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0148558X12452399">Table 8</xref>.</p>

<p>Note: This table presents ordinary least squares (OLS) and Logit regression results on the effect of female CFOs on the price, maturity, and collateral of bank loans by applying a differences-in-differences approach. We trace firms who change their CFOs from male to female (treated sample) and male to male (control group). We require each CFO to be in office consecutively for at least 3 years excluding the transition year. The dependent variables are natural log of <italic>spread</italic>, which is the all-in spread drawn defined as the amount the borrower pays in basis points over London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) or LIBOR equivalent for each dollar drawn down; natural log of <italic>maturity</italic>, which is the maturity time (in months) of a loan; and <italic>secured</italic>, which is a dummy variable that equals 1 if a loan is secured by collateral and is 0 otherwise. <italic>Post</italic> is a dummy variable, which equals 1 if a year is after CFO transition year and 0 if a year is before the CFO transition year. All other variables are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148558X12452399">Tables 1</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148558X12452399">4</xref>. Standard errors are adjusted for within-firm clustering. Absolute values of the heteroscedasticity robust <italic>t</italic>-statistics and <italic>z</italic>-statistics are in parentheses.

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The first column shows the test with log(<italic>spread</italic>) as the dependent variable. We find that the estimated coefficient of <italic>post</italic>, which captures the effect of male-to-male CFO transition on log(<italic>spread</italic>), is insignificant, indicating that there are no significant differences in bank loan prices between the pretransition period and the posttransition period for the control group. The estimated coefficient of the interaction term between <italic>post</italic> and <italic>female CFOs</italic>, which captures the incremental effect of male-to-female CFO transition on log(<italic>spread</italic>), is −0.111 and is significant at the 1% level. Hence, compared with male CFOs, female CFOs reduce bank loan spreads significantly after CFO transitions. Consistent results are also found in columns 2 and 3 when we use log(<italic>maturity</italic>) and <italic>secured</italic> (dummy) as the dependent variables. The results of the differences-in-differences approach demonstrate that our findings regarding the impact of female CFOs on bank loan contracts hold after considering the time-variant omitted variable bias. The results also suggest that female CFOs bring about, and not merely reflect, a reduced bank loan price and more favorable nonprice loan terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0148558X12452399">13</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In our earlier analysis, the unit of observation is individual loans. However, a borrower can obtain several loans in the same year, and these loans may not be independent. Treating these loans independently may overstate the statistical significance. To deal with this issue, we use a reduced sample in which we only keep one largest loan for each firm each year. We rerun our main analysis using this firm-level sample. The results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0148558X12452399">Table 9</xref>. Although the sample size is reduced from 8,986 to 5,480, the main results are qualitatively unchanged.</p>

<title>The Impact of Female CFOs on Major Firm Characteristics</title>
<p>In this article, we establish our hypotheses based on recent studies showing that female CFOs make more conservative corporate decisions and consequently lead to more favorable bank loan contracts. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148558X12452399">Table 3</xref>’s univariate test, we find that firms with female CFOs are more profitable and have a higher market-to-book ratio and a lower leverage level than firms without female CFOs. However, we could not reach the conclusion from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148558X12452399">Table 3</xref> that female CFOs affect those firm characteristics, and subsequently affect bank loan contract terms, as we do not show a causal link between female CFOs and those firm factors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0148558X12452399">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although examining the impact of the gender of CFOs on various corporate decisions is not the focus of this article, in this subsection, we try to provide some evidence to mitigate this causality concern. Similar to the robustness check in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0148558X12452399">Table 8</xref>, we trace firms that change their CFOs from male to female and from male to male. Then we plot the main firm characteristics from 3 years before to 3 years after CFO transitions. In this way, we gain a visual sense of how firm characteristics are affected by CFO gender changes. For comparison, we also plot the changes in the same variables for the male-to-male CFO transition sample.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148558X12452399">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows leverage levels 3 years before and 3 years after the CFO transition. We see that male-to-female CFO transition firms have higher leverage levels than male-to-male CFO transition firms in general. However, for male-to-female transition firms, we see a significant and continuous drop in leverage after female CFOs are hired. For male-to-male transition firms, the leverage remains relatively stable after new male CFOs are hired. The finding shows that female CFOs tend to reduce the firm leverage level after they are hired, consistent with the finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148558X12452399">Huang and Kisgen (2010)</xref>. Earlier studies show that leverage is an important indicator of firm risk, and firms with higher leverage levels pay more when they borrow (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148558X12452399">Graham, Li, and Qiu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148558X12452399">Strahan, 1999</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148558X12452399">Figure 1(b)</xref> plots how the market-to-book ratio changes following CFO transitions. The trends of the market-to-book ratio for the firms belonging to the two different samples are opposite. For male-to-female transition firms, the ratio keeps increasing following the transition from male to female CFOs, whereas for male-to-male CFO transition firms there is a slight decline. The impact of female CFOs on the market-to-book ratio also has implications for bank loan contracting. From the accounting perspective, the market-to-book ratio is a proxy for conservatism, with a higher market-to-book ratio indicating more conservative accounting. Previous studies find that firms with more conservative accounting enjoy more favorable bank loan terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148558X12452399">Sunder, Sunder, &amp; Zhang, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0148558X12452399">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148558X12452399">Figure 1(c)</xref> shows the change in profitability following CFO transitions. Consistent with the finding in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148558X12452399">Table 3</xref>, we find that in general male-to-female-transition firms have higher profitability than male-to-male-transition firms. However, the trends of profitability for the two samples are very similar. For both male-to-male firms and male-to-female firms, the profitability keeps decreasing before CFO transitions. After CFO changes, the profitability increases slowly but not significantly. From this figure, we do not find obvious differences between male and female CFOs regarding their impact on profitability. However, we should note that we could not conclude that female CFOs do not affect firm performance, as we do not provide a strong statistical analysis here.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148558X12452399">Figure 1(d)</xref>, we plot how tangibility changes following CFO transitions. We find that before the CFO transitions, male-to-male-transition firms seem to have had a higher level of tangibility when compared with male-to-female-transition firms. However, after new CFOs are hired, female CFOs increase the tangibility level continuously, whereas male CFOs tend to reduce the tangibility level gradually. This figure indicates that female CFOs are more likely to invest in tangible assets than male CFOs. Tangibility also has a very important implication for bank loan contracting, as tangible assets are critical for lenders to recover when borrowers default. Earlier studies find a strong negative relationship between tangibility and the cost of bank loans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148558X12452399">Bharath, Sunder, &amp; Sunder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148558X12452399">Graham, Li, and Qiu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148558X12452399">Strahan, 1999</xref>). Here we provide another possible channel through which female CFOs affect bank loan contracting.</p>
<p>In general, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148558X12452399">Figure 1</xref> shows that firms under the control of female CFOs are more likely to invest in tangible assets, decrease the leverage level, and increase the market-to-book ratio. These findings could somehow help explain the channels through which female CFOs affect bank loan contracting.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we examine whether the gender of CFOs affects bank loan contracting. Based on recent empirical work showing that female CFOs report more conservative and high-quality accounting numbers, and are more likely to reduce the risk level of the firm, we hypothesize that as inside lenders, banks should recognize the benefits of female CFOs in reducing information risk ex ante and default risk ex post, and reward borrowers with female CFOs with more favorable loan contract terms.</p>
<p>Our empirical results support our hypotheses. We find that, in our sample, firms with female CFOs, on average, enjoy about 14 basis points lower bank loan prices than firms with male CFOs. In addition, loans given to female-CFO-led companies have 3.8-month-longer maturities and are 8% less likely to be required to provide collateral when compared with loans given to male-CFO-led companies. In addition, we do not find that the presence of female CEOs and other female executives affects bank loan contract terms, suggesting that banks view CFOs, but not CEOs or other executives, as the primary executives who determine the quality of accounting information, and in turn affect their lending decisions.</p>
<p>We further comprehensively examine the potential endogeneity concern in our study. We perform a firm and year fixed-effect model, a Heckman two-stage self-selection model, a propensity score-matching method, a differences-in-differences approach, and a firm-level analysis to test potential issues such as unobservable time-variant and time-invariant omitted variable bias, self-selection bias, causality problem, and interdependence among individual loans. Our results hold to all these robustness checks.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first one that relates the gender of CFOs and other top executives with banks’ lending decision making. The results further our understanding of the determinants of the cost of capital in general, and the cost of bank loans in particular. In addition, our article tests the gender effect from the informed and sophisticated private lenders’ perspective, and provides some evidence of systematic differences between men and women with regard to their risk attitudes.</p>
<p>However, we acknowledge that the results of our article should be considered in the context of the study’s inherent limitations. First, although we find supportive evidence for our “risk-averse” hypothesis, we still cannot rule out the “discrimination” hypothesis in the literature. Due to the data limitations, our study only focuses on large loans (at least US$1 million) granted to public companies. The discrimination effect may be less prominent in such kinds of lending decisions. Therefore, it is hard to generalize our findings to small business loans and personal loans. Furthermore, to examine gender discrimination in the credit market, it is very important to focus not only on the interest rates and other loan terms but also on the availability of private debt financing, such as the denial rates of bank loans, as denial rates are the first-stage evidence to test whether women are discriminated against in the credit market. This may be another drawback to our study due to the data limitations.</p>
<p>Second, in our study, as we do not have detailed information about the individual lenders who are in charge of the lending decision making, we only consider the gender effect of the borrowers, and not the gender effect of the lenders. If differences in “risk aversion” do exist between men and women, it is highly possible that male and female lending officers make different judgments on their lending decision making. Therefore, a more accurate research design should simultaneously take into consideration the gender of both borrowers and lenders.</p>
<p>Third, based on earlier studies, in our article we propose two possible explanations for why banks may consider the gender of CFOs in their lending decision making. One is the accounting information risk explanation and another is the default risk explanation. However, we do not know exactly which factor drives the observed gender effect. In addition, as the research on the gender of top executives is still in its early stages, there may be some other alternative explanations for the observed effect of CFO gender that we do not consider in our article but that are considered by lenders when making their decisions. For example, the gender of CFOs may not only affect discount rates but also affect firms’ performance, which is also a primary factor that determines the cost of capital. Further research could examine the relationship between female CFOs and firm performance, and whether the public market recognizes the gender differences between male and female CFOs as well as other top executives with regard to their risk attitudes.</p>

<p>We test whether multicollinearity problems exist for all the regressions presented in this section. We find that all the variance inflation factors (VIF) are far below the threshold indicator of 10.
