<abstract>
<p>The years 1939–1953 were important both for the development of Garfinkel’s ideas and for the discipline of sociology more generally. But very little is known about Garfinkel’s work during this period of rapid disciplinary change – or of his close relationship then with many intellectual leaders in sociology, psychology, philosophy and economics. Filling in details of his work during this period promises to improve the understanding of his important contribution.</p>

<p>In 1967, <italic>Studies in Ethnomethodology</italic> became an instant sociological classic, embroiling its author simultaneously in great acclaim and enduring censure. With the publication of <italic>Studies</italic>, Harold Garfinkel seemed quite literally to burst upon the scene. Because it posed serious challenges to the conception of sociology, and society, prevailing in the 1960s, <italic>Studies</italic> resonated with and has often been identified with that decade and its concerns. However, it was by no means the first of Garfinkel’s influential publications, and he had in fact been laying the groundwork for decades.</p>
<p>While this convergence of <italic>Studies</italic> with the 1960s probably enhanced interest in ethnomethodology in the short term, it also led to an unfortunate association in people’s minds between Garfinkel, ethnomethodology and countercultural ideas and anti-intellectual and anti-theoretical tendencies. Ironically, given his explicit concern with morality, Garfinkel was at the same time also portrayed as advocating a position of moral neutrality contrary to the interests of anyone seriously committed to democratic society.</p>
<p>As a scholar whose early work focused directly on questions of race inequality, who gave us the first studies of the power of labels to disenfranchise people (by race, gender, religion and politics), and the first study of a transgendered identity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468795X13477292">1</xref></sup> Garfinkel was firmly committed to questions of morality and justice. His research at North Carolina took issues of race as its focus and his research at Harvard focused on inequalities associated with political and religious categorization. His Ph.D. dissertation proposed that persons with marginal identities – in that case highly motivated Jewish students – would suffer the most from interactional incongruencies.</p>
<p>Garfinkel’s famous Trust argument builds on this idea and ultimately has the consequence that all coherent social objects and identities are inherently moral objects. They can only be made by persons working together with mutual respect for conditions of reciprocity and equality. The argument makes one of the most important contributions to the question of how coherences can be sustained – and limits on inequalities self-regulated – in modern democratic publics. The theoretical implications are profound – and because marginal status is consequential for the acceptance of persons into reciprocities of practice, the Trust requirement is always relevant to social justice issues.</p>
<p>In order to disentangle the misconceptions and get some sense of where they came from, I will look at Garfinkel’s earliest work against the backdrop of the time when he first committed himself to sociology and began to craft his own unique position in the field.</p>
<p>Unlike many who are assumed to be his contemporaries, Garfinkel’s ideas have their origins in the prewar and war years. Situating Garfinkel in the 1940s not only clarifies issues, but also sheds light on a critical moment in the development of sociology. While the 1930s had been a time of serious debate and discussion, the 1940s brought rapid change and a narrowing of disciplinary interests in an effort to meet the challenges of the Second World War. Garfinkel was positioned at the center of disciplinary discussion at the time (in the relatively elite environments of Chapel Hill, Harvard and Princeton) and was working side by side with key disciplinary leaders as the future of sociology was being decided. While his approach to sociology posed new questions and framed existing ones in new ways, and would later directly oppose the established approach to sociology, he can be seen in these early years working with established leaders and responding directly to their problems and concerns.</p>
<p>Garfinkel belongs to the generation that came to maturity before the Second World War, having entered college in 1935, completed his MA degree at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1942, undertaken a field study of Bastrop, Texas, that summer, and engaged in sociological research for the Army and Army Air Force at Gulfport Field, Mississippi, from 1942 to 1946. He held a prestigious position at Princeton University from 1951 to 1953. Garfinkel was 35 years old and had authored more than a dozen significant manuscripts by the time he completed his Ph.D. with Talcott Parsons (‘The Perception of the Other: A Study in Social Order’) at Harvard in June of 1952.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468795X13477292">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering Garfinkel’s work in the context of the sociological debates of the 1930s and the disciplinary transformation of the 1940s rather than situating it in the 1950s and 1960s sheds new light on important relationships, such as those with Talcott Parsons, Erving Goffman and Harvey Sacks. Links emerge between Garfinkel and important scholars of his own generation (including Jerome Bruner, Herbert Simon and Joseph Weizenbaum). His work with Wilbert Moore at Princeton on the Organizational Behavior Project from 1951 to 1953 dispels the picture of Garfinkel as challenging an established hegemony. It was important work laying the groundwork for an alternative natural language approach to communication, information, computing and decision-making. Paul Lazarsfeld, Oskar Morgenstern and Gregory Bateson (members of the famous Macy Foundation Cybernetics Group) participated in the seminars and conferences that Garfinkel (and his friend and colleague Elliott Mishler) organized to explore these questions, as did Herbert Simon, Kenneth Burke, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Schutz and other influential thinkers.</p>
<p>The scientific possibilities were still open and the disciplinary hegemony that Garfinkel’s work would later challenge had not yet solidified when he formulated his ideas. Garfinkel was criticizing and he was always asking revolutionary questions. But, to a surprising degree in the early years, he can also be seen responding to the various calls for action issued by prominent sociologists in support of the war effort during and just after the Second World War (1940–1948). These were calls to elaborate the status of social facts empirically, in ways that supported the solution to common-sense problems, to work together in scientific teams, to produce a cumulative body of knowledge, all of which would give sociology increased credibility as a science.</p>
<p>The country Garfinkel served between December 1942 and January 1946 was fighting for the liberation of Europe and its Jewish citizens from Hitler. As a Jewish American committed to issues of racial justice, Garfinkel devoted his efforts entirely to wartime training and research during this period. His studies of ‘leadership’ and ‘labelling’ during the war were groundbreaking, and his resulting good relations with the Army Air Force supported his research at UCLA for many years.</p>
<p>After the war his work at Harvard with Bruner and Parsons, and at Princeton with Wilbert Moore and Herbert Simon, would further involve him with the central questions and the most prominent scholars of the day in a number of disciplines (psychology, economics, philosophy, information sciences, game theory and sociology). His collaborations in the 1950s with Robert Boguslaw and Warren Pelton, and in the 1960s with Erving Goffman, Joseph Schneidman, Harvey Sacks, with Weizenbaum’s team at MIT and with Egon Bittner once again involved him in important cross-disciplinary studies. This was a defining moment in the development of sociological thought and Garfinkel was right there at the centre of it. Ironically, as important as these efforts were, their recognition has been greater outside of sociology than in.</p>
<p>This has always seemed something of a puzzle to me, but I think that changes which took place in the discipline of sociology as it reorganized during the war years resulted in a certain rigidity of perspective that not only explains much about this oversight – but also the changing position of Garfinkel relative to it.</p>
<p>The Second World War had presented unprecedented challenges to American social sciences. In occupied Europe, scientific research had largely come to a halt or been co-opted by dictatorships. In the United States, where universities remained open, scientific research not only continued but also redoubled its efforts, joined by scientists from Europe. In 1939, the American Sociological Association (ASA) and its presidents and administrators began organizing to support the war and peace efforts in ways that were both institutional and substantive. A new focus was placed on becoming a well-respected and unified science.</p>
<p>Changes in the conception of science and scientific research that took place as a consequence of this reorganization and unification were consequential. The immediate intent was to increase the likelihood that sociology would be taken seriously as a science and make a meaningful contribution to the war. But, in fact, deep changes in the central ideas of the discipline resulted. A core group of disciplinary elites emerged who pushed sociology towards a unified theoretical conception of social science heavily reliant on both functionalism and statistical methods. This new view of sociology sought to eliminate competing perspectives.</p>
<p>Like other prewar thinkers with whom he associated in the late 1940s and early 1950s (including Jerome Bruner, Talcott Parsons and Herbert Simon), Garfinkel challenged the new positivist and reductionist direction that was being taken by social sciences generally, and focused on articulating the core ideas of sociology in a new and challenging way essentially to rescue social science.</p>
<p>While response to the war had narrowed the focus of sociology as a discipline and sought to eliminate earlier interests in interaction, the research undertaken by Garfinkel during the war years (1942–1946) deepened his appreciation of the relevance of interaction (and communication) to essential questions of work, communication and information. The result was to put him at odds with the discipline he had already embraced.</p>
<p>The oversimplified view of social science that developed in the late 1940s took an increasingly harsh view of attempts to ground social science on the analysis of social interaction. This not only negatively impacted ethnomethodology and the development of a focus on interaction in sociology more generally, but also inhibited promising research in other disciplines that had been developing an interactional focus.</p>
<p>Although his friends Jerry Bruner (in psychology) and Herbert Simon (in economics) went on to have a huge impact on their respective disciplines (Simon winning the Nobel Prize in 1978), they faced similar resistance to their ideas. As late as the 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468795X13477292">Simon (1997)</xref> continued to complain about this resistance and to wonder about its source. As deeply as they challenged their disciplines, however, Bruner arguing for a cultural psychology focused on the role of narrative in organizing cognitive processes, and Simon insisting on empirical examination of actual decision-making in real-world situations of ‘bounded rationality’, both left essential disciplinary assumptions intact. They could at least be interpreted as assuming a basic ability to communicate. They also left the epistemic object and the rational actor to some extent in place.</p>
<p>Garfinkel, by contrast, took the position that without mutual cooperation – Trust – in the use of shared constitutive practices, social objects do not exist and even basic communication is not possible. Without cooperative constitutive practices, there are no social objects, no meanings and no identified actors. In challenging the epistemic character of social objects – including language – and treating all social objects including symbols and ‘information’ as dependent on constitutive sequential practices that must be engaged in cooperatively by competent identified ‘members’ of practices, Garfinkel challenged the adequacy of narrative and ‘bounded rationality’ to explain the phenomenon. Going farther than his friends, he experienced greater resistance. The irony is that recognizing the constitutive character of social facts shows human reason to be less limited than conventional assumptions allow, and issues involving communication to be more important. So, while Garfinkel’s challenge to conventional thinking cut deeper, the potential of his approach is even more significant.</p>
<p>Key here is the relationship in which Garfinkel stood to the discipline of sociology while working out his own unique view.</p>
<p>Garfinkel entered Graduate School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill just as the war and the transformation of the discipline got underway. The year Garfinkel entered graduate school, in 1939, was the year Edwin Sutherland disappointed elite members of the ASA by focusing his Presidential Address on white-collar criminality, ignoring the war in Europe. He would be the last to do so. The problem of white-collar crime was in Sutherland’s view relevant to the stability of international business, and he argued that its uncontrolled character was contributing to the deterioration of international relations. But even though Sutherland’s speech addressed those implications, his failure to explicitly address the war or to urge the need for sociology to change and become more scientific earned him criticism.</p>
<p>In fact, Sutherland’s satisfaction with his scientific grip on his problem was likely as problematic to disciplinary leaders as his failure to mention the war, and this makes the reception of his argument relevant for understanding the position Garfinkel found himself occupying in 1939. Garfinkel was himself committed to fieldwork and his commitment to deep immersion in the field would only intensify over the course of his career. He did not think that giving up hands-on contact with social situations in favour of analytic abstractions was a scientific step forward and he would criticize the idea of science adopted by ASA elites during this period for the rest of his life. Studies of science by Garfinkel and his students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468795X13477292">Mike Lynch [1997]</xref>) would in the 1980s become instrumental in inspiring a new understanding of science practices.</p>
<p>The idea that the Second World War would never have occurred if sociology had been sufficiently scientific to prescribe an antidote to social problems was a popular one expressed by several presidents of ASA in their annual addresses between 1940 and 1946. That sociology – and American sociology at that – could be held responsible for a war in Europe and that its definition of itself as a science would be singled out for blame seems quite strange in retrospect. But the idea was embraced by important and outspoken disciplinary leaders at the time and it became a strong force behind the move to improve sociology as a science. While it seemed clear to many that the problem was simply that sociology had failed to be sufficiently scientific to solve the problems, Sutherland, a Symbolic Interactionist and qualitative methodologist, was and continued to be satisfied with his science the way he practised it. In his view the problems were known – the issue was just that no one was doing anything to fix them. This difference in viewpoint unfortunately increased the perceived differences between qualitative and quantitative camps in a way that confused questions of patriotism and support for the war effort with science.</p>
<p>This was a big change. At North Carolina as the war began, the Chicago School and its focus on ethnographic field studies was still a dominant force. The sociology Garfinkel fell in love with there was a multifaceted discipline, with many widely divergent theories and methods. North Carolina was well known as a centre for ‘modelling’, but social theory there was taught under Howard W. Odum with an emphasis on the social action theory of Florian Znaniecki and W. I. Thomas and the perspective of the actor and interaction inspired by the work of Znaniecki, Thomas, Charles Horton Cooley and George Herbert Mead. Questions of social justice were actively debated and considered essential scientific work.</p>
<p>As social theory came increasingly to rely on theoretical generalizations and statistics, Garfinkel would produce demonstrations of how and why generalizations and statistics distorted the understanding of social order and the social orders of sense making. As disciplinary leaders argued that social justice was not a scientific topic, Garfinkel pursued his interests in social justice.</p>
<p>In the early 1940s, Garfinkel had worked with important social thinkers who were committed to questions of morality and racial equality, and his choice of Talcott Parsons at Harvard as a Graduate Advisor would pair him with one of mid-century sociology’s best known champions of democracy.</p>
<p>Garfinkel’s first two publications, written in 1940 and 1942 at North Carolina (published in 1940 and 1949), examine the social processes that produce and sustain racial inequality in the American South. His later focus on interactional processes, and in particular on the reciprocity commitment, social skills, rules, practices and devices that facilitate meaningful cooperation, would extend that interest.</p>
<p>Although usually disregarded in assessments of his work on race – which characterize Garfinkel as ‘White’ – it is important to realize that Garfinkel in the 1940s was identified as a minority scholar and he devoted much of his intellectual career to problems of marginality and incongruency. He experienced the problems of marginality at first hand. In the 1940s (especially in the American South, where Garfinkel lived from 1939 through June 1946), Jews were not considered White and accommodations were often not open to them.</p>
<p>Garfinkel’s first publication, ‘Color Trouble’, appeared in the journal <italic>Opportunity</italic> (a publication of the Urban League) in May 1940. That he submitted it to the Urban League is itself significant. It presents Garfinkel’s field observations of a racial incident that occurred on a bus he was riding when African American riders did not move to the back of the bus. His analysis illustrates how structures of institutional accountability (narrative accounting practices) can enable organizational workers to violate the reciprocity expectations of ordinary interaction. Given that the bus driver has a job with obligations that must be met – one of the most important of which is to keep to a schedule – the power of his institutionally acceptable racial account, that the bus has ‘Color Trouble’, which Garfinkel compared to things like ‘the bus got a flat tire’, enabled the driver to enforce unjust rules about race without penalty to himself. Color could be rendered as just another kind of trouble with the bus. It is the insidious character of such institutional accounts in undermining Trust relations that enables the bus driver to produce the appearance of ‘patience’ while constituting the minority riders as ‘troublemakers’. Institutional accounts privilege ‘insiders’ over ‘marginal’ persons in just this way.</p>
<p>Without such accountable devices, it is very difficult to disrupt the Trust requirement at the foundation of interaction because the need to sustain mutual intelligibility imposes reciprocity obligations that work against disruption. In institutional accountability, however, the procedure can be asymmetrical. The minority person does not need to agree with their classification for it to become a social fact. In Garfinkel’s later study of degradation ceremonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468795X13477292">Garfinkel, 1956</xref>), he is working with an example of a situation that is symmetrical. It is a study of how ritual can enable an undermining of fairness in interaction in which all parties do agree. Many later ethnomethodological studies document practices of institutional accountability.</p>
<p>Garfinkel’s second major work, his MA thesis of 1942 on ‘Inter- and Intra-Racial Homicide’, an abridged version of which was published in <italic>Social Forces</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468795X13477292">Garfinkel, 1949</xref>), focused on how courtroom outcomes that appeared statistically to be ‘fair’ were actually based on racialized accounts produced in the courtroom as part of the trial. At a time when the discipline was advocating a turn towards statistics, Garfinkel was demonstrating the pitfalls of this approach – particularly in getting at issues of discrimination. The assumption that work based on statistics is somehow ‘objective’ is simply wrong when the numbers in question refer to things like trial outcomes that are the end product of an institutional accounting process.</p>
<p>Garfinkel’s analysis focused on the narrative accounts given by persons involved officially in murder cases in ten county courthouses (including judges, prosecutors, defense lawyers, witnesses). He found that accounts produced for the court – which were highly racialized – played a significant role in determining the outcome of cases. But when looked at statistically, the distribution of punishments by race looked ‘fair’. In other words, the results of these institutional accounts had the effect of neutralizing each other so that statistically it looked as if race were not playing an important role in deciding cases, when in fact it was playing a determining role. This early critique of statistics remains essential.</p>
<p>At Harvard, Garfinkel continued to gravitate towards scholars whose aim was to explain the possibility of democracy and sort out the effects of competing influences in modern societies (Talcott Parsons, Jerome Bruner, Robert Bales and Wilbert Moore). Garfinkel was also interested in what he argued were higher levels of incongruity faced by minorities and marginal persons. In this regard he read the work of gestalt psychologists and theorists of perception, including Adelbert Ames, Kurt Lewin, Egon Brunswik and Aron Gurwitsch.</p>
<p>During his first semester at Harvard in fall 1946, Garfinkel wrote a paper for circulation to a seminar he took with Parsons in which he argued that a sociological theory of objects was necessary before it would be possible to articulate a workable theory of social action. He also argued in this paper that Parsons’ functionalism is a tautology (a paper that he gave directly to Parsons – who continued to work with him). Among other things, Garfinkel wrote that a theory of social action needed to be able to squarely address the question of how social objects are created and sustained in social contexts that are not characterized by what he called ‘tribal’ consensus.</p>
<p>A theory of action also needed to take the handling of incongruities into account if it were to explain the possibility of sustained coherences in a modern democratic society that lacked social consensus. In pursuit of this question, Garfinkel worked with scholars whose main interest was in explaining how shared meaning was sustained often in the face of huge incongruencies (Jerome Bruner, Herbert Simon, Gregory Bateson, Alfred Schutz, Aron Gurwitsch and Kenneth Burke).</p>
<p>During his second semester at Harvard in spring 1947, Garfinkel engaged in a research project on American attitudes towards Russia under the direction of the influential psychologist Jerome Bruner, who introduced the social, cognitive and communicative implications of shared narrative to psychology. Garfinkel wrote two manuscripts based on this research (‘Notes on the Information Apperception Test’ and the ‘The Red as an Ideal Object’). Bruner had been in Europe with military intelligence just after D-Day and one of the tasks he faced was dealing with French towns as they were liberated from the Germans. Interviewing townspeople, Bruner realized that a shared narrative view of the world could be a very powerful thing. For these people it had enabled a view of daily life under Nazi rule that made many things seem ordinary and acceptable which would have been inconceivable in ‘normal’ times.</p>
<p>The idea that a narrative framing of the world shapes cognition, what a person actually perceives and how he or she reasons about it – the foundation of Bruner’s psychology – is similar to Garfinkel’s conception of ‘cognitive style’, social categories of identity and action that are constitutive of perception, understanding and action. Notes taken by Garfinkel in a binder corresponding to a class he took with Bruner in 1947 suggest that Bruner’s approach had a profound effect on his thinking, and Bruner’s name continues to appear in connection with later meetings and research efforts that Garfinkel organized and participated in through the 1960s.</p>
<p>Garfinkel refers repeatedly in his Harvard writing to the difficulties faced by categories of marginal persons he referred to as Jews, Negroes, ‘Reds’ and Criminals, expecting the performance of self to be more difficult, the Trust condition more tenuous, and the consequences of failed reciprocity more serious for members of marginal groups. His inclusion of Criminals as a category of marginal persons goes some way toward explaining his interest in criminology. He would teach courses in criminology at Princeton in 1951–1952 and while doing so outline a criminology text. He later worked with Egon Bittner, Harvey Sacks, Aron Cicourel, David Sudnow and others on issues related to crime and policing.</p>
<p>From the time he arrived at Harvard, Garfinkel remained in a sustained engagement with Parsons and his approach to action theory. Garfinkel took the view that sociology needed a theory of action, but that theory needed to focus on what is going on between people who are actively taking account of one another while cooperating to make social objects together – which is how he conceived interaction.</p>
<p>The big problem with Parsons’ approach (and that of other action theorists), as Garfinkel saw it, was that it formulated social action in terms of the actor’s point of view (and the observer’s view of the actor’s point of view). The individual (his or her motivations, values and goals) then became the focus, and the interaction itself was nowhere in sight. Ironically, the actor as an active participant in interaction was lost in the same way.</p>
<p>Garfinkel worked to persuade Parsons that this problem required a remedy, and he collaborated with him for many years as Parsons attempted to reformulate his ‘pattern variables’ to meet the case. In spite of revisions, the pattern variables remained heavily focused on individual motives and values. But it is important to note that Parsons took Garfinkel’s ideas seriously. Parsons asked Garfinkel to work with him on his response to Dubin on pattern variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468795X13477292">Parsons, 1960</xref>), and they met during the academic year 1959–1960 for discussions of that argument. Terminology proposed by Garfinkel with regard to the actor in his 1948 manuscript (for example, ‘identified actor’ and ‘oriented actor’) appears in the final version of Parsons’ text (which was edited by Garfinkel).</p>
<p>The fact Garfinkel and Parsons continued to have a working relationship through the 1960s will be news to many. There are recordings of several meetings between the two in 1959 and 1960 and again in 1964 (with others present). I have been told that there is a letter in Parsons’ archive in which he wrote that people would be surprised at how close Garfinkel’s thinking was to his own. Garfinkel returned the compliment, in the preface to <italic>Studies</italic>, singling Parsons out for special praise: ‘Parsons’ work, particularly, remains awesome for the penetrating depth and unfailing precision of its practical sociological reasoning on the constituent tasks of the problem of social order and its solutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468795X13477292">Garfinkel, 1967</xref>: ix). Why more about their relationship is not known is another of the mysteries surrounding these two giants of social thought.</p>
<p>Garfinkel’s innovation on the idea of constitutive practices as members’ methods involves a significant shift in perspective, and his insistence that constitutive processes be established in empirical details continues to revolutionize the understanding of social facts. He worked tirelessly over many decades, and in the face of constant misunderstanding, criticism and censure, to make his contribution to the discipline of sociology that he fell in love with at the age of 20 when he held Parsons’ <italic>Structure of Social Action</italic> in his hands for the first time.</p>
