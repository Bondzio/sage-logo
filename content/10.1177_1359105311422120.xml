<p>This study examined age differences in support, BMI, and HbA1c among African American patients with type 2 diabetes. Participants were 158 African American adults with type 2 diabetes. Average HbA1c was 1% higher among patients aged 20–49 than patients 60–77, and double the number of younger patients had a BMI ≥35 than older patients. Younger patients reported less trust in their physician and greater disagreement with recommendations. They reported relying less on partners, greater unresolved conflict with partners around diabetes, and less church involvement. The association between age and HbA1c was partially mediated by patients’ trust of their physician.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Among adults, the average age of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is decreasing rapidly: in 2000 it was approximately 46 years of age—six years lower than in 1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311422120">Koopman, Mainous, Diaz, &amp; Geesey, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, in 2007 it was estimated that almost one in five newly diagnosed patients with diabetes was between 20 and 39 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311422120">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008</xref>). This suggests that type 2 diabetes can no longer be considered a disease primarily of the elderly.</p>
<p>Patients diagnosed at younger ages will have a longer duration of hyperglycemic exposure and will be at higher risk for disease complications, such as end-organ damage, than older patients. Furthermore, several studies have reported that younger adult type 2 patients were more likely than older adult patients to have poorer glycemic control, higher BMI, higher levels of depression, poorer self-care behavior, and greater life stress, above and beyond the effect of potential confounding variables, such as the number of years since diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311422120">Hessler, Fisher, Mullan, Glasgow, &amp; Masharani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311422120">Scott, Von Korff, Alonso, Angermeyer, &amp; Bromet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311422120">Toobert, Hampsen, &amp; Glasgow, 2000</xref>). Very little is known about this growing group of younger adult patients and the reasons for these age differences. Although biological and genetic factors are undoubtedly involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311422120">Li et al., 2006</xref>), lifestyle and a broad array of personal and cultural factors also need to be considered.</p>
<p>Approximately 12% of all adult African Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes and type 2 diabetes is 1.2–2.3 times more prevalent among African Americans than European Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311422120">Harris, 2001</xref>). African Americans also have a higher likelihood of developing diabetes-related complications, suffering from greater disability due to diabetes complications and experiencing higher rates of diabetes-related mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311422120">Brody, Jack, Murry, Landers-Potts, &amp; Liburd, 2001</xref>). Only a few studies have examined age differences among patients with diabetes within the African American community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311422120">El-Kebbi and colleagues (2003)</xref> reported that younger adult age was linked to both higher HbA1c and BMI, and that younger patients showed relatively less improvement in HbA1c at follow-up appointments. These initial findings suggest that younger adult African Americans with type 2 are at considerable risk for negative diabetes-related outcomes, and that greater attention is needed to inform intervention efforts and the design of care programs for this population.</p>
<p>Two potential explanations for these observed age differences in this community have been offered. First, family and community engagement have been consistently cited by African American patients as a primary source of assistance and support for diabetes management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311422120">Chesla et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311422120">Samuel-Hodge et al., 2000</xref>). One potential explanation of the observed age differences is that there may be fewer age-appropriate familial and community resources and supports available for younger than older patients. Close family members and friends may be unprepared to provide the necessary assistance to younger patients at a time when these adults are expected to be healthy and in the prime of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311422120">Carter-Edwards, Skelly, Cagle, &amp; Appel, 2004</xref>). A second hypothesis concerns the relationship younger patients have with their healthcare provider or healthcare system. Among African American patients, problems around patient trust in providers and costs of healthcare have been raised as key concerns in focus groups and have been associated with negative health-related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311422120">Jacobs, Rolle, Ferrans, Whitaker, &amp; Warnecke, 2006</xref>). Studies have found that African American patients have less access, less knowledge of treatment, greater perceived provider racism, fewer African American physicians to see, and higher patient awareness of past experiments—such as the Tuskegee Syphilis study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311422120">Gamble, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311422120">LaVeist, Nickerson, &amp; Bowie, 2000</xref>) than other patient groups. These themes may be even more prominent for younger adult patients, as they may not be as familiar with the healthcare system, may have less frequent visits to their provider, and may not have the benefit of a long-term relationship with a healthcare team in which provider trust has been built than older patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311422120">Campbell, Ramsay, &amp; Green, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study we first sought to document previously found differences in HbA1c and BMI by age; and then to assess possible reasons for age differences across two key areas of potential support: patients’ report of their family and community assistance and support, and their trust in and agreement with their health care team. We hypothesized that indices of family/community support and relationship with physician would explain some of the differential association between BMI and glycemic control based on age. Findings from this study will help identify key areas to address in clinical programs serving this high risk population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1359105311422120" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients were recruited from community medical groups and diabetes education centers in an urban West Coast setting. Inclusion criteria were: patients with type 2 diabetes; patients with T2DM (based on clinic registry) who self-identify as African American, between ages 25 and 80; read and speak English fluently; no diabetes complications that severely limit functional status; no diagnosis of psychosis or dementia, born in the United States; and an identifiable family health partner who was either a spouse, primary relative (parent, sibling, adult child) or someone the patient considered to be family. Letters were sent to each patient by the health care setting at which they relieved diabetes care, followed by telephone screening. For eligible patients, an appointment was made in the patient’s home, our office, or a community setting to explain the project, collect informed consent and begin assessment. Screening identified 300 eligible patients, 205 of whom agreed to participate (68%). Key reasons for non participation were work or family commitments and lack of interest in the study.</p>
<p>Patients met with an African American Research Assistant for two home visits (about 1.5 hours each) that included an interview, questionnaires, and measures of height and weight. Patients completed a 45-minute mail-back questionnaire, and visited a community laboratory for collection of blood specimens. Data were collected between 2001 and 2003, and analyzed in 2010.</p>

<title>Familial support</title>
<p>Because unique variations in family configuration occur in the African American community, partners were defined broadly to include “individuals with strong emotional bonds living together or in geographic proximity” to allow us to include African American families who match those who reside in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311422120">Williams, Auslander, Houston, Krebil,&amp; Haire-Joshu, 2001</xref>). Patient- identified partners could be a spouse or romantic partner, a close relative (e.g., adult offspring, sibling), or an individual who was considered to be family (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311422120">Table 1</xref>). Assessment of patient-reported partner support included: the degree to which patients relied on their partner across five domains: guidance, finances, practical matters, health matters, and companionship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311422120">Chiriboga, &amp; Thurnher, 1980</xref>) (five-items, alpha =.85; items ranging from 1 = “very much” to 3 = “hardly at all”); positive conflict resolution skills with their partner about diabetes management issues with items adapted from Tschann and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311422120">Tschann, Flores, Pasch, &amp; Marin, 1999</xref>) (5-items, alpha = .80; ranging from 1 = “rarely or never” to 4 = “always”) (e.g., when we have a difference of opinion about diabetes, we compromise); and unresolved conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311422120">Tschann, Flores, Pasch, &amp; Marin, 1999</xref>) (five-items, alpha = .90; ranging from 1 = “rarely or never” to 7 = “always”) assessed the level of diabetes-specific conflict with a partner that is not resolved (e.g., after an argument about diabetes with your partner, how often do you find yourself arguing about the same thing soon after).</p>

<title>Data analytic plan</title>
<p>Three patient age groups were formed, balanced by size and based on those used in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311422120">El-Kebbi et al., 2003</xref>): younger adults (29–49 years), middle-aged adults (50–59 years), and older adults (60–77 years). Key patient demographics were compared across groups using chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests. Patient biological measures (HbA1c and BMI), assessments of relationship with healthcare system, and family and community support scores were compared across age groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Analyses were controlled for potentially confounding patient demographics including: gender, education, income, number of years since diagnosis, and whether patients were currently taking insulin. As a virtually identical pattern of findings emerged when additionally controlling for BMI, results not controlling for BMI are reported. Planned post-hoc comparisons of the three age groups were conducted on outcomes following ANCOVA analyses using Least Square Difference (LSD) tests. Two sets of ANCOVA models were tested to examine whether (1) family/community support variables and (2) physician/healthcare variables related to age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311422120">Table 2</xref>), mediated the association between age and HbA1c or BMI. Interactions between age group and patient demographics on biological measures, family and community support, and relationship with the healthcare system were also explored.</p>

<p>Of 205 recruited African American patients, 46 withdrew from the study primarily because of time constraints and one participant had incomplete data, leaving a final sample of 158 patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311422120">Table 1</xref>). The majority was female (60%), and relatively well-educated (74% had completed vocational school or some college). Seventy percent were on oral medications, 24% were taking insulin, and 6% were managing diabetes through diet and exercise. Mean age was 54 years and mean time since diagnosis was 7.6 years. The percent of patients in the sample within each of the three groups was relatively similar: 30% age 29–49 (n = 48), 37% age 50–59 (n = 58), and 33% age 60–77 (n = 52). Choice of partner (i.e, romantic partner, adult family member, or neighbor) did not differ by age. Other than years with diabetes, there were no age group differences on any other demographic variable.</p>

<title>Biological variables</title>
<p>After controlling for potentially confounding covariates, patients in the younger age group (29–49) had a significantly higher HbA1c than patients in either of the two older age groups [F(2,148) = 4.15, p &lt; .05], with an average difference of 1% in HbA1c between the oldest and youngest groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311422120">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, patient BMI was significantly higher in the younger age group than in either of the two older age groups [F(2,148) = 7.04, p &lt; .01]. The number of patients with a BMI ≥ 35 in the younger group was approximately twice the rate of each of the two older groups (young adults = 61%; middle aged adults = 32%; older adults = 28%). Tests of interactions between age and demographic variables were not significant, suggesting that these age differences did not differ by patient gender, years since diagnosis, income, education, or insulin use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1359105311422120">
<title>Family and community support</title>
<p>Younger patients reported relying on their close partners significantly less often than patients in oldest group [F(2,148) = 3.41, p &lt; .05]. When disagreements about diabetes occurred, younger patients utilized fewer positive conflict resolution skills [F(2,148) = 2.78, p &lt; .05] than patients in both older age groups (p &lt; .05), and they experienced more frequent episodes of unresolved conflict with their partner around diabetes [F(2,148) = 7.63, p = .001] than either of the two older groups of patients (p &lt; .01 and p &lt; .001 respectively). Strikingly, 43% of younger patients reported that at least half of the time conflicts around diabetes went unresolved, compared to only 21% of patients middle-aged and only 6% of older adults. No main or interaction effects based on type of partner occurred, with the exception of level of reliance: patients in all three groups were significantly more likely to rely on their partners if they were a romantic partner, compared to other types of relationships.</p>
<p>Significant differences in local church involvement by age also were found. Church attendance was not as frequent [F(2,148) = 2.92, p &lt; .05] for patients in the younger than oldest age group (p &lt; .05). Only about half (55%) of younger patients reported regularly attending church at least once per month, compared to almost three-quarters (73%) of patients in the oldest age group. There were no significant interactions between age and demographic variables for familial or community supports.</p>

<sec id="section13-1359105311422120">
<title>Relationship with health care system</title>
<p>Younger African American patients (age 29–49) reported being significantly less likely to trust their practitioner [F(2,148) = 3.29, p &lt; .05] than older patients (age 60–77, p &lt; .01), and they were marginally less likely than patients in the middle age group (age 50–59, p = .09) to trust their physicians. Thirty-seven percent of patients in the youngest group, compared to 64% of patients in the oldest group, reported agreement or strong agreement on items related to trust in a physician. Patients in the youngest age group were also less likely to hold a positive attitude toward compliance with practitioner recommendations than patients in either of the older age groups ([F(2,148) = 8.23, p &lt; .001]. Patients in the middle (36%) and older age (34%) groups were three times more likely to have a positive attitude towards compliance in than patients in the youngest age group (12%). Interestingly, frequency of visits to a physician in the past year was not significantly associated with age, above and beyond the effects of other patient demographics: the average was 3.2 visits a year for all age groups. Patient concerns about costs related to their diabetes care also did not differ by age, although the large majority (73.4%) of all patients expressed concern about costs. Interactions between age and demographic variables failed to reach significance.</p>

<title>Mediators of associations between age with HbA1c and BMI</title>
<p>Tests of mediation were conducted to determine whether familial/community support or relationship with healthcare team explained the association between younger age and poorer HbA1c and BMI. When physician variables were added to an ANCOVA analysis predicting HbA1c, the effect for age on HbA1c became non-significant (p = .14). In an alternative model we examined whether poor HbA1c mediated the association between age and physician trust. When HbA1c was added to an ANCOVA analysis predicting physician trust, the relationship between age and physician trust remained significant (p &lt; .05). Results suggest that lower physician trust partially mediated the association between younger age and higher HbA1c. This suggests that patients’ lack of trust in their physician helps to explain the relationship between younger age and higher HbA1c. Family and community support variables failed to mediate the association between age and HbA1c, and neither set of variables explained the association between age and BMI.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a community sample of African American patients with type 2 diabetes, we find that younger adult patients report receiving consistently less support for good diabetes management across family, community, and health care resources than middle aged and older type 2 patients. This consistent finding was not qualified by other patient demographic variables.</p>
<p>Important age differences occur in the degree of trust younger patients have in their physician and in their attitude toward complying with physician recommendations. This lack of trust is significantly greater among younger African American patients (age 29–49), who report the lowest level of physician trust, and the most negative attitude toward compliance with physician recommendations. Interestingly, in this community sample, younger adult patients were not less likely to visit their physician and did not experience greater concerns about the financial burdens of care than older patients. Also, we find that African American patients across all three age groups had comparable health care access and utilized their healthcare team at a similar frequency. However, while younger patients are just as likely to follow through with attending medical appointments, they may bring a different attitudinal perspective to appointments or take away a different message from interactions with their health care team, with younger patients being significantly more likely to have a greater level of mistrust of their provider and/or of healthcare in general and a greater skepticism about compliance with physician recommendations. This could in part be due to a lack of experience with the healthcare system, a lack of personal trust in authority figures, or a heightened sensitivity to perceived differential treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311422120">Campbell, Ramsay, &amp; Green, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Age differences are also seen in patients’ use of a network of family and community supports: younger patients rely less often on close partners than older patients. Since having a chronic disease, such as diabetes, is developmentally “out of sequence” for relatively younger adults, young adult patients may have a harder time recognizing and accepting their need for external support from others and asking for that support in a culturally approved manner, especially in ways that do not diminish their self-esteem or threaten to disrupt family harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311422120">August &amp; Sorkin, 2011</xref>). Moreover, younger patients may more likely be in multi-caregiver roles than older patients where, for example, they are expected to care for siblings, elders, their own children, and themselves; plus have a job and a social life. In qualitative work with African American women, for example, being in a multi-caregiver role was cited as a key barrier to improved patient self-esteem and disease management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311422120">Samuel-Hodge et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>When inevitable intra familial conflicts about their chronic disease arise, patients in the youngest age group (29–49) report utilizing fewer positive conflict skills, and they report that conflicts are more likely to go unresolved. Good conflict resolution skills are vital to good disease management, leading to lower depression and better overall health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311422120">Chesla et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311422120">Fisher et al., 2004</xref>). To the extent that younger patients do not employ positive skills, they are at a further disadvantage for receiving family and community support for the management of their diabetes. Younger patients are also less likely to attend religious services regularly. Belonging to a community church enhances both the level and maintenance of good health practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311422120">Aaron, Levine, &amp; Burstin, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>On average, HbA1c was about 1% higher in the youngest, compared to the oldest age group and about twice as many younger patients had a BMI of ≥ 35 than older patients. The reasons for these differences are not well understood and are likely multifaceted (e.g., genetic, behavioral), but of the support mechanisms explored in the mediation analysis, patients’ level of trust in their practitioner emerged as a significant mediator, suggesting physician trust is one specific area deserving of attention.</p>
<p>Several study limitations are noteworthy that could impact the generalizability of the findings. First, although our patient sample included a range of patient ages we recruited relatively fewer younger than older patients, the sample was relatively well-educated, and all participants had some kind of public or private insurance. Results should be replicated with larger samples that include a greater diversity of patients. The cross-sectional nature of the data limit interpretation of the direction of effects, and replication with longitudinal data is necessary. The current sample is African American and the generalizability of the findings to patients within other ethnic groups is also unknown. In addition, some age-related results could be due to differential rates of mortality based on age.</p>
<p>While the current study focused on family/community and healthcare team supports, additional potential mechanisms should be examined as potential mediators and points of intervention for younger patients, including lifestyle factors and medication adherence. Living with the burdens of diabetes can be very difficult, and affective factors that are associated with age or developmental context should also be explored. Among adults with type 2 diabetes, higher levels of depression, diabetes-related distress, and chronic stress have been associated with younger age and to varying degrees glycemic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311422120">Fisher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311422120">Hessler et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311422120">Zhao, Chen, Lin, &amp; Sigal, 2006</xref>). While beyond the scope of this work, it could be the case that affective factors contribute to explaining correlates of age in the areas of patient-provider relationship and familial support.</p>

<title>Practical implications</title>
<p>The implications of these findings include an increased recognition by researchers and clinicians that patient age and developmental context is important to consider in the delivery of care for African Americans with type 2 diabetes. Intervention programs that have partnered with churches for many health initiatives in the African American community may find it difficult to reach this vulnerable sub-group of young adult patients given their lower church attendance. Thus, in addition to enhancing existing familial supports, programs may need to be multifaceted and focus on other community networks to provide areas of contact and support for younger adult African American patients. Such programs might include group medical visits with similarly aged young adults, other community based peer group contacts, same aged community health outreach workers or programs offered through patients’ work, and/or athletic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311422120">El-Kebbi et al., 2003</xref>). Findings also suggest that physician trust is one key area of focus. To build a stronger relationship with their healthcare team, younger African American patients may benefit from working with African American healthcare providers at all levels (including health educators ), and having health care providers extend contact and care outside of the medical clinic to other neighborhood and community settings.</p>
<p>Younger African American patients represent a unique sub-sample of highly vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition to exhibiting poorer glycemic control and higher BMI, this patient group reports fewer social resources and less trust and engagement with their healthcare team. Given these findings, traditional entry points for improving diabetes management may not be as viable for younger, compared to older patients. In addition to working to improve these deficits in support, it may be helpful to consider alternative systems of health care delivery and alternative community networks for care delivery.</p>
