<p>This trenchant and clear book argues against the common view that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are independent and progressive agents of democratization in developing countries. Instead, the book argues that the political agency of NGOs cannot be separated from more structural political forces such as state formation, or the role of national and international capitalism. The book’s central argument is: ‘although NGOs may be more or less independent vis-à-vis the states under which they operate, they are no more or less “free” than any other agent in the global capitalist marketplace’ (p. 38).</p>
<p>The book then demonstrates this argument through an in-depth and historical analysis of NGOs in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It argues: ‘Centuries of NGO activity, both radical and conservative, have contributed to the “centralization” and “domestication” of the state’s capitalist <italic>nature</italic> through state <italic>forms</italic>’ (p. 41). The book expands on each of these state forms, which it represents as pre-colonial, pre-independence, post-independence, neoliberal, ethno-nationalist and national security.</p>
<p>This book therefore provides a strong analysis that pays little respect to views that portray NGOs as the representative of disempowered voices or as powerful counterpoints to states and capitalism. It notes that ‘the term “NGO” is now a hegemonic category in social theory and practice, employed to organize and disseminate knowledge about a wide range of phenomena. It is, even, one may argue, an ideology’ (p. 2). But it also shows that: ‘current practices suggest that NGOs increasingly model their programs according to a policy framework shared by neoliberal donors, particularly governments and commercial banks’ (p. 5).</p>
<p>Indeed, the book’s last chapter (pp. 232–81) is entitled, ‘The NGO Industrial Complex’ and provides a series of generalizations about NGOs. This analysis is driven by classic themes of Marxian debate coupled with the new discursive role played by NGOs (or forced upon NGOs) by the state, or under economic and cultural globalization.</p>
<p>Ten points are made. First, NGOs can only exist within institutional boundaries set by the state (p. 236). Second, NGOs do not typically advocate changes that require a radical transformation of the capitalist state (p. 237). Third, alternative social models advocated by NGOs are underwritten by the state, and any successful counter-hegemonic model ‘would threaten neoliberal hegemony’ if replicated on a wider scale (p. 237). Fourth, NGOs are embedded within neoliberal rationality, and engage more in ethnic and religious identity politics rather than representing class interests and challenging the relationship between labour and capital (p. 238). Fifth, NGOs in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have been portrayed after independence as championing cultural diversity. In reality, ‘such state forms give the illusions of decentralization of development, and of governance grounded in the cultural diversity… in practice, however, they continue to increase the concentration of state power, while also mystifying it’ (p. 238).</p>
<p>The critique continues. Sixth, the discussion of NGOs constitutes a distinctive discursive formation ‘NGOism’ which provides an arena for the state to frame political debates in ways that overemphasize NGOs’ agency. It allows the state to legitimize neoliberal forms of organization by praising some NGO interventions, or to delegitimize NGOs by linking them to colonialism and Christianization (pp. 239–40). Seventh, NGOs and the state frequently share funding or forms of governance (p. 240). Eighth, NGO activities tend to focus upon reforming the state alone rather than addressing matters of nationhood and class (p. 241).</p>
<p>But there are also lessons to be learned about what NGOs can and cannot do. The ninth point is that NGOs can (and should) form means by which social groups can seek democratization and demilitarization. NGOs should therefore seek to learn how and why these objectives frequently become instruments of state power or ethno-nationalist interests (p. 241). And tenth, the explanation for this frustration is that the struggles initiated through NGOs constitute the limits to capitalist expansion. ‘Programs that appear to be counter-hegemonic almost invariably end up serving the very forces they seek to transform…As agents of social change, NGOs and the state are two sides of the same coin; both ultimately operate according to capitalism’s imperatives’ (p. 241).</p>
<p>These strong generalizations, however, come after a series of chapters that provide detailed historical description of NGOs in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. This analysis is highly informative and should be useful to any student of South Asian politics regardless of political views. Significantly, the book analyzes pre-colonial NGOs and the divisions between Hindus, Muslims and Europeans (pp. 42–110). The rise of the welfare state and militaristic visions of national security are mentioned as the main theme in Sri Lanka in the post-Independence period from 1948–2010 (pp. 111–82). The rise of secularism and religion are the main themes of NGO politics in Bangladesh since its independence from Pakistan in 1971 (pp. 183–231).</p>
<p>The book therefore performs two tasks with great skill: a structural criticism of NGOs as separate political agents; and a detailed analysis of the history of NGO politics in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It is likely that not every reader will agree with the book’s pessimism. But in this reviewer’s opinion, the book’s clarity, detail and strength of analysis provide an invaluable guide to the countries, and a useful counterpoint to some rather unhistorical and optimistic discussions of NGO agency. It will be useful to any student or scholar of state theory, civil society and NGO politics in South Asia.</p>
