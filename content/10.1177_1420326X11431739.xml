<abstract>
<p>Currently, the built environment accounts for about 40% of the total energy consumed in the European Union and this level is continuing to increase. This high level of energy consumption is partially a result of attempts to create an optimum indoor environment for the occupants of buildings. New buildings and renovation projects on existing buildings need to improve their energy performance while maintaining a good and healthy indoor environment. One way of saving energy is to build passive houses. This paper presents the results of a case study of some of the first certified passive houses in Denmark, called Comfort Houses. The indoor environment is evaluated using both quantitative measurements of these houses and qualitative interviews with the occupants about their experiences of the indoor environment. The combination of these two sets of knowledge leads to a more complete and holistic picture of the indoor environment. It is shown that attention needs to be paid to the objectives in the design process, the documentation of the designs and on the occupant’s lifestyle and behaviour. Finally, it is important to educate the occupants on how to live in an appropriate manner to achieve a comfortable indoor environment.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11431739"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Currently, the built environment accounts for about 40% of the total energy consumed in the European Union (EU) and this level is continuing to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11431739">1</xref>]. This high level of energy consumption is partially a result of attempts to create an optimum indoor environment for the occupants of buildings in terms of good ventilation, comfortable temperatures and sufficient light. The building industry in Denmark, and also in the rest of Europe, is facing severe challenges if it is to meet the existing EU Directives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11431739">1</xref>]. New buildings and renovation projects on existing buildings need to improve their energy performance while maintaining their commitment to creating a high-quality indoor environment.</p>
<p>One way to save energy is to build houses that satisfy the German Passive House Standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11431739">2</xref>]. A passive house is usually very well insulated, making it draught-free; the majority of its windows are orientated towards the sun; and it has a ventilation system with very efficient heat recovery. In combination these effects lead to low levels of energy use. This concept is now acknowledged internationally and many countries are constructing houses that meet the Passive House Standard that is defined by the Passive House Institute in Darmstadt, Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11431739">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The results of a case study on some of the first certified passive houses in Denmark, called Comfort Houses, are presented in this paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11431739">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11431739">4</xref>]. Comfort Houses exist in 10 different styles of single-family homes. They vary according to size, construction materials, style, construction technique, installations, equipment, etc. Each house was designed by a different cross-disciplinary design team and subsequently built to form an estate in an area that is very quiet and has small amounts of traffic. Eight of the houses are currently certified as being passive houses and they are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11431739">Figure 1</xref>. In addition to fulfilling the criteria for a passive house, the Comfort Houses were developed with a focus on creating a comfortable indoor environment. The vision of the designers was to make people aware that passive houses are synonymous with comfortable houses. The designers had two key objectives. First, they wanted to highlight the positive consequences of constructing passive houses. The basic design automatically fulfils some comfort aspects such as warm indoor temperatures and exclusion of draughts due to the creation of an insulated and airtight building envelope while maintaining air quality using a mechanical ventilation system. Second, they wanted to highlight the comfort aspect of their new designs. It is thought that comfort level will be a key selling point for future house buyers rather than the aspect that the house is a passive house with low energy requirements. Thus, for this housing type to become a success in the future, the building designs need to have a high-quality indoor environment. At the same time the more functional and qualitative requirements with regard to indoor environmental quality need to be integrated into the design. The design should be user-friendly with robust solutions that can tolerate the different behaviours of different households. It is important to know how the houses perform when occupied because this knowledge is crucial to the design of a comfortable indoor environment.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11431739" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The eight certified passive houses in the Comfort House project.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11431739-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The purpose of this study, therefore, is to evaluate the indoor environment using both quantitative measurements and qualitative interviews with the occupants about their experiences of the indoor environment in their house. To what extent do the Comfort Houses create a comfortable indoor environment? How do the occupants of the Comfort Houses rate the indoor environment, and what possible adjustments would they suggest? Also, how does their experience relate to the measured indoor environment?</p>
<p>The reported quantitative measurements are part of a larger demonstration project which is focusing on energy use, thermal comfort and indoor air quality, daylight conditions and acoustic properties. This paper focuses on the indoor environment and leaves out the topic of energy use. This paper is based on the results from three of the eight houses: cases 2, 7 and 8, since the remaining houses were unoccupied at the time of this evaluation. The qualitative interviews are part of another research project which includes other research topics. In that project each house and their respective occupants represent a case and therefore the same case numbers are retained throughout the studies to maintain continuity across all work. This also gives the reader the opportunity to compare across study fields by reading other publications within this research project, e.g. ‘Interview report about the design processes behind the Comfort Houses' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11431739">5</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, it is important to mention that the occupants of this study were promised anonymity; this means that the actual houses and floor plans are not identified in this paper, however, characteristics of the three houses can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11431739">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec2-1420326X11431739" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The indoor environment in the Comfort Houses is evaluated using both quantitative measurements and qualitative interviews since they give two different kinds of knowledge. The combination of this information gives a more complete and holistic picture of the indoor environment. In the following this approach of mixed methods will be outlined and further discussed with a more detailed explanation of the qualitative and quantitative methods.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11431739"><title>Mixed Methods</title>
<p>The use of mixed methods, that integrates qualitative and quantitative techniques, has become increasingly popular since the 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11431739">6</xref>]. There is an extensive literature on the use of mixed methods in social research, for example, Bryman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11431739">6</xref>] and Tashakkori and Teddlie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11431739">7</xref>]. According to Bryman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11431739">6</xref>] there are several reasons for using mixed methods and he developed different categories of mixed-method approaches e.g. triangulation, completeness, explanation, credibility, illustration, utility, enhancement, etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11431739">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11431739">8</xref>]. This paper will not outline the meaning of all these approaches; it will, however, illustrate the case for combining both qualitative and quantitative research in different ways. To answer the research question considered in this study, mixed methods are essential. Even though the papers discussed focus on mixed methods in social research, e.g. questionnaires and/or statistics versus interviews and/or ethnography. The current authors believe that the terminology of mixed methods can also cover qualitative social research methods and the empirical analytical methods used in natural science. Regarding Brymans’ terminology, the approach in this study fits with the following categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11431739">6</xref>].
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Completeness: refers to the notion that the investigator can bring together a more comprehensive account of the area of enquiry in which he or she is interested if both quantitative and qualitative research are employed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Illustration: refers to the use of qualitative data to illustrate quantitative findings, often referred to as putting ‘meat on the bones’ of ‘dry’ quantitative findings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Utility: or improving the usefulness of findings – refers to a suggestion, which is more likely to be prominent among articles with an applied focus, that combining the two approaches will be more useful to practitioners and others.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The combination of qualitative and quantitative methods can give a more nuanced result for the investigated issues. An example could be that measurements of the indoor temperature in a room show a temperature that is too low 25% of the time. The measurement cannot give the answers as to <italic>why</italic> these temperatures are too low - unless, for example, it has been observed that a window was open during those measurements and this can be suggested to be the reason. The observation and the measurements only explain <italic>how</italic> the situation is, but cannot tell <italic>why</italic>, e.g. the window was open. An investigator may have some suggestions, but they are based on his/her previous experience and not based on empirical scientific work. If the investigator needs to know <italic>why</italic>, he/she has to use another approach, e.g. involving the occupants of the room who might be able to give the explanation of the open window. This combination of knowledge will give a more holistic understanding of how to achieve comfortable indoor environments in practice where user behaviour and an understanding of the users are taken into account. The qualitative interviews and quantitative measurements are juxtaposed in a comparative study.</p>
<p>An example of a study in which qualitative social research methods and empirical analytical methods normally used in natural science were combined is the Danish research project ‘Indoor environment and quality of life’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11431739">9</xref>]. Part of this project involved investigating peoples’ ideas about what constitutes comfort. This was done by conducting ethnographical field studies on peoples’ lives and in parallel collecting measurements on comfort parameters such as temperature, light, humidity and CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The study showed that the occupants’ behaviour does not necessarily reflect the building standards’ notion of comfort. The study therefore discussed whether: ‘The concept of comfort has to be expanded to include not only physical factors, but also, psychological, behavioural and mundane, situational ones’. The study could not have come to this conclusion with only one perspective – it was necessary to use both qualitative and quantitative methods. Therefore, it is now common for the indoor environment of buildings to be investigated using a two-pronged approach of measurements and questionnaires, for example, the project HOPE which determined the health and energy efficiency status of 180 office buildings and multi-apartment buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11431739">10</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11431739"><title>Quantitative Measurements of the Indoor Environment</title>
<p>Even though the designers wanted to focus on comfort, the tender document for the Comfort Houses did not contain specific demands for the indoor environment. Therefore, evaluation criteria of a comfortable indoor environment in the measurement project needed to be defined. They are presented in the following discussion.</p>
<p>A distinction is made between continuous measurements and spot measurements. The first were made every 5 min throughout the measurement period (3 years). The equipment was placed centrally in one bedroom, the master bedroom (only in some cases), living room, kitchen and bathroom at a height of 0.16 m. The parameters for continuous measurements were: temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> level and relative humidity (RH). In this study the focus of the measurements was on the living room and bedroom. In some analyses other rooms are used to illustrate similarities or differences. The bathroom measurements will not be included in this paper. The spot measurements were made during visits to the houses. They cover daylight factors in the living room and reverberation time and noise from the ventilation system in the living room and kitchen area.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1420326X11431739"><title>Thermal Comfort and Indoor Air Quality</title>
<p>The thermal comfort and indoor air quality were evaluated using the guidelines set out in the European criteria for the indoor environment, CR 1752 which were developed for office buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11431739">11</xref>]. Therefore, they can only be used as an indicator because, first, the comfort levels at work and at home vary due to different activities and clothing levels, and second, the indoor environment of a home is a person-specific concept, i.e. each individual has his/her idea of what constitutes a perfect environment. This also underlines the necessity to combine the measurements with qualitative interviews. Since the houses are marketed as Comfort Houses, it seems reasonable to expect that the houses should meet category B as a minimum with regard to CR 1752. The requirement for the thermal indoor climate therefore is a temperature in the summer period of 24 ± 1.5°C and in the winter period 22 ± 2°C.</p>
<p>Regarding the indoor atmospheric environment the CO<sub>2</sub> level in the houses must not exceed 660 ppm above the outdoor level (outdoor average is 370 ppm), i.e. 1030 ppm, to meet category B. With regard to RH, CR1752 recommends a range between 30 and 70%. An RH lower than 30% may result in discomfort in the form of dry air, static electricity and desiccated mucosa. The upper limit of 70% should be respected to avoid problems with moisture and mould in the dwelling.</p>
<p>The acceptable length of the time period required should be discussed if it deviates from the specified category. For this purpose the recommendations in the European Standard, EN 15251, which followed up on CR 1752, can be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11431739">12</xref>]. Here it is suggested that deviations from a category should not exceed more than 3–5% of the time. A 5% variation in the three summer months corresponds to 110 h, which was the target value used in the work reported in this paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11431739"><title>Daylight</title>
<p>Daylight was evaluated in terms of the requirements in the Danish Building Regulations (BR08) paragraph 6.5.2, which states that [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11431739">13</xref>]:
<disp-quote><p>Working areas, occupied rooms in institutions, teaching rooms, dining areas and habitable rooms must have sufficient daylight for the rooms to be well lit. Windows must be made, located and, where appropriate, screened such that sunlight through them does not cause overheating in the rooms, and such that nuisance from direct solar heat gain is avoided.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In evaluating the results, 2% was used as the minimum limit of the daylight factor, however, if the situation must be assessed as a good daylight condition, then this should be achieved all the way through the room and not only in areas that are considered to be workplaces. In this way the depth of a room is also included in the evaluation, since deep rooms should have a larger or higher located window area than narrow spaces. The measurement method followed the instructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11431739">14</xref>] in SBi instruction 219 with simultaneous indoor and outdoor measurements on a day with an overcast sky. The daylight factor was only measured in the common rooms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11431739"><title>Noise</title>
<p>The evaluation of the measurements of noise from the ventilation system and the reverberation times in the living room were based on Danish Standard DS490 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11431739">15</xref>] since BR08 refers to the function requirements in this standard. Even though the demands in BR08 are a minimum of class C, the demand in this evaluation was set to class B, because of the formulation of the demands in the tender document:
<disp-quote><p>If the house is to be a comfortable place in which to live consideration must be given in the project to the building's noise levels. In particular the level of reverberation should be taken into account. Also, all construction joints, installations and penetrations must be soundproofed. (translated from the Danish)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This formulation equals the formulation of class B in Danish Standard DS490, as referred to in the Building Regulations (BR08), Denmark. It is required that the noise from the ventilation system does not exceed 25 dB during normal operation and the reverberation time must not be longer than 0.6 s in a furnished room [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11431739">15</xref>]. All measurements were performed in the living and dining rooms, but without furniture, because the occupants had not moved in at the time of the measurements. This will of course to be taken into account when assessing the obtained results.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X11431739"><title>Qualitative Interview About the Indoor Environment</title>
<p>The qualitative interviews were conducted as semi-structured interviews; this means that the interviewer has a general question guide, but is able to change the order of questions or ask additional questions to obtain information that may be of significance to the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11431739">16</xref>]. A qualitative research interview is appropriate when the goal is to understand another person’s or a group of peoples’ experiences of their own life. Qualitative interviews differ from quantitative questionnaires in that they are more flexible; the interviewer has the opportunity to ask new questions and follow-up on responses. The qualitative research interview allows new insights to occur, which may have relevance for the research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11431739">6</xref>]. The results from the qualitative interviews are presented in condensed form and direct quotes from the interviews. Two of the three interviews were conducted in Danish; this means that the quotes are translated from Danish to English. This translation was done as closely as possible to the original statement, but small inaccuracies might occur.</p>
<p>The qualitative interview studies consisted of two interviews: the first one was about the occupants’ experience of the indoor environments in their previous homes, and the second one was about their experience of the indoor environments in the Comfort Houses after the first summer and winter in the houses. The first interview is not directly a part of the results, but was conducted to provide a reference point with regard to the conditions to which the occupants were accustomed, thereby allowing a better understanding of their experience in the Comfort Houses.</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted in parallel with the continuous measurements. This means that the measurements could not be analysed before the design of the interview guide had been completed. Therefore, the question guide had a more general character. The topics of the interview guide were related to the topics of the measurements (indoor temperature, air quality, noise and daylight) and consisted of concrete and direct questions, e.g. ‘Can you stay warm in the house?’ and ‘What do you think of the daylight conditions?’ However, there were also ‘softer’ questions which were based on descriptions of experiences such as: <italic>‘</italic>Can you tell me about one or more situations where you were dissatisfied with the indoor environment?’ and ‘If you are cold what do you then do?’ Questions such as these allow a more comprehensive analysis of the measured data by linking it to the occupants’ experience of life in their house; this allows a better understanding of the indoor environment to be obtained, which is applicable to the real-world situation. This approach required highly personal answers from the occupants, which is one of the reasons why the occupants were promised anonymity.</p>
<p>The two approaches described form the basis of a holistic understanding of the nature of comfort in the Comfort Houses both from social and technical points of view.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11431739"><title>Results</title>
<p>In the following, the results from the comparative study using the quantitative and qualitative analyses of the indoor environmental topics of cases 2, 7 and 8 are presented.</p>
<p>The houses were unoccupied for some periods of time, either because the occupants had not yet moved in, or because the family was on holiday for a long period of time. This means that some data have been left out of the analyses, and these are marked with U.O. (unoccupied) in the results.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11431739"><title>Indoor Temperature</title>
<p>The results on the indoor temperature are divided into summer and winter cases. First, the summer situation is presented.</p>
<p>The measurements show that there is a tendency towards high temperatures in all three cases and in case 7 the temperature did not meet the comfort requirements, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11431739">Table 2</xref>. A possible explanation for this behaviour is that the mechanical ventilation system did not automatically turn on the heat recovery system but rather switched to summer by-pass mode. For this system it is recommended that an upgraded system be installed to ensure that it works properly. The high temperature is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11431739">Figure 2</xref>, which shows the indoor temperatures in the living room of the house (case 7) in July. The measured temperatures of the house in the summer in all three cases did not meet the requirements of category B in CR 1752, especially in the living room. This was confirmed by the occupants in all three cases. The indoor environment was too hot in the summer, and they tried to solve the problem by installing blinds to reduce solar absorption, and by using natural ventilation.

<p>In case 7 the occupants’ descriptions of their behaviour (they rarely opened the windows in their child's room when she was sleeping because of safety concerns) shows that the occupants’ behaviour and psychological experiences can influence the temperature in the house. In this case the safety of their daughter was more important than the temperature in her room, so they did not open the window, even though they felt hot. The house is well designed with regard to the indoor temperature, according to the standards; however, a decision made by the occupants has resulted in high indoor temperatures. This might also be the situation in the other two cases. Maybe the natural ventilation in the houses was designed to deliver a sufficient amount of air to keep the temperature at an acceptable level during summer, however, if the designs do not mesh with the psychological or social behaviour of the occupants, then, the design has failed. Thus, the design needs to be both functional and manageable for the occupants within their lifestyle practices:
<disp-quote><p>We could not keep the doors open when we were not at home. That was what the idiot of an architect said we had to do when we complained about the temperature. Additionally, the windows must be open, but it is not possible – the windows cannot stay open because they are not designed to stay open. They have a small screw you have to screw on and you have to do it every time …  and put the alarm on and leave the windows open (when you are not at home), I do not think so. (Occupant, case 8)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Based on the quote above, the windows should be designed in a way that allows them to stay open when the occupants are not at home, without compromising security. Alternatively, the design needs to take into account that natural ventilation can only function when the house is occupied, which is generally after 4 pm in the afternoon in single-family homes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interviews also revealed that the occupants misunderstood the concept of natural ventilation, which also limits the efficiency of the system. For example, the occupant of case 8 stated the following:
<disp-quote><p>‘We open the window up there [skylight], and that's another good reason why the house needs to have overpressure (in fact during the interview the occupant expressed a feeling of negative pressure in the house), then when you open something, the air blows outwards. Now the skylight only takes in air, but does not remove anything.’</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The design concept of this house is to have a stack effect and use the skylight as an outlet, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11431739">Figure 3</xref>. However, the above quote shows that the occupant has a poor understanding of the ventilation strategy. First, he believes that a house should always have overpressure; however, ideally it should be a balanced system. If there is to be pressure, it should be a small negative pressure which minimizes the risk of moisture entering the house. Second, he does not understand the principal of stack ventilation. One needs to open a vent or a window in the lower part of the house to supply air and use the upper part, the skylight in this case, as the air outlet. The explanation by the occupant in the above quote shows that he expects to ventilate the house by opening only the skylight, which is not possible to the required extent in this situation. This shows that theory and practice do not always follow. The occupants have to know how to handle the system or understand the strategy to perform ‘correctly’. It is believed that both the combination of ‘wrong’ occupant behaviour and poor design is responsible for the high temperatures in the summer in all three cases. The latter is further discussed in Kvale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11431739">16</xref>]. A study of the design process showed that the indoor temperature was analysed by substituting average values of the monthly temperatures into the equations. It is believed that an hour-by-hour dynamic simulation, or at least a simple check of the 24-hour maximum temperature for critical rooms, would probably have revealed the risks of overheating in the actual design proposal.

</p>
<p>Regarding the indoor temperature in the winter period, the occupants in all three houses thought it was too cold in the house. This was partly verified by the measurements taken during the winter period, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11431739">Table 3</xref>: the partial verification is a result of case 8 satisfying the temperature requirement of category B over 95% of the time in most rooms and months, which was evaluated to be acceptable. The dissatisfaction expressed by the occupants in case 8 could be a result of the low temperatures during one week in December (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11431739">Figure 4</xref>) and the occupants’ desire for an indoor temperature of 23°C. Generally, the temperature was between 20 and 22°C.

It is clear that the indoor temperature was mainly above 20°C, but for a few days was between 19 and 20°C, in periods in which the outdoor temperature dropped below −5°C. This could be because the system had reached its capacity with the amount of internal gains present. The internal gains could be larger on the 26th because the indoor temperature was higher, even though the outdoor temperature was below -10°C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11431739-fig4.tif"/></fig>

They thought it was nice when the sun was shining, since then the temperature increased by 2 to 3°C. They experienced different temperatures in each room when the sun was shining. In particular, the daughter's room (not measured) was believed to be colder than the master bedroom (bedroom 2).</td>

<p>In cases 2 and 8, the adjustments performed in January resulted in a significantly better temperature control as evidenced in the measurements and by the comments of the occupants. In case 2 the percentage of time that the requirements of category B were met increased significantly, however, the bedroom still only fulfilled these requirements 63% of the time in February. In case 8 the changes led to the temperature requirement in the living room being mostly fulfilled. The bedroom and kitchen fulfilled the requirements for category B fairly well in all months. The reasons for the necessity of the adjustments in the two cases are different. In one case it is a result of poor design-related choices and in the other case it is a result of technical errors when installing the system.</p>
<p>In case 7, a plumber was contacted to find out if he could raise the temperature of the system, and the response was that it was indeed possible. However, this study does not have any follow-up measurements to discuss if this remedial action was successful. Another reason for the indoor temperatures being below 20°C at other times is that the house had fewer occupants than expected and therefore had a lower internal gain than estimated in the design calculations of the system. For example, the low temperatures from 1 January 2010 to 03 January 2010 in case 7 are a result of the family being on holiday over the New Year period. This highlights the point that the system needs to be able to store sufficient residual heat to be able to maintain the required indoor temperature, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11431739">Figure 5</xref>.
<fig id="fig5-1420326X11431739" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>The indoor temperature in the living room (the full line) during January for case 7 and the outdoor temperature (the dashed line).

</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11431739">Table 3</xref> shows significant differences in the ability of different rooms to fulfil the requirements of category B in each case. There are several possible explanations for this observation. First, for both cases 2 and 7 the occupants stated that the extra bedroom was not used every day. This led to the door of this room being closed, which resulted in poor heat transmission between the other areas in the house and the unused bedroom. Another explanation is that in the design phase no attention was paid to different transmission losses from different rooms and/or the lack of solar heat gains because of the orientation of the windows. A final possibility is that the actual internal heat gains were lower than the theoretical ones used in the calculations in the planning phase – the tender document required a design for a house for a family of four.</p>
<p>The occupants stated that they experienced different temperatures in different rooms. Two of the cases expressed a direct desire to be able to regulate the temperature in individual rooms. This is not currently possible because the houses are heated using ventilated air and the temperature is centrally controlled in the ventilation unit and not in each room. Additionally, the occupants did not feel that they could control the system, which means they are passive instead of active participants. This is exemplified by the following dialogue and quote:
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: It's just frustrating that you do not have any control over it since none of us can access the control panel of the ventilation system.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: Do you want it to be more user-friendly, a more simple system to control?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: Yes, exactly. (occupant, case 2)</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>The ventilation system lives its own life … We want a flat screen monitor down here [first floor], and, for example, choose the bathroom −23°C [snaps fingers] and then we have 23°C … I have thought of writing to them [the designers of the ventilation system] to ask if they were asleep during the design process because this is not the way to design a ventilation system today. It's uncontrollable, it does not work and it’s bad<italic>.</italic> (Occupant, case 8)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It could be argued that the winter of 2009–2010 was colder than usual, which is correct, but still only a few night temperatures were lower than the winter design temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11431739">17</xref>] of −12°C, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11431739">Figure 6</xref>. Therefore, in theory the systems should have the necessary capacity to be able to perform under these conditions.

<sec id="sec11-1420326X11431739"><title>Indoor Air Quality</title>
<p>The results presented with regard to the indoor air quality concentrate on the living rooms and ignore the bedrooms and kitchens, because they show the same behaviour as in the living rooms, and because not all of the bedrooms were measured, due to privacy issues. The measurement in the kitchen deviated from the living room in some cases. This is possibly a result of effects due to cooking.</p>
<p>The charts in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11431739">Table 4</xref> show that there were no problems with the CO<sub>2</sub> levels during the summer period, whereas the required CO<sub>2</sub> levels were not met in cases 2 and 8 during the winter. This variation between summer and winter shows a normal pattern, which is due to the fact that the house was more open to the environment during the summer period because of open windows and doors. The occupants in cases 2 and 7 generally felt satisfied with the air quality; however, case 2 used natural ventilation in the morning. The occupants in case 8 expressed more dissatisfaction. The situation is complex because a number of issues come into play. In the following, some of the central aspects are outlined. Overall this was due to a lack of knowledge, trust and communication.

Whether or not they continued doing so after the air exchange was increased was not ascertained in the interview.</td>
<td>The occupants thought the air was fresh and healthy and not at all humid or stale. They were very happy with the performance of the mechanical ventilation system, in particular the fact that they did not need to open the windows was seen as a definite plus point. Previously, when they smelt odours they had to open the windows whereas now they used the ventilation system actively, e.g. when the wife cooks and they have people over they turn it up. They thought this was very easy because they just had to press a button and the air change increased for an hour. After that hour, if necessary, they could press the button again.</td>
<td>If there was only one person at home the occupants did not think the air in the house became stale; however, with five or six adults, the air become stale in a few hours. They wanted a high air exchange rate in the house – so they could not see or smell that they were smoking in the house (to achieve that, the air exchange rate would have to be about ten times higher). They felt the ventilation system was not running correctly. They thought, there had been more instances of illness in the new house – it was very dusty and their noses were blocked up. They supplemented the air supply by natural ventilation in both summer and winter.</td></tr>

</p>
<p>First, the service technician of the ventilation system gave the occupants incorrect information, as exemplified by the following interview dialogue:
<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: Does this mean that you also ventilate using natural ventilation?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: We have to do so – 3 to 4 min each hour and that is when the ventilation system runs on step 4. It is because it is so hot in here.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: Do you also ventilate using natural ventilation in winter?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: Yes, yes, because we only had the ventilation system running on step 2, as he [the service technician] said we should. It should not run on a higher level than step 2 because otherwise the heat cannot keep up.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: Why do you need to open the windows in winter?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: The air quality is poor in here … we needed some fresh air. But this should not be necessary when you have a ventilation system. (Occupant, case 8)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The service technician was not well informed about the ventilation and heating system; the system should be able to produce sufficient heat whatever the step at which the ventilation system was running, as long as it was designed correctly. The occupants thought the performance on step 2 had resulted in poor indoor air quality and therefore they reacted by using natural ventilation to improve the conditions. Additionally, this resulted in larger heat losses because the fresh air bypassed the heat recovery system in the ventilation unit. Thus, the ventilation system needs to produce even more heat. This shows a lack of knowledge on two levels. The service man misinformed the occupants, because he lacked sufficient knowledge about the system. Also, the occupants were not familiar with the principals of heat recovery in the ventilation system. They are familiar with natural ventilation as the source of fresh air. The occupants lack of knowledge about the consequences of behaviour patterns in passive houses.</p>
<p>Another aspect was mistrust of the mechanical ventilation system, which the statements in the previous and following dialogues have highlighted. The systems in most passive houses are characterized by inlets in low pollution spaces such as the living room and bedrooms, and outlets in the most polluted spaces such as bathrooms and kitchens:
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: It does not make sense. It should not be that way; each room must have an inlet and an outlet.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: You would like an inlet and outlet in each room?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: Yes, then you get ventilation in all rooms. Up in the bedroom, where we close the door, we have an inlet and a small slit under the door. It creates a draught on the outside of the door … On the first floor we do not have an outlet, because our bathroom door is closed. It's normal to close the door into a bathroom. The outlet in the bathroom should ONLY work for the polluted room, not for the adjacent spaces. (Occupant, case 8)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This mistrust can psychologically affect the general experience of the indoor environment and can enhance or distort the perception of the situation, e.g. the occupants express that they felt ill more often since they moved in their house. This study does not doubt the fact that they were ill, but maybe the general perception of the situation is intensified so that the experience of being ill is made worse.</p>
<p>Regarding the RH, all the measurements showed that the houses were dry in the winter period. This is as expected since the outside temperature during the winter is very low, which contributes to dry air inside a house. Case 2 was the only case in which the occupants thought that the air was too dry; they ‘solved’ the problem by opening the windows at night – a solution that in fact increased the problem (if the problem actually was dry air). Again, as previously noted, the occupants do not have sufficient knowledge about the indoor environment – the thermal dynamics – and act in an incorrect manner. The occupants in case 8 did not directly express their experience of the humidity; their comments were more focused on the general air quality and how the actual system functions.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> level could be reduced by increasing the air change rate. An excellent solution – simple and understandable, and easy to use for the occupants, which could be the solution seen in case 7. The occupants only need to touch one button to increase the air change rate for an hour. Another possibility is to make the ventilation system more automatic and let the air change rate depend on the CO<sub>2</sub> level (and the temperature and the RH). Unfortunately, it would be difficult to solve the problem of a low RH by lowering the ventilation rates, as this would increase the CO<sub>2</sub> level. Adding moisture to the ventilation air could create other problems such as mould in the system. Additionally, the building industry has a great resistance to such a solution. It is, however, important to note that this problem also occurs in ‘normal’ houses, with the same air change characteristics.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1420326X11431739"><title>Daytime Light Levels</title>
<p>The daytime light levels were measured at two different places in the common rooms of the three cases. The graphs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X11431739">Table 5</xref> show that all cases fulfilled the requirement of a minimum 2% daylight factor, even at the back of the room. This means that the overhang of the houses did not have a negative influence on the daylight conditions, and the depths of the living rooms were suitable. The experience of the occupants was consistent with the measurements. In case 7, in the dining room an opposite window in the kitchen has improved the daylight factor considerably. Additionally the living room is relatively narrow. The occupants expressed it as follows:
<disp-quote><p>It is very nice when the sun comes up and also when it goes down. It is really nice. We have enough daylight, more than enough. When we want to watch a movie in the daytime, some times it is too bright when the sun is shining, then we use the blinds. (Occupant, case 7)</p></disp-quote>

<p>Also, the eastern-orientated window in the living room in case 8, which is smaller than the windows in the dining room, delivers a satisfactory level of daylight, even with a room depth of 4 m. The occupants stated it as follows:
<disp-quote><p>In here (the dining room), the daylight is fine … You can read the newspaper; you can do all those things without turning on extra lights. That is fine. We can do the same in the living room. (Occupant, case 8)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Maybe it is not so surprising that the daylight conditions are fulfilled very well, because the focus on daylight has always been an important part of Scandinavian architecture. Danish and Nordic architects have an even greater focus on daylight, because the light is less intense and therefore more ‘valuable’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11431739">18</xref>].</p>

<p>The noise and experience of sounds is the last topic of the indoor environment to be presented. The measurements show that none of the cases satisfied the class B requirement of the Danish Building Regulations regarding the reverberation time without furniture, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1420326X11431739">Table 6</xref>. How the results would have turned out with furniture is hard to judge. It depends both on the kind and the amount of furniture in the room, which can differ in each case. Thus, the measurements are more comparable without furniture. In cases 7 and 8, it is doubtful that the reverberation time could be lowered to 0.6 s solely by adding furniture to the room.

<p>The pictures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1420326X11431739">Table 6</xref> show three different initiatives to improve the acoustic conditions in the rooms. Two of them are actual acoustic solutions, with the roof in case 7 being the ‘normal’ ceiling. In another study about the design process behind the Comfort Houses, it became clear that the designers in case 7 had originally wanted to have a regular acoustic ceiling, but it was changed due to financial prioritization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11431739">5</xref>]. Even though the design team behind the house in case 8 had installed perforated acoustic plates in parts of the ceiling, the measurements of the reverberation time were still significantly higher than the recommended level, due to the high rooms and heavy materials. The study about the design processes show that the majority of the consortia based the acoustic decisions on experiences of previous building projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11431739">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11431739">19</xref>]. Very few of the consortia consulted with an acoustic expert. As seen in the table, simple calculations of the reverberation time based on Sabinés formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11431739">20</xref>] gives a very good indication of the reverberation time compared to the measured value. If this type of calculation had been conducted in the design processes, then better solutions might have been selected. However, in mitigation, it should be pointed out that the designers were following the demands in the tender document and perhaps they should have been better defined.</p>
<p>A comparison of the measured results and the interviews shows that there are good correlations. Cases 2 and 7 have the lowest reverberation time, and none of these occupants complained about the sound in their house:
<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: How about the sound in the house? Is it ok or could you use some more absorption of the sound?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: No, I think the sound is ok.</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Interviewer: It is not too dead or - ?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p>Occupant: No, it is just perfect. (occupant, case 7).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The highest reverberation time was measured in case 8 and the occupants were also the most dissatisfied, as illustrated in following quote:
<disp-quote><p>This is the noisiest house I have ever lived in. The room up there, if I fart, you can hear it all the way down to the living room. It's so crazy. It is the same the other way around .… It is totally poor, very poor. All the plates there [the perforated acoustic plates] .… they do not work .… they have never worked .… the sound here – yeah you can indeed hear it now. Even though we have pictures and flowers, which should soften the acoustic – it does not soften … It's actually quite annoying. You can not sit anywhere and talk without disturbing the rest of the house. (Occupant, case 8)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The measurements of the noise from the ventilation system showed that all cases had fulfilled the requirement of a noise level of 25 dB or lower in standard operation – step 2 (the exact value is not listed because the meter cannot measure lower than 25 dB). The occupants in case 2 experienced noise from the ventilation when it ran on step 3, but the noise was not measured on that step. The occupants therefore turn it down to step 2. The occupants in case 8 ran the ventilation system on step 4 in the summer. They were disturbed when the background noise of music or TV was turned off.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1420326X11431739"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, the study shows that the occupants’ experiences are consistent with the measured data, and in about half of the topics investigated the requirements to meet category B are fulfilled, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1420326X11431739">Table 7</xref> for an overview. The concept of passive houses is new to the building industry in Denmark and the pilot project of the Comfort Houses is one of the first attempts to manufacture this type of house. That those three cases are not totally successful in creating an outstanding comfort level does <italic>not</italic> mean that it is a bad idea to construct passive or low-energy houses. What has been learned from these pilot projects can be used to improve the next generation of passive and low-energy houses. The results from this project form part of the analyses carried out for the Danish Enterprise and Construction Authority in preparation for the Danish low-energy class 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11431739">21</xref>], which was announced during August 2011. The measurement project continues to run until 2012 and will include the other five Comfort Houses that were not considered in this paper; this will generate even more knowledge about this field.

</p>
<p>The barriers to fulfilling the criteria in category B lie in the conflicting nature of some of the investigated topics, e.g. the CO<sub>2</sub> level and the humidity which can be difficult to fulfil at the same time as seen in the winter period in this study. Additionally, some of the approaches to energy savings conflict with the indoor environment, e.g. large windows facing to the south, which deliver passive solar heat gains in winter, can be a problem in the summer and may result in excess temperatures if no precautions are taken.</p>
<p>The fact that the European planning criteria in CR 1752 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11431739">11</xref>] (developed for offices buildings) were used to evaluate the indoor environment in houses means that caution has to be taken in drawing conclusions from the presented results. The comfort level in a house is often a result of the desires and resulting choices of the occupants of that house, e.g. one person would like a temperature of 20°C in the living room whereas others would prefer 23°C or one person a colder bedroom than their partner.</p>
<p>One key advantage of the current study is the combined use of measured data and interviews; the latter proving to be highly helpful in explaining some of the measured conditions. It should be noted that it is possible that the occupants’ perceptions could be influenced by the measuring equipment, which was located on the walls at a height of 0.16 m from the floor and therefore highly visible to the occupants. The equipment has a display showing the actual value of the measured data, therefore one could imagine that if an occupant, for example, reads 19.5°C on the measuring device, s/he could become aware that the temperature was below 20°C, and this could therefore lead to them to express a feeling of being cold, although this should not be the case. Despite this, the occupants' opinions are still important for a more detailed picture of the indoor environment, since measurements can usually only say that a situation exists, whereas interviews can explain why this situation has occurred.</p>
<p>It is clear that design-related problems occur in these houses, and that these are a result of decisions made during the design process by the design team, which in these cases were different cross-disciplinary design teams. Two factors can be identified that have an influence on the design decisions. First, the demands for comfort in the Comfort Houses and house occupancy were not fully clearly specified in the tender document and therefore the design teams defined individual demands for comfort and periods of occupancy, which in most cases resulted in decisions being made that were based on previous estimated solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11431739">19</xref>]. It is not a regular practice in the building industry to document single-family houses in such detail as the level presented in this study. However, if Comfort Houses are to become a viable part of the housing mix in the future, then the building industry needs to change its practice and closely document the indoor environmental aspects of these houses, e.g. an hour-by-hour dynamic simulation of the indoor temperature or calculation of the reverberation time instead of selecting standard solutions based on previous experience. Passive houses or Comfort Houses are not yet off-the-shelf items.</p>
<p>Second, the occupants have not been fully informed about the conditions and assumptions for the system. This is what the CEN 1752 has stated as being necessary if the indoor environments in offices are to be fulfilled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11431739">11</xref>]:
<disp-quote><p>The design assumptions shall be listed in the operational guide for the ventilation or air-conditioning system and it shall be stated that the indoor environment for which the system is designed can only be achieved if these conditions are met. Owners and users of the buildings shall be warned that changes in the application of spaces, or in thermal load or pollution load, can result in the system being unable to meet the indoor environmental requirements for which it was designed.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This has not been done in these cases. If the occupants had been fully informed about the conditions and assumptions for the system they might have presented different behaviour and maybe had more realistic expectations of the system and the indoor environments of their houses. Instead, the occupants’ behaviour and understanding of the indoor environment has led to significant adverse effects on the indoor environment. In some cases they do what they think is the logical course of action or what they were used to doing in their previous homes. Other aspects are perceived by the occupants as being more important than the indoor environment; e.g. the safety and security of the house and the occupants. Physiological and social aspects can therefore be more important than the indoor environment. Again, this could be expected because the occupants are not fully informed about how to live in a passive house and how to adjust the indoor environment.</p>
<p>Blussen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11431739">22</xref>] states that
<disp-quote><p>The relationship between indoor environment factors and complex human behaviour is thus not simple. Still, the indoor environment must meet the diverse needs of the occupants whose interests frequently conflict.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, a more interactive top-down approach is needed since different internal and external drivers can influence the wishes and demands of the occupants, which also change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11431739">22</xref>]. A possible solution could be to involve the future occupants to a greater extend in the design process. However, Bluyssen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11431739">22</xref>] also states that it is not simple, because occupants process information both consciously and unconsciously:
<disp-quote><p>It is difficult to pinpoint one single method as the best .… it is important to realize that the way we evaluate our environment (perception) and the way we respond to our environment (behaviour) are two different processes, and, we process information consciously (cognitive) and unconsciously (emotions).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>One might argue that some of the indoor environmental strategies such as natural ventilation, solar shading and air change rates need to be automated. However, is that the way forward? There will always be the possibility of the occupants overriding the automatic systems. Furthermore, such adjustments can have serious consequences both for the indoor environment and energy use if made without any knowledge. Jaffari and Matthews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11431739">9</xref>] believe that instead the occupants need to become aware of their practices rather than becoming passive objects:
<disp-quote><p>We suspect that taking autonomy away from people is more likely to result in diminished (not improved) understanding of the correlation of their actions with sustainable living; that the reasons for the system’s particular actions at particular points are not likely to be transparent to those who must live with their consequences; and that the loss of human autonomy and control is as likely to generate creative ways of ‘working around’ the system rather than straightforward, energy-efficient compliance with it. In contrast, we regard it as essential to engage people in the change towards energy-efficient comfort practice, making them aware of their current practice and challenging some of their existing habits with the aid of technology design.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They suggest more innovative solutions that confront the occupants with their behaviour and have an effect on the indoor environment, instead of equipping the house with automatic systems. The focus on the occupant and his/her behaviour and understanding of the energy and indoor environmental practices has also been investigated by Cole et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11431739">23</xref>], They suggest that a broader view needs to be taken on comfort, because the concepts of buildings are evolving. They think occupants or inhabitants should become more active and be engaged in parts of the design, maintenance and performance of the comfort – the indoor environment - instead of automating the building. The notion of comfort needs to be ‘re-contextualized’ since the existing standards largely ignore the behavioural aspects of comfort. Instead they believe in <italic>interactive adaptivity</italic> – a new conceptualization of comfort, in which communication and dialogue occur at all stages of design and occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11431739">23</xref>]:
<disp-quote><p>A dynamic and complex building system with a participatory process, interactivity between inhabitants, and between inhabitants and building elements can adopt to changing conditions (…), resulting in a fluid but robust design that is responsive to social, ecological, and economical [sic] conditions over time … The goal is to create a building in which the building inhabitants interact actively with the building controls, sensing and monitoring systems in order to produce adaptive controls and building management environment.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The sources discussed do not believe in automatic buildings, but instead believe in the education of the occupants and also understanding the occupants’ needs and behaviour, which corresponds closely with the findings of this study. The occupants are frustrated about not having the ability to control, for example, the temperature, or because they have to accept indoor environmental conditions that are unacceptable because of pressing psychological and social priorities. It is believed that if the occupants had been consulted in the design process or had been fully informed about the systems and how to act in the house to achieve comfortable conditions, better results would have been obtained. Additionally, the design proposals could have been tested to a greater degree to make sure that in practice the house would fulfil the comfort-level criteria. In the future, houses should have a certain level of robustness; therefore, it could be very interesting to integrate more sensitivity analysis in the design process. Instead of using a ‘standard behaviour’, whatever that is, in both the energy and indoor environmental calculations, different behaviours could be simulated to test the ‘limits’ of the building, and these findings could be communicated to the occupants to make them aware of what consequences a certain behaviour can have on the final operation of the house.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1420326X11431739"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The indoor environmental quality found in the three cases showed that the qualitative and quantitative data corresponded fairly well with each other. Even though the discussions of the results were focused on what did not work in the Comfort Houses, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1420326X11431739">Table 6</xref> shows that over half of the studied areas met the comfort-level requirement defined in the Introduction.</p>
<p>The areas in which the indoor environments did not fulfil the requirement of the Building Regulations, are the most interesting because they offer the opportunity to learn how to improve the design in the next generation of Comfort Houses. The experience of this study has identified four areas for further consideration in order to improve the design and construction of passive houses/Comfort Houses.
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It is important to define from the beginning the goals and demands of the project so as to achieve a satisfactory energy performance and indoor climate. This will give the design team specific targets.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The design process needs to contain a detailed analysis of the indoor environment of the house; this is different to the approach that is currently used by architects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is necessary to have a greater focus on the occupants’ lifestyle and behaviour traits when designing and planning passive and active systems. It is important to focus on user-friendly solutions that will allow the correct handling of the systems but also take realistic user behaviour into account.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is important to inform, educate and communicate with the occupants on how to live in a passive house (or any other low-energy house). Knowledge and communication are mechanisms with which the occupants can gain trust in the concept.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The building concepts need to be more robust so that the houses can be better managed by ordinary occupants with little knowledge of the principles and actions required to control any deviations from the assumed behaviour, e.g. lower internal gains which could result in lower temperatures than planned.</p>
<p>This study has discussed experiences with the indoor environment in some of the first passive houses built in Denmark. Hopefully designers will learn from this, because, in the future, houses will have to save energy, and this objective must not be achieved at the expense of the indoor environment.</p>
