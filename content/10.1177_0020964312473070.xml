<p>N<sc>oted preacher and homiletician</sc> Thomas Long approaches the perennial questions of God and human suffering with pastoral intensity. Lingering behind the book title’s question is his concern that ministers are not saying much at all. Long covers a lot of ground in this short book as he aims to revive a full-orbed theodicy for today’s preachers. While many will expect a collection of sermons, he explains that sample sermons would “be more misleading than helpful” (p. xiv) given the topic. Identifying his book as a “work of homiletical pastoral care” (p. xiii), he offers a cogent and engaging exploration of the questions surrounding the theodicy problem.</p>
<p>While theodicy was once construed as a defense of God in the face of extreme suffering, it has shifted to attest to a crisis of faith in the presence of suffering and evil. Because Long presents theodicy as a practice engaged by everyday persons, he believes that preachers are responsible for addressing this crisis. Long roots this faith crisis in a seismic event—the destruction of the city of Lisbon, Portugal in 1755—that literally shook the foundations of Western conceptions of God and human suffering. Despite attempts to uphold traditional claims about God in the midst of Lisbon, the dissonance was too great; while the “well-worn explanations of the past were advanced” (p. 13), they were no longer plausible. Some religious communities were willfully ignorant in the face of the challenge of Lisbon. But others accepted the crisis and were left with the task of reconciling faith claims with the realities of suffering around them.</p>
<p>According to Long, this reconciling practice is as important today as it was in the 18th century. “We are all heirs of Lisbon” (p. 17), he claims. While some theologians presently dismiss this classic discourse about suffering, Long is convinced that the theodicy questions are live for people today; to dismiss the genre of theodicy is to turn away from the urgent queries of parishioners. Using biblical scholar Bart Ehrman’s disenchantment story and theodical examination as a starting point, Long aims to widen the lens for theodicy without abandoning its central tenets. It will take “theological imagination” (p. 26) to do so, but Long brings a particular expertise to this task, as someone engaged in the “arts” of ministry. Long examines the most influential figures on the theodicy question. He is a skilled guide through these thinkers, enlivening the logic of their arguments while following the logic closely, as a way of modeling his proposed approach. The absence of voices of women and minority theologians is striking, especially given some prominent contributions on the topic, e.g., by Wendy Farley. While Long targets the dominant conversation, some of the most imaginative work on suffering comes from the margins.</p>
<p>I will highlight two significant contributions of Long’s work. First, the process of reading the book is an exercise in theodicy, as it artfully moves readers through the logic. I can imagine preachers rethinking how they will preach the Job text or how they might approach a particular pastoral situation differently given Long’s reflections. In this way, <italic>What Shall We Say?</italic> is very useful. Second, Long’s critique of “the ministry of presence,” of what has become a kind of default position on suffering by ministers within mainline churches, is spot-on. The “limp” theology of presence goes like this: in the face of horrific suffering, the only thing we can do is to be present with people. Here, the truism that all our words fall short in the face of colossal suffering becomes a warrant for Christian ministers to skirt the difficult issues of suffering. Long indicts preachers on this count, and he reconfigures theodicy as a practice of theological inquiry about suffering. This practice involves head and heart, intellectual rigor, and humility.</p>
<p>Mainline timidity (and laziness?) drives Long’s articulation of theodicy. Explanation-phobia turns quickly to theological silence in the face of suffering. It does not do justice to suffering or to Christian faith, as Long exclaims: “as if all the gospel has to offer in the face of suffering is our little presence” (p. 33). On this point, he takes issue with the theodicies of Kushner and process theology. They yield a “little presence,” in that they have deflated the largeness out of God and the power out of a Christian encounter with suffering. While I may take issue with what Long offers as a response, his critique of present practice is incisive. My question back to Long is: what is the substance of a bigger presence? He provides a visual snapshot of this ministerial presence by way of his creative use of the phrase <italic>solvitur ambulando</italic>, translated, “it is solved by walking” (p. 115). I would identify this as a holy and sanctifying presence in the midst of suffering, but this would require a more robust theology of the Holy Spirit than the one that Long provides.</p>
<p>I want to press Long on one point. Eschatology plays a crucial role in his theodicy. According to Long, Christian theology provides distinctive affirmations about God’s triumph over evil. In opposition to what he claims is the weak eschatology of process theology, he asserts a vision of God’s power over evil. Long writes: “Here, it seems to me, a comprehensive theodicy from a Christian perspective parts company with more timid approaches. The nonviolence of God’s love ultimately does violence to evil” (p. 145). Although evil cannot fully be explained, it is real and must be countered. In Long’s estimation, popular approaches do not do justice to this reality, and they certainly do not have a God who can do anything about evil. Note how Long proceeds. God is not powerless in the face of evil; instead God wars with evil. Yet God does not wage war as we do; it is the weak power of love demonstrated by the Prince of Peace that “burns down the gates of hell” (p. 146). Yet resurrection alone is not sufficient to counter evil. One of the most shocking elements of Long’s text is his presentation of a warrior God. While the Prince of Peace comes to earth, the warrior God fights the final cosmic battle. Long is careful to qualify: “Here is it important to keep in view the image of God as the warrior—a warrior waging love, to be sure, but a warrior nonetheless” (p. 150).The confidence that Christians have in the face of suffering is ultimately secured by this eschatological promise. Though in the present, the explanations and solutions to suffering are not fully apparent (although it is the Christian minister’s job to “walk them out”), the end provides the grounds for confidence that are not visible in the present situation. The language of sovereignty, though unacknowledged, creeps in; God’s purposes are hidden from us.</p>
<p>In the final paragraphs of the book, Long the preacher appears. The penultimate paragraph is sermonic in tone, and I can picture Long in a pulpit, speaking boldly the promise that God will wage war on evil. I imagine this falling on the ears of his congregants, as Long declares that their pain will be healed, that evil will be overcome. Rarely are these bold claims made from mainline pulpits, which often drown in nuance and qualification. But is this bold promise of triumph another form of comfort, of the “God Will Take Care of You” response that Long identifies as naïve and childlike (p. 18)? Is this the masculinized side of that coin, the action-figure version of childhood faith? Long aptly stirs our biblical imagination, as evidenced in his readings of Job and the parable of the wheat and the tares. But I am concerned that the warrior God provides another form of theological comfort, or worse, a theological vision that can easily fortify “holy wars” fought in the name of North American Christianity. Long would never want to contribute to that perversion of the Christian vision, but these images and vocabulary are operative in ways that Long cannot control. Can he get some theological traction and confidence back into theodicy without deploying these images? By placing this victory in the ultimate realm, does it turn people away from the task of sanctifying the present? The implications of this eschatology for ethics is critical to explore and timely, given the post 9/11 context that most U.S. preachers are answerable to. While the ripple effects of Lisbon can still be felt, the waves of September 11 are still washing over North American preachers. How might Long’s theodical challenge extend to speak not only to a loss of Christian faith but also to the loss of Christian exceptionalism? What shall we say in response to these 21st-century moments? <italic>Solvitur ambulando.</italic></p>
