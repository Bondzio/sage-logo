<title>MNRS Foundation News</title>
<p>What a great 2013 conference in Chicago! Congratulations to all those involved in planning, staffing, and participating in a stimulating exchange of scholarship and colleagueship. The Foundation Board of Trustees looks forward to working more closely with the Emerging Scholars Network (ESN) to enhance their involvement in our activities. To that end, Marilyn Swan, a doctoral student from South Dakota State University, has agreed to serve as the ESN representative to the Board, and we welcome her input and participation.</p>
<p>The Foundation also celebrated an important Endowment achievement—reaching our interim goal of US$200,000. THANK YOU to all who made this significant milestone possible and also to those who joined the Founder’s Circle or made other donations at the conference. We truly appreciate your ongoing support of research. This year, there were more than 40 grant applications—so many, in fact, that we were unable to fund many well-qualified applications. While this speaks to the high quality of scholarship in MNRS, it also makes our Foundation mission even more compelling.</p>
<p>Fundraising activities included a vibrant karaoke evening complete with brilliant vocals and dance moves, and an outstanding silent auction, with Loyola University, Chicago Niehoff School of Nursing, winning the coveted roller coaster trophy for raising the most money. Some of you commented to me that you were frustrated by the short hours available to bid on auction items. Members of the Program Planning committee will take your comments and evaluation of these activities into consideration for future events. I also personally invite you to send your suggestions on how to improve our fundraising efforts at the St. Louis conference; all ideas regarding WHAT we might do and WHEN to best hold events are most welcome. You may direct your recommendations to me at <email>Kathleen-buckwalter@uiowa.edu</email>, and be assured they will be taken seriously and conveyed to conference planners.</p>
