<p>Does globalization as exemplified by multinational production have a “California effect” or a “China effect” on the developing world? Does it, as some argue, lead to an improvement or California-ization of standards, as multinational corporations find it efficient to standardize advanced domestic practices globally? Or does it contribute to a China-ization or decline of labor standards, as companies driven by profit engage in a race to the bottom? In this impressive volume, Mosley carefully and thoroughly considers these questions, analyzing the impact of globalization on labor rights in the developing world. As a professor who struggles with the common proclivity of students to either vilify or glorify the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the developing world, I for one am grateful to have a thorough, nuanced account of the impact of FDI on labor. Mosley’s text was itself sparked by an inquiry by her student Saika Uno about the relationship between labor rights and economic openness. Mosley took up the question by exploring what may have seemed at first like a simple task but in practice became a very complex one: comparing the impact of directly owned versus subcontracted global production on collective labor rights. She and Uno began this research, coauthoring an article that appeared in these pages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012438849">Mosley &amp; Uno, 2007</xref>); Mosley expands on these timely and important questions in this 2011 book.</p>
<p>In her comparison of the impact of the type of multinational production on labor, Mosley evaluates data on workers’ rights from low- and middle-income nations from the period of 1985–2002. Her primary hypotheses are that FDI will positively affect labor rights, whereas subcontracting will negatively affect labor rights. The positive hypothesis is derived in part from her contention that FDI is driven by multiple considerations, including access to markets and resources and not simply production costs. Furthermore, foreign firms engaged in direct investment not only may bring best practices from their home countries with them but also may lobby host governments to utilize high labor standards and may attract NGO attention and accountability for the same. Subcontracting, on the other hand, which is common in labor-intensive sectors, remains primarily driven by cost considerations and is far harder to regulate and monitor.</p>
<p>Mosley offers a well-structured text—though perhaps too organized. The bones of the book are described repeatedly, in part because of the complexity of the argument undertaken. However, to be keenly appreciated is her painstaking thoroughness. Although her hypotheses are not confirmed as fully as expected by the data, Mosley is careful to consider other key variables that affect labor rights, including domestic politics and institutions, domestic economic factors, and the regional and economic diffusion of labor practices. Many of these are found to be significant in multiple models; in every case, she consistently and effectively offers excellent post hoc analysis of all outcomes.</p>
<p>She begins with an impressive review of the literature. She evaluates both the proglobalization climb to the top scholarship (emphasizing international pressure for a skilled, high-quality, stable labor force) and the antiglobalization race to the bottom dependency-like scholarship (highlighting international downward pressure on wages). In operationalizing her key independent variables, capturing FDI is fairly straightforward, as countries and other organizations commonly collect data on inflows and outflows (p. 66). She uses two measures of FDI: new flows of FDI and the total existing stock of FDI in a country in a given year, measured relative to GDP (p. 138).</p>
<p>However, with her second primary independent variable, Mosley has to deal with the issue that has flummoxed scholars before her (and continues to do so today). How does one clearly measure subcontracting when it is not regularly tracked by governments, and firms remain reluctant to share such information? Mosley uses trade (flow of exports and imports) as an empirical proxy for subcontracting, controlling for the impact of direct investment on workers’ rights. Although this proxy may work when nations have high levels of FDI and low levels of other forms of trade—or, alternatively, low levels of FDI and high levels of trade (which may reasonably be presumed to be subcontracting)—what of nations with a blend of the two forms of multinational production? What of nations that exhibit not only significant FDI and significant subcontracting but also activities that are somewhere in between the two? It is not clear that this proxy for subcontracting allows her to always make stark distinctions between FDI and subcontracting; this may account for some of the difficulty she faces in finding more significant variation in globalization’s impacts on labor rights.</p>
<p>As for the dependent variable, Mosley helpfully contributes to the construction of a sophisticated measure of collective labor rights that does not rely on one broad measure of human rights (e.g., Freedom House’s civil liberties index). Rather, Mosley’s variable focuses specifically on labor rights and employs multiple sources to reduce bias (the U.S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, International Labor Organization reports, and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions’ Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights; p. 115). She also differentiates between legal protections and actual provision of rights. Labor violations are coded on 37 dimensions. The data include a broad range of low- and middle-income countries from 1985 to 2002 from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>In her overall regression analysis, Mosley does find support for her primary argument: “Nations with greater direct investment have better workers’ rights, all else being equal; however, nations with higher levels of trade openness exhibit more violations of collective labor rights” (p. 136). However, when she distinguishes between the provision and implementation of labor rights, she finds that only trade openness, not FDI, is significantly related to either, and it is related solely to law, not practice (p. 162). Domestic political institutions appear to matter even more: Democracy is positively and significantly related to workers’ rights (p. 147), both in law and in practice (p. 162). As well, one’s neighbors are highly influential in these matters. Workers’ rights are positively and significantly related to a diffusion of labor practices by one’s regional peers (p. 147), in law as well as in practice (p. 162).</p>
<p>In the first half of her second cut at these questions, in a chapter titled “Varieties of Capitalists,” Mosley seeks to differentiate more fully between types of FDI. She considers a number of empirical studies that compare FDI by sector and country source. Although this is justifiable, it reads a bit like what Mosley understandably wishes she could have undertaken if her data would have afforded well-specified sector and source-country comparisons. And given that the data she does find available cross-nationally and longitudinally on sector and firm nationality are incomplete and often poorly specified (e.g., sectors are often too broadly defined), the findings are often unexpected, and most fairly inconclusive. She does acknowledge this while claiming modest support for her assertions that certain types of FDI (e.g., high tech rather than low tech) and certain types of countries (those with coordinated market economies versus liberal market economies) offer greater support for labor rights.</p>
<p>The second half of her second cut is more compelling. She provides an interesting case study of Costa Rica that fleshes out her hypotheses. Although Costa Rica has experienced significant upgrading in its manufacturing sector (notably it accounted for one fourth of Intel’s sales by 2003), high-tech industry still composes only a small portion of its FDI. As well, it appears that domestic factors such as historically limited unions with weak ties to political parties significantly counteract the positive impacts of its growing FDI, leading to limits on collective labor rights overall. However, as she notes, some scholars assert that Costa Rican law is more favorably inclined toward individual workers than unions; thus, the scenario for workers be may be more positive than not. As Mosley acknowledges (p. 233), at times workers do not strike not only because they are prohibited from doing so but also because of satisfaction with wages and circumstances. Thus, I would assert even more strongly than Mosley that attention to an outcomes focus for labor rights (better jobs, higher wages) may be as crucial as attention to process (right to strike, form unions, bargain collectively). As important for workers as collective rights are, so too are individual financial and environmental improvements; when possible, it is preferable to consider both in analyses of the direct impacts of globalization on workers’ lives.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the more important findings in Costa Rica is one I also encountered in my own research among international factories in Mexico: Unions are not the only, and may not always be the best, organizations furthering the interests of labor in every context. Rather, we must also pay attention to other nongovernmental organizations dedicated to advancing labor rights and conditions, ones that may have far stronger reputations and records of success among workers.</p>
<p>In her conclusion, Mosley counters concerns that the ascent and impact of nations like China and India in the 21st century may create tsunami-like pressures for a race to the bottom. She is careful to assess the broad range of multinational production in China, noting that pressure created by FDI may have led even to the 2008 Chinese labor reforms, reflecting perhaps a California effect in China itself. Finally, she effectively asserts that activists and policy makers who care about labor rights would do well to not simply condemn FDI but rather to support certain types of FDI from particular countries and ought to give as great attention to internal factors such as democracy that clearly and significantly do affect labor rights.</p>
