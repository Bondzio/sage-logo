<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The influence of modern classification systems and the dominance of the paradigm of ‘biological psychiatry’ over the last 30 years have together led to an emphasis on diagnosis and treatment by symptom cluster. This perspective may overlook both the patient’s current psycho-social context and their personal history. An understanding of unconscious relational traumatic memory may assist in both the conceptualisation and the treatment of many patients, particularly those adults who have been abused in childhood, where the link between the early experiences and the late manifestations are frequently lost.</p>

<p>The history of both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental illness has been dominated by two major paradigms, both active early in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486309">1</xref></sup> The ‘somatiker’ paradigm attributed mental disorder largely to ‘brain disease’, and was the province of the neuropathologist. Their aim was to better understand mental illness via anatomic localisation of lesions. The ‘psychiker’, on the other hand, attributed mental disorder to emotional causes, and meaning to symptoms; this was the province of the psychoanalyst. The latter were influential until the 1970s, when renewed interest in classification and the neurosciences ushered in the ‘second biological psychiatry’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486309">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Critical to this period was the development of the Third Edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</italic>, or DSM-III.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486309">3</xref></sup> In response to studies demonstrating poor diagnostic reliability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486309">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486309">5</xref></sup> the DSM-III introduced explicit criteria for 265 separate disorders. These ‘disorders’ were designed to be both descriptive and atheoretical. Diagnosis was made by ‘symptom cluster’, primarily to assist with the issue of reliability, in both research and clinical settings. These disorders were not initially considered to be diseases in the traditional sense, in contrast to the rest of medicine, where conditions are codified in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486309">6</xref></sup> where the emphasis is primarily on organ-based dysfunction. The DSM-III and its subsequent editions have however become widely accepted in many countries, and are seen by many as the ‘Bible of Psychiatry’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486309">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Questions about the validity of the manual and its diagnostic categories have been steadily accumulating,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486309">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486309"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486309">10</xref></sup> as the manual ‘fails to identify what underlies the symptomatic expression of a condition’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486309">11</xref></sup> Even the concept of schizophrenia as a category of mental illness has come under repeated criticism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486309">12</xref></sup> The symptom-based approach also creates a situation in which ‘a particular patient can satisfy the criteria for several disorders and many dissimilar patients can meet the criteria for the same disorder’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486309">11</xref></sup> One particular criticism relates to the de-contextualising effects of the manual. Although the system allows for the recording of difficulties on multiple axes, only the major Axis 1 diagnoses are generally considered with respect to treatment and third-party payment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486309">13</xref></sup> As a result, the patient’s personal situation or history may be seen as unimportant. Two sociologists have noted this phenomenon, with respect to the diagnosis of ‘depression’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486309">14</xref></sup> which they believe has led to the over-medicalisation of symptoms in some patients, and an over-reliance on antidepressant medications.</p>
<p>This de-contextualisation may be particularly exacerbated if the patient’s developmental history is not carefully considered. Children who were abused may in fact go on to suffer many different medical and psychiatric problems in adult life, and the link between the abuse and the presentation may often be lost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486309">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486309">16</xref></sup> The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486309">17</xref></sup> found that there were strong correlations not only between early trauma and a range of psychiatric illness, but that there was also a strong correlation with lung disease, heart disease, liver disease, obesity and diabetes; and that the development of these diseases was related, at least partially, to some of the ‘personal solutions’ that were used to manage the aftermath of the abuse, such as drinking, smoking and over-eating.</p>
<p>The concept of a type of ‘post-abuse syndrome’ is not new, but these syndromes previously generally outlined the psychological components only. One of the most frequently referenced of these is that of Herman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486309">18</xref></sup> and her concept of Complex Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD). Herman’s description encompasses affective symptoms, self-harm, anger, reliving experiences, dissociation, shame and guilt, a sense of isolation, alterations in perceptions of the perpetrator and alterations in relation to others. Herman coined the term to help re-define these somewhat myriad symptomatic presentations as primarily trauma-related, and to avoid the multiple diagnostic labelling of the DSM system. However, this description is still primarily symptomatic. It took the creation of an entirely new paradigm of mental health to further enhance the understanding of the complex after-effects of child abuse.</p>
<p>This third paradigm of mental illness emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, and involved a combination of both biological and social factors. The paradigm integrated a number of relatively new fields of study, including infant research, affect theory, memory and trauma. Schore’s synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486309">19</xref></sup> of these fields was one of the first critical contributions, and central to his synthesis was the concept of affect regulation. Schore established that the interplay of experience and development are especially important in the early years of life, when neural networks are particularly malleable or plastic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486309">20</xref></sup> Schore suggests that the hierarchical apex of the limbic system, the right orbitofrontal cortex, is fundamentally shaped in infant-caregiver interactions. In modulating the infant’s expression, the caregiver directly influences the infant’s later capacity for self-regulation and self-organisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486309">19</xref></sup> These interactive attachment experiences are primarily affective, and they become embedded in implicit somatic memory networks, as unconscious relational memories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213486309">21</xref></sup> Failure of interactive attachment experiences in early life sets the scene for affective dysregulation in childhood, and subsequently, in adult life.</p>
<sec id="section4-1039856213486309">
<title>The Conversational Model of Psychotherapy</title>
<p>One internationally recognised school of psychotherapy, the Conversational Model of Psychotherapy (CMoP), embodies many of the principles of the third paradigm of mental illness, and it further refines the concept of unconscious relational memory specifically by adding the traumatic dimension. This model of psychotherapy is discussed extensively elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486309">22</xref></sup> In brief, it was developed by Robert Hobson and Russell Meares, arising out of work with patients seen in the UK in the 1960s, patients who would now be seen as suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder or related conditions.</p>
<p>For Meares, a focus on inner life, and not symptoms, is critical. He writes about the importance of the feelings associated with the self, ‘the sense of aliveness, of vitality…allied to a feeling of well-being’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486309">22</xref></sup> Associated with this inner life is an ability to reflect upon it, a capacity for doubleness or duality. The individual’s sense of ‘well-being’ is directly related to feeling valued. Meares says that significant damage may occur either when, ‘the care-giving environment has failed to provide appropriate responsiveness, i.e. a constantly changing series of “attuned” or empathic representations’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486309">22</xref></sup> or when ‘attacks upon value’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486309">22</xref></sup> have been persistently inflicted. Meares says that consciousness is characteristically ‘adualistic’ in those who were repetitively traumatised by their environment, and that the aim of therapy is to restore a dualistic sense of self.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486309">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Meares examines these emotional traumas in the context of the hierarchy of memory. He distinguishes autobiographical memory, in which ‘episodes of the past are brought into consciousness again’, from a separate system that accesses, ‘facts, the body of our knowledge of the world, (which) are remembered as discrete data, unconnected to the episodes in which they were learnt’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486309">23</xref></sup> Meares says the first system is dualistic, or dependent upon reflective awareness, and the latter is adualistic and can be labelled semantic. He says that attacks upon a person’s value involving repetitive shaming, ridiculing and invalidation lead to the formation of traumatic memories, stored within this semantic memory system, beyond reflective awareness. Patients remember the ‘facts’ of the original trauma, for example how stupid or ugly they felt, but not the original circumstances, for example, a parent repeatedly criticising them.</p>
<p>Traumatic memories also exist in a complex that includes the form of relationship in which the original trauma took place. The patient feels not only stupid and ugly, but he or she also feels as if in the presence of a critical other, locating a past experience as if it was occurring in the present. The trauma is repeatedly relived with others, whose response is, ‘an effect of the patient’s unconscious construction, at that moment, of her way of existing in relation to the other’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486309">23</xref></sup> Meares uses the term ‘expectational field’ to describe this phenomenon, a revision of the Kleinian concept of projective identification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213486309">24</xref></sup> moving the focus away from defence.</p>
<p>In the context of the therapeutic relationship, Meares believes that the therapist may be potentially coerced into becoming the original abuser, ‘and is in danger of acting out the part’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486309">22</xref></sup> The therapist or mental health professional may feel an urge to give inappropriate advice to the patient, to argue with or criticise the patient, or to even terminate the interview or the therapy itself. If the therapist realises that the expectational field is in effect, he or she can respond differently. The therapist must be acutely aware of what may appear to be very slight changes in the patient: in body language, tone, or use of language, as these may indicate that the patient is in the grip of a traumatic memory. These markers of traumatic memory are also helpful diagnostically.</p>

<title>‘Eric’</title>
<p>‘Eric’ was a fire-fighter who had been referred to me with ‘Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, and Avoidant Personality Traits’. Eric initially spoke about a truck accident that he attended many years before, in which a young man was killed. Eric’s greatest worry was that he might have been able to save the man’s life, if he had reached him earlier. He also told me that he had subsequently ‘frozen’ in the middle of a factory fire, and that he had had to leave his job because of this. He said that he was hyper-vigilant, constantly checking things, and that he suffered with nightmares and ‘fear, anger and rage attacks’. He also said that he had been ‘nervy’ since early childhood.</p>
<p>In the 8 years prior to his referral to me, Eric had been admitted several times with suicidal ideation. He had been trialled on a number of antidepressants, and had undergone several psychotherapeutic treatments, including: Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Dialectical-Behaviour Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing. He had also seen a pastoral counsellor. One of the therapies included an attempt to ‘desensitise’ him to the accident site, and one of the therapists described him as having ‘Avoidant Personality Traits, which lead to him to being fairly irresponsible in treatment’.</p>
<p>Despite these earlier interventions, Eric was barely functioning when I first met him. He lived with his wife and teenage son in a small house. He spent most of his time in a shed, working with his power tools, in an attempt to ‘block things out’; he had not worked for more than a few hours each week, labouring, for several years. On mental state examination, Eric impressed as a physically healthy man who was not obviously agitated or hyper-vigilant. Instead, he was shy, overly apologetic and had trouble making eye contact.</p>
<p>Using CMoP principles, I gave Eric every opportunity to talk. He was then very quickly able to give me an idea of his early life. He had had a very difficult mother, and he grew up in fear of her ‘wrath’. His mother, he remembered, constantly screamed at him and belittled him, making him feel small and worthless; his most frequent memory was of being told, ‘Near enough is good enough for you’.</p>
<p>Eric also said that one of his biggest problems was his sadness. He felt like a failure, ‘a hopeless case’, as he hadn’t been able to provide for his family, and he also felt like he had let people in positions of power ‘walk all over’ him. Eric soon reached the conclusion that every time he had a conversation with anyone, he expected the ‘wrath’ of his mother. When talking about his relationship with her, he had enormous difficulty maintaining eye contact and slumped into his chair. Eric also rarely offered an opinion of his own; in therapy, if he offered an opinion, he would qualify it by finishing his sentence with ‘or something like that’. He thought that people could see through him, and his greatest fear was of making mistakes and of being ‘found out, a fraud’. He thought this was the main reason that he left his job as a fire-fighter, and the reason why he had been unable to hold down any subsequent jobs.</p>
<p>Several months into treatment, Eric disclosed that he had initially expected me to tell him how to ‘get better’, just like his previous therapists and his mother had done, and when this did not happen, when I resisted giving advice, for example, he realised that he could ‘take part’ in his own therapy. Eric slowly grew in confidence, both within and outside the therapy, and he eventually retrained in another field and commenced part-time work successfully. In one of his jobs, he was even able to stand and teach a class. After 3 years, regular therapy was terminated: Eric described being happy both at home and at work. No symptom had ever been individually targeted.</p>
<p>In CMoP, the aim of the therapy is to transform a conversation marked by traumatic relatedness into one in which the interior zone of self can begin to generate and a self-reflective capacity develop. Empathy is seen to be important, but insufficient. An understanding of traumatic memories and the expectational field significantly enhances the therapist’s understanding of the interpersonal world that their patient inhabits, and assists them in not becoming a ‘host’ to the field. Meares describes the necessary components of the therapy as coupling, representation and amplification; very similar to those provided by the mother with her infant in proto-conversation.</p>
<p>Coupling consists of trying to link with the other’s words or expressions, representation is the therapist’s attempt to ‘portray…the larger experience…includes what has been said but extends beyond this to encompass something nascent or latent in the patient’s expression’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486309">25</xref></sup> and amplification ‘is particularly of an affective kind…an escalation in the same positive range or the addition of another emotion sensed as part of the same expression’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486309">25</xref></sup> While experiencing being valued and being of value, in the relationship, the patient who has been repetitively traumatised can begin to develop a sense of self and value, and can begin to consciously acknowledge and integrate the trauma into their personal history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213486309" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although it has been well-documented that much, if not most, of human behaviour occurs outside of conscious awareness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213486309">26</xref></sup> this understanding does not appear to be widespread, either in the general population or within the mental health sector itself, where one of the most frequently utilised psychotherapeutic treatments, CBT, does not primarily address unconscious processes. Traumatic events in childhood, most frequently interpersonal, do impact on both cortical and sub-cortical systems, and the results may manifest many years later for the most part unconsciously, leading to a loss of the connection between the causative agent and its sequelae. This, in turn, may lead to misdiagnosis in the context of the DSM’s classification system, where symptom cluster can be mistaken for disorder and even disease; for example, Eric could have feasibly been diagnosed with multiple anxiety disorders, a depressive disorder and a personality disorder. More sophisticated post-abuse descriptions such as that of CPTSD are very valuable; however, a more nuanced understanding is reached if normal and abnormal development is understood at the level of unconscious relational memories.</p>
<p>Eric’s mother’s repeated injunctions that he was ‘not good enough’ were imprinted in his unconscious traumatic memory system, and these were reflected in his belief that he was no good, his sense of failure and his preoccupation about making mistakes. Eric’s therapeutic relationship initially resembled his relationship with his mother and this was also played out in his relationships with others. He expected to be told what to do, and he qualified everything he said, in case he was contradicted; he brought to relationships a fear of what might be said. His fear was apparent from his first visit to my office. His apologies, the difficulty with eye contact and his slumping into the chair portrayed this, the unconscious relational traumatic memories. A previous therapist, who felt that Eric was ‘irresponsible in treatment’, may have become ‘host’ to the expectational field, in feeling critical toward him.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856213486309" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although the introduction of the DSM’s classification system and the newer generation of psychotropic medications have undoubtedly enhanced the care of many mentally ill patients, over-use of this predominantly biological paradigm may have inadvertently led to many patients being seen out of a broader and more historical context. The concept of unconscious relational traumatic memory may be especially helpful in understanding the complex presentations of some patients who have suffered early trauma, and who present later in life with mental health problems. In many patients, the link between the trauma and the symptoms is completely lost. To ignore such concepts deprives the psychiatrist or other mental health professional of vital information that can be used in both understanding and in treatment.</p>
