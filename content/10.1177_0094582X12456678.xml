<abstract>
<p>Research with hundreds of mostly indigenous Maya workers in the export processing plants (maquilas) of highland Guatemala has revealed a disconnect between working conditions in the factories, perceived rights, national and international labor laws, and law enforcement. Because of this disjunction, efforts to address the plight of workers must engage the complex conditions of the current labor regimes. Maquilas operate in contexts that are virtually exempt from regulation and conflate national and global orders, precluding a clear perspective on issues of rights and legal claims. In the new geographies of power, workers in transnational factories fall into the interstices between state and nonstate spaces and lose their rights and entitlements in the process.</p>
<p>Investigaciones en torno a cientos de trabajadores, en su mayor parte indígenas mayas, en las maquilas del altiplano guatemalteco revelan profundas discrepancias entre las condiciones laborales en las fábricas, los derechos presuntamente establecidos, una gama de leyes nacionales e internacionales a las cuales se suscribe Guatemala, y los sistemas de tutela y aplicación de la ley. Dadas estas divergencias, cualquier esfuerzo por atender las condiciones de los trabajadores tiene que tomar en cuenta el complejo entorno de los actuales regímenes laborales. Las maquilas operan en contextos prácticamente exentos de regulación y entremezclan el orden nacional y global, impidiendo una visión clara sobre los derechos y reclamos legales. En las nuevas geografías de poder, los trabajadores de las fábricas transnacionales desaparecen en los intersticios entre el espacio estatal y espacios no estatales, dando lugar a una pérdida de derechos y situaciones vagas dentro del marco de la ley.</p>

<p>Globalization creates new subjects and redefines old ones. Not only are distances shorter but processes of production, distribution, and consumption are developing simultaneously around the globe. To what once appeared to be a separation of producing and consuming actors in developed, underdeveloped, and emergent economies have been added diverse Fourth Worlds throughout the developed world in which migrants, poor women, and marginalized minorities are employed in jobs that pay below the minimum wage and have unacceptable working conditions. The individuals or corporations interested in hiring workers to produce a given commodity are often not directly linked to the workers as the preindustrial emerging capitalist was by assembling cottage industry workers or the Fordist enterprise was by assembling hundreds or thousands of workers under one roof. In this post-Fordist arrangement, buyer-driven commodity chains structure production, distribution, and consumption, with several layers of contractors and subcontractors producing for a variety of large retailers or for single-brand stores. By removing the direct relation between the company and the worker, the company removes the worker from its area of responsibility and creates several layers of separation. The worker as “risk” is now someone else’s problem. Coupled with this development is the establishment of free-trade zones around the world that offer capital exemptions from laws of trade, import/export regulations, and laws related to conditions, organizing rights, and wages. Therefore the new producing subjects are victims of a weakening of labor law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12456678">Goldin, 2006</xref>: 125). The flexibilization practices that accompany employment under globalization have directly impacted labor legislation, resulting in a reduction of workers’ rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X12456678">Gotovac, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we contrast Guatemala’s labor laws with workers’ perceptions and understandings of their rights. The women and men working in export processing plants as part of a complex web of global assemblages in global capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X12456678">Ong and Collier, 2005</xref>) are the focus of the study. These workers are embedded in a logic of transnational economic transactions that is intentionally fragmented. Retailers look for contractors and subcontractors in places where the inconveniences associated with production from the perspective of capital can be minimized, contractors look for states that are willing to relax regulations, and consumers, often themselves members of marginalized minorities with few resources, look for opportunities to purchase well-made, inexpensive goods produced under conditions that they may choose to ignore. It is within this closing circle that workers are supposed to enjoy the protection of labor laws designed to prevent unfair and intolerable working conditions. We use a framework that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X12456678">Sassen (2006)</xref> calls TAR (territory, authority, rights) to disentangle issues affecting industrial workers as they express their understandings of the different domains of global production. We find an organizing logic that conflates national and global orders and precludes a clear perspective on the nature of assemblages. The ways in which people understand national territories, authority, and rights in the context of the nation-state do not fit the positioning of new subjects in global and national territories. No longer are there fixed and exclusive connections with a single sovereign state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X12456678">Sassen, 2006</xref>: 407). In the new geographies of power, workers in Guatemala’s maquilas fall into the interstices between state and nonstate spaces, and this produces unclear places in the law and results in a loss of rights and entitlements. Workers must balance their desire to claim their rights, when they know what they are, against the fear of losing the few jobs available to them. In the territories where production takes place, legal protections are detached from national jurisdictions and incorporated into partial global regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X12456678">Sassen, 2006</xref>: 416). We show how this detachment is expressed by workers in their interpretations of labor practices. On a practical level, these industries operate in contexts that are virtually exempt from regulation and follow no national organizational logic. Because of this disjunction, new and complex systems of organization, information, and activism may be required to achieve some form of resolution to the workers’ plight.</p>
<p>We document the above from the perspective of workers in apparel industries located in rural and urbanizing areas of the central highlands of Guatemala. Most of the companies that employ the workers we interviewed are owned by Korean capital. The companies are oriented toward export in what were previously assembly plants but are now producing most components of the commodities under full-package strategies. Their subcontractors produce well-known clothing brands for such companies as Gap, OshKosh, Liz Claiborne, Donna Karan, Levi’s, and Old Navy and for mass retail stores such as Macy’s, Walmart, Kmart, and JCPenney. The companies subcontract to (mostly Korean) capital, which hires local workers in Guatemala to produce goods for global markets, and the workers are thereby subjected to the local, national, and global dynamics of the production process.</p>
<p>For over 10 years, Goldín has been meeting with workers in several communities of the departments of Sacatepéquez and Chimaltenango, central Guatemala, and documenting labor conditions, the nature of the assembly plant work, and the organization of multiactivity households through semistructured interviews and surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12456678">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12456678">2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12456678">2009b</xref>). A longitudinal study conducted from 2006 to 2009 included 450 households in four communities known to send workers. In each household two individuals, a young adult between 16 and 25 years old and one of the older adults in the household, were interviewed when available. This was repeated in a three-wave panel study at six-month intervals, yielding about 2,600 interviews. In-depth interviews were conducted with approximately 40 workers. The study’s focus was the dynamics of labor turnover in factories from the perspective of workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12456678">2011</xref>). Salient to the analysis were accounts of working conditions in the factories and workers’ views about their rights and duties and the role of the government in their work lives (whether it conducted inspections to ensure that labor regulations were enforced or acted on worker complaints to the Labor Ministry).</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X12456678">
<title>Territories: The Workers and Their Communities</title>
<p>The factories studied were located in areas of high population density and some of the lowest poverty levels in the country. Many poor women and men in these areas are willing to take factory jobs. The workers are mostly but not exclusively Mayan Indians who speak Kaqchikel-Maya and Spanish. Non-Maya people also migrate to these areas in search of factory work. About 70 percent of workers in the factories are young women between 18 and 20 years old, with many below 18, the legal age for factory work. The gender ratio in these factories is less skewed toward female workers than in other parts of the world. Men are considered better workers for the “harder” jobs, such as using industrial presses, packing, and loading. Most women and some men do sewing, removal of loose threads, and cutting. The clothing pieces are generally designed in countries of the developed world, but in full-package industries some of the designs are also produced locally. Workers have only recently and partially abandoned agriculture, and some continue working on their families’ plots or for others on weekends. In contrast to agriculture, the factory provides access to men and women from the surrounding communities and a new set of friends and lovers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12456678">2001</xref>). In spite of harsh treatment and long hours, workers at first seemed to appreciate the industrial labor opportunities. More recently, their hopes of a new life as a result of wage labor have begun to fade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>The region is mountainous, with altitudes of about 6,800 feet, and travel within it is difficult. Buses run along the main roads and secondary roads, but with the closing of many factories in the past few years (mainly due to their moving to either Honduras or China in search of even “better” conditions for capital), some bus routes have been suspended. This has forced many workers to find alternative ways of reaching the main roads where buses circulate, including walking late at night or before dawn or obtaining rides with one of the few truck owners in their village. This is an important concern for workers and their parents, for these towns have seen violence including robbery and rape. Families balance these risks when making decisions to go to work. On most accounts, the households that supply workers are very poor and survive through gender complementarity in what are often extended households or households with more than two income earners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>There are very few job opportunities in the area. People may work in vegetable processing plants that export nontraditional agricultural crops to the United States and Europe, on poultry farms, or (women) in Guatemala City as domestics. Men may work in construction. The international factories are viewed as providing the most and best jobs, but job security in them is limited because of the constant movement of industries seeking lower wages and fewer regulations in what is a highly competitive market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X12456678">1</xref></sup> Guatemalan wages are somewhat higher than in other Central American countries, such as Honduras and Nicaragua, and reports suggest a larger number of plant closings than in other Central American countries, with some subsequently reopening under different names and/or legal status. Between 2002 and 2004, about 44 companies had changed their names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12456678">Oxfam International, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Anyone walking the steep roads of the highland towns where workers live will understand the remoteness of these areas of the world economy, distant from global cities and finance centers and from buying companies and consumers. The mostly indigenous producers of highland Guatemala maquilas, international buyers, and Korean subcontracting capital and supervisors are separated from centers of power by geography, gender, ethnicity, class, and other sources of difference.</p>

<title>Codes of Conduct</title>
<p>In 1991, the first code of conduct was developed by the Levi Company, which was the first corporation to agree to establish what it called “global sourcing and operating guidelines.” Many other corporations, in response to claims from trade unions or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), agreed to create comparable codes. With the goal of keeping corporations accountable for their labor practices, the codes mirrored the guidelines offered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention of the Rights of the Child and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and the International Labor Organization (ILO)’s Rights at Work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12456678">Braun and Gearhart, 2004</xref>: 186). Trade unions often perceive industry-friendly codes of conduct as a threat to international labor organization. By demanding protections similar to those sought by international framework agreements, codes of conduct may make international labor organization appear redundant. Furthermore, they offer corporations “soft laws” developed in consideration of corporate needs that often undermine workers’ power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12456678">Compa, 2004</xref>: 211). While nearly all of them require that workers’ “enabling rights” be guaranteed, most also include the provision that although the codes “respect the right to form and join trade unions and bargain collectively,” when “law prohibits these freedoms, [the codes will] . . . facilitate parallel means of association and bargaining” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0094582X12456678">SAI, n.d.</xref>). Such qualifications are viewed by trade unions as granting corporations the opportunity to block efforts to organize workers internationally. Indeed, organizing rights and efforts are often not contemplated or emphasized as part of monitoring efforts, the focus being on working conditions in the plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability to monitor the shop floor to ensure compliance is key to the enforcement of codes of conduct. This is usually something that trade unions want to be responsible for, but where there are no trade unions it has been left to NGOs or agents of the government. This is the case with the Guatemalan maquilas, most of which are not unionized. The Commission of Verification of Codes of Conduct (COVERCO), an independent NGO formed in 2001, for example, recently requested an investigation of the closing of a large factory in Guatemala and concluded that the procedures for closing should have relied more on the existing collective bargaining agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12456678">COVERCO, 2007</xref>). Codes of conduct have generally been effective in eliminating child labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X12456678">Greenfield, 1997</xref>), reducing harassment of workers, and calling attention to the need to improve wage payment and the physical condition of the facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade, 2004b</xref>), but they have been inadequate to provide more bargaining power beyond the most basic of rights already observed in other countries.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Guatemalan Ministry of Labor ordered the creation of a special unit of inspectors of assembly plants to verify compliance with labor laws. The unit was to be composed of a minimum of five inspectors (<italic>Prensa Libre</italic>, November 14, 2003). Since then, numerous violations of labor laws, involving lack of knowledge of labor rights, lack of payment of wages and benefits, overly long and exhausting labor days, and poor treatment in the plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12456678">Benítez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12456678">Gamarro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0094582X12456678">Smith and Gudiel, 2004</xref>), have been reported. In 2008, discussions of the creation of a new labor code and set of inspections were initiated by the then newly appointed minister of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12456678">Bolaños, 2008</xref>), and in 2009 reports on the precarious condition of working mothers continued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12456678">Bonillo, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Private Monitoring</title>
<p>The ILO has worked for decades to define the basic rights of workers worldwide, to prohibit child labor, forced labor, and discrimination, and to protect the right to association and collective bargaining. While it has generally been successful in generating national support for the first three of four of these basic rights, support for the last—often termed “empowering” or “enabling”—is less frequently observed. Ratification of conventions is voluntary, rendering the ILO relatively powerless to sanction offending corporations or facilities with anything more than shame and defamation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0094582X12456678">Rodriguez-Garavito, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0094582X12456678">Stevis and Boswell, 2008</xref>). As a result, a system of third-party auditing and monitoring has developed to provide impartial and standardized assessments of working conditions. There are currently six main organizations conducting such monitoring, each with its own standards. Some of these organizations are independent monitors, while others offer services that are contracted by corporations. In the latter arrangement, companies voluntarily subscribe to the standards set by an auditing organization, which then monitors factory facilities, workers, and management to assure the clients that those standards are being met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade, 2004b</xref>). When treated as a contracted service, third-party auditing services compete for business in much the same way as the factories they are hired to inspect, and therefore they do not necessarily create standards with only the rights of the workers in mind. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade (2004b)</xref>, there is often no space for workers’ voices in this complicated assemblage of interests across global territories.</p>
<p>A study by the U.S. Department of Labor cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade (2001)</xref> shows that early monitoring reduced some of the problems found in plants (about 17 percent between 1994 and 1996), but after a few years violations continued or increased and infractions were not addressed. At times, manufacturers ignored the monitors’ reports or postponed addressing them under the pretext of wanting to document the frequency of the violations. “Overall compliance did not change between 1996 and 1998 despite the fact that the percentage of shops being monitored appears to have increased dramatically (48 percent to 77 percent). Overall, compliance fell in 2000 despite continued high rates of monitoring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade, 2001</xref>: 102). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade (2001</xref>: 99, 103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12456678">2004b</xref>: 203) concluded that monitoring represented a new paradigm that included a “social accountability” contract but, ironically, excluded workers. Private monitoring of workers appeared to be protecting factories rather than empowering workers. Our interviews with workers in the maquilas of Guatemala confirm Esbenshade’s findings. Our workers reported that inspections were often announced in advance to give factories time to address issues that might be problematic during inspections. The monitors’ interviews with workers were not confidential, and this further undermined the integrity of the monitoring process. The association of apparel exporters, VESTEX, agreed to have the maquilas it oversaw go through a certification process that required compliance with codes of conduct and included independent audits. About 70 percent of companies agreed to become certified, but this did not mean that the subcontractors employed by each firm were also certified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12456678">Frundt, 2004</xref>: 48), and most companies used subcontractors.</p>
<p>The above exposes the weaknesses of a system replete with conflicts of interest and situations forcing workers to choose between expressing their grievances and keeping their jobs. These conflicts are associated with a system of private monitoring that is, in essence, looking out for its own interests and the interests of the companies that contract for its services. The workers lack power to change their situation. Rather, if contractors find out that they have revealed deficient conditions to the monitors, they are often dismissed. This seems to happen whether monitors are agents of the corporation, independent actors who are interested in being hired again, or government representatives who purport to be enforcing the law. Indeed, the latter are often asked to play down complaints by other segments of government that are eager to keep capital in town. Furthermore, in situations in which government inspectors’ wages are almost as low as those of factory workers, fraud and bribery are widely suspected.</p>
<p>In sum, reliance on independent observers to ensure compliance and/or voluntary control on the part of business on the assumption of corporate social responsibility have obvious limitations. In addition, the notion of choosing which rights to enforce beyond the realm of national law or international law further weakens the legal protections for workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12456678">Goldin, 2006</xref>). This is a real or imagined <italic>terra franca</italic> in which local rights are relegated to global regimes that have no interest in enforcing legal protections. With the excuse of not interfering with states, global capital deregulates labor practice with the support of encouraging states.</p>

<title>Rights (On Paper)</title>
<sec id="section6-0094582X12456678">
<title>Formal Labor Laws</title>
<p>The enforcement of labor rights falls into the no-man’s-land between states and international territories. Guatemala has a number of national laws to protect workers, but maquila factories have been exempted from some of them in order to attract capital to the country. In 1989 the Guatemalan Congress adopted Decree 29-89, which formalized the current laws for the operation of freestanding export processing plants (maquilas). Both national and foreign investors enjoy a 10-year tax holiday and are exempt from export and import tariffs on machinery, equipment, raw materials, and semifinished products. Departing from previous arrangements, this decree allows maquilas to subcontract among themselves. A separate law passed the same year, Decree 65-89, allows for privately owned and operated free-trade zones in which investors receive the same incentives. Most maquilas in Guatemala are freestanding factories, not located in any of the nation’s free-trade zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X12456678">Human Rights Watch, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to being a signatory to various international and Latin American agreements with regard to human rights, women’s rights, and socioeconomic and cultural rights, Guatemala subscribes to all of the ILO conventions included in the declaration of 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X12456678">ILO, 2010</xref>): 87 (issued in 1948) with respect to freedom of association and protection of the right to organize, 98 (issued in 1949) on the right to organize and collective bargaining, 29 (issued in 1930) and 105 abolishing forced labor, 100 and 111 (issued in 1951 and 1958) on equal pay and against discrimination at work, and 138 and 182 (issued in 1973 and 1999) on child labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12456678">Oxfam International, 2004</xref>: 55–56). Most of these conventions are included in trade agreements such as the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the Central American Free Trade Agreement–Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR). They are also included in Guatemala’s labor code.</p>
<p>With respect to labor stability, the law provides guidelines calling for contracts for workers that are “indefinite” rather than temporary and precluding the termination of pregnant women and labor leaders. The guidelines require employers to recognize resignations and agreements between worker and employer. Employers are allowed to stop paying wages temporarily because of lack of demand, lack of raw materials, or strikes and legal work stoppages. These conditions reduce job stability for all workers. Standard benefits include weekly rest, holidays, paid vacations, additional end-of-year pay, compensation for “unjustified” termination, and bonuses and/or incentives. Other regulations address issues related to health, sanitary conditions, and respect for human dignity. Many aspects of the legislation are broad enough that compliance is difficult to measure, among them “reasonable” termination, “protection” of women in the workplace, respect for job security, and health risks related to working conditions. For the most part, there is a disconnect between this legislation and practice. A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12456678">Oxfam International (2004</xref>: 35) on labor laws in the Central American free-trade zones noted that their official texts included only general statements about the requirement of compliance. While lack of compliance with tax exemptions for investors was characterized as “very serious,” lack of compliance with unionizing rights and child labor restrictions was simply “serious,” making the priorities clear.</p>
<p>There are no good records of labor complaints for Guatemala. The Oxfam International study documents some of the same issues raised by workers in our study, such as termination because of pregnancy or during the breastfeeding period (the right to breastfeed a baby twice a day for 10 months after a birth was granted to workers in 1973), inappropriate physical or verbal treatment, illegal payments, lack of paid vacations and/or unpaid vacations, and forced overtime and massive layoffs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X12456678">Oxfam International, 2004</xref>: 66). Even before the first maquiladora opened in 1984, Guatemalan workers sought international support to protect their rights to fair wages and safe working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X12456678">Petersen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0094582X12456678">1994</xref>). Historically, labor rights campaigns in Guatemala have received support from various U.S.-based unions, but none of these campaigns have included workers in the central highlands. Some of these areas are difficult to reach, and the fact that the workers are indigenous, mostly female, and young makes them the victims of three layers of marginality and submission. We suspect that just as many researchers focus on populations that are easy to access and potentially more mature, union leaders may experience similar biases when they are looking for contacts in a region. Young workers are intimidated by capital and by their own families, which depend on their jobs, and are therefore rather resistant to organizing (although they use many other forms of resistance, such as high turnover rates, line stoppages, and some direct confrontation with managers) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2011</xref>). In addition to this, Guatemala has the dubious distinction of being one of the most dangerous countries in the world for trade union activists. In 2009 alone, 76 nondeadly violent acts were committed against trade unionists with 100 percent impunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0094582X12456678">US/LEAP, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0094582X12456678">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the many obstacles to union organizing in Central American countries (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12456678">Armbruster, 1998</xref>), two are of ongoing concern for Guatemalan maquila workers. First, capital mobility allows a firm to terminate production or transfer it to another country with few protections for workers. This was a primary concern at the Lunafil textile plant in Amatitlán in the 1980s and in the Phillips–Van Heusen case, when the leading purveyor of men’s shirts in the United States first refused to recognize the union and then countered resistance with firings, demotions, death threats, and threats to close its Guatemalan plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12456678">Esbenshade, 2004a</xref>: 45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X12456678">Johns, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12456678">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0094582X12456678">Petersen, 1994</xref>). State repression may also be used to protect international economic interests, either passively, by refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of a union, or aggressively, using intimidation, threats, and force, as with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company in the late 1970s, which resulted in the deaths of eight union members between 1978 and 1980 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12456678">Armbruster, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X12456678">2</xref></sup> In its country report on human rights practices for 2007, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the U.S. State Department reported four murders of union leaders and activists in Guatemala, and the Office of Trade and Labor Affairs, which administers CAFTA-DR, argued in April 2008 that the Guatemalan government had violated numerous articles of the agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12456678">Sepúlveda, Schapira-Felderhoff, and Delpech, 2009</xref>: 39). Passive oppression is evidenced by the paucity of recognized labor federations in Guatemala. Though the 1986 constitution and the labor code ensure workers’ rights to associate, strike, and bargain collectively, accompanying these rights is a vague and liberally interpreted caveat that legal “requirements” be fulfilled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0094582X12456678">Petersen, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the Federación Sindical de Trabajadores de la Alimentación, Agro-industria y Similares de Guatemala (Federation of Food and Agro-industrial Workers—FESTRAS), of the 230 or so maquilas that formally existed in Guatemala until 2009 (the number fluctuates as they open, close, and merge), only 3 had unions. Of those, since the closing of Cimatextiles SA in 2007 and Choi Shin SA in 2008, where the first collective agreement had been negotiated, only one union in the textile industry (SAE-A International) remained, and it was facing serious problems “due to the constant persecution against the unions and acceptance by the Ministry of Labor of labor violations that have taken place” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12456678">Sepúlveda, Schapira-Felderhoff, and Delpech, 2009</xref>: 52, our translation). Guatemala has among the fewest collective bargaining agreements in all of Latin America, and little information is available on the duration and termination or renewal of contracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12456678">Sepúlveda, Schapira-Felderhoff, and Delpech, 2009</xref>: 27). The ILO reports from 2009 and 2011 emphasize the lack of collective bargaining in the maquilas, blacklisting of labor leaders, violence, reprisals, and juridical restrictions on strikes involving characterizing the zones as “essential services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X12456678">ILO, 2011</xref>: 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12456678">Sepúlveda, Schapira-Felderhoff, and Delpech, 2009</xref>: 51). The conclusion of the ILO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X12456678">2011</xref>: 27) report on union activity in the maquilas of Guatemala reads:
<disp-quote>
<p>For years the CEACR [Comisión de Expertos en Aplicación de Convenios y Recomendaciones (Experts’ Commission on Application of Conventions and Recommendations)] has taken note of the complaints and comments of labor union organizations on the problems applying Convention 87 with respect to labor rights in the maquilas . . . where it is impossible to exercise the right to unionize as a result of the acute opposition of employers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, it is almost impossible to discover the unions that are still signatories to collective bargaining agreements in Guatemala, something that the CEACR has requested the government to provide regularly. This reflects the incipient character of the process in many sectors of the economy, including agriculture, and its virtual absence in sectors such as the maquila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12456678">Sepúlveda, Schapira-Felderhoff, and Delpech, 2009</xref>: 41).</p>
<p>Strong workers’-rights language in trade programs can be an effective tool in leading states to take measures to protect labor rights or face revocation of preferential treatment. The U.S. General System of Preferences (GSP) has a formal review mechanism, until recently triggered only by petitions from concerned groups, in which the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) can determine whether a given government is taking appropriate steps to ensure respect for internationally recognized workers rights. In early October 2000 Guatemala was singled out for special scrutiny for labor rights problems when the USTR announced an unprecedented self-initiated review of Guatemala’s standing under the GSP. The focus of the review was on antiunion violence and violation of other recognized workers’ rights. However, on May 31, 2001, the USTR lifted the review without imposing sanctions, citing the adoption of labor code reforms and steps taken to address violence against workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X12456678">Human Rights Watch, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X12456678">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Violence against union organizers continues to be documented throughout Central America, particularly since the ratification of CAFTA-DR in July 2006. The Comité de Libertad Sindical (Committee on Union Freedom) documented an increase of 30 percent in violations of union freedom in 2004 and 2007 over the preceding years, thus confirming that CAFTA-DR has not helped to increase union freedom or collective bargaining in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X12456678">Sepúlveda, Schapira-Felderhoff, and Delpech, 2009</xref>: 118–119). Attacks on workers have been employed since as early as 1983, when the Guatemalan military accepted the establishment of a new labor federation, the Confederación de Unidad Sindical de Guatemala (Federation of Guatemalan Trade Union Unity—CUSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12456678">Frundt, 1995</xref>), and as recently as 2008, when the Coca-Cola Bottling Company was implicated in the 2006 forced exile of one trade unionist and the 2008 murder and rape of three relatives of another. A suit against the Coca-Cola Company was filed in the New York State Supreme Court in 2010 for allowing its processing plants to engage in a campaign of violence against the two union leaders and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X12456678">Skeen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0094582X12456678">US/LEAP, 2010</xref>). The most recent report by the ILO maintains that violence against union organizers continues with impunity. Of four main final recommendations and observations, acts of violence against union leaders and activists is second, following the “overall application of labor convention 87” and followed by legislative problems that restrict the establishment of organizations, free elections, the free conduct of activities, the right to strike, and the exercise of union rights in the maquila sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X12456678">ILO, 2011</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>Given this history, the fact that union organizing is rare in the highlands is not surprising. It is against this conflictive and discouraging backdrop that young and mostly indigenous workers in the maquilas consider whether to complain and if so to whom. They often spoke to us about the failure of management to comply with labor codes:
<disp-quote>
<p>They don’t comply with their obligations, with the labor code here in Guatemala. Sometimes they fire us or they make us resign, or they are late with payments or the additional pay, like bonuses or severance pay, or the end-of- year pay, vacations. Once it was not until the month of March that we received part of the thirteenth month [<italic>aguinaldo</italic>]. But at least it is a job!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And in 2003 they reported massive layoffs related to child labor laws:
<disp-quote>
<p>Last week they fired many, about 50. They said that there would be a visit from the city. They took all the minors to the cafeteria and fired them. One girl was 13 and had been working there for 13 months. They fired a 14-year-old girl who worked in packing. We started working there when we were 16. I think that age is now legal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of the accounts reported by Kurt Petersen in 1992 and other descriptions of labor conditions around the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12456678">AVANCSO, 1994</xref>) are almost identical to the accounts from workers we talked to in 2009. One of the few evident changes is that the mean age of workers has increased as a result of threats of penalties in the United States and the action of students and labor activists intended to enforce child labor laws. Workers must now be 18 years old.</p>

<title>Flexibilization</title>
<p>Reforms resulting from flexibilization efforts throughout Latin America have resulted in the suspension of many labor protections. In contrast to Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Colombia, Guatemala has not followed a formal process of flexibilization. Instead, Guatemala’s flexibilization has been defacto. Outsourcing is the expression of this form of flexibilization. It is conceived as a strategy of “savings” and the simplification of labor processes and represents the transfer of responsibility from the firm to the external subcontractor—a separation of the financial and creative process from the complexities (and distractions) of production. In this deconstruction of the commodity chain, the worker/producer is subject to the constraints imposed by third parties, replacing the language of rights with a language of necessity. Interestingly, one of the supposed advantages of outsourcing as described by a company human resources manager in Guatemala is that relying on third-tier subcontractors for production reduces turnover and absenteeism and minimizes the payment of overtime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12456678">Dardon, 2007</xref>). In fact, the production sites run by the subcontractors tend to be characterized by high turnover, absenteeism, and mandatory overtime. To workers, working for subcontractors often means long hours (with some reports of continued work for 36 hours with minimum meal breaks). In all of these cases, turnover is both an instrument of capital for eliminating unwanted workers by closing shop altogether and moving elsewhere or a form of partial relief for workers who seek “unpaid vacations” to attend to their health, their families, or their need for rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12456678">2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Workers’ Voices: The Letter Of The Law And Practice</title>
<p>One of the ways (though not the most widespread) in which inspections of the plants take place is described by the Labor Ministry as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X12456678">Ministerio de Trabajo, 2007</xref>, our translation):
<disp-quote>
<p>With the goal of verifying the labor conditions in the maquilas, the minister of labor, Rodolfo Colmenares Arandi, visited Korean maquilas with congressmen Jorge Mario Barrios Falla and Carlos Morales, members of the Congress’s Labor Commission. Also in attendance was the Korean ambassador to Guatemala, Mr. Ji Eun Yu, who explained that the current investment of his country amounts to US$130 million, and the president of the apparel association [VESTEX], Karla Caballeros. They visited two maquilas . . . in Palin, Escuintla. During the visit they confirmed that both maquilas were complying with labor conditions as established by the prevailing Guatemalan labor law.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most plants have not been visited by the minister of labor, but they have experienced occasional inspections. Workers described visits by inspectors to assess “quality” or “cleanliness.” A young woman said, “They come to check on the quality. They talk to the workers and they ask us how we are being treated.” Asked whether they could tell the inspectors freely what they wanted to, she replies, “Yes, thank God. You can say if you are sick that you need permission to leave. They don’t say, ‘No, you can’t leave’; they say, ‘OK,’ and they give it to you. They check our schedule and let us leave. You do have to bring a doctor’s order so as not to hurt production, because otherwise they will give them a fine if the shipment does not go through on time.” This response shows some confusion about the role of the inspectors and why they are talking with them.</p>
<p>“In my plant,” said another young woman, “inspectors come and check to see whether things are clean or dirty. They don’t tell you in advance, they just surprise us. They also go to the packing section and check the styles being shipped.” In one instance, workers described a recent strike organized by the production lines: Someone sent a little piece of paper down the lines indicating that they would wait outside after lunch—that nobody should go back to work. The issue was that the government had raised the minimum wage but the industry had said that it was not going to apply the new increases to maquila workers’ daily wages (industrial wages 2009: Q52, maquilas Q47.75). According to one young man, the workers said, “If they’re not going to give us the raise, that’s their problem, but we won’t work here any longer.” He continued:
<disp-quote>
<p>Then we all went in and spent the day planning things, and the next day we went in, but nobody turned on their machines. Then the <italic>licenciado</italic> (administrator) said, “Those that aren’t going to work should go home,” but nobody started working, so there was nothing he could do. But then some started working, and they took down their names. Those who started working, whether male or female, were met outside by the <italic>maras</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X12456678">4</xref></sup> So when nobody works and they go outside, they bring the inspector from the Labor Ministry, who talks to the people. And the people tell him that they don’t want to work, that sometimes they are not paying the overtime, that when we tell them they don’t pay attention to us. Now it seems that the labor inspector comes every two weeks to inspect the envelopes and the factory pay logs, so you can go and complain and see if you get the unpaid hours. . . . But when you go to the office to complain, they scold us. They don’t let us argue about our rights, because one has a right to claim for our envelope, and the administrator says, “This is the minimum wage. If you like it, take it, and if you don’t, leave. That’s your problem, not the factory’s. Sign here and leave, and let’s see where you find another job!” So we don’t insist on the overtime.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Factories often close and either move to other countries or reopen sometime later under a different name. We asked workers whether they were paid their severance payments and whether they were informed by anyone of their rights: “By the government, nobody told us anything. The factory manager spoke to us. He told us the factory was going to close, that they did not have enough work, and the factory did not have enough money to cover all the payments.” Asked where the employers went when they closed the factory, a woman from Santa María Cauqué responded:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some may go to Guatemala City, or to other factories, I don’t know. . . . Some say they are going to start making uniforms for the army. . . . I think the government is making arrangements with the Chinese [Koreans] to make the soldiers’ uniforms, because the Chinese want to stay here and with that they may be able to stay. . . . It’s the government that doesn’t let them [the factories] stay, and they offered this [new business] to convince the government.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The general understanding seems to be that factories close because the Guatemalan government won’t let them stay. There are, however, sectors of the government that are doing everything they can to accommodate investors so that they will remain in Guatemala, but they cannot always get Congress to approve the kinds of exemptions that investors request. Most members of the government and sectors of the Guatemalan elite are proud of the country’s success in attracting foreign investment, even when the jobs provided are not the best-paying and there is little evidence of significant regional or local development. When we asked municipal representatives in townships such as Chimaltenango and Santiago, Sacatepéquez, both areas with high maquila presence, what benefits the factories offered the region other than employment, they were puzzled. Did they bring clinics, schools, or roads? Smiling at our naïveté, they said no. Labor representatives in Guatemala City and officers of VESTEX said that the Korean contractors were offering worker training and occasional trips to Korea but most workers could not attend. (If they could only get them to do the training sessions on Sundays!) In a country like Guatemala, and particularly in areas where the actions of government are often associated with civil war, decimation, and brutality against anyone perceived to be part of the “rebels” or antigovernment forces, it is difficult for workers to see government as a possible ally and protector of their rights. Workers are more inclined to believe supervisors who complain about diminishing orders or a slow and inefficient workforce. For them both capital and the state are forces to contend with; both are perceived as foreign and external to their lives, their communities, and their plight. They feel that they are on their own.</p>
<p>Reports of factory closings vary, but for the most part they emphasize the lack of prior notification to workers and the lack of payment of back wages. The following exchange was recorded in 2006:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>LG:</speaker>
<p>Did they give you any severance pay?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Worker:</speaker>
<p>Thank God, yes, they paid us a few cents. They made us resign first, but they paid us something.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LG:</speaker>
<p>Did you get prior notice of the closing?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>W:</speaker>
<p>No, because if they had given notice, people would not have continued working. It was all of a sudden. They said that the factory would be closing, that whoever wanted could receive whatever they were giving, and if they did not like that, then nothing. They said that they did not have enough money, and there would not be any more work.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LG:</speaker>
<p>Did they pay the full benefits owed?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>W:</speaker>
<p>No, because they said they did not fire us. . . . If they had fired all of us, then they would have had to pay everyone, but they forced us to resign and said that they would just pay us our thirteenth month, vacation, and a bonus, not the severance pay.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>LG:</speaker>
<p>Did anyone from the Labor Ministry talk to the workers?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>W:</speaker>
<p>No one. They didn’t want to get involved. They never told the Ministry about this. . . . Nobody defended us! Nobody! It was just us and the company.</p>
</speech>
<p>In other cases, workers indicated that they had gone to the Labor Ministry to complain. They described the experience as a runaround, with workers being told that the factory might reopen in a few months or that they would receive back payments in the near future. Sometimes, as one young man described the situation, they received severance pay based on a maximum of one or two years of prior work because they had been forced to resign:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know what the law says, but they paid me for two years, even though I had worked for six, because when they heard that the factories would need to close they had us sign our resignations. Those who did not want to resign at the time, they just paid them and let them go. The rest of us were rehired. . . . We were favored because we agreed to resign! They moved us to another worksheet [<italic>planilla</italic>], on which the factory was listed under a different name. Those who did not resign got 5,000 or 6,000 quetzales [US$1= 8 Q], and those of us who resigned got Q 1,500. . . . Yes, we got less, but we didn’t lose our jobs!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A 31-year-old woman reported that at the closing of the plant the workers were told that the factory was bankrupt,
<disp-quote>
<p>that there were a lot of poor-quality products and that too many bad things were happening in the factory. Then the maquila closed down. Soon afterward they stopped paying us. For example, they would pay one Saturday and not the next. Then we realized that they were not paying regularly. . . . One day they called 15 of us to the cafeteria and said that they were sorry, it was not that we were bad workers, but they had to fire us. They didn’t have enough work. They fired me on November 30 and paid me on January 21.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When we asked whether anyone from the Ministry had talked to them about the closing, she said, “No, only the chief of personnel of the factory. He thanked us for the work we had done for so long. He said that we were not bad workers, that it was just that they didn’t have any work. The factory closed the end of January.”</p>
<p>We asked a woman who was dismissed from another factory in 2008 to describe the moment when the factory closed:
<disp-quote>
<p>That day we expected to get paid at around 5:40 p.m. They said that they were going to give us only Q100 [rather than the usual Q400], and we left. The next day, Wednesday, we arrived, and everyone was running around. They said that the factory was closing, and we all went down to see what was happening, because if they left without paying we would not just leave like that. So people started taking machines and everything that they could find. People were resigned to that. There were no other options, no payment! But nobody told us that there was no work. Nothing! They did not tell us anything! . . . Some were crying, because they had spent so much time in that factory. Some were fighting. They were taking sewing machines, the overlock [for edging and finishing stitches] and the plain [for weaving, knitting]. Some went into the rooms where the owners worked and took the cupboards, the stoves, the beds, everything!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here again, no one from the Labor Ministry had talked to the workers. We have dozens of similar descriptions from workers in various factories that closed between 2000 and 2008. The differences are minor. In some cases, when workers arrived they found that all the equipment had already been removed. In some they received no payments at all, while in others they received partial payments. Nobody reported intervention by the government, even in cases where workers had gone to complain about not being paid.</p>
<p>Disciplinary actions, complaints, special requests, inspections, and threats take place in the factory’s office. Workers report physical threats and arguments with the supervisor. They also report that inspectors often go to the office and workers are brought in by their supervisors to be questioned about treatment, voluntary overtime, and other working conditions. They consider these trips to the office part of their jobs, and they know very well what they are expected to say when inspectors inquire. As pointed out earlier, they often do not know whether the inspectors come from the government, from one of the main Korean contracting firms, or from the local plant management. They are often Koreans. Workers told us that the <italic>gringos</italic> (Americans) tended to be nicer to workers than the <italic>Chinos</italic> (Koreans). However, they had no expectations that inspections might result in changes, and they knew that if they deviated from expected responses they might be reprimanded or even dismissed. “Sometimes,” a young woman told us, “if we say we don’t want to stay later [than the regular workday], they shout at you and they bring you to the main office to admonish you and tell you that you have to stay. They do that once in a while, when production is low and they force workers to stay.” Another worker said, “The Korean woman gives you two minutes to use one of the two bathrooms [for hundreds of workers]. The time is not enough, and after five minutes, they call you to the main office to reprimand you, and then they put a letter in your file” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0094582X12456678">Trejo, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Mandatory overtime was widely reported. A 25-year-old male worker told us:
<disp-quote>
<p>Overtime is not supposed to be mandatory, other than the main eight-hour workday, but they make you stay. They give you a ticket for dinner, they just leave it on your machine. . . . If you want to explain that you can’t stay, they won’t listen to you. They just leave the ticket, and that’s that! We sometimes stay until 10, 10:30, or 11 at night. Sometimes we have to stay the whole night, until the work is done. We’re supposed to leave at 4:30 p.m., but we never leave before 6:30 or 7:30. That means that we work two extra hours every day. But 10:30 is too much! In this factory, the work is piecework (<italic>por trato</italic>). In each load comes a ticket with the name of the specific job needed (sewing, cleaning, etc.), and you get paid by the amount completed. If you don’t complete the goal by 5:30, you need to stay longer.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The essence of this statement was repeated by virtually all of the workers in our sample. No one is working 8-hour days. The norm is 10–12 hours, and many report working 15 hours a day. It is the worker’s obligation to complete the established quotas, which are often impossible to complete in less than 10 hours. Workers reported high levels of stress due to exhaustion and pressure to keep up or speed up their work. They also pointed to their inability to plan their days, take care of their children, or fulfill other household obligations such as helping their mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0094582X12456678">Trejo, 2009</xref>). When we asked young people who had never worked in the factories why they had never looked for an industrial job, 26 percent told us that they had heard bad things about it and 20 percent said, “They exploit you too much,” “They treat you badly,” “They oppress you,” or “It’s exhausting.” When we asked those who had stopped working in the factories why they had stopped, 37 percent mentioned the low wages and 25 percent said that they were tired, bored, or sick from working so many hours. Other reasons included sick relatives, having a child, returning to be with their children, the lack of respect they experienced, the impure air in the factory that hurt their lungs, and numerous problems they had experienced while working, including suffering from specific ailments such as gastritis (for lack of food or water most of the day), respiratory problems, and body aches. Only 9 percent indicated that they had been fired.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our visits to workers’ households began in 1995. We saw them mainly on weekends and continued visiting them until late 2008. Their optimism in 1995, when the factories had been in the area for 5–10 years, was surprising and encouraging. We described their ambivalence about their transition from agricultural to industrial work and the ways in which the factories expanded their sociological maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12456678">2001</xref>). Workers characterized agriculture as a job of the past, something that their parents still practiced but that they hoped not to have to return to. (Most still helped their parents or were hired by others as field hands on weekends.) They appreciated the biweekly wages from factory work and the ways in which access to cash had elevated their status in their households. While women had always had a say in the administration of their households’ funds, young women were able to impact the overall standing of the household by supporting the education of siblings, buying color TVs, or providing a respite to parents. Young couples fantasized about the “modern” life they would achieve by saving some of the money they were earning in the factories. They did note the harsh conditions and the occasional bad treatment they received from supervisors, some reporting being slapped in the head or face when they did not “behave.” During those years, because of complaints from consumers in the United States and reports from the ILO, age restrictions were more strongly enforced, resulting in a slighter older workforce. While 12- and 13-year-old workers are uncommon today, many are 15 to 17 years old and have obtained their jobs with fake IDs.</p>
<p>As the years went by and factories closed or changed their identities, workers began to suspect that their pursuit of modernity and progress would be more difficult than they had imagined. Many were dismissed when the factories closed. Often they resorted to taking time off, what they called “vacations”—voluntary breaks that allowed them to recover from exhaustion, take care of children, or simply avoid the forced overtime and the medical consequences of a rigid system of prolonged shifts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X12456678">2011</xref>). The long hours, difficult conditions, and frustration generated feelings of desperation:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was desperate. Now it’s hard to find another job. I went to one factory and they told me they had nothing for me. I went to another and they said they didn’t have a job for me. I became more desperate. When [the factory] closed they left me without my pay, with nothing. They didn’t even tell us they were going to close. We never knew why they left. They didn’t pay us our time, and they left us with nothing. I was very desperate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the past few years, workers have repeatedly used the word “desperation” to describe their feelings about their life situation, whether jobless or employed and under the constant threat of losing a job or experiencing harsh conditions at work. This is compounded by the feeling of being alone in facing and dealing with the company or the manager. The absence of labor protections from either unions or the government leaves workers feeling impotent. Conversations with officers of VESTEX suggest that government officials see themselves as attracting potential investors and describe Guatemalan workers to foreign capital as “the best workers in the world.” They emphasize that they look out for the well-being of all workers and provide the conditions for a fair workplace in compliance with national and international laws. Our study and the others cited above show a disconnect between rules and their enforcement. Incomplete and often improper inspections that remain in the office rather than reaching the production floor and inspectors suspected of being paid off by subcontractors or limited to quality control rather than compliance with labor laws reinforce this lack of correspondence between rule and practice.</p>
<p>Workers are working too many hours for wages that often fall below the minimum subsistence level. The government is conflicted, given the desire to attract foreign investment that may bring much-needed jobs and possibly development in impoverished areas of their countries. Subcontractors are left to their own devices to establish labor conditions that result in rapid supply of just-in-time orders; corporations are relieved of the responsibility for production, and consumers demand low prices, abundant variety of products, and the satisfaction of believing that goods are being produced by happy, well-paid workers somewhere in the world. Few labor laws are truly enforced. In the case of rural maquilas and in the absence of workers’ organizations, there is little hope for intervention by international labor institutions.</p>
<p>There are some successes that point to the importance of workers’ understanding their rights. For example, workers in the Honduran factories of Russell Athletic were rehired after Russell had closed the factories in response to efforts at unionization. U.S. students orchestrated a national campaign against the company and succeeded in exerting pressure alongside workers who knew enough to engage U.S.-based NGOs, the Fair Labor Association, and the Workers’ Rights Consortium about the company’s obstruction of unionization. The factories reopened and rehired most of the workers with the promise to stop fighting unionization. This approach involved organizing university students in the United States and took more than 10 years. As of February 2010, Russell seemed to be complying with most of the agreements of November 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X12456678">Greenhouse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0094582X12456678">Workers’ Rights Consortium, 2010</xref>). This simply would not have taken place through appeals to corporate responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0094582X12456678">Quan, 2003</xref>), nor is it realistic to expect that consumers around the world could replicate this concerted effort. Fragmented efforts such as these may continue, with hope for international labor organizing and the building of global solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0094582X12456678">Stirling, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094582X12456678">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Complex global assemblages rely on the impression of disconnection of their parts as a way of avoiding responsibility. For too long, perceptions of a lack of connection were reinforced by great distances, diverse languages, dissimilar labor practices, multiple brands, and different hopes. The expansion of capitalism to the periphery in response to its various crises began as modern forms of discovery and exploration. One of the marvels of globalization is the loss of the obscuring layers of distance and the appearance of new levels of responsibility and weakened rights. Outsourcing “works well” when the hardworking people described in the brochures are ignorant of their rights and when consumers around the world choose to overlook the conditions of production of the goods they buy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0094582X12456678">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12456678">Goldín, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0094582X12456678">Young, 2003</xref>: 44), there was discussion of the need for new institutions with true enforcement power to deal with international agents. Maquila workers are just one piece of a complex global assemblage of industry, technologies, flexible and diminished rights, and layers of intermediaries often linked by common capital and shared goals. They also include households that choose to work and to resist through voluntary turnover, individuals who wear the clothes that others make, and states and nonstate agents with sometimes colliding and sometimes coinciding aims. It is now apparent that these assemblages follow a distinct logic that relies on the pretext of separation and invisibility but that conforms to broadly accepted flexible rules and weak systems of control. Legal protections are detached from their national territorial jurisdictions and become “incorporated into a variety of often highly specialized or partial global regimes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X12456678">Sassen, 2006</xref>: 417). This logic of global engagement relies on the difficulty of enforcement. How can we talk about enforcing rights when the system relies on weak laws meant to be adjusted or loosely applied and even more dubious control mechanisms?</p>
<p>These global regimes connect consumption, production, and circulation in shadowed forms. They are no-man’s-lands of global territories, unclear layers of power and authority that place states against states and transnational capital, workers against workers around the world, and diminished rights. The possibility of locating any meaningful authority in these sites is remote. As long as there are global inequalities, capital with places to move, consumers with choices for cheap commodities, workers desperate to work, and diffuse responsibilities, the prospects for international activism on worker rights are bleak. It is possible, however, that there are vulnerable connectors in this logic of production, and these connectors may represent new spaces for political activism and engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X12456678">Sassen, 2006</xref>). The spaces that lie at the intersection of national and international legal systems are liminal spaces, between areas of structure and order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0094582X12456678">Turner, 1979</xref>), removed from traditional states and territories and vulnerable to weak enforcement. To counter these conditions, one might pursue continued and collaborative work by activists around the world, information campaigns about production processes for consumers and about rights for workers that may contribute to more synchronized action and coalition building (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X12456678">Turner, 2003</xref>). Correcting the situation requires that capital find ever fewer places to move, that consumers become more aware of the social forces behind the product, and that states find ways to stimulate their economies that rely less on foreign investment than on intelligent exploitation of their own resources, human and natural. Workers blame governments rather than capital and corporations for their situation in the world because so many governments have privileged some social sectors over others. Just as we hear about protecting “job creators” in the United States today, many other states have identified capital as the sector that needs state protection. This may change with continued educational campaigns, expanded cross-national activism, and the development of truly independent monitoring systems. These conditions may call for moral rather than legal forces and actual rather than virtual powers that provide a voice to those who are regularly silenced.</p>
