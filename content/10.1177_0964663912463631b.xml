<p>In their edited anthology, <italic>Framing Crime</italic>, editors Keith J Hayward and Mike Presdee present the reader – or better put, the reader-viewer – with 12 globally attuned, skillfully developed and thoroughly engaging essays on the power of the image in the construction and deconstruction of crime. Situated within the oppositional framework of cultural criminology, the book contends with both the proliferation of images in mass-mediated societies and the destabilization of the visual through new technologies and creative interventions. It also packs a political punch. As the authors point out, we live in a world that continually deploys images to objectify and criminalize the socially marginalized, the culturally authorized and the economically disenfranchised. We also live in a world where activists and artists have appropriated visual mediums to resist this epistemic violence, either by producing their own works or by discerning counter-hegemonic messages within the mainstream texts. While it never indulges in polemics, I read the book as an urgent call for critical scholars to not only take heed of these visual contestations but also to aggressively interrupt and intervene in their dynamics. The nice thing about <italic>Framing Crime</italic> is that the essays give their reader-viewers the methodological tools to do this important work. Each chapter includes a ‘Methodological Reflections’ section that offers a guide for critical scholars embarking on their own engagements with the visual.</p>
<p>The book begins with a lucid editorial introduction, ‘Opening the lens: cultural criminology and the image’, that speaks both to the newcomers and to those more experienced in the field. To contextualize the vast arena of crime-related imagery, the editors foreground the ubiquity of visual engagement – whether with video, TV, film, newspaper pictures, advertisements, cell phone photos, artistic expressions, YouTube clips, surveillance monitors or other media – and the role it plays in creating, negotiating or subverting hegemony. While visual analysis of such texts is not unheard of in criminology, the editors rightly point out that much of the existing scholarship reifies the meaning of images as singular and stable. A critical approach must recognize the polysemic character of an image, and engage with, as the editors state, the ‘meaning, affect, situation, symbolic power and efficiency, and spectacle in the same “frame”’ (p. 3).</p>
<p>The next three essays focus on the photographic medium. Phil Carney’s historical analysis is an excellent starting point, providing an account of the photograph as a ‘social practice of production’ (p. 18). Spanning from the mid-19th century to the current media-saturated and digitized moment, Carney’s chapter deploys the trope of the theatre to challenge the notion that a crime photograph represents a real and knowable original and to instead understand such images as festive and performative of power and desire. The following chapter by Jeff Ferrell and Cecile Van de Voorde is an articulate, even poetic challenge to orthodox criminological engagement with photographs and their positivist social scientific underpinnings. In the words of the authors: ‘images, images everywhere, but seldom a drop of critical analysis’ (p. 48). In response, the authors point to the photodocumentary tradition as one site that can engage in ‘visual resistance’ to conventional imagery of crime and criminalized people as well as mainstream criminological research methodologies. The final chapter in this batch of essays, by Philip J. Jones and Clair Wardle, examines the media coverage of Maxine Carr, a woman convicted of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Focusing their analysis on page layout, image montages and headline text in three centre-right British newspapers, the authors demonstrate how exaggerations and distortions of Carr’s culpability perpetuated stereotypical renditions of female criminality. Importantly, the chapter addresses the obstacles the researchers faced in obtaining permission to reproduce the images under analysis. Having personally encountered comparable roadblocks in my own critical analyses of visual texts, I found Jones and Wardle’s attention to this pragmatic issue a valuable inclusion. As the chapter suggests, when academics are prevented from visually reproducing the images under interrogation, our critical impact is undermined, while the profit-seeking and sensationalist image producers can escape critical scrutiny and continue to entrench their ideological agendas.</p>
<p>The next three essays consider how fictional movies inform popular understandings of crime and punishment. Majid Yar’s essay provides a useful overview of some of the central theoretical and methodological approaches employed by critical scholars of film and how they might be taken up by the cultural criminologist. Not surprisingly, but nonetheless still insightfully, Yar suggests adopting a blended or synthetic approach that can include quantitative and qualitative methodologies, Marxist interpretations of a film’s ideologies, and a postmodern understanding of the semiotic instability of the text, including the recognition of embedded subversive messages alongside hegemonic constructions. Using a blended interpretation of the Hollywood film, <italic>Catch Me If You Can</italic>, Yar persuasively demonstrates the ambivalence of the text, which constructs criminal behavior as simultaneously heinous and heroic, deviant and enticing. This essay will be particularly helpful for teaching, as I find students who discover their critical lens in film interpretation tend to overlook any disruptive elements – including affective elements – that may undermine the film’s more explicit ideology. In continuing to focus on the affective nature of film, Alison Young’s chapter advocates for what she describes as a ‘scenographic’ analysis of the film that not only pays attention to narrative but also to camera angle, sound, cinematography, editing, and so on. Using this approach, Young does an intriguing comparative close-text analysis of the affective dimensions of the renditions of rape in <italic>Kill Bill vol. 1</italic> and <italic>The Accused</italic>, ultimately finding that the former in fact does a better job of legitimating the victim’s point of view than the more celebrated feminist film, <italic>The Accused. </italic>While I resist the suggestion that a critical scholar should always position affective processes as the starting point– after all, depending on your research goals, sometimes a simple plot summary <italic>will</italic> do the job – Young’s point is well-taken. Criminology and legal scholars who approach film as a subject of critical inquiry would be wise to seriously consider how an analysis of form, aesthetics and affect may deepen, nuance and trouble their investigations of the cinematic criminal imaginary. The final essay that deals with Hollywood is Alexandra Campbell’s chapter, ‘Imagining the “war on terror”: Fiction, film and framing’. Campbell uses the thriller, <italic>The Siege</italic>, interrogating the terrorist script applied to Muslims in American pop culture and its interaction with broader political agendas. Drawing connections between the Orientalist representation of Muslims in fiction as rabid destroyers, and the gross violations of human rights and legal protections of Muslims in spaces like Guantanamo Bay, Campell explores how Muslims are now understood as occupying only a ‘bare life’, and are thereby excluded from basic civil rights and notions of citizenship. While this issue is close to my heart, I think one can safely say that in light of the rise of Muslims as stock bad guys in Hollywood, and the intensification of Islamaphobia on the national and international stages, this essay could not be timelier.</p>
<p>The next two essays address the undertheorized arenas of aboriginal art and television advertisement. In ‘Framing the crimes of colonialism: critical images of aboriginal art and law’, Chris Cunneen considers how a wide variety of aboriginal artistic expressions – including sketches, sculpture and art installations – articulate aboriginal law and culture while documenting state crime and colonial atrocities. The chapter is a welcome inclusion for its demonstration that the image is not only a medium for the privileged, but is also deployed by ‘communities of resistance’ as an artistic-political-epistemological tool. Stephen L. Muzzatti’s subsequent chapter, ‘“Drive it like you stole it”: A cultural criminology of car commercials’, moves us away from the perspective of those resisting state authority, to instead consider the illusion of resistance and nonconformity in marketing campaigns. Muzzatti analyzes how car commercials market transgression by insinuating that ownership of a particular vehicle endows the consumer with the edginess of criminality. On a broader level, the chapter convincingly positions advertisements as a key source of criminological meaning-making, while exploring the central place of consumerism in the self-construction of identity.</p>
<p>Bruce Hoffman and Michelle Brown provide an intertextual angle in their chapter entitled, ‘Staging an execution: The Media at McVeigh’, which also refers to a documentary they produced with the same name. The authors recount their experiences filming the media coverage and interviewing reporters, protesters and other participants at the execution of the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh. While drawing attention to the pressures and limitations that reporters face in covering such a monumental event, the chapter delves into the resultant ‘ugly criminology’ perpetuated by the media, which decontextualizes interview sound bites, distorts the demographic picture and depoliticizes the messages of protesters.</p>
<p>Damián Zaitch and Tom de Leeuw’s chapter, ‘Fighting with images: The production and consumption of violence among online football supporters’, addresses the incredibly influential medium of internet cultural production. Contributing to the fields of hooligan research, Internet-focused research and masculinity studies, the authors examine how football supporters in Argentina and the Netherlands creatively use website images to construct identity and engage in political struggle. The essay is fascinating and insightful, and also does an effective job of encouraging cultural criminologists to take such on-line popular expression seriously, not only as a reflection of hegemonic masculine norms but also as a rebuttal to prevailing classist ideologies.</p>
<p>The final chapter is a complex and transdisciplinary investigation into the power of the image to narrate mass atrocities. Wayne Morrison’s ‘A reflected gaze of humanity: Cultural criminology and images of genocide’ offers a scathing critique of the alliance between conventional criminology and institutional power that exceptionalizes state-sponsored atrocity and overlooks its criminal dimensions. The chapter, and thus the book, closes on a self-reflexive challenge that suggests cultural criminologists and their ilk must not simply analyze the image, but also consider one’s own phenomenological and political interaction with the visual in our research and scholarship.</p>
<p>I end this book review with my own challenge to those analyzing the visual field in critical scholarship. While the editors are correct that the image has become ‘truly ascendant’ in contemporary times, I was left wondering: how does this fact impact those who are blind or visually impaired? In other words, when one builds a critical anthology that, for the most part, centers on one sense – sight – an important area of consideration might be those who are excluded from the ‘hegemony of vision’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912463631b">David,1993</xref>). While all of the essays challenge the image as an objective recorder of fact, none specifically interrogates the ‘ocularcentric’ paradigm of knowledge, truth and power from a critical disability studies or a crip theory perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912463631b">McCruer, 2006</xref>). I am not disputing the value of an anthology that focuses on the image, but rather suggesting that we need to always be vigilant about how our own framing might unwittingly perpetuate the marginalization of those who sense the world in different ways.</p>
<p>Overall, however, it should be obvious from the foregoing paragraphs that I found <italic>Framing Crime</italic> to be an erudite book that will assist many different audiences, including criminologists, scholars of the law, media or cultural studies, and students in these fields. I encourage those who pick up this book to go through all of the chapters, not just the ones that speak directly to your work. Each essay offers a sophisticated analysis of the image and its semiotic, affective, political and epistemological significance, and each transcends the particular medium it places under study. <italic>Framing Crime</italic> is thus a welcome addition to the field of cultural criminology, and a testament to the brilliant work that is occurring under this rubric.</p>
