<p>Anyone who has struggled to make sense of the Big Red Books or attempted to teach freshmen to do a subject search in the catalog knows that Library of Congress Subject Headings can be less than intuitive. In this book, Vanda Broughton does an admirable job of making sense of the hows and whens (if not always the whys) of the LCSH system. The book will be an excellent introduction both for library students and those looking for a refresher course on subject headings.</p>
<p>The book begins with a brief history of the development of LCSH, which was never intended to be used outside the Library of Congress. As the system gradually became the de facto standard for libraries in the English-speaking world and beyond, it has adapted and evolved, though it maintains its distinctly American accent. Broughton introduces the reader to the overarching principles of the system, including the concept of literary warrant; the problems of subject cataloging using natural language; and some of the inevitable biases of the system. She covers the basics of how headings are formatted and displayed, the choice and form of headings (including the concept of pre-coordination and inversion), and how a piece of content is analyzed. The bulk of the book is given over to explaining main headings, structured headings, topical, geographic, and free-floating subdivisions, and how these can all be combined. Also covered are authority records, pattern headings (entries like ‘Piano,’ which can be used for any musical instrument), chronological headings and subdivisions (which are especially messy), and name headings (the only kind that can be created on the fly) for people, places, corporations, and events. Separate chapters are dedicated to literature and music. Finally, Broughton talks about the practicalities of using LC’s Classification Web and the Library of Congress’s online catalog, although surprisingly there is no mention of WorldCat as a publicly available source for catalog records.</p>
<p>Examples of subject headings are given throughout, some of them highly amusing. (There is a subject heading for ‘Cows on postage stamps’, and another for ‘Front pages of Brazilian newspapers’.) Most chapters have exercises and answer keys for use in the classroom. (These do require access to LCSH, either in print or online.) There is also a helpful glossary. One small objection is that there are several summaries per chapter, sometimes coming every few pages. One summary per chapter would seem sufficient.</p>
<p>Many passages in the book have to be read more than once to be understood, but that probably has more to do with the complexity of the system than with Broughton’s writing style. She brings a subtle, dry British humor to a topic that could be deadly boring. It is easy to get frustrated by the complexities and inconsistencies of LCSH, and Broughton does a good job keeping them in perspective and shaking her head along with us at the system’s quirks. After a particularly confusing example of how topical, geographic, and free-floating subdivisions can be combined, she writes, ‘The important thing here is to keep calm’. A little later, she acknowledges, ‘Be aware that the cataloguers at the Library of Congress itself occasionally do strange things’ (p. 161).</p>
<p>Though it’s perhaps outside the scope of a practical book like this, one does miss a critique of the continuing usefulness of the LCSH. Any frontline librarian knows that few patrons are aware that subject headings exist, let alone understand how to use them. Broughton provides very little justification for why non-cataloging librarians should continue to learn such a complex and inconsistent system in an online world dominated by keyword searching, thesauri, and tagging. She does mention FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology), an effort to ‘deconstruct’ the complex pre-coordinated headings into their basic components, or facets – topical, geographic, period, and form – thus making them more machine readable and easier to apply by non-professional catalogers and indexers. But one comes away with the sense that LCSH is an unwieldy dinosaur that we are stuck with simply because it is too big to fail. As a companion to this book, reference librarians might want to read ALA’s <italic>Magic Search: Getting the Best Results From Your Catalog and Beyond</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612459114">Kornegay et al., 2009</xref>), which takes a practical approach to combining keyword searching with a knowledge of LCSH subdivisions to better exploit the power of the system.</p>
