<abstract>
<p>The current article analyses the papers presented at the 2011 BELMAS Conference in order to understand the sorts of works it contained in terms of topics addressed and types of papers, as well as authorship patterns of the presenters. Based on an analysis of 57 works presented at the Conference, it was found that the typical paper was authored by a single individual, who might originate from countries other than the UK. Additionally, the presenter is usually a university member who presents empirical and conceptual works mostly in the area of policy/reforms and headship (leadership) but not solely. Compared to the 2007 BELMAS Conference, some increase in the works authored by practitioners from schools and a variety of educational agencies was observed. A major shift between the conferences is evident in respect to the topics discussed by the presenters. Some suggestions for BELMAS end this paper.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the second weekend of July 2011, many academics and practitioners in education gathered together in the Robinson Executive Centre in Bedfordshire, not far from Cambridge, to attend the annual BELMAS Conference. Surrounded by the rural landscapes of Wyboston Lake the delegates, who came from different parts of the world, enjoyed a wonderful scholarly and warm atmosphere and had many chances to meet new colleagues and spread their ideas publically. The effective organisation of the conference, including the programme format, the working environment and the accommodation, could be sensed by everyone.</p>
<p>Yet academic conferences are not only a social arena but also another means of knowledge production in any field of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0892020611427930">Gunter, 2002</xref>). These fields are social arenas in which research tasks and specialities are created, abolished and reshaped by internal and external forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0892020611427930">Klein, 1993</xref>), and attempts to demarcate recognisable identities and boundaries are constantly conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892020611427930">Becher, 1989</xref>). Part of the field’s intellectual identity and boundaries is simply generated by what its members publish and where they publish it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0892020611427930">Rodgers &amp; Rodgers, 2000</xref>), in books and academic journals as well as in academic conferences.</p>
<p>In an attempt to shed some light on the field’s emergent intellectual identity and boundaries, I want to reflect systematically in this article on papers presented at the 2011 BELMAS Conference in order to understand the sorts of works it contained in terms of topics addressed and types of papers, as well as the authorship patterns of the presenters. Two major questions guided the analysis: (1) What are the major topics and modes of inquiry presented in this conference? (2) Based on a comparison of topics addressed and types of papers presented at the 2007 and 2011 BELMAS conferences, to what extent do some issues consistently constitute the central focus of scholarly and empirical works in educational management (EM)?</p>
<p>Due to the high importance of reviewing existing research and scholarly directions in any field of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0892020611427930">Ribbins, 2004</xref>), the answers to these questions may provide an opportunity to glean information about the distinctive intellectual identity of the field and the reshaping of its boundaries, and to reveal what the field has become during the last few years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0892020611427930">
<title>Past searches for the knowledge base of EM</title>
<p>The last quarter of the nineteenth century is considered to be the beginning of EM as a profession in the USA and later on as a field of study in universities worldwide. Between 1875 and 1900, concepts of speculative science were dominant, and pioneers, searching for a legitimacy for the new field, stressed the need for a scientific approach to school administration in order to understand the art of running school systems and schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892020611427930">Culbertson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892020611427930">English, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0892020611427930">Heck, 2006</xref>). But, it was not until the early 1960s that the field’s transformation into a science was expressed by a substantial body of textbook literature written specifically for school principals by professors of EM, and by the foundation of refereed journals and academic associations such as the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), the British Educational Leadership Management and Administration Society (BELMAS) and the Commonwealth Council for Educational Administration and Management (CCEAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0892020611427930">Oplatka, 2010</xref>). Ever since, the field’s knowledge base has increased markedly as more and more journals have been founded to allow members of the field to publish their works.</p>
<p>Following the extension of the field’s knowledge base, though, some field members, much concerned about the lack of clear boundaries and cumulative knowledge base, reviewed the content of the papers published in the field’s journals in order to shed light on major focuses and deficiencies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892020611427930">Campbell (1979)</xref>, for instance, found that among the topics of the articles published in the American journal <italic>Educational Administration Quarterly</italic> (<italic>EAQ</italic>) from 1965 to 1978 the most mentioned were: politics/policy-making, school finance, decision-making, motivation/satisfaction, preparation programmes, leadership, administrative behaviour, authority/bureaucracy, collective bargaining and organisational structure. He concluded that <italic>EAQ</italic> had published articles representing a very wide range of topics and that the field had developed few foci of interest around which scholarly interests might be grouped.</p>
<p>In 1990, Swafford analysed the papers published during the first 25 years of the <italic>Journal of Educational Adminstration</italic> (<italic>JEA</italic>). He found the following topics and their frequency in the period examined: ‘the field of EM’, ‘organisational structure’, ‘principalship’, ‘leadership’, ‘organisational climate’, ‘philosophy of EM’, ‘politics of education’, ‘change and innovation’, ‘participatory decision-making’, ‘attitude formation and change’, ‘the inspectorate’ and some minor subjects. Similar topics appeared in the British journal, <italic>Educational Management, Administration and Leadership</italic> (<italic>EMAL</italic>). It contained articles about management training, the relation between the professional and educational roles inherent in headship, and in-school evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892020611427930">Hughes, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Several reviews of the field’s content, both in journals and conferences, have been published during the 2000s. A review of <italic>EAQ</italic>’s content from 1979 to 2003 pointed to a discernable upturn in the share of empirical work in this journal since the late 1980s, including a noticeable increase in the percentage of naturalistic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892020611427930">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, only a very few articles fit into the general category of ‘theoretical and conceptual analysis’. There appears to be a slight decrease in the total number of qualitative studies each year, whereas the total number of quantitative studies (utilising mainly analysis of variance followed by descriptive analyses) is on an upward trend, as another reviewer of this journal identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020611427930">Byrd, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In a series of papers about the works presented at the field’s conferences the field’s knowledge base has been reviewed worldwide. Thus, although the 2006 CCEAM Conference held in Cyprus was embedded with a mixture of ideas and topics with no clear connection between them, it was apparent that certain topics received more attention than others, among them ‘leadership’ and ‘career and policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0892020611427930">Oplatka, 2007</xref>). These topics were also very common at the BELMAS Conference a year later, but were not the only ones. A review of works presented at that conference revealed a wide variety of content debated by field members, such as educational change and improvement, career issues, partnership, leadership and collaboration, leaders’ attitudes, leadership development and headship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892020611427930">Oplatka, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, in reviewing the CCEAM conference held in Durban, South Africa, in 2008, similar topics and epistemological trends were identified. The typical paper was authored by one individual, was empirical and was based on traditional methodologies (e.g. surveys, interviews) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0892020611427930">Oplatka, 2009</xref>). The conferences share similar topics (e.g. leadership, policy, principal preparation, educational change, partnership), a resemblance that may derive from the globalisation of the field and the high ratio of authors from Anglo-American nations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0892020611427930">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The method employed in analysing the Conference’s abstracts was ‘qualitative content analysis’ based on principles of qualitative data collection and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892020611427930">Altheide, 1996</xref>). This sort of analysis illustrates the usefulness of constant comparison for discovering patterns, emphases and themes in an analysis of documents.</p>
<p>For this article I reviewed the ‘Educational Leadership in an Age of Globalisation’ booklet produced by the organising committee of the Conference that contains considerable information about the authors (presenters) themselves and the intellectual and methodological content of their presentations. This booklet formed the database of this review.</p>
<p>The analysis is organised around two central issues: the background characteristics of the presenters (e.g. patterns of authorship, authors’ countries of origin and institutional affiliation) and the presentation (e.g. type of the paper, methodological applications and topics addressed). In the first stage, the personal details of the authors were collected based on the contact details of authors provided by the Conference organisers. Then, each of the 57 abstracts included in the booklet (excluding three key note lectures and two presentations about journals or journal papers) was coded on six variables: number of authors, topic, purpose, type of paper (empirical, comment, conceptual, etc.), subjects and methodology (if available).</p>
<p>Consistent with the method of qualitative content analysis depicted above, topic analysis, at the first phase, was based on common categories/themes in the study of EM (e.g. leadership, policy focus, organisational features, etc.) provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0892020611427930">Swafford (1990)</xref>. With a list of these themes at hand, I tried at the outset to match every abstract’s purpose/topic to the appropriate category. I found it very important to adhere first to common themes prior to any attempt to devise new categories and topics, lest some of them be new titles for existing themes. When a certain abstract did not match any of the common categories, it was categorised into a temporary, new sub-theme. An initial, inductive analysis of the booklet yielded several new categories to more accurately present the common topics discussed at the Conference.</p>
<p>The open coding of the abstracts was followed by a comparison of the abstracts within every category and among the categories to verify clear boundaries between the categories and to trace inconsistencies. This yielded ten distinct topics addressed at the Conference. They were further compared with those found at the previous BELMAS Conference and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892020611427930">Oplatka (2008)</xref> in order to imply the fluid nature of the field rather than to signify any epistemological trend.</p>
<p>I am aware, furthermore, of the potential influence of the analyst upon the selection of the topics addressed in a conference. For this reason, two colleagues trained in qualitative analysis verified the themes grounded from the data and provided useful comments for the analyst.</p>
<p>In addition, as this paper is based, in fact, on an analysis of proposed presentations in the form of abstracts rather than academic papers, one should be aware of the potential differences between the proposed abstracts and the final report presented at the Conference in reality. This potential shortcoming should be taken into account when reading this paper.</p>

<sec id="section4-0892020611427930">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Overall, I examined 57 abstracts of presentations (including those presented in the form of a symposium), discussed and written by authors from a wide variety of countries.</p>
<sec id="section5-0892020611427930">
<title>Authorship patterns</title>
<p>Of the 57 works presented at the Conference, 39 (68.42 per cent) were authored by one person, 16 (27.6 per cent) were authored by two and two (3.5 per cent) had four or more authors. This corresponds, by and large, to the authorship style at the 2007 BELMAS Conference where over two-thirds of the articles were authored by one person rather than a number, a feature of authorship in journals and conferences in the field. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892020611427930">Table 1</xref> depicts the authorship patterns.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, but heart-warming, was the mosaic of many international delegates at the Conference. Although BELMAS is the British society of researchers and practitioners in EM, the 2011 BELMAS Conference was characterised by authors from 15 countries around the globe, 58.02 per cent of which came from the UK, the hosting country. Note that I refer here to the country of all the authors indicated in the Conference booklet, regardless of their actual appearance at the Conference.</p>
<p>As is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0892020611427930">Table 2</xref>, six (7.4 per cent) came from Russia, five (6.17 per cent) came from the US, four each (4.93 per cent) came from Israel and Canada, three (3.7 per cent) came from China, and two each (2.46 per cent) came from Nigeria, Pakistan and France. One author came from each of the following countries: Australia, Kuwait, Italy, Cyprus, Singapore and Malta. As compared to the 2007 BELMAS conference, the number of countries ‘represented’ at the conference has dramatically increased.</p>

<p>Clearly, any attempt to allocate a paper to any one category is somewhat arbitrary, at least in part because the categories themselves are not mutually exclusive and due to the mixture of foci embedded in any paper. Still, the identification of the types of papers presented at the conference may shed light on the nature of works with which members of the field of EM are usually concerned.</p>
<p>Looking at <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0892020611427930">Table 4</xref>, it is clear that many of the papers presented were based on empirical work (56.14 per cent). By ‘empirical work’ I mean papers reporting on any type of research undertaken by the author(s). Sixteen papers (26.31 per cent) were conceptual, i.e. papers that either developed theoretical hypotheses or reviewed an area of study by covering the main contributors to the development of a topic and exploring their various views (e.g. developing educational leaders for managing diversity, leading innovation and professional growth). Nine works were descriptive, i.e. a description of programmes, systems or processes (e.g. educational leadership and globalisation – a school’s perspective, collaboration as a route to school improvement: how North Shields schools have worked together to raise achievement in deprived areas), and one was a viewpoint, i.e. a paper where content was dependent on the author’s opinion; interpretation is included in this category.</p>

<p>Compared to the 2007 BELMAS Conference, there was an increase in conceptual and descriptive works and a decline in historical and evaluative works, but almost no change in the number of empirical reports. This is a welcome shift, in my view, as academic conferences need to enable personal points of view or descriptions of practice in order to stimulate debate and expose field members, especially academics who are accused of working in ‘ivory towers’, to recent, yet unobserved empirically, developments in practice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only four works were comparative in nature, i.e. included a comparison among nations. Comparisons were made of France and the UK, England and Russia, and Singapore and England. One work included a comparison among many Eastern European countries, especially in relation to leader development, a topic that gained much attention at the Conference. Note that all the comparisons included England or the UK, and none presented a comparison between other countries. This reflects, in some sense, the British focus of the Conference as opposed to the nature of many international conferences.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>If we focus on the 32 empirical papers, they included a wide variety of subject groups (24 in total due to a lack of details about the subjects in many abstracts), the majority of which were school teachers (nine studies) and principals (five studies), and to a lesser extent university lecturers (three studies), middle managers in schools (two studies) and pupils (two studies). Interestingly, principal-candidates, stakeholders and directors of children’s services each appeared only in one study. In addition, and as opposed to the 2007 BELMAS Conference, none of the studies (that provided details about the subjects) included policy-makers as subjects. This absence stands in sharp contrast to the appearance of many presentations that analysed policy issues conceptually. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0892020611427930">Table 5</xref> presents the frequencies of the subjects in the empirical works only.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Other aspects of empirical papers were the methods used by researchers to create the knowledge base in their field, as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0892020611427930">Table 6</xref>. Note that due to the use of more than one methodology in several empirical works, the total number of methods (46) outnumbers the total number of empirical works (32). Questionnaires and interviews constituted the main methodological techniques used by authors presenting their works at the Conference (15.21 per cent and 47.8 per cent respectively). But, as opposed to the 2007 BELMAS Conference, there was a sharp increase in the use of document analysis and case studies (15.21 per cent vs 4 per cent, 13.04 per cent vs 0 per cent respectively), a shift that seemed to derive, at least in part, from the continuous permeation of new methodologies into the field of EM. Note, however, that the ratio of quantitative works has tailed off markedly. Here again, however, quite a number of authors unfortunately omitted any information about the methods they employed.</p>

<title>Topics addressed</title>
<p>Of the 57 works presented at the Conference, the most popular topics were related to policy and reform, on one side, and to headship and leadership development, on the other. This might reflect the increasing attention given in the field of EM to evaluative works of policies/reforms and to works studying, and even sometimes glorifying, the centrality of leadership in the school’s success.

<p>Fifteen works (26.31 per cent) focused on policy development, the influence of policies or reforms on the educational system or schools, and schools’ responses to a certain education policies/reforms. For example, one work was devoted to investigate the impact of decentralisation on Arab-Bedouin elementary schools in Israel and how it facilitated implementation of school-based management reform in this country. French principals’ responses to imposed administrative reform in their country were presented by researchers from this country. A conceptual work, in contrast, debated the identification of different forms of globalisation and its benefits for English educational leaders, while a conceptual work written by an American author asked why schools had become the ‘solution’ for the global economic crisis in many reforms.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, much attention was given at the Conference to headship and leadership, especially the development of new and senior leaders. Twelve (21.05 per cent) empirical works revolved around primary and secondary headship, such as the ethical work of head teachers in England, the perceptions of Muslim and Jewish teachers towards the masculinity of male head teachers, the practices that constitute core leadership principles among Cypriot principals and the identities of school principals in the US. None of the works about headship were conceptual or descriptive.</p>
<p>‘Leadership development’ was referred to in ten (17.54 per cent) presentations. Authors proposed a conceptual framework to develop educational leaders for managing diversity, presented a multi-agency leadership development programme or organised a workshop about a programme of schools growing their own leaders in clusters. One author juxtaposed Kenyan safari animals with leadership in cross-cultural contexts as an exercise in which participants are provided with the opportunity to examine complex issues of leadership in leadership development courses. Only three works in this topic were empirical, such as investigating the in-service leadership development practice of woman secondary school head teachers or studying the challenges of leadership development in China.</p>
<p>As BELMAS members have traditionally centred on compulsory education, it was interesting to find five (8.77 per cent) works whose orientation was higher education. Authors displayed a Finnish-Russian joint module on Teaching Foreign Languages to Young Learners intended for pre-service and in-service teachers of foreign languages, explored collaborative interprofessional/departmental practices in Oxford Brookes University, or discussed the implications of education markets to higher education institutions.</p>
<p>Other topics received a limited attention at the Conference. Thus the topics of ‘leadership and collaboration’ (e.g. how to be a collaborative leader, the potential for shaping a democratic education system), role incumbency’ (e.g. teaching-research officers in mainland China, job realities of beginning and experienced assistant principals) and ‘methods’ (e.g. teachers using action research methods as a framework for their continuing professional development in China) were referred to in three works each. ‘Educational change’, a topic of much interest in the field, was the focus of only two works, just like the old topic of ‘organisational environments’. ‘Education law’ was mentioned by one presenter only.</p>
<p>A comparison of the topics presented in the 2007 and 2011 BELMAS conferences reveals stark distinctions. Topics of much interest four years ago, such as educational change, partnership and leaders’ attitudes, have been replaced by new areas of interest (e.g. policy and reform, leadership development, higher education). Yet the study of headship (and educational leadership) remained very widespread, perhaps due to the attendance of many international delegates at the 2011 conference. While it is hard to reach a general conclusion from a small sample of works, the distinction between the two conferences signals, by and large, the uncertain, contextualised and flexible nature of EM as a field of study.</p>

<sec id="section10-0892020611427930">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>What is the portrait of the BELMAS presenter arising from this review? First, consistent with authorship patterns and types of paper in other conferences and in some of the field’s journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892020611427930">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0892020611427930">Oplatka, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892020611427930">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0892020611427930">Swafford, 1990</xref>), the typical paper at the Conference was authored by one individual who might have originated from a different country than the UK. In this sense, although the attendance of international delegates in international conferences (e.g. the CCEAM conference) is usually much higher, the 2011 conference symbolises, in my view, the transition of BELMAS from a local academic society to an international one, acknowledged by scholars from the four corners of the earth. This allows profound intercultural fertilisation, which in turn increases scientific growth as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892020611427930">Dimmock &amp; Walker (1998)</xref> indicated.</p>
<p>Additionally, the presenter is usually a university member but not solely. Compared to the 2007 BELMAS Conference, some increase in the works authored by practitioners from schools and from various education agencies was observed at the current conference, reflecting the field’s practical legacy, i.e. its works that leave us with much knowledge that can be or has the potential to be applied by EM practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0892020611427930">Oplatka, 2010</xref>). Perhaps this partially accounts for a decrease in empirical works, and especially in quantitative inquiries, and an increase in descriptive works, a trend that contrasts the situation in <italic>EAQ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892020611427930">Byrd, 2007</xref>). The empirical legacy of the field, i.e. works that generate new knowledge based on scientific research design, were no longer dominant at the Conference. Note, however, that around one third of the works in 2007 were classified as N/A by type, an absence that makes it difficult to reach any clear conclusions in this respect.</p>
<p>Interesting distinctions between the current conference and the previous one are reflected in the topics addressed. While issues of headship and leadership appeared at both conferences, other topics have almost disappeared at the 2011 conference (e.g. educational change, partnership) and others seem to have permeated the field more extensively (e.g. policy and reform, leadership development, higher education). While it is very hard to gain broad corollaries from two conferences, this shift corroborates the flexible, contextualised nature of the field of EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892020611427930">Culbertson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0892020611427930">Ribbins, 2004</xref>) on one side, and the increasing attention given by field members to globalisation and accountability in education on the other.</p>
<p>Several insights for BELMAS merit highlighting. First, given the high ratio of international presenters at the Conference, questions about BELMAS’s organisational identity may arise. For example, how ‘British’ is BELMAS nowadays? What is the desirable distinction between BELMAS and international academic associations? Second, and similar to the first insight, one may consider the ratio of academics vs practitioners at the Conference. As an applied field of study, EM is oriented both towards theory and practice. How do future conference designers respond to the different needs of both groups? Should they design different presentation formats? Could they expect practitioners to follow strict academic regulations without losing the enchantment of plain descriptions of practice? Third, given the decrease in the ratio of empirical works, what are the implications of this trend for an academic society? Could such a society be considered ‘academic’ while its conference is replete with non-empirical works? This is not to say, of course, that non-empirical works are inferior to empirical ones. Rather, practitioners’ works that reflect on practice are also of much value in an applied field like EM. Finally, future conference designers may want to consider the adoption of structured abstracts as a means to sharpen the type of works and their possible contribution to the field, and help future reviewers identify the type and topics of conference abstracts.</p>
