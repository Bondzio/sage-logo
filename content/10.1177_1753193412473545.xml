<p>What is the aim of this Journal? The question is important even if the answer appears self-evident. We expect authors to provide the aim or purpose of their study at the end of the introduction to their paper. This allows readers to assess the merit of the question(s) being asked and in due course how well they are answered by the study. Like most other journals we state what we do: publish the best papers in our field. This implies that that is solely what we are trying to do. But our aim is surely greater than that. Our aim is to … Well indeed what is our aim? Are we achieving it? How we can achieve an undefined aim is unclear.</p>
<p>I do not believe I know exactly what our aim is nor do I believe as Editor-in-Chief that I alone should set the aim. Rather the aim should be informed by many voices. Once it is stated we can measure our success in achieving it. I will however set out what I believe are the main directions where we should aim and also ask some of the questions they raise. We will in due course clearly state our aim but first I hope to stimulate a debate amongst readers to help direct us.</p>
<p>I believe our aim should at least be to help encourage, improve and disseminate the best knowledge and ideas in our field (that alone may take some defining) to optimize patient care (worldwide – there should be no limit to where we wish make improvements). This is not a “mission statement” to make us proud but to ask what we are doing and to question further what we are not doing. I believe that we should encourage as well as disseminate knowledge. We should not be a passive receptacle for whatever authors feel like submitting. We should do more to direct and guide the work that is produced. We are immensely privileged to have a voice heard by many and we should use it better. We already direct practice such as requiring submissions to be ethical and by commissioning reviews on important topics. But we could do more to encourage better research.</p>
<p>We already improve the submissions we receive or at least we like to think so. The peer review process provides feedback to authors, which is enhanced further in the editing process. We do not know how well we do that although we know we could do it better. Some of the reviews we receive are outstanding. The reviewer has put real effort and thought into their review and even if the paper is rejected the authors will have been helped to improve that and any future studies. Other reviews are virtually worthless. They display a lack of effort and commitment from the reviewer and help neither the authors nor the Editor. We are encouraging our reviewers to improve through rating their reviews and sending them examples of high quality reviews. We are also improving our review panel by removing weak reviewers and adding new enthusiastic ones.</p>
<p>We disseminate knowledge in print and online. We want more readers so that the knowledge we print is read more widely. Our publishers Sage are working hard to achieve this but we need even more input from our readers. Who do you encourage to read this Journal? If no-one, then why not? How do you help improve what we do? Do you ever read an article and find an error or an unsubstantiated claim? If so, do you write in to correct the error or ask for clarification?</p>
<p>We plan to define the aims of the Journal and would welcome input from individuals or groups to try to ensure we achieve the right aims as these will help guide our efforts in the future. To encourage you I will leave some questions: what is the scope of the Journal- hand, wrist and forearm but what about the elbow?; what is the best research - is it always a well conducted RCT, what about a case series that has a new idea that changes practice or a systematic review, i.e. secondary research, that defines what we know and so provides a platform for advance?; how do we encourage good research; do we make the submission restrictions even tighter excluding many good ideas from less experienced units but perhaps pushing researchers to do better; should we offer guidance on a study in its formative stages to try to avoid fundamental flaws (is that the role of a journal); or should we provide assistance, even funding, to conduct research such as systematic reviews?; does the impact factor matter? These and many other important questions need addressing: please help.</p>
