<p>This slim monograph of 111 pages of text packs a wealth of detailed information on the complex issue of peasant burden reduction. After decollectivization in the early l980s, peasants had to pay not just an array of state taxes, but also an even larger array of informal taxes and fees, a substantial portion of which were not officially approved. During the l990s, the Chinese government became increasingly concerned about the discontent and unrest that these levies provoked. But it was not until the end of the decade that top leaders made up their minds to find effective solutions. They took steps to pressure local authorities, using performance contracts, to reduce burdens. As this process gathered steam, a large number of exactions were cancelled culminating in 2006 with the abolition of the age-old agricultural tax, which actually contributed only a tiny portion to the state budget. Some types of extraction continued but overall, this reform was of substantial benefit to China’s villagers.</p>
<p>Instead of choosing between a ‘top–down’ and a ‘bottom–up’ approach, the author, Linda Li, combines them. Li analyses in detail the complex interplay between actors at various levels of the hierarchy, from the centre on down. She locates the origins of tax reform in the countryside but considers carefully how local initiatives had to pass muster from higher authority. Successful tax reform required coming to grips with the major side effect of the reform project, which was that it would deprive the townships of essential revenues. Thus, the crucial issue was sustainability.</p>
<p>One solution to the revenue question was to reduce the large bureaucracies of the townships, which, it was hoped, would free up resources lost from burden reduction. But downsizing was a politically sensitive task, since it affected the livelihood of cadres who had been on the state’s payroll. Letting people go proved to be much more expensive than anticipated, so that the actual savings were not that great. Another solution was the allocation of payments by the centre to offset revenue losses, which was made possible by the rapidly increasing flow of tax money to the centre in the first decade of this century. But these transfers were usually, though not always, not even remotely sufficient. Still another solution that did help the townships was to assign payment of teachers’ salaries and of some other services to the counties. Despite the latter, townships were plunged into an even more precarious financial situation than before. Li blames this outcome on the lack of careful planning. She notes, ‘A complex and multifaceted issue was reduced to one of maladministration and bad institutional designs at local levels’ (p. 100). Inadequate planning was only part of the problem, however. In 2003, China’s leaders promised a new deal for the peasants, but this would have required addressing the actual financial needs of the rural sector. Instead, they adopted a quick-fix solution that left the townships holding the bag.</p>
<p>Townships responded by reducing development projects, the supply of public goods – an interesting chapter deals with the marketizing of government services – and by incurring more debts. Of course corruption made the financial situation worse. Faced with the task of finding money needed to govern and meet higher-level assignments, rural governments stepped up the requisitioning of peasant land sold at high prices to developers, thereby exacerbating what was already a bitter source of conflict between farmers and the local state, one that largely replaced the conflict over peasant burdens. For reasons not altogether clear the author did not engage with the confiscation of village land.</p>
<p>The author successfully employs numerous theoretical concepts, such as institutionalism, path dependency, and policy analysis to illuminate her empirical material. This makes the study very useful for graduate students in the social sciences who are learning how to analyze Chinese data in terms of relevant theories. The empirical material is based on 19 trips between 2002 and 2006 to three provinces, as well as the printed literature. Interviews with Beijing officials allowed Li to gain a degree of insight into top-level motivations, which is often missing from studies of rural politics.</p>
<p>Graphs and tables illuminate the points Li is making. Overall, while the monograph could have benefitted from better editing, since it is marred by some grammatical errors and misspellings, including words in pinyin, this volume is a significant, specialized contribution to our understanding of the predicament of the countryside.</p>
