<p>Theories come to fruition and often wane, but then are sometimes revived afresh in a slightly new form. This is the case with this published PhD on the courtly nature of the book of Proverbs. In the 1960s and 70s the ‘royal’ nature of wisdom literature in general and Proverbs in particular was stressed in the scholarship in large part on the basis of ancient Near Eastern parallels, but also arguing from the concerns of the text itself. In subsequent decades these theories largely fell from favour, and were thought to have been over-emphasized. But Ansberry is not simply trying to revive an old hypothesis; rather he presents the evidence afresh in a new context. He too looks at ancient Near Eastern parallels and does a careful analysis of the contents of the different sections that make up Proverbs. In addition however he uses the rather new vocabulary of finding a ‘discourse setting’ for the book, i.e. a social and dialogical context through which the material is conveyed. In chapter 1 he states his method and then in chapter 2 surveys the ancient Near Eastern material. Of course it is clear that the Egyptian instructions often address an official class. Indeed the very written nature of these documents narrows the social context down to an elite, educated group. He points out how in Syrian and Mesopotamian material too there is an important link between social order, as realized through the royal bureaucracy, and the cosmic order itself. In the following chapters Ansberry turns to distinct sections of Proverbs and discovers the courtly flavour of each. He argues, following Brown, that there is a distinct development running through the book whereby simple sayings become more complex, the domestic sphere makes way for the royal and where the ambiguous addressee gradually becomes the more explicit, naïve (but noble) youth requiring sound moral, ethical, practical and institutional advice. A gradual elevation of the level of ‘discursive elocution’ is found running through the book’s sections, according to Ansberry, culminating in ‘advanced wisdom’ in Proverbs 25-9, which develops its own critique in 27-9 and then in a fresh recontextualization of the proverbial discourse in Proverbs 30-31 (in terms of a royal hierarchical vision of the world in chapter 30 and a heroic pangyric, the singular, exceptional woman, in Prov 31:10-31). Ultimately Ansberry sees the book of Proverbs as ‘a cultural primer that seeks to inculcate proper ethical values into its recipients’ (p. 187). It teaches social competence and a moral vision that ultimately transcends social boundaries. It is ‘a work of the court, by the court and for the court but in the interests of the people’ (p. 189). This is a well argued, thorough piece of work. Its fresh emphasis on the aristocratic nature of Proverbs is timely. I am less convinced by the developmental argument for the book, which seems almost too neat if it is by design. One wonders if anyone ever conceived the book that way. Yet it is a stimulating argument and a book that deserves to be taken seriously within the field.</p>

<p>Although this book is a survey of Old Testament wisdom literature as the title of the book suggests, it is in fact much broader in scope. There are some elements of introduction to the genre, but it is much richer and broader than most such introductions. The New Testament is brought into the equation at some length, as is also an engagement with the wisdom literature from the angle of Christian life and thought in the present world. The book explores issues that relate to the wider worlds of philosophy, poetry, education and government and it even engages with scientific enquiry in the interests of modern relevance. The way the book is structured is that as well as an overview chapter for each wisdom book there is also a chapter on one particular poem within each of the books. This is an interesting technique that highlights Proverbs 31, Job 28 and Ecclesiastes 3 for example. They describe the book of Ecclesiastes as ‘like an octopus: just when you think you have all the tentacles under control…there is one waving about in the air.’ (p. 188) and include a fascinating excurses on the theology of time. This enables engagement on more general theoretical and theological and more specific textual levels that is a useful and innovative method. This is engagingly written with some personal anecdotes included – one of its authors (O’Dowd) reveals that he has moved from working in Old Testament to the aerospace industry, and yet despite that he is co-author of this book! Its chatty nature makes this a readable resource, bringing scholarship and modern relevance together. If I have any criticism it is of its slightly dated scholarship of the wisdom literature – good standard material but not very cutting edge. There are memorable sentences throughout, such as ‘Wisdom has as much to do with fractals and quantum physics as it does with marriage and family life’ (p. 28) which gets across the point that practical knowledge is as important as scientific knowledge. They complain that in today’s world our emphasis on autonomy and universal scientific knowledge has led to a marginalization of the tradition, and of local knowledge as encapsulated in Proverbs. However, they then go on to show how the local in Proverbs can become the universal in its emphasis on experience. The aim of the authors is to revive the wisdom tradition in the theology of the church today and I would say that they largely succeed in that worthwhile task.</p>

<p>With striking honestly, Chris Boesel embarks upon a creative exploration of the theological and ethical underpinnings of Christian-Jewish dialogue. Boesel’s engaging style and conversational approach invites the reader to consider vital matters, taking into account their own experiences and journeys along the theological highway of faith. The question of ‘whose voice’ might be in any way representative of a particular viewpoint is a very pressing concern if dialogue is to be in any way productive. This book positively wrestles with some of the complexities spoken and unspoken, in what is a well-trodden area. What Boesel brings that is fresh, is an acknowledgement (as hinted above already) that words have ethical import. The process of exploring relationships involves an active encounter between groups or individuals. Through a deep engagement with Barth, Ruether, Kierkegaard and other influential thinkers, this book re-examines some of the deep-held theological assumptions behind understandings of the Christian faith that have led (perhaps even subconsciously) to an imperialistic stance. Boesel discovers that, despite their contributions to the discourse, these heavyweight theologians cannot break free from their own imperialistic methods. To find a way through, the work of philosophers Derrida and Levinas is imaginatively employed, before a final return (with perhaps changed perspectives) to what Barth can actually offer. My only critique would be a wondering if the methodology of this book would engage all Christian perspectives (other than an evangelical one), and what those different perspectives themselves might offer the conversation? I am not convinced either by Boesel’s insistence on using feminine pronouns for the Divine.</p>

<body>
<p>Edwin Broadhead has written a brilliant study on the section of the early Jesus movement usually described as Jewish Christianity. This volume takes the debate forward in significant ways by recognizing the diversity that existed within that broad section of early Christianity often lumped together under the umbrella term of Jewish Christianity. Broadhead guides readers through this highly contested area of scholarship with great clarity and sober judgments.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into five major sections. The first probes a number of the issues surrounding scholarship on this topic, including a detailed survey of the history of research, consideration of the problems that surround defining the term ‘Jewish Christianity’, and strategies that research can bring to the quest of studying early Jewish believers in Jesus. The second part, ‘Points of Origin’, commences with a chapter that stresses the necessity of taking seriously the Jewishness of Jesus as an originating factor in early Christianity. However, Broadhead’s thinking is sophisticated enough to see that Jesus inaugurated new perspectives within Judaism: ‘If Jesus is a Jewish prophetic figure, it is reasonable to expect a prophetic revisionist form of Jewishness will dominate among the earliest communities of his followers and within the earliest texts produced by those communities’ (p. 79). With that fundamental insight, Broadhead turns his attention to early Jesus communities (pp. 80-127), and their writings (pp. 128-160). Insights abound on every page, with communities such as Jerusalem, the Galilee, Antioch, Rome, Alexandria, and Pauline congregations being the subjects of close analysis. The breath of data considered is impressive, including topographical features, textual remains, and ecclesial succession lists. Part three moves to a later stage of movement, by bring together ‘Patristic Representations of Jewish Christianity’. Here the book concentrates on descriptions of Nazarenes (pp. 163-187), and Ebionites (pp. 188-212) as portrayed in the writings of early Christian writers such as Jerome, Epiphanius, and Tertullian, among others. Part four expands the scope of this study by drawing together further evidence for Jewish Christianity. Here the topics include a treatment of possible Jewish Christian writings such as the Jewish Christian Gospels – here one might have wished for more discussion on the number of Jewish Christian Gospels and recent questions raised about the whole category (a. Gregory, ‘Hindrance or Help? The Category of “Jewish-Christian Gospels” <italic>JSNT</italic> [2006] 387-413). Other sources of evidence in this section are drawn from Rabbinic texts and archaeological findings; this makes for a very rich survey of relevant evidence. The final section, ‘The Significance of Jewish Christianity for Contemporary Scholarship’, assesses some of the key debates especially surrounding the so-called ‘parting of the ways’. Broadhead’s complaint against this terminology is that it ‘is a grand narrative built largely on official pronouncements and imperial decrees; it may have little relationship to the experience of individual believers in local communities’ (p. 389). Instead, Broadhead prefers to speak of a <italic>forming of the ways</italic> as affirming the formative stages of both rabbinic Judaism and emerging orthodox Christianity. It is argued that Jewish Christianity is not some minor strand in developing Christianity, but in fact has left its imprint on the entire movement.</p>
<p>This is a fascinating, clearly written study, which finds its strength in drawing together so many relevant strands of evidence while articulating a cogent thesis about the entirety of early Christianity being shaped by its Jewish heritage. This book is of enormous relevance to New Testament scholars, for those who study Patristics, and anybody interested in the emergence of Christianity in its first few centuries.</p>

<p>A lecturer teaching a course on exegetical method has a number of good potential textbooks at his or her disposal. However, N. Clayton Croy has managed to produce, in short compass, a manual that capably handles questions about the hermeneutics of meaning, the process of basic exegesis, and the main obstacles and challenges of applying the Biblical text to the modern situation all in one place.</p>
<p>The book is composed of four chapters: ‘Analyzing and Preparing the Interpreter,’ ‘Analyzing the Text,’ ‘Evaluating and Contemporizing the Text,’ and ‘Appropriating the Text and Transforming the Community.’ The chapters flow, one to the next, quite smoothly based on the ‘model for Biblical interpretation’ he outlines. First comes ‘self-awareness,’ then ‘exegesis’ (textual analysis), then ‘hermeneutics’ (determining the ‘truth revealed by God through the human author’), and finally ‘Application’ (‘responding to Scripture as God’s Word for faith and practice’). Unfortunately, the balance of the chapters, in terms of length, is a bit awkward – the second chapter is over one hundred pages, while the other three are each less than thirty pages long.</p>
<p>The title of the book is explained in the third chapter where he offers a helpful discussion of the hermeneutical relationship between Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. He argues that the Reformers did not mean for the motto <italic>sola scriptura</italic> to imply that non-biblical sources should be wholly ignored. Rather, Scripture was elevated to the highest level as authority, with ‘tradition’ given weight, but not equal to or above Scripture. The same would be true for experience and reason, though Croy posits that Scripture is read <italic>through</italic> tradition, reason, and experience, and not just <italic>alongside</italic> them. Given the supremacy of Scripture in the determination of truth and right practice, he reasons that a more appropriate motto would be <italic>prima scriptura</italic>.</p>
<p>Croy’s text has a number of useful appended items including sample exegesis papers and a chart comparing and contrasting the textual apparatuses and overall purposes of the UBS Greek NT and the NA<sup>27</sup> Greek NT. A bibliography of works on hermeneutics and exegetical method appears after the appendixes.</p>
<p>This book was a joy to read and offers a treasure trove of tips for exegesis as well as numerous witty anecdotes. Croy is remarkably comfortable discussing both theoretical as well as practical matters. If you are going to teach a course, though, that is going to work closely with the Greek text, I would recommend pairing this textbook with a book that treats semantic, grammatical, and syntactical issues more rigorously. His discussion of grammatical matters, for example, spans less than ten pages.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in hermeneutics and theological interpretation of Scripture.</p>

<body>
<p>In <italic>Ascension Theology</italic>, Douglas Farrow presents a bold and bombastic defence of the importance of the doctrine of the Ascension. For a short book which even includes coloured pictures it is ambitious in its survey of scripture and the tradition. Farrow offers an approach similar to that presented in his earlier <italic>Ascension and Ecclesia</italic> (1999), but modified by his newly found Roman Catholicism, which has been embraced with the zeal of the convert. For Farrow, a proper understanding of the ascent of Christ, the corresponding descent, and the eschatological return, offers a solution to virtually all the problems of politics and ethics. There is much to commend here: the emphasis on the flesh and the body of Christ is a welcome riposte to over-spiritualised theologies. Similarly, there is significant reflection on the way in which ascension and the parousia are reflected in Eucharistic theologies, and on the importance of ensuring that the eschatological perspective is maintained as a corrective to over-realised theologies. The expository sections are impressive, even if sometimes the reading of scripture is overly decontextualized. Farrow undoubtedly knows the tradition very well.</p>
<p>However, while there is much that is thought-provoking and scholarly, the book is marred by a deeply problematic form of discourse. Aidan Nichols describes the book as ‘beautifully written’, which seems to me to be a bizarre understanding of beauty. Instead I found it aggressively intolerant and frequently tasteless. Applying the term <italic>Lebensraum</italic> (p. 36) to a discussion of Irenaeus in relation to the living space created by the father is highly dubious. The anti-liberal invective grows even worse by p. 53 when there is an assault on feminist, queer, communist, capitalist, or eco-Christs, which are understood as expressions of an immanentism that resembles the racialist Nazi-inspired theology of the 1930s. Yet there is no effort to understand what such theologies are seeking to do. Farrow moves into a direct assault on democracy (p. 104) and what he calls ‘state-sanctioned ideologies’ such as same-sex marriage and the ‘contraceptive mentality’ (p. 108). By p. 110 the author attacks human rights ‘and deceptive abstractions like “pluralism” and “tolerance”, which serve only to push those of particular faith and conviction … into the maw of their homogenizing machine’. It is hard to see Canadian multi-culturalism in such dangerous caricatures. There is an extreme passion in chapter six that is likely to force the more liberal-minded reader to ask whether there is anything remotely appealing about such a macho and belligerent form of Christianity. This is a book with no shades of grey. For those of us who inhabit a world and a church where grey is the order of the day, Farrow’s version of Christianity offers little to help us make sense of a world which was created by God and whose inhabitants were created in his image, and in which we are instructed to love our enemies in a messy world full of compromises.</p>

<p><italic>The Doors of the Sea</italic> was first published in 2005 in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami that had killed over 200,000 people a year earlier. Now available in paperback, its author, David Bentley Hart, treats the tsunami with the theological seriousness and elegant prose for which he is justly known. In the first half of the book, he examines rival secular and Christian interpretations of the ‘meaning’ of the tsunami. At no point does he condescend or fail to appreciate the moral seriousness of the questions they raise: Christians do need to account for the goodness of God in the face of grave injustices. Hart rejects deterministic and punitive theologies and, wisely, sidesteps the too-easy distinction between ‘natural’ and ‘moral’ evils. The mass death of children, whether by tsunami or war, is a cause for moral outrage. An appropriate Christian response will refuse to exchange moral outrage for God’s goodness, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Hart’s attempt to articulate such a response constitutes the second half of <italic>The Doors of the Sea</italic>. It is, refreshingly, merely a presentation of the gospel, albeit one with a strong polemic against double predestinarianism and a slight bent toward Gnosticism. Hart, who is an Eastern Orthodox theologian, draws from biblical and patristic sources to argue that evil and death are distortions of God’s good creation wrought by misused human freedom. These distortions are overcome by Christ’s resurrection. Tsunamis, earthquakes, wars—all is but a temporary departure from the peace which is our origin and goal as creatures. The popular effort to invest disaster with ultimate meaning is mistaken, because its only significance is as a sign of a fading rebellion.</p>
<p>Hart is surely correct that the gospel is close to Gnosticism (p. 95). Both Gnostics and the apostolic writers shared a vision of an enslaved cosmos requiring liberation from without. Nevertheless, Christianity, with its glorification of the word made flesh, is also close to materialism. Hart is careful not to endorse Gnosticism as such, and insists on the goodness of creation (p. 96). Yet his emphasis on the non-being of evil would seem to encourage passivity rather than steadfast resistance. There is no mention of any political steps that could be taken, for instance, to reverse the environmental degradation that is likely connected to the recent uptick in large-scale disasters. There is, more to the point, no mention of the church in Hart’s presentation of the gospel. New Testament cosmology gives a central place to the church as the first fruits of God’s everlasting peace. By embodying and proclaiming peace, the church participates in God’s reign now. Hart is correct that the solution to the problem of evil is the gospel. The gospel, thank God, is that for those who are in Christ there is a new creation.</p>

<p>Much of the Christian world lacks sufficient awareness of the wider context in which the figures of the New Testament moved. Moyer Hubbard, professor at Talbot School of Theology, addresses this need in his book <italic>Christianity in the Greco-Roman World</italic>, a book targeting undergraduate-level readers and working expositors.</p>
<p>There is much to praise about Hubbard’s effort. Hubbard provides a topical look at key areas of that world: 1. Religion and superstition; 2. Education, philosophy, and oratory; 3. City and society; and, 4. Household and family. Although this is a broad range for a compact volume to address, Hubbard limits the scope of his work, responsibly admitting that the subject is massive (p. 4). While the popular format makes the most of options such as sidebars and eye-catching fonts, the inclusion of fictional narratives to introduce each chapter is odd, and distracts from the non-fictional narrative value of the New Testament that the author is attempting to highlight. This work is a well-written narrative, well organized and thoroughly indexed enough to remain a useful reference. The notes (sadly, in publisher- but not reader-friendly endnote format) are thorough and provide pointers to much of the available scholarly literature for those needing to research an issue more carefully.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while Hubbard intends to ‘whet your appetite for further study!’ (p. 5), that further study is constrained by the choices that Hubbard presents to the reader. While most of his selections of data are judicious, some are one-sided. For example, Hubbard references 1 Timothy 2 regarding the role of women, noting ‘Paul does impose limitations,’ (p. 207) without engaging even in an endnote the large body of literature that contests his interpretations of the passage, even from within evangelicalism, such as Catherine Cark Kroeger. Whatever one’s interpretation of women in ministry, their understanding will be better informed by the arguments on both sides, based on historical context and early church practice. Likewise, the section on religion (pp. 20-58) treats polytheism and highlights the infusion of Eastern mystery religions into Greco-Roman culture, but only within a polytheistic framework. This work would benefit from engaging the phenomenon of ‘pagan monotheism’ as copiously written on by modern scholars (Mitchell, Athanassiadi, Frede, <italic>et al</italic>.). The publishers may cite space constraint as justification, but such space could easily be freed up by elimination of the fictional narratives introducing each section.</p>
<p>On balance, this is a useful work, since anything that provides context at a popular level is a welcome addition to this field. One expects that the sales will justify a second edition, which will hopefully broaden the boundaries of information included. Nevertheless, academic readers and many expositors will likely prefer Klauck’s <italic>The Religious Context of Early Christianity: A Guide to Graeco-Roman Religion</italic> (Edinburgh, 2000).</p>

<p>It may appear strange to describe a commentary that is more than eight hundred pages long as being ‘mid-length’, but given the tendency with a number of recent volumes that description is indeed apt. This commentary is accessible, reasonably centrist in it exegetical comments, and up-to-date with the latest debates. As such, it is likely to occupy a prominent place on reading lists for students undertaking exegetical courses on Romans, or Pauline theology more widely.</p>
<p>The volume has a brief introductory section (pp. 1-27), and a useful bibliography (pp. 27-34). Hultgren sees the outlook of the epistle as theocentric, with the primary question it seeks to answer being ‘how can God reclaim the creation?’ (p. 26). With two subsidiary questions being ‘how can God include Gentiles?’ and ‘if justification is by faith in Christ, how can God save his people Israel?’ (p. 26). In relation to the vexed question of ‘purpose of Romans’, Hultgren detects multiple aims, among which are Paul setting forth his missionary plans, an assurance that he is not seeking to establish another congregation to rival those already in Rome, and also to present his theological understandings. The focus of this book is upon the exegetical comments. The commentary proper is arranged into ten sections, following the proposed structural units. Each major unit follows the same general pattern. For example, chapter two (pp. 85-147) covers Rom 1.18-3.20, and commences with a brief introduction to the whole unit (pp. 85-86). Then the commentary divides the larger unit up into sub-units, in this section five of them. The first (pp. 86-110) covers Rom 1.18-32, and commences with Hultgren’s translation followed by note on the text and translation; these consider different English translations, text-critical matters, and even matters of grammar and syntax. After this there is a ‘general comment’ (pp. 88-89), which outlines the central thrust of the passage under consideration, then follows the detailed comments (pp. 89-105), and the relevant bibliography (pp. 105-110). The sectional bibliographies should not be neglected, since they list a range of pertinent works for further research. Hultgren’s detailed comments are clear, and seek to assist readers to understand the flow of the overall argument of the letter. He emphasizes an apocalyptic or eschatological dimension in Paul’s theological thinking, noting that the ‘declaration of the revelation of the wrath of God at 1:18 is expressed in the language of apocalyptic’ (p. 90). Here it would have been helpful to see interaction with Campbell’s <italic>Deliverance of God: An Apocalyptic Rereading of Justification in Paul</italic>, and while that work is cited in the bibliography (p. 711) it makes no obvious impact on the commentary. One assumes it appeared too late to be used. The main reason this is a pity is that although Hultgren emphasizes apocalyptic categories, he does so in a way different from Campbell, and it would have been insightful to have had some reflection upon the varied approaches. This section covering Rom 1.18-32 is also supplemented by an appendix entitled ‘Romans 1:26-27 and Homosexuality’, (pp. 616-622). While some may wonder why this has been placed as an appendix rather than an integrated excursus, the decision seems sensible since it allows the emphases of the letter to be followed in the commentary section, while treating more contemporary topics in a detailed, but non-distracting manner in the appendices.</p>
<p>This is a solid commentary, which presents clear exegesis along mainstream scholarly lines. As such, it is likely to be an excellent guide to students and pastors, and the general comments allow one to gain a quick orientation to the overall flow of Paul’s thought in this letter. This is a helpful volume and a useful supplement to other scholarly commentaries on Romans.</p>

<p>By asking, ‘How were books imagined in early modern England?’ James Kearney places his finger on the pulse of a far-reaching change in the conception of the written word that took place during the Reformation, when the materiality of the word became a crux for the interpretation of revelation, authority and conversion.</p>
<p>Nowadays writing is often held to be primarily an instrument, a medium for communication. It lacks numinosity; it is immediately connected with disembodied speech. Kearney, however, shows us how deeply our assumptions about writing are historically and culturally conditioned. The written word is a material form, and as such is always embodied. From the start Christianity seems to have had a special relationship to the materiality of the word, privileging the codex when surrounding cultures were still usually using scrolls. By the Middle Ages, practices of veneration of books were common; not just the Bible, but also other liturgical and religious books were revered in this way. The material form of Scripture and the physical form of Christ flowed into each other in contemplative allegories about the mystery of the Word become flesh. The Reformers’ attempt to champion the Word over the Image led them into paradoxes, for the Word itself was also an Image, a form of representation. Language itself was part of the Fall; the Bible was, for Luther, ‘a necessary evil’ (p. 23, quoting H. Oberman).</p>
<p>Kearney’s study of the conception of the book at this crucial period is complex and nuanced, and therefore interesting. He resists the simple understanding of a Protestant conception of the word gradually triumphing over a Catholic one, and offers us a series of connected insights into literature at a long period of transition, when people were grappling with the problem of representation and language in relation to faith and truth. He begins with Erasmus, Tyndale and More, arguing that the move from image-focused piety to text-focused piety was particularly bound up with these figures. Chapter 2 examines Spenser’s <italic>Fairie Queene</italic> as an exploration of the paradoxes opened up when an iconoclastic culture gives iconic status to the book. Chapter 3 investigates narratives of textual conversion, particularly the conversion to evil portrayed in Marlowe’s <italic>Doctor Faustus</italic>, which Kearney relates to other seminal accounts of textual conversion, especially Augustine’s and Luther’s. Chapter 4 presents a fascinating argument that whereas the ‘idol’ had traditionally been the ‘disavowed object par excellence’ in Christianity, by the Enlightenment it had yielded that role to the ‘fetish’. ‘Fetishes’ were the kinds of things that Europeans encountered the New World; they differed from idols inasmuch as idols are a threat, for they have the potential to seduce the soul, whereas fetishes only inveigle other people, and remind iconoclasts of how enlightened they are by comparison. The book is the counterpart of the fetish: it demonstrates that reason, enlightenment and providence is on the book-bearing European side in their pursuit of world-dominion. Kearney reads Shakespeare’s <italic>Tempest</italic> in connection with this discourse, as a story in which Prospero is called to let go of books and liberal arts with their illusion of power, authority and transcendence, and to accept the ineluctability of labour and death in the fallen world. An Epilogue explores the enchantment and disenchantment of the book in Francis Bacon’s <italic>New Atlantis</italic>.</p>
<p>At times it seems that this insightful book is almost bursting at its seams with ideas, which makes it both a pleasure and a challenge to read. Written by a scholar of English, it is relevant to History and Theology, and the issues it raises about what the Bible is, and what the relationship is between words and the Word, are significant also for Biblical Studies.</p>

<p>Cleophus J. LaRue’s book, <italic>I Believe I’ll Testify</italic> targets homiletics and rhetoric scholars, and pulpit clergy. Throughout the text the author exposes the underlying pillars which characterize the most exemplary African American preachers. Beyond natural giftedness, LaRue provides the reader with the rhetorical strategies and sermon preparation methods geared towards an effective delivery measurable by the message’s ability to resonate with the entire person.</p>
<p>The author critically opposes the extremities of the non-emotive cognitive sermon and the emotionally dynamic sermon without purpose. The greater of the two concerns lies in homiletic trends that ‘forget to preach Jesus and his crucifixion’ (p. 44) due to the drives for broad appeal and yielding to the snares of worldly success. The volume functions as a manifesto in the jeremiad tradition to call both pre- and post-vocational seminarians, and novice and seasoned preachers to rise above the currents of change that provoke compromising the Gospel.</p>
<p>Although LaRue presents African American preaching as the primary emphasis, he stresses that no racial or ethnic group has a monopoly on homiletic theory, or the theological agenda for the diversity of preaching discourses. ‘A healthy appreciation of and lively exchange between all homiletic traditions will result in stronger preachers irrespective of ethnicity, gender, regional differences, and denominational ties.’ (p. 35) In Chapter four, the reference to Philip Jenkins’ <italic>The Next Christendom</italic> addresses the demographic trajectory of South America and Africa replacing North America with the largest population of Christianity and highlights the key point that the Western Church can no longer sustain an exclusivist theological worldview. Most other books on preaching in the African American tradition fail to acknowledge how these potent demographic shifts impact the context of the inter-cultural exegetical dialogue.</p>
<p>As a preacher scholar, LaRue refers to his previous book entitled <italic>The Heart of Black Preaching</italic> the five domains of the ‘black lived experience’, which include ‘personal piety, care of the soul, social justice, corporate concerns, and maintenance of the institutional church’ (p. 65). The text demonstrates that these domains apply to the universal human experience and must be preached from pulpits across racial and cultural lines. The book’s most beneficial feature lies in the author’s detailed account of the sermon preparation process which includes exegetical diligence, the use of a healthy and robust imagination, and intentional colorful language.</p>
<p>Unlike other previous works of a similar genre, <italic>I Blieve I’ll Testify</italic> does not provide the in-depth heritage of African American preaching from the colonial era through the Twentieth Century. Such purposeful omission helps the author concentrate the book’s content on revisiting the sense of urgency in preaching, which he describes as somewhat lacking in much of present day preaching.</p>

<body>
<p>In <italic>Deep Exegesis</italic>, Peter Leithart argues that a deep (and accurate) exegesis of the biblical text should yield something like the quadriga, the hermeneutical method developed by medieval bible teachers which culled literal, christological, tropological, and anagogical meaning from the text.</p>
<p>In chapter one, Leithart mounts an offensive against the Kantian ‘text as husk to be discarded, essence as kernel to be kept’ approach to Scripture study. Firing salvo after salvo at Kant and his exegetical opponents, Leithart seeks to destroy what he regards as the dangerous notion that we can discard the historical husk to feed on the metaphysical essence of a text.</p>
<p>After tearing down the dichotomistic hermeneutics of Kant and his intellectual inheritors, Leithart spends the remainder of the book endeavouring to build up what he calls a ‘hermeneutics of the letter’ (p. 34). In so doing he seeks to show how much can be gained from feeding on the husk that modern hermeneutics tends to discard. Far from proving irrelevant to a text’s essence, the husk of history and politics and blood and battle and myriad other gritty details will take us to the essence. It will take us to Him (ch. 6).</p>
<p>One of his most brilliant insights is that the beginning of a text (and of an event) cannot be understood until its middle and end inform it. It is only in retrospect and after repeated readings that we can begin to understand the beginning. ‘Texts must be read in light of the way things turned out’ (p. 67). Genesis 1 cannot be understood until we reach John 1 and read John back into Genesis. Thus does John give us a richer and truer understanding of Genesis.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Leithart’s effervescence loses fizz by the end. Chapter 6 drags the reader back into the same text used throughout the book (John 9) without shedding new light on the subject. The chapter’s title (‘Texts Are about Christ’) leads us to expect consummation; we get stagnation instead. Other arguments are attenuated and lead to wild theologizing. The Pharisees and even the man born blind may well emit Oedipal resonances, but is that germane to a rigorous and responsible biblical exegesis?</p>
<p>In one sense this is a complex and wide-ranging book (Leithart cracks like zig-zag lightning through Chrysostom, Kant, Stanley Fish, Cormac McCarthy, Dante, Homer, Bach, Umberto Eco and countless others, illuminating each work with his insights). In another sense it is simple, making one plea: give the Bible its due by reading slowly and studiously, reverently and creatively, always worshipfully and ever with an eye to the possibility of its fullness informing every passage. Does Leithart make a convincing case for the need for a return to something like the fourfold medieval method? Not quite, perhaps. But <italic>Deep Exegesis</italic> is a scandalously fun read and a welcome invitation to take a second look at the way we read Scripture. Various reservations notwithstanding, this reader highly recommends it.</p>

<p>Matthew Marohl presents a novel interpretation of a familiar verse. He argues that in Matt 1.19, where we are told that Joseph opted not to disgrace Mary, the text actually means that he opted not to disgrace her by having her executed to uphold his family’s honour. Marohl also sees 1.19 as the first example of a motif that runs throughout Matthew’s gospel: that of unexpected new life coming from expected death.</p>
<p>Chapter one examines the practice of honour killings in the modern world. In chapter two, Marohl sets out his argument regarding Matt 1.19. Chapter three consists of a discussion of honour killings in the ancient Mediterranean world, followed by a brief argument that ancient Christians saw a reference to honour killing in 1.19. Finally, in chapter four, Marohl argues for the existence of the motif of unexpected new life coming from expected death.</p>
<p>Although it is very readable, there is, unfortunately, little to commend this book. Chapter one is virtually irrelevant as far as the rest of the study is concerned, and the material on honour killings in the ancient world should have been placed before the discussion of Joseph’s situation.</p>
<p>Marohl’s thesis that in Matt 1.19 Joseph is envisaged choosing not to have Mary executed seems unlikely, since if such a profound thing as execution is in view, we would expect that to be made clear. Moreover, the few examples of early Christian writers Marohl provides, who saw a reference to a potential execution of Mary in Matt 1.19, hardly succeeds in demonstrating that most early Christians saw a reference to execution in this verse. Furthermore, Marohl does not deal properly with the controversial issue of whether Jews around the turn of the era enforced the death penalty for sexual sins.</p>
<p>Most importantly, even if there is a reference to the potential execution of Mary in Matt 1.19, such an execution would scarcely be an honour killing. According to Deut 22, execution for sexual sin was for the purpose of purging evil from among God’s people, not for upholding the honour of the wronged family. Marohl accepts that the Matthean Joseph contemplates killing Mary on the grounds of Deut 22, yet without explanation insists on seeing a reference to an honour killing. However, it is hardly possible to accept that Joseph, a devout Jew, has contemplated the execution of Mary for any other reason than that which the Torah prescribes.</p>
<p>Finally, the perceived motif of unexpected new life coming from expected death also looks dubious. Firstly, it is doubtful that there is any reference to death in Matt 1.19. Secondly, of the other examples cited, some are about real death, while others have to do with expected death; and some have to do with new life but others simply involve escaping death, i.e., the continuation of the old life.</p>

<p>This is a very welcome edition of the Gospels in their most familiar English form. Its range of introductory and supplementary material will be especially useful to new readers, but readers who know the text well will also find new insights.</p>
<p>The introduction gives a readable, succinct account of the significance and origin of the Gospels, an insightful summary of their content and differences, and a somewhat thinner, sometimes misleading account of the King James Bible itself. W. R Owens makes a standard case for reading this version, its aesthetic qualities and its centrality in English-speaking culture, but offers no comment on its scholarly merits as a translation. Knowledge of the original texts has developed greatly, but the KJB’s virtues as a highly sensitive literal translation make it much more than an aesthetic achievement.</p>
<p>The notes are very helpful for the theological, biblical, historical and linguistic explanations they give, and make a good model for further annotation of the KJB. It has long needed the kind of annotation one gives to, say, Shakespeare’s plays, to go along with normal biblical commentary. Among the other helpful elements are glossaries of persons, places and words and terms.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier Oxford World’s Classics edition of the Bible, it gives the text in a single column, paragraphed form, which facilitates a sense of the text ‘as a connected sequence of prose’; in William Tyndale’s words, it makes clearer ‘the process, order and meaning’ of the text. Flatteringly, it resembles my own <italic>New Cambridge Paragraph Bible</italic>, and it too is based on the original 1611 text rather than the traditional eighteenth-century text. Owens’s spelling and punctuation are more conservative, sometimes leading to unnecessarily awkward moments and to entries in the glossary such as ‘<bold>brasen</bold> brazen (made of brass)’ and ‘<bold>clothes</bold> cloths’; spelling changes would have made these redundant. ‘Bewray’ probably should not have been glossed as ‘betray’ since the translators had a distinct sense of the two words. Contrastingly, but with justification, the paragraphing is freely revised, and the italics are omitted. All cavils aside, this is a good presentation, and the inclusion of the 1611 chapter summaries is worthwhile.</p>

<p>As someone who, for the last forty years, has been involved in making Church appointments from Bishops to curates (or vice versa), I was very interested to read this book. It is full of very good practical advice. While it is meant to cover all churches it is more particularly applicable to the Church of England, Church of Scotland and Methodist Churches. Geared to lay people caught up in church vacancies; it covers every aspect of the process of appointments and wisely explains the role of the Church hierarchy in relation to appointments. It has wise things to say about confidentiality. It is also strong on how to create a prayerful background to making appointments. I feel the book is lacking in psychological insights. There is little said about the processes of group dynamics, or how to handle different personality types. While I would not recommend Myers-Briggs testing as part of an appointment process some understanding of it could be very helpful. The book describes the processes for interviewing and says that it is best to keep the candidates apart. I would take the opposite view; the way candidates deal with each other is a very good test of their maturity in relationships. I feel there is not enough about understanding parish history. I could never rest in a new job until I had grasped its history. I would recommend any new incumbent to read the previous 20 years Parish magazines and Church council minutes. It is not possible to move people on if you do not know where they have come from.</p>
<p>Similarly nothing is said about one incumbent handing over to another. A good conversation with one’s predecessor can be very helpful. I knew one incumbent whose first act was to destroy the parish card index- a sure sign of insecurity. There is a very great tendency for a church to turn into a society for its own self-preservation and while the authors advise giving considerable thought to describing the sociological background of a parish, they still tend to view this a little as the basis of something which is for the benefit of the congregation. The church does not exist for itself – it exists for others, and there is here implicitly a rather weak theology of mission. One problem, which some parishes face, is a development of a controlling group who want their own way over everything and have taken over the seats of power. There is little advice on how to overcome this.</p>
<p>But overall this is a good and practical book, which will help a lot of people.</p>

<p>This is a significant new contribution to Christian philosophy from a pentecostal perspective. Pentecostals are only just starting to contribute to philosophy with the other notable work being done by Amos Yong. James Smith aims at constructing the outline of a distinctly pentecostal philosophy to bring into debate with existing philosophical concerns, whereas Yong has developed existing thinking in the American pragmatist tradition. This no doubt reflects some of Smith’s Calvinist roots and a desire to work within the space created by Reformed epistemology. It leads to a more ‘over-against’ philosophy that generates a number of creative discussions.</p>
<p>Smith starts by outlining five aspects of what he sees as the unique pentecostal worldview: a position of radical openness to God, especially in God doing something different or new; an ‘enchanted’ theology of creation and culture; a non-dualistic affirmation of embodiment and materiality (as seen in healing); an affective, narrative epistemology; and an eschatological orientation to mission and justice. These commitments form the Pentecostal basis for Smith’s explorations alongside detailed narratives in which they are embedded. Pentecost in Acts 2 is seen as a revolutionary counter-interpretation of the world, a ‘Spirit theory’ rather than a ‘wine theory’ – Peter’s sermon countering the initial response of the onlookers. Hence the title of the book, <italic>Thinking in Tongues</italic>, as a Spirit counter-interpretation of the world.</p>
<p>The primacy of ‘narrative knowledge’ is explored through a narrative testimony of pentecostal healing. This is brought into dialogue with contemporary thinking on film-making, as places of affectivity and ‘imagining the world otherwise.’ The result is a suggestion of pentecostal film-making as a kind of surrealism, pushing against what ‘they’ say is possible and creating space for God’s Spirit to break in. Thinking on metaphysics is explored through a dialogue between the pentecostal enchanted worldview and the current preference for naturalist approaches. Smith sees pentecostals as having a ‘participatory ontology’ of ‘enchanted naturalism’ and in this the thinking of Radical Orthodoxy is seen as having much to contribute. Smith suggests that the dominant frameworks in the philosophy of religion are plagued by reductionism and rationalism. He suggests a way forward through a more rigorous attention to worship, liturgy and religious practice drawing on the work of William Abraham. Pentecostal tongues speech is explored as a contribution to the philosophy of language. In particular it is seen as a discourse of resistance, pertinent to pentecostal origins with the urban poor.</p>
<p><italic>Thinking in Tongues</italic> is an engagingly written re-reading of pentecostalism that provides a number of challenging contributions to contemporary philosophical debates. Surprisingly it draws on little pentecostal scholarship, even in the area of tongues. It also pays limited attention to the many possible criticisms, proposing instead to be a positive manifesto. Despite limitations this book should be read to stimulate further debate within Christian philosophy and pentecostalism.</p>

<p>I remember it well even though it was last century. I had done a fair number of ‘Thoughts for the Day’, and then the BBC decided to gather together a number of regular contributors to offer new contributors some helpful hints. The main helpful hint was ‘never start by saying this is St X’s day’ because that introduction tends to send reluctant listeners heading for the shower or switching off – literally and metaphorically! The title of this book – The Future of Preaching – almost made me switch off. I’m glad I didn’t. Within its covers were not so much a series of helpful hints for hard pressed preachers in search of inspiration or help for the rapidly approaching Sunday slot, but a collection of essays by a broad range of contributors offering a series of perspectives for those of us in pulpit or radio studio.</p>
<p>Roger Standing’s ‘Mediated Preaching’ offers a thought-provoking analysis of the context of preaching in today’s British culture. Facebook, Bebo, Twitter, virtual relationships; ‘soft’ levels of commitment; the death of the monologue (despite Barack Obama); ‘A list’ and ‘B list’ celebrities and reality tv help set the scene for preaching as a mediated discipline as ‘the Word of God must always be clothed in the specific culture of place and time.’</p>
<p>Two of the essays particularly challenged my thinking. Trevor Pitt’s starting point will be recognised by too many priests and ministers. Diminishing numbers of clergy are expected to ‘manage’ groups of parishes and the fundamental bond between pastor and preacher is stretched almost to breaking point. He quotes <italic>inter alia</italic> T.S. Eliot on the poet’s task of ‘turning blood into ink’ and the responsibility of the preacher of turning ink back into blood. Pitt unpacks this, as contemporary preaching, he believes, moves away from the expository and didactic to the narrative. Preaching is ‘doing theology’ in our post-modern market place.</p>
<p>Susan Durber’s ‘The Preacher’s Inner Life’ was certainly a pearl of great price. This ‘pearl’ was not so much its content, but the absolute honesty and integrity with which she approached her subject, reflecting on the task of preaching and on her own experience of life.</p>
<p>I was grateful to Ian Stackhouse for reminding me of P. T. Forsyth’s dictum: ‘The Christian preacher is not the successor of the Greek orator, but of the Hebrew prophet.’</p>
<p>The Editor concludes: ‘Please do not assume I am advocating a slick accommodation to prevailing communication modules, whether derived from the new anchor, the stand-up comedian, the electioneering politician, the doorstep salesman or the internet blogger.’ Stevenson’s collection of essays made me think again on both the importance of preaching and the context within which that task is carried out. Current contributors to ‘Thought for the Day’ in a BBC studio as well as preachers in our pulpits will find in this book much to ponder.</p>

<body>
<p>The book is a collection of essays devoted to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Alan Culpepper’s <italic>Anatomy of the Fourth Gospel</italic>. The essays were written by thirteen leading Johannine scholars.</p>
<p>In the first essay Thatcher reviews major works on the Gospel of John paying particular attention to the methodologies and approaches that have been taken in its interpretation. He also explains how Culpepper’s ground-breaking book began a new line of research in Johannine studies, and outlines the theoretical foundations for recent reader-centred approaches to the Gospel. In the final essay of the book, Moore explains the ‘new narratology’ and how this can morph into feminist, cultural, postcolonial, and poststructuralist narratology in the study of the Gospel.</p>
<p>There are six additional essays that explain how narrative criticism has substantially evolved since 1983, incorporating allied methods and theories. Time and again the authors of these articles indicate that there should be a dialogue between narrative criticism and questions of history, composition history, and the Johannine community. The authors have written their essays in dialogue with Culpepper’s book, whether criticizing some of his points, developing some of his insights, or following new paths in the interpretation of the Gospel. One essay that is particularly compelling is that of Reinhartz, ‘Building Skyscrapers on Toothpicks: The Literary-Critical Challenge to Historical Criticism.’ She proposes to approach historical questions in the Gospel of John taking into account three considerations: humility, imagination, and good humour. In that spirit, Reinhartz submits the hypothesis that passages in the Gospel of John that represent the Jews in a negative way constitute a warning against synagogue participation, and that these passages are intended to deter Christ-confessors for whom Judaism remained attractive.</p>
<p>The following five essays represent attempts to offer novel interpretations of passages or themes in the Gospel. The essays reflect a number of reading strategies that have emerged in the twenty-five years since Culpepper’ book and that are driven by interdisciplinary interests. Stibbe’s article illustrates, among other things, how sociological approaches can shed light on the interpretation of the topic of unity in the Gospel of John. Liew’s article is a postcolonial reading of the themes of life and death in the Gospel. Staley’s contribution is a critical evaluation of nine cinematic representations of the raising of Lazarus. Zimmermann’s essay focuses on the possibility that references to the garden and to Jesus as gardener in Jn 18-20 were developed in light of Gen 2-3. The article by Moloney does not reflect new methodologies or approaches to the Gospel, but is an explication of how John 21 can be read as a literary unity with John 1-20 and yet be considered a latter addition.</p>
<p>Indeed, this collection of essays is an important contribution to the ongoing methodological debate regarding the interpretation of the Gospel of John. Although some of the proposed interpretations are perhaps less convincing than others (e.g. Zimmerman’s suggestion that Jn 18:1; 19:41; 20:15 refer to the Garden of Eden), the reader will find important insights that are worth further research.</p>

<p>This volume contains eighteen essays (including the editorial introduction) on aspects of miracle ranging from what counts as a miracle, through the history of the significance of miracle in biblical and classical antiquity, early Christianity, the Middle Ages, the Reformation and on through the Enlightenment to the present day, to miracle in ‘traditional’ and world religions (Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and Christianity). The dominant perspective is Christian, in that the target reader is likely to be a modern Westerner more familiar with Christian than with other religious traditions, and that it is miracles within the Judaeo-Christian tradition that are most thoroughly discussed. The treatment of miracles in other traditions serves not only to show the ubiquity of interest in miracle, but also to relativize Christian conceptions of miracle. Indeed, one of the things this collection succeeds in doing is to show that there is no generally agreed definition of what a miracle is and, indeed, that the word ‘miracle’, freighted with Christian theological and Western philosophical traditions as it is, may not always be the most appropriate term to designate extraordinary events of religious significance.</p>
<p>The contributors take a variety of approaches, ranging from philosophical to theological, exegetical, historical, and medical. They also take a variety of stances, so that, for example, Michael P. Levine’s discussion of ‘Philosophers on Miracles’ towards the end of the collection can be read in part as a brisk critique of some of the kinds of argument advanced in Robert A. Larmer’s essay on ‘The meanings of miracle’ near the beginning. These two essays also illustrate the spectrum of the varying degrees of openness to and scepticism towards the miraculous exhibited by the contributors, although many are content to report the views of others without explicitly revealing their own. This diversity is here a strength rather than a weakness, exposing readers to a variety of positions and stimulating them to think through the issues raised for themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant issues raised is whether the post-Enlightenment dualist distinction between ‘nature’ and ‘the supernatural’ is really the most helpful way of thinking about miracles in particular or God’s relationship to the world in general. It becomes apparent from reading the <italic>Companion</italic> that this is a way of thinking peculiar to the modern West, and although there is no explicit agenda to that effect, the reader may well be left with the impression that Western theology could usefully learn from other traditions. The introduction by Graham Twelftree helpfully highlights a number of other issues arising from the essays, as well as providing a succinct summary of the argument of each.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a highly readable, informative and stimulating collection of essays, which can be warmly commended to anyone interested in the question of miracle.</p>

<p>The Great Exhibition of 1851 – with its imposing crystal palace of glass and iron set in London’s Hyde Park, and its thousands of displays of produce, arts and crafts from across the globe – symbolised Victorian faith in industrial progress, free trade, and the ‘civilising’ mission of the British Empire. It has been the subject of numerous studies. However, apart from the debates over whether the Exhibition should open on Sundays, the religious aspects have received little attention. In this carefully researched, finely crafted and beautifully illustrated study, Geoffrey Cantor, a distinguished historian of science, provides the first comprehensive account of religion and the Great Exhibition.</p>
<p>Cantor considers a wide range of religious responses – drawn from periodicals, newspapers, treatises, tracts, sermons, private diaries and correspondence – to the planning for the Exhibition, the design of the crystal palace, the content and organisation of the exhibition halls, and the events of 1851. As he demonstrates, the religious attitudes towards the Exhibition were as varied as the religious landscape of mid-nineteenth-century Britain. For moderate Anglicans, the Exhibition signified the work of providence, and of England, in directing humanity towards peaceful commerce, co-operation and unity among the nations. For moderate dissenters, especially Congregationalists, the Exhibition represented the beneficent, divinely-ordained effects of free trade and voluntary institutions. For moderate Roman Catholics and Jews, the Exhibition demonstrated that God distributed His gifts liberally among different races and religious communities, and that the achievements of Catholic and Jewish craftsmen and scientists provided a powerful argument for full religious equality. For moderate theists, the scientific displays provided further evidence of the essential goodness of the divinely-ordained natural order.</p>
<p>Others, however, were critical, even apprehensive. Zealous Evangelicals with gloomy pre-millenarian views prophesied that the Exhibition would bring divine wrath upon a presumptuous people. With references to the Tower of Babel, they portrayed the Exhibition as redolent of human pride, materialism and hedonism. Some High Anglicans warned against the corrupting effects of bringing a host of foreigners, many of them non-Christians, to London. Many Protestants discerned in the Exhibition a Roman Catholic conspiracy, and deprecated the prominent displays of beautifully crafted Catholic liturgical objects, or the popular ‘Medieval Hall’—while also lamenting the relatively scant space given to the display of Bible translations. Some secularists viewed the Exhibition as a symbol of the oppression of labouring people.</p>
<p>It is not clear from Cantor’s account how representative these negative views were. Most religious opinion, it seems, embraced the positive perception of the Exhibition as celebrating providence and progress. He might have said more about how the Exhibition reflected, and influenced, religious perceptions of the wider world. What, for example, were the views of the British mission public, that significant portion of the population which enthused over the overseas missionary movement, could view the Empire as an agent of providence, but also wished to protect vulnerable peoples from predatory traders and colonists? Nonetheless, Cantor has given us an informed and engaging study that throws much light on Britain’s religious diversity in the noontide of her global pre-eminence.</p>
