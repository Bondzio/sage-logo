<p>In 1896, Sir Stephen Padget (London) published his landmark textbook <italic>Surgery of the Chest</italic>. In this book, he said “Surgery of the heart has probably reached the limits set by nature, no new methods and no new discovery can overcome the natural difficulties that attend a wound of the heart.” The same pessimism had been expressed by Professor Theodor Billroth (Vienna), whose often quoted prophesy is more frequently recalled, perhaps because of the very personal nature of the remark. “Any surgeon who operates upon the heart should lose the respect of his colleagues,” he admonished. Curiously, the year that Padget's classic text was published was the same year in which Ludwig Rehn, of Frankfurt, accomplished the first successful suture of a heart wound.</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history. For several decades, direct surgery on the heart consisted largely of procedures directed at retrieval of foreign bodies (referred to as “missiles,” as though there was a need for any greater drama) and repair of penetrating injuries resulting from military combat. Then the birth of surgery to repair congenital heart defects came in the 1930s, with the first operation done to close patent ductus arteriosus. The recognition that most congenital heart disease involved abnormalities of structures within the heart led to the development of such innovative procedures as transventricular pulmonary valvotomy by Lord Brock and Sir Thomas Holmes-Sellors in London and repair of atrial septal defect using the “atrial well” technique by Robert Gross in Boston. In Minneapolis, F. John Lewis expeditiously repaired simple intracardiac defects during a very brief period of inflow occlusion under total body hypothermia.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the modern history of cardiac surgery began in 1953. In Philadelphia, John H. Gibbon repaired an atrial septal defect using the heart–lung bypass machine that he had developed over the preceding 20 years. Much of Gibbon’s early work that led to the development of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support took place at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, where Gibbon served a fellowship under Edward Churchill, the Harvard Professor who was the Chief of Surgical Services at MGH. Although Churchill had pioneered pericardiectomy for chronic constrictive pericarditis, it is believed that his attitudes about intracardiac surgery were somewhat akin to those of Padget and Billroth. History suggests that it was Gibbon’s experience observing an emergency Trendelenberg operation performed by Churchill, in a desperate effort to save the life of a patient dying of massive pulmonary embolism, which inspired him to develop the heart–lung bypass machine. In truth, there is no way to know whether this rationale was simply more palatable to his mentor Churchill than was the idea of an apparatus to support intracardiac repair of structural heart disease.</p>
<p>The development of cardiopulmonary bypass is surely one of the landmark achievements of modern surgical science. Its evolution and refinement over the last 60 years is a remarkable story of collaboration between surgeons, engineers, basic scientists, industry, and even government. The heart–lung bypass machine is used hundreds of thousands of times each year to carry out “open heart” operations. Related forms of extracorporeal circulatory support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are used for more extended periods of support of pediatric and adult patients with cardiac failure, cardiopulmonary disease, primary respiratory failure, and a variety of other life-threatening conditions. Scientific research to increase the safety and efficacy of mechanical circulatory and cardiopulmonary support has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>In this issue of <italic>World Journal for Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery</italic> (<italic>WJPCHS</italic>), we are pleased to publish proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support Systems and Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Perfusion. The meetings have taken place annually since the first conference was hosted by Penn State Hershey College of Medicine in 2005 and have been attended by nearly 2000 physicians, scientists, technologists, and nurses from 31 countries. The international conference now serves as the scientific meeting of the International Society for Pediatric Mechanical Circulatory Support. Articles in this issue of <italic>WJPCHS</italic> address many of the scientific and clinical issues related to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, ECMO, and ventricular assist devices in pediatric patients and provide “state-of-the-art” current reviews and very up-to-date perspectives from experts in the field.</p>
