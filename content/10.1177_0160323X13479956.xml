<abstract>
<p>This article integrates the urban politics, growth management, and economic development literatures to examine how voter characteristics, community context, local government structure and capacity, and state policy and regional contexts influence the adoption of development incentives and growth management policy instruments. Using a 2004 national survey of city economic development directors, U.S. Census, U.S. Department of Agriculture <italic>Atlas of Rural and Small-town America</italic>, U.S. Census of Governments, and U.S. Election Atlas voting data, we develop two scaled Poisson policy count models. Only wealth and growth rates play large, significant roles in explaining both location incentives and growth management, while local government structure and bureaucratic capacity does not significantly affect adoption for either policy type. We conclude that location incentive and growth management policy adoption decisions are driven by a community’s political economic context: its voter characteristics, community context, and the regional context.</p>

<p>For decades, urban political scientists have questioned what drives city adoption of growth management and economic development policies. Using two models for adoption of growth management tools and economic development tools, we investigate the relationship between policy adoption and (1) voter characteristics, (2) local community context, (3) local government characteristics, and (4) state smart growth policy and regional context. Policy count models are constructed with U.S. Census, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0160323X13479956">U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (2012)</xref> <italic>Atlas of rural and small-town America</italic>, U.S. Census of Governments, and U.S. Election Atlas voting data and 2004 survey data from a national sample of economic development officials in over 300 U.S. cities greater than 50,000 and a sample of cities greater than 10,000 within twelve metropolitan areas that represent different economic conditions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0160323X13479956">
<title>Extant Literature</title>
<p>Growth management has evolved from policies that were decidedly antigrowth in its early years, going so far as to impose building moratorium or caps on permits issued, to a diverse and nuanced set of policies to manage and direct growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X13479956">Bengston, Fletcher, and Nelson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X13479956">Dierwechter 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X13479956">Pallagst 2007</xref>). The prominent explanations for adoption of these policies have seen less evolution and general focus on community and environmental characteristics with little attention to the role of local government and the local political economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X13479956">Nelson et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160323X13479956">Cunningham 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While all U.S. cities face fiscal and economic constraints determined by their specific tax authority and their place in a federalist system, each adjusts to these constraints in ways that reflect their voters’ priorities and the community’s specific economic conditions and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X13479956">DeLeon 1992</xref>; Goetz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X13479956">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X13479956">1994</xref>; Lewis and Neiman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X13479956">2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X13479956">Goetz (1994</xref>, 87) observes, “structural constraints do exist, but these constraints are interpreted locally, and policy determined by the configuration of competing political interests.” Local growth management and economic development policy does not occur in a policy vacuum, particularly state policies such as “smart growth” legislation influence local policy making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X13479956">Howell-Moroney 2007</xref>), so we have included an index of state smart growth policy in our models.</p>
<p>Building on the existing literature, we consider four factors salient to a city’s policy instrument choices: (1) differences in voter preferences across cites; (2) economic, infrastructural, and fiscal conditions of the city; (3) the role of city officials as structured by the local government system; and (4) the role of state policy and regional context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0160323X13479956">
<title>Voter Preferences and Characteristics</title>
<p>Peterson’s (1981) widely accepted argument that policies were driven more by external factors than internal politics minimized the importance of city voter differences. Critiques of this unitary perspective note that development occurs in specific neighborhoods, which imposes uneven costs and benefits across neighborhoods and voter groups. Unless the benefits from growth are used to compensate those harmed, not all residents will be supportive of a pro-growth city. Wealthier voters tend to be antigrowth in order to maintain the status quo-community conditions and property values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X13479956">Babcock and Siemon 1985</xref>). Citizens in larger cities may support adoption of the both types of policies in order to direct growth in a complex urban system with varied demands, urban problems, and a larger tax base.</p>
<p>New development tends to occur in areas with lower land values in order to reduce costs. In older, larger cities with little vacant space, that low cost, more easily acquired land is often in minority or poor neighborhoods. Displacement effects suggest cities with higher percentages of poor or minority residents would see less voter support for economic development and adopt fewer policies. However, a priori the direction of this effect is not certain. Dependent on the type of jobs created by development, the economic prospects of lower income residents may improve, leading to support for economic development efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X13479956">Bowman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X13479956">Goetz 1994</xref>). The percentage of poor or minority residents in a city may thus have offsetting impacts. The impact on growth management policies is more clear-cut. Reduced supply increased costs of housing resulting from growth control efforts leads poor and minority residents to oppose growth management policies.</p>
<p>Homeownership is the other potentially important factor affecting voter preferences on development. Homeowners are assumed to oppose development because it threatens their property values, drives up tax rates, or lowers service quality. However, most of these impacts are due to increased residential growth, especially higher density or lower-cost developments. Homeowners potentially can gain from nonresidential growth in the city. Greater business activity or more jobs may increase housing demand, which generates higher capitalized value for homeowners while renters face displacement or higher housing costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X13479956">Anglin 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X13479956">Bollens 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, the preferences of homeowners for growth policies would be conditional on the type of development promoted. The result would be support for growth management policies directed toward residential development and for economic development policies that encourage selected business growth, what some might term smart growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0160323X13479956">Ye, Mandpe, and Meyer 2005</xref>). Renters may have slightly different preferences, rather than simply the opposite. They would oppose growth management policies, which are more likely to drive up their rents by constraining supply, but they may also support economic development policies, which could create jobs for the lower-income or younger population that makes up the renter groups. This suggests that cities with a higher percentage of homeowners would be more likely to adopt growth management policies. The impact of homeowners on development policies would be weaker, or even a wash, given that both owners and renters may support these policies although for different reasons (owners gain housing value and renters gain jobs).</p>

<title>Community Context</title>
<p>The severity of economic or fiscal needs has been related to greater use of economic development tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X13479956">Bowman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X13479956">Elkins 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X13479956">Green and Fleischmann 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160323X13479956">Reese 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X13479956">Rubin and Rubin 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X13479956">Schneider 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0160323X13479956">Sharp and Elkins 1991</xref>). Cities with a high unemployment rate, slow population growth, a weak tax base, or high municipal fiscal stress value the benefits from business growth more than cities without these problems. The more severe the problem, the more important it is to get immediate relief, leading cities to offer incentives and make concessions that lower the cost of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0160323X13479956">Steinacker 2002</xref>). Fiscally stressed communities are the ones that can least afford to give up the benefits from growth, suggesting they would offer fewer location incentives; yet, the evidence suggests need for new growth will outweigh the potential issue of affordability of this strategy. Additionally, cities with a higher per capita property tax may need both support existing public services through increased property tax revenue and be comfortable with the taxpayer supported commercial development via increased use of location incentives.</p>
<p>Cities facing competition from other localities more actively court development and create a pro-business environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X13479956">Schneider 1989</xref>) and offer more tax abatements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X13479956">Feiock and Clingermayer 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X13479956">Green and Fleischmann (1991)</xref> found that perceptions of high competition led communities of all sizes to employ more economic development policies, but this was strongest for central cities and rural areas, weakest for suburban places.</p>

<title>Local Government</title>
<p>Extant economic development and growth management studies focus on the role that city elites, especially elected politicians, play in directing their city’s future within the recognized economic and political constraints. Policies to promote development can be a response to leaders’ perceptions of their city’s image and its place in the hierarchy of cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X13479956">Pagano and Bowman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160323X13479956">Lewis and Neiman 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160323X13479956">2009</xref>). Based on previous work that links the power of elected executives to both growth management and economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13479956">Clingermayer and Feiock 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X13479956">Feiock 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X13479956">Feiock, Tavares, and Lubell 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X13479956">Pagano and Bowman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160323X13479956">Schneider 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160323X13479956">Schneider and Teske 1993</xref>), we expect that a strong mayor, as indicated by formal powers of the office, will lead to a greater number of policies of either type. A strong mayor position is more likely to attract an activist, policy entrepreneur candidate rather than a laissez-faire candidate, leading to more policy activity overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0160323X13479956">Schneider and Teske 1995</xref>). In addition, a mayor with power over the budget is in a strong position to build winning coalitions among city council members, neutralizing potential opposition to his or her policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X13479956">Reese and Rosenfeld 2002</xref>). The city council may still play a significant part in choice of a city’s growth strategy, under particular conditions. At-large council members are often described as having a citywide policy perspective, similar to that of the mayor.</p>
<p>The size and professionalization of the economic development office may also influence the number and type of growth policies that a city adopts. Larger offices are also more able to implement multiple programs, making it easier to push for adoption in the first place. Bureaucratic capacity can also lead both adoption of growth management or economic development policies.</p>

<title>State Policy and Regional Context</title>
<p>Adoptions of smart growth policy have accelerated in the past thirty years with even historically pro-growth states like Arizona, adopting a smart growth program. The impact of these state policies on local development decisions and policy decisions has been mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X13479956">Carruthers 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0160323X13479956">Wassmer 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0160323X13479956">Yin and Sun 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X13479956">Howell-Moroney 2007</xref>). Smart growth policies include a large variety of incentives and constraints that may help to direct development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0160323X13479956">Ye, Mandpe, and Meyer 2005</xref>). Smart growth policies encompass a wide range of requirements that include twenty different policy areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X13479956">Howell-Moroney 2008</xref>). Some states adopt comprehensive plans that encompass the entire state, but these may or may not directly affect local government plans through mandatory policy adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X13479956">Lewis and Knaap 2012</xref>).

<title>Data</title>
<p>The dependent variables in this study were constructed from responses to a nationwide 2004 mail survey of government officials responsible for local economic development activities. The sample frame included the population (522) of U.S. cities with 50,000 or more residents in 1990 and a sample of 388 smaller cities (populations between 10,000 and 50,000) located in twelve selected metropolitan areas: Boston, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Denver, Salt Lake City, San Francisco-San Jose-Oakland, Riverside-San Bernardino, San Antonio, Houston, Tampa-St. Petersburg, and Miami-Ft. Lauderdale. The metropolitan areas were selected to reflect the diverse urban conditions within four regions across the country. Responses were received from 348 cites, a response rate of 38 percent with 268 cities providing complete information for our models. Community characteristics and demographic data used to construct voter preference measures were from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0160323X13479956">U.S. Census Bureau (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0160323X13479956">U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (2012)</xref> <italic>Atlas of Rural and Small-town America</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0160323X13479956">U.S. Census of Governments (2005)</xref> data, and U.S. Election Atlas voting data. We created a smart growth index for our measure of state policy.</p>
<sec id="section7-0160323X13479956">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Indices of growth management and location incentives are summed responses from two questions that identified policies that were categorized as “growth management” or as “economic development” efforts. Respondents were asked to check all the policy instruments adopted by their city. Using the summation of policy instruments adopted, we created two scaled Poisson policy instrument choice models.</p>
<p>There was substantial variation in the numbers of tools employed in both categories. The mean number of growth management policies is 1.39 of the six available, approximately 31.0 percent, had not adopted any growth management policies, while 1.12 percent adopted all six. Impact fees are the most commonly used growth management tool employed by more than half of the cities (55.6 percent; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160323X13479956">Table 1</xref>). On average, cities use 4.01 percent economic development policies of the thirteen possible, while approximately 10.8 percent of cities do not adopt any location incentives and only a single city adopting all thirteen policies. Infrastructure improvements and tax increment financing are the most commonly used by 61.9 percent and 56.3 percent of municipalities, respectively.</p>

<title>Voter Characteristics</title>
<p>Voter characteristics, as indicators of likely development and growth management policy preferences, included log of median family income; the percentage of the population that was nonwhite; the percentage of housing units that were owner occupied; and the percentage of voters who had voted for Bush in the 2000 Presidential Election.</p>
<p>Cities in our sample have a mean median household income of $57,063 with a range from $18,777 to $145,802. Homeownership rates range from 28.29 percent to 94.32 percent in our sample with a mean of 65.68 percent. Percentage of nonwhite population in our cities ranges from 1.38 percent to 93.42 percent with a mean of 27.45 percent. Percentage of conservative voters as indicated by 2000 Presidential Election ranges from 16.89 percent to 79.77 percent with an average of 46.61 percent.</p>

<title>Community Context</title>
<p>Community context data were extracted and constructed from the U.S. Census and Census of Government Data: unemployment rate (a measure of economic stress), number of jurisdictions in the county with a population over 10,000 (a measure of interjurisdictional competition),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160323X13479956">1</xref>
</sup> a gravity measure of the city within the county (a measure of urban hierarchy), property tax rate per capita (measure of fiscal stress), median age of housing structures (proxy for city age); additionally, we included log of city size, which affects the problems that citizens and community faces, as well as the resources available to deal with these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160323X13479956">Fleischmann, Green, and Kwong 1992</xref>). The gravity measure was constructed as ratio of the city’s population to the average city size in the county. Cities range from 0.68 percent unemployment to 9.92 percent with a median of 3.53 percent. Larger communities we anticipate attempting to direct growth through increased variety of policy instruments. The mean city size in our sample is 91,822. In our sample, the mean per capita property tax was $350.05 and the range was $0 to $2,285.47.</p>
<p>We expect regional competition to increase the number of location incentives adopted and reduce the number of growth management policies. The number of jurisdictions within a county ranged from 1 to 76 with a mean of 16.47. The jurisdiction’s relative size in the county may also have an impact on its policy adoption, so we constructed a gravity index, which is equal to a city’s population divided by the average population for cities within the county. In our sample, gravity indices ranged from 0.01 to 9.32 with a mean of 0.89.</p>
<p>In addition to competition, aging infrastructure may push councils to adopt more location incentives in order to renovate and improve infrastructure, as well as build new structures, while cities with newer housing infrastructure may be more supportive of growth restrictions due to their better economic position. We included the median age of owner-occupied housing as a measure of both age of city and aging infrastructure—two factors influencing policy adoption. In our sample, median age of housing ranged from 1,940 to 1,996 with a mean of 1,968.15.<sup>

<title>Local Government</title>
<p>Government structural characteristics and bureaucratic capacity variables were created from the survey data: strong mayor, percentage of council representing a district versus the entire city, and the number of economic development staff per 1,000 community members. A strong mayor city was considered one where the mayor had the power to present the budget to the council. In our sample, 22.8 percent of cities had strong mayor governance structures. The survey asked the number of city council members elected at large or in districts. On average, 61 percent of seats within a city were elected at large with a range from 0 to 100 percent of city council seats.</p>
<p>The survey indicator of economic development staff size was normalized to staff per 1,000 population. To the extent to which larger economic development staff indicates bureaucratic capacity and knowledge of the variety of development policy options, it is expected to be associated with more economic development policies. Although we do not have data on planning department size in our survey, we expect that more professionalized cities, with larger economic development staffs, would also have larger planning departments.<sup>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Equations where the dependent variables are “counts” of the number of items require an estimation procedure that takes into consideration the non-normal distribution of these variables. After examining the distribution of the dependent variables, a Poisson scaled model was selected as most appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X13479956">Greene 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160323X13479956">Long and Freese 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160323X13479956">4</xref>
</sup> Our models explore the effect of voter preferences and characteristics, community context, government structure, and state policy context on the adoption of growth management and location incentive policy instruments (Table 2). These models, counts of location incentives and growth management tools, enable us to determine how voter characteristics, community context, government structure, and state policy and regional context affect policy adoption. Building the same policy count model for each domain enables us to compare the how these factors differentially impact economic development versus growth management.</p>
<p>The McFadden’s adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for the two models are 0.506 for growth management and 0.097 for location incentives<sup>

<title>Hypothesis 1: Voter Preferences and Charact-eristics</title>
<p>Voter preferences and characteristics had mixed effects on policy outcomes. We find modest evidence supporting Hypothesis 1<sub>GM</sub>. Log of median family income had a large and positive impact on adoption of growth management policies, significant at the 0.05 level, but percentage owner-occupied housing had an unanticipated negative impact with an increase in homeownership from the minimum to the maximum associated with a 59 percent decrease in growth management policies, significant at the 0.01 level. We find support for Hypothesis 1<sub>LI</sub> with an increase in log of median family income resulting in a large decrease location incentives by 68 percent, significant at the 0.05 level, an increase in the nonwhite population results in an increase in the location incentives by 77 percent, significant at the 0.05 level, and an increase in percentage conservative voters more than doubles the location incentives, significant at the 0.01 level. Wealthier communities are less likely to adopt a variety of location incentives to attract new development and more likely to support growth management policy adoption. This is consistent with literature indicating that wealthy communities attempt to preserve the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X13479956">Baldassare and Protash 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160323X13479956">Babcock and Siemon 1985</xref>). The unanticipated impact of homeownership may actually be the result of lax growth management policies, which some have argued enable construction of more and lower priced housing (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X13479956">Carlson and Mathur 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0160323X13479956">
<title>Hypothesis 2: Community Context</title>
<p>We find some support for Hypothesis 2<sub>GM</sub> with aging housing infrastructure associated with fewer growth management tools and greater population growth rate associated with more. A city with a median housing infrastructure age of 1996 versus 1940 has 16 percent more growth management tools, significant at the 0.001 level. Cities with growth rates of 8 percent versus 0 percent have an odds ratio of 13.97, significant at the 0.001 level, resulting in substantially more growth management tools in rapidly growing cities.</p>
<p>With regard to location incentives, Hypothesis 2<sub>LI</sub>, we do not find support for our hypothesis. Higher growth rates are associated with more location incentives; likewise, a larger population is also associated with more location incentives. An increase in the population from 7,843 to 1,223,400 leads to an increase in 146 percent, significant at the 0.01, while an increase in the growth rate from 0 to 8 percent results in an increase in location incentives adoption by 79 percent, significant at the 0.01.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0160323X13479956">
<title>Hypothesis 3: Local Government</title>
<p>A strong mayor was expected to have a positive impact on the adoption of both types of policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X13479956">Clingermayer and Feiock 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X13479956">Feiock 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X13479956">Feiock, Tavares, and Lubell 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X13479956">Pagano and Bowman 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160323X13479956">Schneider 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160323X13479956">Schneider and Teske 1993</xref>), but there was no significant effect on development policies and growth management policies. Bureaucratic capacity also had no significant impact on policy adoption. Thus, we find no support for Hypothesis 3 that local government context, both the structure and the bureaucratic capacity, affects growth management and location incentive policy adoption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0160323X13479956">
<title>Hypothesis 4: State Policy Context</title>
<p>We find some support for Hypothesis 4<sub>GM</sub> with cities in the East and cities within a stronger smart growth policy state adopting more growth management policies. An increase from a state with no smart growth policy to one with a strong policy results in an increase of 46 percent in growth management policy adoption, significant at the 0.05 level. Cities that are within the East have 82 percent more growth management policies than a Midwestern city, significant at the 0.01 level. We find no support for Hypothesis 4<sub>LI</sub> with cities in the West and the South have fewer location incentives adopted and smart growth policy having no impact. Somewhat surprisingly a city in the South has 32.5 percent fewer location incentives than a Midwestern city, significant at the 0.01 level, while a city in the West has 35.0 percent fewer location incentives, significant at the 0.01 level. Thus, we have decidedly mixed results overall with regard to state policy and regional context.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Findings from two scaled Poisson policy count models suggest that a complex mix of factors affect cities’ growth and economic development policy adoption. Voter characteristics, community context, and regional context play a large role in shaping a city’s growth management and location incentive policy position. We find support for the idea that wealthier, rapidly growing regions are more likely to adopt growth management policy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X13479956">Baldassare and Protash 1982</xref>), but interestingly higher homeownership rates reduce growth management policy adoption (in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X13479956">Fischel 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X13479956">Pallagst 2007</xref>). The percentage of minority residents does not affect growth management policy adoption, but did affect location incentives with higher minority proportion associated with more tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160323X13479956">Goetz 1994</xref>). Conservative voters were also associated with higher location incentive adoption, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X13479956">Gerber and Phillips (2003)</xref>.</p>
<p>There has been a substantial body of findings that city stress factors, such as unemployment, will influence development strategy, but we found no evidence of that in this study. Likewise competition and the cities’ position within the urban hierarchy were not important determinants. Growth rates were a major determinant of policy adoption for both domains, which is consistent with the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X13479956">Green and Fleischmann 1991</xref>). Local government context was not a significant determinate, but state policy and regional context were important. State smart growth increased growth management adoption, but did not significantly affect location incentives, while region had a somewhat unanticipated impact on location incentives. Overall, we find that voters, community context, and state policy and regional context affect policy adoption.</p>
<p>This study provides a platform for future research that can incorporate cities’ responses to the economic crisis and slowing of housing construction. We anticipate that some wealthier communities may now adopt policies that previously were not on the horizon, for example. In the future, we plan to more fully investigate implementation of these policies, as policies on the books do not always translate into policies in action. Our unanticipated findings are also leading to future research plans; we are exploring options for closer consideration of the role of growth management adoption on homeownership and housing construction and the links between population growth and location incentives, as both of these results provide some indication of endogeneity. Construction of a time-series data set will enable a better understanding of cause and effect, as well as path dependence.</p>
<p>We found several characteristics that influence communities’ adoption of growth management tools or location incentives. Only one factor, wealth, appeared to have an oppositional impact leading to greater growth management policy adoption and fewer location incentives. In contrast, rapid growth rates lead to greater adoption of both policy types. Planning and economic development theories are decades beyond simple growth quotas or smoke-stake chasing. Yet, urban policy studies have not completely caught up to these changes, this study develops a political economic policy count model at the nexus of these literatures demonstrating that voter characteristics, community context, and state policy and regional context drive policy adoption.<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160323X13479956"/>
