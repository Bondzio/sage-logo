<p>Singapore, an island city-state located in Southeast Asia, is a young nation with no more than five decades since its independence in 1965. It is the third most densely populated country in the world, with about 4.8 million people living in 700 square kilometers of land. There are four official languages (i.e., English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil) in Singapore, but English is the language of instruction in schools. Students in Singapore have consistently performed well in international comparison studies of mathematics and science achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212472230">Gonzales et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212472230">Leung (2006)</xref> contended that the educational system, among other factors, plays a role in this achievement. Singapore’s education system, especially at the secondary level, is examination-driven, and the Ministry of Education (MOE) maintains some influence over the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212472230">J. Tan &amp; Gopinathan, 2000</xref>). Contemporary descriptions of service delivery for children with disabilities in Singapore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212472230">Lim &amp; Sang, 2000</xref>) have highlighted the presence of a dual education system with mainstream education at one end and with special education schools at the other. Special education in Singapore is delivered in a special school, segregated from the mainstream schools with greater emphasis on teaching of life skills to students with disabilities. This article presents a description of the mainstream and special education systems in Singapore. Current programs and practices available for students with disabilities and some future directions are also discussed.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212472230">
<title>Mainstream Education in Singapore</title>
<p>Singapore’s public schools follow a centralized curriculum, with large class sizes of 35 to 40 students per class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212472230">Musti-Rao, Hawkins, &amp; Tan, 2011</xref>). Education takes place in three stages: primary education, secondary education, and preuniversity education. Out of these, only primary education is compulsory. Primary education begins at first grade when a child turns 6 years of age, but most children in Singapore attend between 2 to 4 years of preschool. As there is no public provision of preschool education, these preschool programs are run by private providers. Singapore students attend primary school from Grades 1 to 6. At the end of their sixth year, all students take a national examination called the <italic>Primary School Leaving Examination</italic> (PSLE). On passing the PSLE, students proceed to secondary schools where they are, depending on their PSLE performance, streamed into various tracks. There, the students pursue either the General Certificate of Education (GCE)–Normal level (i.e., GCE N) examination or the more academically demanding GCE–Ordinary level (GCE O) examination at the end of 4 years. Those who do well on their GCE O examinations qualify to either enter a junior college and graduate with a GCE–Advanced level (i.e., GCE A) or enter a polytechnic institute and graduate with a diploma on successful completion. Those who complete the GCE N level examination may take the GCE O level examination after 1 year of further study or proceed toward technical education. Either the GCE A level or the polytechnic diploma results may be used for admission into local and international universities.</p>

<title>Special Education in Singapore</title>
<p>It was reported in 2006 that 4,007 students were identified as having some form of disabilities in mainstream schools and that there were 4,723 students with disabilities attending special schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212472230">Steering Committee on the Enabling Masterplan, 2007b</xref>). Based on these figures and including the 144 children with disabilities who required home care, the incidence of disabilities among school-aged children was reported to be 1.2%. This figure is reported to be an underestimate, as the reported incidence among preschoolers for the same period was 3.2%. The current context of special education in Singapore is the product of a gradual evolution of the special education system.</p>
<p>During the period of colonial rule by the British in the years before 1965, children with physical disabilities and sensory impairments were largely supported by charity organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212472230">Lim &amp; Sang, 2000</xref>). Children with an intellectual disability either dropped out of the general education school system or were kept at home. Education for the children with intellectual disabilities began in 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212472230">Lim &amp; Sang, 2000</xref>). The 1970s also marked the recognition and establishment of services for students with mild disabilities both within the MOE with its establishment of the School Social Work and School Psychological Services Branch in 1970 and within the Ministry of Health with its establishment of the Child Psychiatric Clinic in 1972. Although the first few special schools in Singapore offered education to students with physical, sensory, and intellectual disabilities, new special schools opened up for students with more specific diagnosis such as autism spectrum disorders and multiple disabilities in the 1980s and 1990s. With the gradual growth in the number of special schools during this period to provide education for children with disabilities, an unforeseen impact was the formation of a dual system of education.</p>
<p>Two key events that mark the recent changes within the educational landscape in Singapore may have contributed to some advances in the field. First, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s inauguration speech in 2004, where he made explicit reference to a vision of Singapore as an inclusive society, paved the way for changes in policy and service delivery for students with disabilities in unprecedented proportions. The changes resulted in several new measures that were instituted within the mainstream and special education school systems to better support students with disabilities. These measures took the form of a significant increase in funding allocation for professional development and for the redevelopment of school infrastructure. They also resulted in the introduction of new professionals in mainstream schools to support students with mild disabilities as well as the training of general education teachers to support students with mild disabilities.</p>
<p>Another significant milestone marking the support of people with disabilities in the 21st century in Singapore was the Enabling Masterplan (EM) 2007–2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472230">Steering Committee on the Enabling Masterplan, 2007a</xref>). Helmed by representatives from public and private sectors, the EM was designed to guide the development of programs and services for people with disabilities in Singapore. Significant to the education of students with disabilities were the six recommendations outlined by the Sub-committee on Early Intervention and Education for Children with Special Needs: (a) the need to restructure the leadership framework with the government taking over both early intervention and special education, (b) planned and purposeful integration of students with disabilities through exploration of educational models that bridge the gap between the special and mainstream education systems, (c) the development and maintenance of quality programs and staff, (d) the adequate funding of enabling services, (e) empowerment of family caregivers through education and training, and (f) proper transition planning and management within and between schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472230">Steering Committee on the Enabling Masterplan, 2007a</xref>).</p>

<title>Support for Students With Mild Disabilities</title>
<sec id="section4-1053451212472230">
<title>Mainstream Support</title>
<p>In an effort to meet the needs of students considered at risk for academic failure, all primary schools are staffed with at least one learning support coordinator each for literacy (LSC) and mathematics (LSM) instruction. The LSC and LSM are general education teachers who have received further professional development to support students at risk of literacy and numeracy failure in first and second grades. Furthermore, 10% of all primary school teachers and a 20% of all secondary school teachers receive more than 110 hours of training to support students with disabilities in mainstream schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212472230">MOE, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212472230">2007</xref>). These teachers who are <italic>trained in special needs</italic> (TSN) are deployed in different ways after their training. Although some continue to serve their role as teachers with special training, others have been entrusted with the responsibility of establishing and maintaining school support structures such as case management teams and special committees, or mentoring other teachers and school professionals. In addition, two secondary schools have been resourced to support students with hearing impairment who communicate using sign language, and four secondary schools have been resourced to support students with visual impairments.</p>
<p>Starting in 2005, all primary and some secondary schools were staffed with at least one allied educator—learning and behavior support (AED [LBS]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212472230">MOE, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212472230">2010</xref>). The AED (LBS) is a professional trained in supporting the learning and behavioral needs of students with disabilities. The support provided by the AED (LBS) can take the form of in-class support, pull-out support, or indirect support via collaboration with teachers. In addition, many AED (LBS) take on the role of coordinating the support and transition of students with disabilities. This support for disabilities within mainstream schools is unprecedented as students with disabilities in mainstream schools were previously expected to cope with the resources provided for typically developing students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1053451212472230">
<title>Special Centers</title>
<p>Some students who attend mainstream schools receive further support in centers providing specialized services to groups of children. For instance, the Students’ Care Service is a voluntary welfare organization (VWO) that has been providing educational psychology services to children from 1983 by identifying and providing intervention for children with learning and behavioral concerns. The TEACH ME program was established in 1991 by the Asian Women’s Welfare Association (AWWA) with a mobile therapy team to support children with physical impairments in mainstream schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212472230">AWWA, 2010</xref>). At about the same time in 1991, the Dyslexia Association of Singapore (DAS) was also established and started learning centers located within some mainstream schools or within the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212472230">DAS, 2009</xref>). In recent years, services have also been offered by Therapy Hubs, which provide physiotherapy and occupational and speech/language therapy services to individuals within the community who need such services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212472230">Society for the Physically Disabled, n.d.</xref>). More recently, there has been an emergence of social enterprises such as Bridge Learning providing assessment and intervention services for children with learning difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212472230">Bridge Learning, 2011</xref>). Unlike other similar organizations, this organization adopts a noncategorical approach to supporting students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053451212472230">
<title>New Schooling Options</title>
<p>In addition to the traditional mainstream educational environments where students with disabilities are educated, new schools such as the Northlight School and Assumption Pathway Schools were established in 2007 and 2009, respectively, catering to students who fail the Primary Six Leaving Examinations (PSLE). Although these are not special schools, their intake of students who fail the PSLE makes it more likely that the students whom they support have some form of disability (particularly learning disabilities) and/or environmental risk. These schools focus on character and vocational education in addition to foundational literacy skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053451212472230">
<title>Special Schools</title>
<p>Although most children with mild disabilities are supported in mainstream environments, some receive services in one of the 20 special schools (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212472230">Table 1</xref>). These schools support students with mild disabilities (e.g., visual, hearing, and physical impairments) who traditionally have difficulties accessing education in mainstream environments because of their disabilities. The funding and governance model is different in special schools. The MOE funds and regulates the education of students within the mainstream school system, but special schools are operated by a tripartite relationship among VWOs, which are often charities, with joint administration and funding from the Ministry of Community Development, Youth, and Sports and MOE. Schools that provide education to students with mild disabilities include Canossian School, Lighthouse School, Pathlight School, and the Singapore School for the Deaf.</p>

<title>Satellite Classrooms</title>
<p>In an effort to facilitate social inclusion of students with disabilities in the mainstream environment, satellite classrooms were launched in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212472230">MOE, 2010</xref>). In this new service delivery option, mainstream schools located near special schools enter a partnership to conduct joint social and learning opportunities by conducting satellite classes. This option is currently available for children with the intellectual capacity to access the mainstream curriculum in Pathlight and Canossian Schools.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1053451212472230">
<title>Support for Students With Moderate to Severe Disabilities</title>
<p>Although students with mild disabilities are typically supported in the mainstream school system, the current education system with standards-based assessment and high-stakes testing (e.g., PSLE, GCE O level) continues to necessitate that students with moderate to severe disabilities receive their education in the special education school system. In a recent report, 39% of the 4,800 students attending special schools had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders or multiple disabilities, 52% of students with an intellectual disability, 3% of students with a sensory disability, and 5% of students with a physical disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212472230">T. Tan, 2011</xref>). Some commonalities seen across special schools include better student–teacher ratios in the form of smaller class sizes, presence of teacher aides in classrooms, and related services provided by trained therapists. The special schools do not routinely teach the national curriculum or conduct examinations. Instead, they adopt a specialized and individualized curriculum for their students. An individualized education plan is written up for each student that outlines the supports and services each student receives. Depending on the cognitive levels of the students, these may mean the introduction of functional academics. In addition, there is a strong emphasis on life skills. Special schools are differentially resourced with equipment and material that support the specific needs of the students such as specialized facilities (e.g., hydrotherapy pools), augmentative or alternative communication technology (e.g., picture exchange cards, speech generating devices), and assistive technology (e.g., wheelchairs, individual schedules, and Braille machines).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053451212472230">
<title>Teacher Training</title>
<p>The National Institute of Education (NIE), an institute of Nanyang Technological University, trains all the teachers in mainstream and special education in Singapore. It offers a range of teacher education programs from initial teacher preparation to professional development courses. The teacher preparation programs for mainstream education at the degree, diploma, and postgraduate diploma levels have some embedded component of supporting students with disabilities within their training. A course titled “Teaching and Managing Diverse Learners in the Classrooms” equips teachers with an understanding of pedagogical approaches that support the learning needs of students. NIE also offers a diploma in special education, which is a 1-year full-time program that prepares teachers in special schools to teach children and young adults with a range of disabilities including cognitive, physical, sensory, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. This program is designed to prepare teachers with a basic knowledge of the key areas of child development, educational theory, and the etiology of the major types of disabilities. Graduates of this program acquire the skills necessary for the identification of specific disabilities, the diagnosis and assessment of individual strengths and weaknesses, and planning and evaluating individualized intervention programs.</p>
<p>For teachers in mainstream schools supporting students with disabilities, NIE also offers opportunities for professional development via the certificate in special needs support. Mainstream teachers (i.e., TSNs) who attend this program gain more in-depth knowledge and understanding of the special needs of diverse learners and learn ways to plan, adapt, and differentiate instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners in the mainstream setting. In addition, NIE offers training at the graduate levels. The master’s of education with a specialization in special education promotes professional competence in the field of special education by providing knowledge-based theory, practice, and research. This degree is designed for professionals who are involved in education-related activities in special education or disability-related work across mainstream schools, special schools, community agencies, and VWOs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1053451212472230">
<title>Challenges and Future Directions</title>
<p>Although the progress made during the preceding decades has been encouraging and represents a leap in the education of children with disabilities, challenges remain. Largely because of the success of the Child Development Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212472230">Ho, 2007</xref>), increasing numbers of children with disabilities are identified in preschool, and the numbers continue to rise. However, identification for school-aged children remains a challenge. Students who are identified within mainstream primary schools can access free diagnostic services, but there is a waiting list because of the limited number of educational psychologists within the school system. Students in secondary schools rely mainly on psychologists in private practice or the Child Guidance Clinic, if they exhibit related mental health concerns. Although improvements in the identification and diagnostic process in primary years will result in fewer students who merit diagnosis at the secondary level, there is a need to consider options for children with such needs.</p>
<p>Within mainstream schools, there is a need to consider how students with disabilities are supported. Although schools that do a good job supporting students with disabilities employ a schoolwide approach to supporting their students, this is not consistent across schools. There is a need to consider how school leaders can facilitate the process and implement systems within schools to facilitate schoolwide approach to identification and intervention supports. One barrier to the inclusion of students with disabilities in mainstream contexts is the national examination. Although teachers may want to support the students within their classes, the pace with which they have to cover the curricular content to prepare the students for the examinations significantly limits differentiation of instructional content for those students who need the additional learning supports. This issue merits further investigation. In addition to the issue of instructional content, a recent progress has been the introduction of accommodations for examinations (e.g., extra time, larger font size, exemption of second language, specialized testing conditions). However, there continues to be a stigma associated with receiving such accommodations as a notation is made in the students’ transcripts that the results were obtained under special conditions. The transition of students with disabilities between grade levels or schools also needs to be standardized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472230">Steering Committee on the Enabling Masterplan, 2007a</xref>). Although there is a centralized student record system within all mainstream schools to provide a repository for student information, the degree to which this system is used to help facilitate the transition of students with disabilities is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Although parents of the students with disabilities have been involved from the onset with the establishment of VWOs that run special schools, they remain as crucial but still unequal partners in the support process with special education being largely child and school centric. However, research has been limited to a study of parental perceptions toward the permanency planning of their children with intellectual disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212472230">Ow &amp; Fu, 1999</xref>). Further research regarding parental perceptions and aspirations is warranted.</p>
<p>One impact of the dual education system is in teacher training. Almost all teachers working in mainstream schools will be graduates by 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212472230">MOE, 2011</xref>). In contrast, teachers working in special schools receive training only on par with AED (LBS) and may not teach in mainstream schools. Similarly, although there is increased ease of movement from teachers in mainstream schools to special schools, the reverse is not the case. There is a need for teachers in special education to receive training equal, if not greater, in intensity to that which their counterparts in mainstream education receive.</p>
<p>On the legislative front, children with disabilities are exempt from compulsory education in Singapore. Although the legislation was crafted to reduce the pressure on parents to have their children perform in schools, it potentially deepens the divide between the mainstream education and special education system. An expansion of the legislation to include compulsory attendance in special schools would serve to give opportunities for education for all children. This divide between special and mainstream education was expressed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472230">Steering Committee on the Enabling Masterplan (2007a)</xref>, and they have recommended the ownership and leadership of special schools to fall within the MOE.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a young nation, Singapore has made great progress in several public sectors in comparison to neighboring countries. For example, Singapore has the highest trade to gross domestic product ratio in the world, an indication of the importance of trade to its economy. Singapore is known to be a melting pot of cultures, with people from different walks of life. With about 60% of the population being citizens, Singapore’s economy is considered to be one of the freest, most business friendly, and competitive economies in the world. Singapore’s economy is considered to be one of the freest, most business friendly, and competitive economies in the world. The turn of the 21st century has seen great progress in the field of education, specifically special education. The continuous changes seen in programs and policies are aimed at improving the service delivery options for students with disabilities in both mainstream and special education schools. We believe these recent changes are in the right direction—and a systemwide approach to identification and intervention services will help students with disabilities succeed in their individual learning journeys.</p>
