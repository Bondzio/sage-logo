<abstract>
<p>Femoral head allograft is an accepted alternative for significant bone loss in severe hindfoot reconstruction. This is primarily because the size and shape of the graft provides not only structural support but additionally prevents significant loss of limb length. We present a case using a technique from a directly lateral approach and simultaneous preparation of the tibia and calcaneus for tibiocalcaneal arthrodesis. Acetabular resurfacing reamers were used to prepare the joint for grafting as well as sculpt the graft itself for near press fit between the tibia and calcaneus. Fixation with a lateral locking plate avoids the unnecessary decompression reaming of the graft core itself, ultimately sparing the valuable poles of the graft for increased likelihood of incorporation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Significant defects of the hindfoot and ankle may result from a variety of events such as traumatic degeneration, Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy, failed total ankle arthroplasty, avascular necrosis, infection, severe biomechanical abnormalities, and many others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012463055">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012463055">2</xref></sup> Often with these scenarios, it is necessary to remove a significant portion of the hindfoot leading to and resulting in large bony voids and potential limb length discrepancies.</p>
<p>Previously in 2011, Cuttica and Hyer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463055">3</xref></sup> described a 2-incisional technique for insertion of a femoral head allograft using a cup and cone reamer technique for tibiotalocalcaneal fusion. They described the use of a large structural graft to avoid excessive shortening of the limb, which directly affects the ambulation and weight-bearing function of the patient. In addition, the cup-and-cone technique assists in stabilizing the spherical graft during insertion of an intramedullary (IM) nail. Ultimately, the cup-and-cone technique enhances the bone-to-bone contact, which increases the likelihood of incorporation, stability, and success.</p>
<p>We present a modification of this technique by approaching the ankle using a purely lateral approach with the Birmingham Acetabular Resurfacing Reamers (Smith and Nephew, Memphis, TN) and fixating it with a locking lateral plate and Ilizarov external ring fixator.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 64-year-old female initially sustained an injury in a swimming pool, which resulted in a Weber C-type ankle fracture with syndesmotic compromise. She was treated conservatively by another surgeon, and unfortunately, healing did not take place. She subsequently underwent open reduction internal fixation of the fibula, but no stabilization of the syndesmosis was performed. She continued to have pain postoperatively and was dispensed an Arizona brace. She then presented to our office complaining of continued pain and swelling. Her past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation and peripheral neuropathy, likely secondary to spinal stenosis. Physical exam demonstrated vascular status intact and decreased epicritic sensation. We obtained plain film radiographs and noted that the fibula was shortened in length and externally rotated, and it appeared to be outside the incisural notch of the tibia, along with an increased medial clear space. In addition, we noticed signs of distal lateral tibial osteonecrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012463055">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig1-1938640012463055" position="float">

</fig>
<p>Further workup consisted of a CT scan to better understand the 3-dimensional nature of the deformity and formulate a surgical plan. CT confirmed the diagnosis of syndesmotic compromise as well as distal lateral tibial osteonecrosis.</p>
<p>The patient opted for surgical revision consisting of revisional trimalleolar fracture and syndesmotic reduction. Postoperative radiographs demonstrated adequate reduction of the syndesmosis, but with time, the ankle and rear foot proceeded into valgus secondary to the distal lateral tibial osteonecrosis. Clinical assessment of the ankle revealed adequate motion and function at this juncture, and the patient desired to preserve ankle function. For this reason, we performed a triple arthrodesis to better align the rear foot and support the ankle in order to avoid fusion of the tibiotalar articulation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the ankle continued into valgus, and we noted signs of talar avascular necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012463055">Figure 2</xref>). The ankle was further complicated with edema and cellulitis. A leukocyte-labeled bone scan demonstrated uptake in the fibula and ankle. We then initiated a 3-stage treatment regiment for limb salvage. Stage 1 consisted of bone biopsy, which resulted in negative cultures and pathology report negative for osteomyelitis. In stage 2, we removed the hardware and performed a talectomy along with partial resection of the fibula. We then implanted a drug-eluding antibiotic spacer and stabilized the ankle with a temporary external fixator device, which remained intact for 3 weeks.</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, stage 3 consisted of an arthrodesis with insertion of a femoral head allograft stabilized with a lateral locking plate and an Ilizarov external ring fixator. We also inserted bone morphogenic protein and bone marrow aspirate into and surrounding the graft.</p>

<title>Stage 3 Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Before inflation of the tourniquet, we obtained bone marrow stem cells from the calcaneus. A well-padded thigh tourniquet was inflated, and a lateral expansile incisional approach allowed for excellent exposure. The fibula was resected several centimeters above the level of the ankle joint and morselized for autogenous bone grafting. After adequate joint resection was achieved, the defect was prepared for receipt of a femoral head allograft. We used the Birmingham acetabular resurfacing reamer to prepare the joint for a ball and socket type of configuration. We used a 40-mm size reamer, but smaller or larger sizes may be necessary depending on the patient.</p>
<p>The foot was reduced and held in a corrected position. We then began reaming the joint from a lateral to a medial direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012463055">Figure 3</xref>). Using the reamer in this manner created a deep socket for placement of the femoral head allograft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012463055">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1938640012463055">4B</xref>). The benefit to this technique lies in the reamer simultaneously preparing both the distal tibia as well as the superior calcaneus.</p>

</fig>
<p>Preparation of the femoral head allograft was then performed with the corresponding resurfacing reamer until adequate cancellous bone was noted and the graft was deemed the appropriate size for the joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012463055">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1938640012463055">5B</xref>). Afterward, we fenestrated and fish scaled the graft to increase the likelihood of incorporation. The graft was then saturated and infused with bone marrow aspirate previously harvested from the patient. Autogenous bone graft from the resected fibula along with bone morphogenic protein was packed around the graft filling any residual voids.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using the reamers to prepare the graft bed provided a near press fit of the graft between the distal tibia and superior calcaneus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1938640012463055">Figure 6</xref>). We placed 6.7-mm lag screws for compression along with additional rotatory stability of the spherical graft. These large-diameter screws were oriented from anterior superior to posterior inferior, spanning from the anterior distal face of the tibia, through the graft itself, and into the body of the calcaneus. A locking plate was then applied to the lateral side of the joint spanning from the tibia to the calcaneus. Finally, a circular ring external fixator device was applied to help prevent collapse of the construct and graft itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1938640012463055">Figure 7</xref>). The deep tissues and skin were closed in traditional fashion.</p>

<p>The patient was instructed to remain non–weight bearing to prevent collapse of the graft. Postoperative radiographs were closely monitored for graft incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1938640012463055">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1938640012463055">9</xref>). An external bone stimulator was also used postoperatively. The external ring fixator was removed 10 weeks postoperatively, and the patient was transitioned to a custom ankle-foot orthotic brace. At 12 months’ follow-up, ankle position and critical limb length were preserved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In addressing severe hindfoot deformities, this technique may be helpful and necessary for limb salvage. Fortunately, many deformities spare the medial malleolus, and we recommend leaving as much of the medial malleolus as possible. This allows the spherical shape of the graft to abut the remaining medial malleolus providing stability along with increasing host-graft contact area.</p>
<p>A lateral approach with simultaneous reaming of the tibia and calcaneus decreases the amount of dissection required. With this approach, it is not necessary to completely dislocate the foot medially to ream the distal tibia or superior calcaneus. This avoids complete stripping of the surrounding soft tissues. The reamer creates a socket between the distal tibia and the superior calcaneus allowing the graft to seat in close proximity between the tibial plafond, medial malleolus, and calcaneus.</p>
<p>The lateral approach also affords the option of using a lateral plate for internal fixation. We have found that an IM nail is a viable option for fixation, but unfortunately the nail does require reaming of the internal core of the graft itself. This decreases the amount of bone available for fusion, especially at the superior and inferior poles of the graft. For this reason, we prefer a lateral locking plate spanning the tibia, graft, and calcaneus. Because we have further used this technique in other patients, we have not always found it necessary to incorporate an external fixator with the use of a locking plate. In the case presented here, we did feel that it was necessary to support the construct with an external ring fixator, but this was used as a static frame solely for the purpose of stability and did not provide additional compression. This decision of whether to use an external ring fixator in addition to internal fixation should be made on an individual basis of each patient considering body habitus, comorbidities, compliance, extent of bony resection, and surgeon discretion.</p>
<p>Cuttica and Hyer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012463055">3</xref></sup> stated that one benefit of using a structural femoral head allograft is that it avoids donor site morbidity. In addition, it is difficult to obtain a structural autogenous graft of this size. They also note that the larger femoral head allograft is appropriate because it helps preserve critical limb length.</p>
<p>Clowers and Myerson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012463055">4</xref></sup> advocated retrieving stem cell aspirate from the iliac crest and not only coating the graft but injecting the aspirate into the core via the fenestration tunnels. We use a similar technique by harvesting stem cells from the calcaneus at the beginning of the procedure before inflation of the thigh tourniquet.</p>
<p>Alfahd et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012463055">5</xref></sup> found construct stability to be similar in cadaveric studies between the blade plate and IM nail for tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis. Other similar cadaveric studies have found blade plate fixation to provide superior stability, especially in osteopenic bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012463055">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012463055"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012463055">8</xref></sup> Hammett et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012463055">9</xref></sup> cautioned against using IM nails in osteopenic patients simply because of the likelihood of stress fracture occurring at the tip of the nail. Lowery and Joseph<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012463055">10</xref></sup> advocated the use of a humeral locking plate for tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis because it offers excellent biomechanical stability, is less technically demanding, and contours nicely to the lateral hindfoot.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Maintaining limb length is one of the major advantages of incorporating femoral head allograft into the reconstruction of severe hindfoot deformities. We have described a technique in which an isolated lateral approach is used to allow resection and create a ball and socket type configuration via simultaneous reaming of the distal tibia and superior calcaneus. This enables stability of the graft, increases surface contact area for fusion, and maintains critical limb length. A lateral locking plate avoids the graft core reaming disadvantage of IM nail fixation and ultimately preserves vital bone-to-bone contact at the host-graft interface. Further clinical studies are necessary to validate the effectiveness of this technique.</p>
