<p>Diabetes mellitus is one of the non-communicable diseases which have become a major global health problem.</p>
<p>The aim of the study is to estimate the usefulness of the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) for detecting undiagnosed diabetes in the rural areas of Tamil Nadu. Community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in the rural health centres (Chunampett and Annachikuppam) covering a population of 35,000. Two villages were identified from each of the centres. 1,936 respondents participated in the study during the period February-April 2008. A pre-designed and pre-tested protocol was used to find out the prevalence and the risk of diabetes mellitus in the general population by using the Indian diabetes risk score.</p>
<p>The study finding shows that 60 per cent of the respondents were female; most were Hindus (62 per cent). A large number of subjects (49 per cent) were in the age group of 20–35 years. 62 per cent of the respondents belonged to the lower and lower middle socio-economic classes. Almost 75 per cent were indulged in mild to moderate physical activity and 88 per cent had no family history of diabetes mellitus. Findings depict that 40 per cent of the respondents were in overweight category, out of which 64 per cent had high diabetes risk score. Chance of high diabetic score increases with the increase in body mass index (BMI). Prevalence of diabetes was 5.99 per cent, out of which 56 per cent had high IDRS (more than 60). Correlation between BMI and IDRS shows, that if BMI increases from less than 18.5 to more than 30, chances of high risk for developing diabetes mellitus also significantly increase. IDRS can identify high risk diabetes subjects from the community and it can be used for mass screening in India as it is a cost-effective method.</p>
