<title>Background:</title>
<p>The ideal treatment for osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs) is still controversial, especially in older patients. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested for use in the cell-based treatment of cartilage lesions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513479018">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To compare the clinical outcomes of MSC injection and arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment with those of arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment alone for the treatment of OLTs in older patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513479018">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513479018">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Among 107 patients with OLTs treated arthroscopically, only the patients older than 50 years (65 patients) were included in this study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 35 patients (37 ankles) treated with arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment alone (group A) and 30 patients (31 ankles) who underwent MSC injection along with arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment (group B). Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale, and the Roles and Maudsley score. The Tegner activity scale was used to determine outcomes in activity levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513479018">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean VAS score in each group was significantly improved (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) from 7.2 ± 1.1 to 4.0 ± 0.7 in group A and from 7.1 ± 1.0 to 3.2 ± 0.9 in group B. The mean AOFAS score in each group was also significantly improved (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) from 68.0 ± 5.5 to 77.2 ± 4.8 in group A and from 68.1 ± 5.6 to 82.6 ± 6.4 in group B. There were significant differences in mean VAS and AOFAS scores between the groups at final follow-up (mean, 21.8 months; range, 12-44 months) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The Roles and Maudsley score showed significantly greater improvement in group B than in group A after surgery (<italic>P</italic> = .040). The Tegner activity scale score was significantly improved in group B (from 3.5 ± 0.7 to 3.8 ± 0.7; <italic>P</italic> = .041) but not in group A (from 3.5 ± 0.8 to 3.6 ± 0.6; <italic>P</italic> = .645). Large lesion size (≥109 mm<sup>2</sup>) and the existence of subchondral cysts were significant predictors of unsatisfactory clinical outcomes in group A (<italic>P</italic> = .04 and .03, respectively). These correlations were not observed in group B.</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546513479018">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Injection of MSCs with marrow stimulation treatment was encouraging in patients older than 50 years compared with patients treated with marrow stimulation treatment alone, especially when the lesion size was larger than 109 mm<sup>2</sup> or a subchondral cyst existed. Although still in the early stages of application, MSCs may have great potential in the treatment of OLTs in patients older than 50 years, and more evaluations of its effect should be performed.</p>

<body>
<p>Osteochondral lesion of the talus (OLT) is a broad term used to describe an injury or abnormality of the talar articular cartilage and adjacent bone. The various methods of surgical treatment for OLTs have been introduced from marrow stimulation techniques such as subchondral drilling, curettage, microabrasion, and microfracture, to restorative techniques such as osteochondral autograft transfer, mosaicplasty, and frozen osteochondral allografts, which were developed to transfer articular hyaline cartilage to replace the injured area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546513479018">‡</xref></sup> Articular hyaline cartilage is avascular and has poor regenerative capabilities, and injuries that do not penetrate the subchondral plate have no stimulus for an inflammatory reaction and healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513479018">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513479018">40</xref></sup> The principal aim of the marrow stimulation treatments is the recruitment of pluripotent mesenchymal cells from the bone marrow that leads to fibrous tissue covering the lesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479018">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513479018">40</xref></sup> These treatments provide acceptable clinical results over midterm follow-up periods but often fail in the long term because of biomechanical insufficiency of the regenerative fibrocartilage and scar tissue that results from these methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513479018">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513479018">33</xref></sup> Subsequently, OLTs may not respond to these marrow stimulation treatments, and the articular surface may continue to deteriorate and lead to degenerative arthritis of the ankle joint, especially in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513479018">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0363546513479018">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0363546513479018">61</xref></sup> Several recent studies have reported less favorable outcomes of arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment for OLTs in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479018">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479018">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513479018">42</xref></sup> Therefore, the initial treatment of OLTs in older patients is very important to halt the progression to degenerative arthritis.</p>
<p>Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were proposed as a new option for the treatment of articular cartilage defects because of their ability to differentiate into various lineages, including osteoblasts and chondrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513479018">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513479018">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0363546513479018">55</xref></sup> In the literature, only a few studies have reported on the application of MSCs for the treatment of OLTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513479018">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513479018">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The goals of this study were (1) to investigate the clinical outcomes and postoperative activity levels of patients older than 50 years treated with injection of MSCs along with arthroscopic marrow stimulation for OLTs, (2) to compare the outcomes thereof with those of arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment alone, and (3) to identify the prognostic factors associated with poor outcomes for OLTs.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546513479018" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed 107 consecutive patients (112 ankles) with a diagnosis of OLTs who were treated with arthroscopic marrow stimulation from May 2008 to December 2011. All patients had localized OLTs with symptoms of ankle joint pain or functional limitations despite a minimum of 3 months’ nonoperative management. Nonoperative treatment options included ankle bracing, physical therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If the patients had chronic lateral ankle instability, ankle bracing and taping were recommended to decrease the occurrence of ankle sprains, and a structured physical therapy program focused on peroneus strengthening exercise and proprioceptive-based rehabilitation of the ankle was also performed.</p>
<p>Patients with previous surgical treatments and patients with arthritic changes of their ankle joint or deformity of the axis of the ankle on plain radiographs were excluded. Of a total of 112 ankles, the first 77 ankles (May 2008 to September 2010) were treated with arthroscopic marrow stimulation alone, and the next 35 ankles (October 2010 to December 2011) were treated with MSC injection along with arthroscopic marrow stimulation. To investigate the effect of age on the outcome of patients after arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment with or without the injection of MSCs, we used an age limit (50 years) as a cutoff to define “older” patients.</p>
<p>This study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital. Among the 107 patients, 65 patients older than 50 years (68 ankles) were included; there were 33 men and 32 women. The average age was 56.8 years (range, 51-73 years), the average preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 26.9 (range, 20.8-33.4), and the average duration of symptoms was 22.1 weeks (range, 16-34 weeks). We divided these 65 patients into 2 groups: 35 patients (37 ankles) who were treated with arthroscopic marrow stimulation alone (group A) and 30 patients (31 ankles) who underwent arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment along with MSC injection (group B). The mean follow-up period was 21.8 months (range, 12-44 months): 23.9 months (range, 18-44 months) in group A and 19.7 months (range, 12-26 months) in group B (<italic>P</italic> = .078). There were no significant differences in basic characteristics between the groups regarding patient sex, BMI, duration of symptoms before surgery, or follow-up period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513479018">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Clinical and Radiological Analysis</title>
<p>For clinical evaluation, the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Scale were utilized. The Roles and Maudsley score was used to evaluate patient satisfaction with clinical results. The Tegner activity scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0363546513479018">65</xref></sup> was used to determine sporting and activity levels. Although the Tegner activity scale was originally intended for the knee, it also facilitates outcomes research in sports medicine. The period required to return to sports activity after surgery was also investigated.</p>
<p>At preoperative and final follow-up examinations, we obtained anteroposterior and lateral weightbearing radiographs to assess the ankle joint for degenerative arthritis. We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the size and location of lesions and to evaluate any associated lesions (eg, subchondral cyst) before surgery. To avoid potential bias, an independent observer who was a musculoskeletal trained radiologist, not involved in the care of the patients and blinded to the intention of this study, evaluated the MRI scans. The width and length of the OLTs were measured with coronal, sagittal, and axial MRI scans, and the largest dimension was selected. We reconfirmed the lesion size through an arthroscopic examination, and the defect size was calculated by the ellipse formula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513479018">Figure 1B</xref>). We compared the size measurements (width, length, and size) based on MRI with those determined by arthroscopic examination, and a good correlation was found by linear regression analysis (<italic>r</italic> = 0.76; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The arthroscopic marrow stimulation procedure was performed in a standardized manner in every case. After accurate debridement of all unstable and damaged cartilage in the lesion, a microfracture was performed, 3 to 4 mm apart in areas where the subchondral bone was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513479018">Figure 1A</xref>). Multiple perforations perpendicular to the joint surface were made by a 2.5-mm, 90° microfracture awl (Linvatec, Largo, Florida), as described by Steadman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0363546513479018">62</xref></sup> For areas with losses of subchondral bone, abrasion arthroplasty was performed by removing loose chondral or osteochondral fragments with a ring-shaped or curved curette and by trimming damaged cartilage with a power shaver until a stable, smooth articular surface was created. When there were subchondral cysts, the cysts were decompressed by removal of cystic materials. The tourniquet was released after this procedure, and adequate bone bleeding at microfracture holes was confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513479018">Figure 2C</xref>). For group B, the injection of MSCs isolated at 1 day before arthroscopic surgery was performed after the arthroscopic procedure.</p>

<p>After surgery, a short leg splint was applied for 2 weeks, and after sutures were removed, we recommended tolerable weightbearing activities for patients without associated lesions. There were 37 patients (20 patients in group A and 17 patients in group B) who received a lateral ligament reconstruction along with the arthroscopic treatment. In patients who had a history of recurrent sprains or chronic ankle instability, ankle bracing and taping were recommended to decrease the occurrence of ankle sprains, and a structured physical therapy program focused on peroneus strengthening exercise and proprioceptive-based rehabilitation of the ankle was also performed. If the instability was not improved after these treatments and the ruptured anterior talofibular ligament or calcaneofibular ligament was identified on MRI, lateral ligament reconstruction was performed, as described by Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513479018">38</xref></sup> For those patients, we recommended postoperative short leg walking cast immobilization with partial weightbearing for 4 weeks. Patients began both active and passive range of motion exercises to the ankle joint at 4 weeks after surgery. Sports or high-impact activities were limited for at least 3 months.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546513479018">
<title>Sample Collection and MSC Isolation</title>
<p>The MSCs were derived from the fat pad harvested from the buttock of the patients. One week before the buttock fat pad harvesting procedure, patients were restricted from consuming corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. One day before arthroscopic surgery, we harvested the fat pad tissue through tumescent liposuction. The patient was placed in the prone position under intravenous anesthesia. After surgical preparation, a hollow blunt-tipped cannula was introduced into the subcutaneous space through a small incision, and the subcutaneous adipose tissue was infiltrated with a mixture solution to minimize blood loss and tissue contamination by peripheral blood cells before aspiration. The mixture solution was made of 500 mL of 0.9% saline solution supplemented with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine (400 mg/20 mL), 4 mL of 8.4% sodium hydrogen carbonate (20 mL), and 0.7 mL of 0.1% epinephrine (1 mg/mL). The liposuction material was aspirated by gentle suction, and the buttock fat pad was collected (see Appendix Figure S1, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The MSCs derived from the buttock fat pad were isolated as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513479018">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0363546513479018">67</xref></sup> Briefly, the pad was minced and washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and an equal volume of 0.1% collagenase type 1 (Worthington Biochemical Corp, Lakewood, New Jersey). The tissue was placed in a rotary incubator at 37°C, with continuous agitation for 3 hours. After digestion, the lipoaspirates were centrifuged at 1200<italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes to separate the lipoaspirate and the collagenase. The lipoaspirates were then washed 3 times to remove any remaining collagenase. After the last round of centrifugation, cells in the aspirates were counted using a hemocytometer. After the stem cells were isolated, a mean of 3.9 × 10<sup>6</sup> (range, 1.8 to 9.3 × 10<sup>6</sup>) stem cells was prepared (see Appendix Figure S2, available online). Before injection, bacteriological tests were performed on the samples (to ensure the absence of contamination), and the viability of the cells was assessed using the methylene blue dye exclusion test.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The principal dependent variables of clinical outcomes were the VAS, AOFAS scale, and Tegner activity scale at the final follow-up. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted for the evaluation of changes in preoperative and final follow-up values, and 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for the comparison of results between the groups. Either the χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical data. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the various factors (such as sex, BMI, duration of symptoms, size and location of OLT, existence of subchondral cyst, and additional surgery) independently associated with satisfaction with clinical results for each group. The median values are used as standard values for dividing the groups. We defined satisfactory clinical results as a VAS score of less than 4 points, an AOFAS score of more than 80, and a good or excellent Roles and Maudsley score at the final follow-up. For the logistic regression models, we reported odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) relative to a chosen reference group. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 12.0.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois), with significance defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Association Between Variables of OLT and Clinical Outcome</title>
<p>The mean size of OLTs was 108.7 ± 34.6 mm<sup>2</sup>. For each group, the mean lesion size was 102.7 ± 31.4 mm<sup>2</sup> in group A and 118.9 ± 47.9 mm<sup>2</sup> in group B (<italic>P</italic> = .126). To analyze the association of the size of OLTs with clinical results, we divided the patients according to lesion size into large lesion size (≥109 mm<sup>2</sup>) and small lesion size (&lt;109 mm<sup>2</sup>) groups. For locating the osteochondral lesion, we divided the talar dome into 2 parts sagittally and demarcated medial and lateral lesions. There were 25 medial and 12 lateral lesions in group A and 22 medial and 9 lateral lesions in group B (<italic>P</italic> = .781). We also investigated the existence of subchondral cysts in each group. The subchondral cysts existed in 16 patients from group A and 12 patients from group B (<italic>P</italic> = .523). When considering a VAS score of less than 4 points, an AOFAS score more than 80, and a good or excellent Roles and Maudsley score at the final follow-up as a satisfactory clinical outcome, large lesion size (≥109 mm<sup>2</sup>) and the existence of subchondral cysts were significant predictors of unsatisfactory clinical outcomes, with an odds ratio of 4.43 (95% CI, 0.86-22.77) and 7.62 (95% CI, 1.24-46.73), respectively, compared with small lesion size (&lt;109 mm<sup>2</sup>) and the nonexistence of subchondral cysts in group A (<italic>P</italic> = .04 and <italic>P</italic> = .03, respectively). These correlations were not observed in group B. No association was found between the location of OLTs and clinical outcomes in both groups (see Appendix Table S1, available online).</p>

<title>Associations Between Variables of OLT and Arthritic Change of the Ankle Joint</title>
<p>Degenerative arthritis of the ankle joint was assessed according to anteroposterior and lateral weightbearing radiographs at the final follow-up. If there were bony spurs around the ankle joint, joint space narrowing compared with the opposite ankle, or joint margin sclerosis on plain radiographs, we defined them as degenerative arthritis. Degenerative arthritis of the ankle joint was observed in 4 cases in group A and 1 case in group B at the final follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513479018">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Other Prognostic Factors</title>
<p>We used logistic regression models to assess the independent effects of patients’ sex, BMI, duration of symptoms, and additional surgery of lateral ligament reconstruction on clinical outcomes in each group (see Appendix Table S1). Median values were used as a standard for dividing the groups according to patients’ BMI (&lt;26.9 or ≥26.9) and duration of symptoms (&lt;22.1 or ≥21.1 weeks). The lateral ligament reconstructions were performed along with the arthroscopic treatment in 13 cases of group A and 9 cases of group B (<italic>P</italic> = .645). All prognostic factors, including the patient’s sex, BMI, duration of symptoms, and additional surgery of lateral ligament reconstruction did not show a significant influence on clinical outcomes (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).

<title>Follow-up MRI Assessment and Second-Look Arthroscopic Surgery</title>
<p>There were 6 patients in group A and 1 patient in group B who showed clinical failure (poor according to the Roles and Maudsley score). Among 6 patients of group A, 4 patients received an osteochondral transplantation after confirming the failure of microfracture through the follow-up MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513479018">Figure 3C</xref>). Second-look arthroscopic surgery was performed before the osteochondral transplantation and revealed that the cartilage regeneration was poor and unstable fibrotic tissue was covered in the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513479018">Figure 3D</xref>). Two patients in group A and 1 patient in group B who showed clinical failure but refused to receive more evaluation and aggressive surgery were managed with nonoperative measures, including rest, immobilization, anti-inflammatory medication, and physical therapy. Follow-up MRI and second-look arthroscopic surgery were performed in 1 patient of group B at 8 months after the initial surgery. We explained the purpose of the follow-up MRI and second-look arthroscopic surgery to this patient and received written consent. In this patient, follow-up MRI and second-look arthroscopic surgery revealed that the cartilage defect was completely covered with smooth tissues, considered to be the cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513479018">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513479018">G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513479018">H</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A number of retrospective studies have assessed the results of marrow stimulation treatment in OLTs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546513479018">§</xref></sup> In these studies, various factors involved with marrow stimulation treatment, including the age of the patients, the size and location of OLTs, and the existence of subchondral cysts, were reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513479018">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479018">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513479018">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0363546513479018">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0363546513479018">60</xref></sup> We retrospectively reviewed 65 consecutive patients (68 ankles) who had a diagnosis of OLT and were treated with arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment along with or without MSC injection and investigated the clinical outcomes and prognostic factors associated with this treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study presenting a clinical report of MSC injection along with arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment for OLTs.</p>
<p>Several recent studies have indicated that older patients seem to do well with arthroscopic treatment for OLTs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479018">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513479018">32</xref></sup> while several authors have reported less favorable outcomes of marrow stimulation procedures for the treatment of OLTs in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479018">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479018">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513479018">42</xref></sup> Chuckpaiwong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479018">17</xref></sup> retrospectively evaluated a total of 105 patients with OLTs who underwent arthroscopic microfracture and reported significant improvements in the outcome of surgical treatment in younger patients (mean, 38.6 ± 10.6 years) compared with older patients (mean, 44.1 ± 9.7 years) (<italic>P</italic> = .029). Ferkel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref></sup> retrospectively evaluated a total of 64 patients. Twenty-seven patients were 32 years of age or younger, and 23 were older than 32 years. The older age group had an AOFAS score of 80, while the younger group had a score of 88. Giannini and Vannini<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479018">26</xref></sup> reported that marrow stimulation treatment should be used in patients younger than 50 years for better results. Age-dependent results after microfracture of chondral lesions in the knee have already been described in previous studies. In a case series of 72 patients treated arthroscopically with microfracture for full-thickness chondral defects, Steadman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0363546513479018">62</xref></sup> found that patients younger than 35 years improved more than did those between 35 and 45 years of age. In our study, we chose to investigate the effect of MSCs on the outcomes of patients older than 50 years. Although the overall clinical outcomes, including VAS and AOFAS scores, were significantly improved in both the patients undergoing arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment alone (group A) and those with arthroscopic marrow stimulation and MSC injection (group B) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 for each), there were significant differences in mean VAS and AOFAS scores between the groups at final follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513479018">Table 2</xref>). Also, the Roles and Maudsley score showed significantly greater postoperative improvement in patients in group B compared with those in group A (<italic>P</italic> = .040). Activity levels according to the Tegner activity scale were significantly improved only in group B (<italic>P</italic> = .041) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513479018">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, we discerned that the injection of MSCs along with arthroscopic microfracture would potentially be useful for better clinical results in patients older than 50 years.</p>
<p>The principal aim of the marrow stimulation treatments in OLTs is revascularization of the bony defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513479018">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513479018">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513479018">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0363546513479018">59</xref></sup> Articular hyaline cartilage is avascular and has poor regenerative capabilities; therefore, injuries that do not penetrate the subchondral plate have no stimulus for an inflammatory reaction and healing. Through marrow stimulation treatments, when the depth of the OLT extends to the subchondral bone, marrow cells are stimulated to produce new tissue in an attempt to fill the defect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513479018">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0363546513479018">53</xref></sup> However, in previous in vitro studies, several authors reported an age-related decline in the number of MSCs in the bone marrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513479018">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513479018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513479018">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0363546513479018">52</xref></sup> Therefore, marrow stimulation treatment alone without additional MSC injection for OLTs has less favorable outcomes in older patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479018">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479018">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513479018">42</xref></sup> From this point of view, we hypothesized that the injection of MSCs along with arthroscopic microfracture may be helpful for the treatment of OLTs in older patients. These results were in accordance with our hypothesis, as previously mentioned: the clinical outcomes of injection of MSCs along with marrow stimulation treatment in older patients (group B) showed significantly greater improvement than those who received marrow stimulation treatment alone (group A).</p>
<p>A review of the literature revealed significant correlations between defect size and clinical outcomes of arthroscopic treatment of OLTs. Giannini and Vannini<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479018">26</xref></sup> reported that arthroscopic treatment seems to be the treatment of choice for lesions smaller than 150 mm<sup>2</sup> and that it may also be attempted in lesions from 150 to 200 mm<sup>2</sup>. Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479018">16</xref></sup> retrospectively evaluated a total of 120 ankles with OLTs that underwent arthroscopic microfracture and reported that the patients with osteochondral lesions smaller than 150 mm<sup>2</sup> had better results than did those with larger lesions. Gobbi et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513479018">27</xref></sup> using the Pearson correlation analysis, showed an inverse relationship between defect size and outcome (microfracture: <italic>r</italic> = −0.92; osteochondral transplantation: <italic>r</italic> = −0.89). Chuckpaiwong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479018">17</xref></sup> reported a strong correlation between lesion size and successful outcome. They found excellent results in patients with osteochondral lesions smaller than 15 mm, regardless of location.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479018">17</xref></sup> These results are consistent with the outcomes of our study, which found significant correlations between defect size and clinical outcomes. In our study, the mean size of OLTs was 108.7 ± 34.6 mm<sup>2</sup>, and to analyze the association of the size of OLTs with clinical results, we divided the patients according to lesion size into large lesion size (≥109 mm<sup>2</sup>) and small lesion size (&lt;109 mm<sup>2</sup>) groups, and patients with OLTs larger than 109 mm<sup>2</sup> had worse results than those with smaller lesions in group A (<italic>P</italic> = .04). However, this correlation was not observed in group B (<italic>P</italic> = .23) (see Appendix Table S1). Accordingly, we discerned that the injection of MSCs had an influence on the better outcomes of treatment in patients older than 50 years and with OLTs larger than 109 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Osteochondral lesions of the talus associated with subchondral cysts have been treated with a variety of procedures. Two studies have reported good to excellent results in 74% to 80% of patients treated for small (&lt;50 mm<sup>2</sup>) cystic lesions with marrow stimulation alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513479018">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513479018">45</xref></sup> Authors of other studies have recommended against the use of marrow stimulation alone in the treatment of cystic lesions based on the results of their studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0363546513479018">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0363546513479018">60</xref></sup> Kumai et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513479018">43</xref></sup> recommended osteochondral autografts/allografts or autologous chondrocyte implantation as the initial treatment in patients with associated subchondral cysts larger than 6 mm in depth, as these patients did not do well with routine marrow stimulation treatments. It has been postulated that synovial cysts can be caused by synovial fluid intrusion through a defect in the articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513479018">41</xref></sup> Second-look arthroscopic surgery after talar osteochondral drilling has also shown irregular chondral surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513479018">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513479018">36</xref></sup> In our study, the subchondral cysts existed in 16 cases of group A and 12 cases of group B (<italic>P</italic> = .523). In addition, the clinical outcome was significantly worse in patients with subchondral cysts than those without subchondral cysts in group A (<italic>P</italic> = .03). However, this correlation was not observed in group B (<italic>P</italic> = .35) (Appendix Table S1). Although we cannot provide a definitive explanation for the exact effect of MSCs on the subchondral cyst, we consider the possibility that injecting MSCs influenced the better outcomes of treatment in patients older than 50 years and with subchondral cysts. More evaluations are required to investigate the mechanism of MSCs in the healing process of OLTs.</p>
<p>Biomechanical studies of human ankle articular cartilage have led some authors to conclude that cartilage lesions such as OLTs may be related to the disparity of the mechanical properties in the different regions of the ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513479018">4</xref></sup> The softest tissue of the talar dome appears to be on the posteromedial talar dome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513479018">4</xref></sup> Additionally, stiffer articular cartilage is found on the tibial side when compared with the talar side, which may account for the low frequency of tibial OLTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513479018">4</xref></sup> We attempted to correlate our results with regard to location on the talus, but no association was found between the location of OLTs and clinical outcomes in both groups (Appendix Table S1). Several authors have reported no difference in outcome based on the location of an OLT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0363546513479018">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0363546513479018">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>The development of late osteoarthritis in patients with OLTs treated with surgical intervention remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513479018">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513479018">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513479018">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0363546513479018">66</xref></sup> Angermann and Jensen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513479018">2</xref></sup> reported the development of degenerative changes in 6% to 17% of the overall patient population. Canale and Belding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513479018">13</xref></sup> reported degenerative changes in more than 50% of their patients. In contrast, other authors described late osteoarthritis as an uncommon complication of OLTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513479018">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513479018">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0363546513479018">66</xref></sup> Ferkel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref></sup> reported that their long-term outcomes deteriorated with time in 35% of 50 cases. Although the exact reason for arthritic change is unknown, pre-existent degenerative changes and the lack of durability of fibrocartilage may have contributed to the deterioration of results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref></sup> In our study, degenerative arthritic changes of the ankle joint were observed in 4 cases (11%) in group A and 1 case (3%) in group B at the final follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513479018">Figure 2</xref>). We found that large lesion size (≥109 mm<sup>2</sup>) and the existence of subchondral cysts were significantly associated with the development of degenerative arthritis of the ankle joint in group A (<italic>P</italic> = .014 and <italic>P</italic> = .021, respectively), but these associations were not found in group B (<italic>P</italic> = .214 and <italic>P</italic> = .182, respectively). Therefore, we considered that the injection of MSCs influenced the development of arthritic changes. However, the follow-up period of our study was relatively short (mean, 21.8 months), and these results may change over a longer follow-up period, as the durability of the regenerated fibrous cartilage after marrow stimulation treatment is known to deteriorate as time passes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479018">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513479018">44</xref></sup> Therefore, long-term evaluations are required to investigate the association between the effect of MSCs and the development of degenerative arthritis of the ankle joint.</p>
<p>Recently, MSCs have been suggested for use in the cell-based treatment of cartilage lesions. Chondrogenesis of MSCs was first reported by Ashton et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513479018">3</xref></sup> and a defined medium for the in vitro chondrogenesis of MSCs was first described by Johnstone et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513479018">35</xref></sup> who used micromass culture with transforming growth factor β and dexamethasone. Regarding in vitro studies, the transplantation of MSCs into full-thickness articular cartilage defects has been attempted under various conditions, and MSCs have been used with success in hybrid scaffolds to repair osteochondral defects in animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513479018">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513479018">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513479018">39</xref></sup> An animal experiment by McIlwraith et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546513479018">48</xref></sup> investigating MSC use to augment healing of microfractured chondral defects showed encouraging results. In their study, they found that arthroscopic and gross evaluation confirmed a significant increase in repair tissue firmness and a trend for better overall repair tissue quality in MSC-treated joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546513479018">48</xref></sup> Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly greater levels of aggrecan in repair tissue treated with MSC injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546513479018">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although many studies have been successful, several questions still persist that limit the clinical application of these cells for cartilage injury, such as which tissue are suitable MSCs derived from or what conditions are appropriate for cartilage repair. Although still in the early stages of application, this unique approach may have great potential in the treatment of human cartilage defects. Although the clinical outcomes of the injection of MSCs along with arthroscopic microfracture in OLTs were encouraging in group B compared with those in group A in our study, we suggest that basic research and histological evaluations are required to identify the effect of MSCs in microfractured chondral defects. However, this study presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first clinical report of the injection of MSCs along with arthroscopic marrow stimulation treatment in OLTs.</p>
<p>The source of the MSCs is very important to obtain good results. The choice of the stem cell source is determined by the ease of harvesting, population density, and differentiation potential of the cells because their abilities vary among different tissue sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0363546513479018">58</xref></sup> Bone marrow–derived stem cells have been widely studied, and there is a wealth of information in the literature concerning these cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0363546513479018">56</xref></sup> However, bone marrow harvesting is painful and is associated with donor site morbidities and risks of wound infection and sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0363546513479018">57</xref></sup> Furthermore, with increasing age, there is a decrease in MSC numbers, life span, and proliferation and differentiation potentials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546513479018">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0363546513479018">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0363546513479018">63</xref></sup> Therefore, an alternative cell source that is easy to obtain, has a low risk of complications, and has a high yield of cells with good proliferation and differentiation potentials that do not decline with age is ideal for enabling optimal cell-based tissue repair therapies in an aging population. In this study, MSCs were derived from the fat pad harvested from the buttock of patients. These cells have been shown to maintain their differentiation potential even in the later stages of life and may have better chondrogenic potential than bone marrow–derived MSCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0363546513479018">58</xref></sup> Moreover, the pain and morbidity associated with the harvesting of fat pad cells are considerably less than that associated with bone marrow cell harvesting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513479018">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the technique of this study was primitive, we obtained good outcomes in older patients (group B) perhaps because of the paracrine effects of the injected stem cells. It is widely known that stem cell therapy has 2 main mechanisms of action. The first is that these cells comprise the final tissue in human organs. The second mechanism, the most convincingly proven so far, is the paracrine effects of the cytokines and growth factors released by the grafted cells, which favorably influence the microenvironment by triggering host-associated signaling pathways and lead to increased angiogenesis, decreased apoptosis, and possibly induction of endogenous generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513479018">14</xref></sup> As we mentioned above, more basic research and histological evaluations are required to identify the mechanism of action of MSCs in microfractured chondral defects.</p>
<p>There were 4 patients who showed clinical failure and received osteochondral transplantation after confirming the failure of microfracture through follow-up MRI in group A. However, there were no complications of the injection of MSCs, including infection, fever, hematoma, tissue hypertrophy, adhesion formation, or other major adverse events, that occurred among the patients. Therefore, we consider the injection of MSCs to be a safe treatment.</p>
<p>The present study does have some limitations. First, the number of patients was relatively small, the follow-up period was short, and data were collected retrospectively. For more accurate evaluation of the effect of MSCs in OLTs, a prospective study and a larger series of cases with a longer follow-up period are required. Second, we used the VAS, AOFAS scale, and Tegner activity scale to evaluate the results. Follow-up MRI, second-look arthroscopic surgery, or histological evaluation correlated with clinical outcomes and power analysis is necessary to identify the effect of MSCs more precisely. Lastly, the number of MSCs to be injected to achieve the optimal response is unknown.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed encouraging results for marrow stimulation treatment with MSC injection compared with marrow stimulation treatment alone for patients older than 50 years. Furthermore, the injection of MSCs influenced better outcomes of treatment in patients older than 50 years when the lesion size was larger than 109 mm<sup>2</sup> or in the presence of a subchondral cyst. We propose that the injection of MSCs may be helpful in preventing the development of arthritic changes. Although still in the early stages of application, MSCs may have great potential in the treatment of OLTs in patients older than 50 years, and more evaluations of the effect of MSCs should be performed.</p>
