<p>The Soviet prison camp system, the Gulag, was a sprawling network covering some of the most inhospitable areas of the Soviet Union. The harsh realities of life for Gulag prisoners have for a long time been known through the memoirs of those inmates lucky enough to survive, most famously Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. However, very little is known about those who actually worked in the camps, who served the state and were complicit in maintaining the repressive prison apparatus. With the publication of <italic>Gulag Boss</italic>, a memoir of an ex-camp boss, Fyodor Mochulsky, a fascinating account of life from the other side can now be read in the English language. Translated by Deborah Kaple, <italic>Gulag Boss</italic> presents challenging questions about how ordinary people like Mochulsky functioned as part of the Stalinist system and how we can ascribe responsibility.</p>
<p>Mochulsky never wanted to work in the Gulag and throughout his memoir his life is one dictated by chance. Originally trained as an engineer, Mochulsky was hand-selected to become a labour boss in the Pechorlag in 1940, a labour camp in the North of Russia. He had no choice but to accept. Before his arrival at the camp, Mochulsky had no sense of the difficulties of Gulag life. He believed, as many Soviet citizens did, that the labour camps were for reforming criminals, later to be released back into Soviet society. On arrival at Pechorlag Mochulsky saw the daily hardships the prisoners faced. Mochulsky’s memoir is packed with detail about his responsibilities in the Gulag system as he moved from one assignment to another. But what is striking about his story is how he presents himself as a problem-solver and how he was forced to work around the system in order to get results. For example, terrible working conditions and a lack of equipment often made completing prison tasks impossible. Mochulsky describes how on his arrival at the camp the prisoners did not have living quarters and it was already winter. Fearing that all the prisoners would perish, Mochulsky suspended their construction tasks and concentrated instead on building barracks. Mochulsky even admits to damaging ‘socialist property’ by converting old mining carts into stoves (35). Mochulsky managed to house the prisoners and complete the construction targets on time but he took big risks in doing so. If construction quotas had not been filled, Mochulsky may have been sent to prison himself.</p>
<p>Alongside the memoir’s ‘management’ perspective, there are also important snap-shots into the lives of the prisoners. Mochulsky describes murder in the camps and the treatment of female prisoners, but the most interesting issue is the unusual power relationship between the camp bosses and the prison gangs. Mochulsky faced great difficulty in getting some of the prisoners to do their work. This was particularly the case for the ‘hardened criminals’, who Mochulsky describes as being ‘totally acclimated to prison life’ (52). Mochulsky had to win these prisoners’ trust, offering them the chance to organize their work however they pleased, without interference, and promising that their food rations would be guaranteed. Allowing these hardened criminals a certain level of autonomy meant that the work was completed, to 150 percent of the norm (57). As such, Mochulsky’s memoir raises interesting issues about the true level of authority within the prison camps. Mochulsky was a young man, pressurized by orders from above to fulfil construction targets and facing arrest if he failed, but he had to cajole and bribe his prisoners into completing their work. Importantly, throughout the memoir Mochulsky sees himself as a negotiator, rather than a disciplinarian.</p>
<p>In the final chapter of the memoir Mochulsky poses a number of bigger questions from his experience of the Gulag, and notably, he finds it difficult to reconcile the suffering in the prison camps to the larger goal of building socialism. Mochulsky is conscious that the Stalinist regime hid the truth of the Gulag from ordinary people and that thousands were convicted for merely holding different political beliefs. He slowly understood that the Gulag was not a system of re-education, describing it instead as ‘barbarity’ (172). But at the same time Mochulsky felt that his role in the Gulag system was important; that building railway lines and meeting construction targets were crucial to the war effort. This tension between what Mochulsky saw as his duty and the painful reality of the Gulag runs throughout his memoir. This is perhaps what makes <italic>Gulag Boss</italic> such an important book. It brings us closer to understanding why and how someone like Mochulsky could be reconciled to working within such a repressive apparatus, in the light of his own sense of responsibility.</p>
