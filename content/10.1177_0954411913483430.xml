<abstract>
<p>This article presents the results of a finite element simulation on the occupant head response in an infantry vehicle under two separated loading conditions: (1) blunt impact and (2) blast loading conditions. A Hybrid-III dummy body integrated with a previously validated human head model was used as the surrogate. The biomechanical response of the head was studied in terms of head acceleration due to the impact by a projectile on the vehicle and intracranial pressure caused by blast wave. A series of parametric studies were conducted on the numerical model to analyze the effect of some key parameters, such as seat configuration, impact velocity, and boundary conditions. The simulation results indicate that a properly designed seat and internal surface of the infantry vehicle can play a vital role in reducing the risk of head injury in the current scenarios. Comparison of the kinematic responses under the blunt impact and blast loading conditions reveals that under the current loading conditions, the acceleration pulse in the blast scenario has much higher peak values and frequency than blunt impact case, which may reflect different head response characteristics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Increasing number of Warfighters suffering from impact- and blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been reported in recent military conflicts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913483430">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913483430">2</xref></sup> Such injury has caused a high rate of mortality and morbidity among the victims, and it is of current interest in both clinical and academic settings. The investigations into the TBI are either experimental or computational. Compared to experimental studies, properly conducted computational studies can save time, cost, and labor significantly in understanding of injury mechanisms and injury thresholds. A computational model enables researchers to study interaction of complex parameters, such as stress transfer, energy dissipation, and wave propagation, which are very difficult or not possible to measure experimentally.</p>
<p>Currently, most of the numerical head models available for TBI research are focused on direct impact by a projectile in the case of impact TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913483430">3</xref>

Such idealized studies disregarded the influence of environmental factors, such as buildings and vehicles. These environmental factors, however, are very common in the real battlefield and may have considerable effect on the response of Warfighters and the extent of injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913483430">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To overcome the limitation of neglecting environmental influence, effort has been made to develop finite element (FE) models to simulate the occupant head response in an infantry vehicle subjected to blunt impact and blast loading. A comparison was made between these two different loading scenarios, which have not been reported in the current literature. In this study, a human head model was integrated into a Hybrid-III crash dummy torso, which was placed in a simplified infantry vehicle model. The impact load was produced by a rigid projectile, and the blast wave was based on a planar pulse. Relatively low load levels were chosen in this study such that the energy released by the projectile or blast does not cause penetration damage on the vehicle but considerable head response can be observed. Modeling severe structural damage is beyond the scope of this study. Biomechanical responses, for example, the acceleration of the head and intracranial pressure (ICP) in the brain, were analyzed in detail. Since strain is very low in blast scenario, ICP is the widely accepted main response variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913483430">2</xref></sup> Considering previous publications that have shown that rotational acceleration was not the main culprit of elevated ICP, this study does not include this loading scenario. Based on this model, a series of parametric studies were conducted to discuss the effect of some key parameters, such as configurations of the seat arrangement, velocity of projectile, and the boundary conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0954411913483430">
<title>The numerical model</title>
<p>As mentioned above, two loading scenarios were considered separately in this study, namely, blunt and blast impacts, which are detailed in the following subsections. All the simulations were implemented using an explicit FE solver LS-DYNA 971 (LSTC, Livermore, CA, USA).</p>
<sec id="section3-0954411913483430">
<title>Blunt impact</title>
<p>In blunt impact loading conditions, effects of adding a foam cushion to the seat and changing the impact velocity of a rigid projectile in a simplified infantry vehicle model on the acceleration response of the occupant head were the main focus of this study. Hypermesh 10.0 (Altair, Irvine, CA, USA) was used as preprocessor to develop the FE mesh of a simplified infantry vehicle. The basic profile of the vehicle was kept and all internal structures were neglected since they have little influence on the overall response. A simple seat model was fixed to one side of infantry vehicle as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913483430">Figure 1</xref>. The dummy head complex was facing the positive <italic>x</italic>- (posterior to anterior), <italic>y</italic>- (to the left), and <italic>z</italic>- (inferior to superior) directions, respectively. A mass element was added on the center of gravity (CG) of the vehicle such that the total weight was 15 ton. A cylindrical projectile with a hemi-spherical end and the mass of approximately 10 kg was used to apply the blunt impact on left side of the simulated tank where the seat is located. The projectile has the length of 90 mm and the radius of 88 mm.</p>

</fig>
<p>The whole vehicle was modeled with 45,136 thin shell elements, and the armor was assumed to be made of a high-strength steel with an average thickness of 15 mm. Its material properties were described with MAT_99 (*MAT_SIMPLIFIED_JOHNSON_COOK_ORTHOTROPIC_DAMAGE) in LS-DYNA. Specific parameters are given as follows: Young’s modulus <italic>E</italic> of 207.0 GPa, density <italic>ρ</italic> of 7830 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, yield stress <italic>σ<sub>Y</sub>
</italic> of 1540 MPa, and a principal plastic strain at failure <italic>ε</italic>
<sub>f</sub> of 0.4. It should be noted that the lightweight infantry vehicle in this study is not designed to resist large-caliber armor piercing shells. It can only protect occupants against machine guns and shell fragments with lower speed.</p>
<p>Since one of the focuses in this study was to analyze the human brain/skull response, a human head model with skull and brain assembly is necessary. A previously validated human head FE model developed at Wayne State University (WSU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913483430">16</xref></sup> was integrated into a Hybrid-III dummy torso model and used as the human surrogate. The head model has dimensions of 198 mm in length, 140 mm in width, and 222 mm in height and the weight of 4.6 kg. It was modeled with 23,540 elements and consists of some vital components such as the skull, brain, dura maters, falx cerebri, tentorium, and a simplified jaw. The brain tissue was modeled as a viscoelastic material with the following properties:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913483430">17</xref></sup> short-term shear modulus G<sub>0</sub> = 10.8 kPa, long-term shear modulus G<sub>i</sub> = 3.1 kPa, and time decay coefficient β = 456. Bony materials were modeled as an elastic material with Young’s modulus <italic>E</italic> = 12 GPa.</p>
<p>The integration of human head with dummy neck was implemented by removing the dummy head and connecting the WSU head model onto the revolute joint on the neck, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913483430">Figure 2</xref>. The CG of the human head model was found and aligned to the location of the accelerometer mounted on the original dummy head model to measure head accelerations. After integration of the human head and dummy torso models, the dummy was placed over a simplified seat and constrained with a four-point seat belt. Less than a millimeter of clearance was given between dummy components and foam components to avoid initial penetration.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using this dummy/vehicle model, the following two series of parametric study were conducted.</p>
<sec id="section4-0954411913483430">
<title>Effect of foam layer on the seat</title>
<p>In this section, a plastic foam material with a thickness of 40 mm was placed on the seat as a protective structure to mitigate the kinetic energy transfer. Four different configurations are considered here, namely, (i) both seat back and seat pan are rigid, (ii) both seat back and seat pan are covered with foam, (iii) seat back is covered with foam while seat pan is rigid, and (iv) seat back is rigid while seat pan is covered with foam.</p>
<p>The foam layer was modeled with solid elements, and the material properties were described using MAT_63 (*MAT_CRUSHABLE_FOAM) card in LS-DYNA, which is frequently applied to model the behavior of energy absorbing cushions. Young’s modulus of the low density foam is 13 MPa, and the compressive strength is 0.4 MPa. This type of foam was designed to dissipate kinetic energy during plastic deformation. It has only slight deformation under the gravity of the dummy. The impact velocities of the projectile were identical in all the four cases and assumed to be 400 m/s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0954411913483430">
<title>Effect of impact velocity</title>
<p>Four initial velocities (100, 200, 300, and 400 m/s) were assigned to the projectile, and the resulting head acceleration responses due to these impact velocities were studied. In this study, the highest impact velocity (400 m/s) was carefully selected such that the vehicular wall could not be fully perforated by the projectile but considerable head acceleration could be generated. In the case of a full penetration, the deformation of the vehicle would be highly localized, and the injury of the occupant is mainly caused by flying fragments within the vehicular cabin. The aim of this study is to investigate the head response due to inertia loading produced by the blunt impact of projectile on the vehicular wall. The projectile had a fixed incident angle of 90° with the side wall of the vehicle, that is, it was perpendicular to the impact surface. In this section, both the seat back and seat pan were protected with foam layers.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0954411913483430">
<title>Blast impact</title>
<p>Shock wave reflection in the closed environment can cause more injuries than that in the open field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913483430">15</xref></sup> Therefore, a comparison study was conducted to investigate such effect using the FE models described previously. In order to reduce the computational time, the vehicle model was further simplified to include only the passenger compartment. The pressure load selected is relatively low (1.1 MPa) to simulate a shock wave large enough to produce considerable ICP without inducing large deformation or motion on the vehicle. This pressure level represents a 40 kg of TNT (trinitrotoluene) at a standoff distance of 4 m to the front surface of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The surrogate was facing to an opening through which blast wave is able to propagate. The opening was used to simulate a window, door, or gun port on the vehicle. An air domain containing the structures was modeled using solid elements with arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) formulation, through which the shock wave can transmit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913483430">18</xref></sup> The behavior of air was described using MAT_9 (*MAT_NULL) together with corresponding equation of state (EOS). A triangular shock wave (peak pressure: 1.1 MPa, duration 2.4 ms) was directly applied on the surface of the air domain facing to the opening of the vehicle to model a planar blast wave in far-field explosion. The interaction of shock wave and head was implemented using Lagrangian/ALE coupling algorithm, that is, *CONSTRAINED_LAGRANGE_IN_SOLID function in LS-DYNA, where the force between a solid node and a fluid node is calculated based on their distance and material stiffness. In this algorithm, the surrogate (Lagrangian part) was surrounded by the fixed air domain (Eulerian part) during the whole blast loading procedure. In other words, the solid and fluid elements coexisted in the same space. The fluid–solid interaction (FSI) parameters used in this study were consistent with those in the study by Zhu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913483430">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913483430">14</xref></sup> A parametric study was conducted on the number of coupling points (1, 2, and 3), and it has been revealed that the coupling points had little effect on the results. Therefore, to save computational cost, one coupling point was used. It is noted that simulation of blast wave propagation in the air requires modeling air domain with a large number of elements, and fluid/coupling algorithm is very time-consuming. Considering the limited computational capability, an air domain with relative coarse mesh was used. More importantly, it has been reported that the shock wave is nearly planar in the area close to the head in the loading scenario as selected, a relative coarse mesh should have no significant influence on the results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913483430">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Two boundary conditions were considered, namely, nonreflection and reflection, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913483430">Figure 3(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913483430">(b)</xref>, respectively. In both cases, a part of the side wall with a square port facing to the blast was modeled such that the incident pressure waves were identical. In the nonreflection case, the wall behind the dummy, roof, and floor were removed to eliminate their wave reflection effect. For reflection conditions, however, the wave reflection behavior at these surfaces was taken into account.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913483430">Figure 4</xref> illustrates typical high-speed impact events at a projectile velocity of 400 m/s. The projectile hits the infantry vehicle at 3 ms and then bounds back. The vehicle starts to move and the wall deforms. The kinetic energy is transmitted to the dummy through the seat and then causes the motion of the head. Typical acceleration–time histories of the head in three directions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411913483430">Figure 5</xref>. The impact velocity was 300 m/s, and both the seat back and seat pan were protected with foams.

<title>Blast impact</title>
<p>The ICP and motion of the head under two boundary conditions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411913483430">Figure 3</xref> are described in this section. A blast wave is characterized by a supersonic static shock wave followed by a blast wind. The shock wave can induce stress wave and shear wave in the brain then increase the magnitude of ICP. Blast wind, however, can cause the global motion of the head. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411913483430">Figure 8</xref> demonstrates the blast loading events in both boundary conditions. It can be seen that a planar wave hits the wall of the vehicle and then transmits into the vehicle through the opening. A spherical wave is generated at the interface at about 1.8 ms and then propagates and expands the volume in the vehicle. After the wave interacts with the head at 2.5 ms, it continues traveling. In the case of nonreflection boundary condition, the shock wave will be mitigated gradually in the air, while in the reflection case, the wave is reflected back at the surface of the back wall and then induces the secondary shock to the head.</p>

The peak ICP in the reflection case is higher than that of nonreflection case by 38%. Since the total pressure at a target is the combination of incident pressure and reflected pressures (caused by roof, back face, floor, and so on in the present case),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913483430">19</xref></sup> higher pressure is transmitted into the brain in the reflection case and then causes higher ICP. Therefore, it is suggested that the internal surface of a military vehicle should be protected with properly designed energy absorption materials. But the material properties, thickness, and shape of the foam claddings need to be determined carefully.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913483430">20</xref></sup>

In the nonreflection case, the head is pushed to move backward; while for reflection condition, due to the wave reflection of internal wall behind the dummy, the pressures in the opposite directions are in a state of relative equilibrium. Therefore, the head motion in the loading direction is not evident. However, because of the complex wave reflection behavior, the head has a left rotation with approximately 25°.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A comparative study was conducted on the blunt impact and blast loading conditions to reveal the difference in their kinematic responses. In both cases, the impulses per unit area transmitted into the brain CG (i.e. integration of ICP over time) were kept identical and equal to 0.32 Pa·s, which could be considered caused by a projectile at 300 m/s in the blunt impact scenario and an overpressure with the magnitude of 3 bar and duration of 0.7 ms in the blast scenario. In this study, the analyses were concentrated on the comparison of response–time histories in two different loading scenarios and the influence of the load–time wave form on the response–time curve. Since energy is not related to loading time duration, identical impulse was applied on both modes for comparison purpose. The seat was protected with foam layers in both loading scenarios, and reflection boundary conditions were used in the blast case. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954411913483430">Figure 12(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954411913483430">(b)</xref> illustrates the comparison of time histories of <italic>a<sub>x</sub>

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954411913483430">Figure 12(a)</xref>, it can be seen that the acceleration response under blast loading has a much higher frequency. The first pulse in the blasting case has a duration of 2 ms while that in the blunt impact case is 6.3 ms. For the acceleration in <italic>z</italic>-direction, the peak values in both loading conditions are much more similar, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954411913483430">Figure 12(b)</xref>. However, again, the pulse in the blunt impact has much longer duration than in the blast scenario.</p>

<p>There are some limitations in this study. The current computational analysis was semiquantitative with the emphasis on “trends”, rather than on actual values. Due to the lack of real-world experimental data, no comparison with testing results was conducted, and the head model was validated only at simple loading configurations. The focus of the analysis was placed on the biomechanical response without injury considered. The infantry vehicle model was highly simplified and only basic geometry was kept. The mechanical properties of the armor are unknown, and the material parameters taken from open literature were used. These issues can weaken the accuracy of the simulations. In addition, a wider range of loading levels will be studied in the future work when more real-world data become available.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>FE models have been developed to simulate the occupant head response in an infantry vehicle under blunt impact and blast loading conditions. The geometry of the vehicle was significantly simplified, and the material properties were taken from the literature. To study the biomechanical response in the brain, a validated human head model was integrated into a Hybrid-III dummy torso, which was seated in the simulated military vehicle. In the blunt impact loading condition, a projectile hits the vehicle and the response of the head was recorded. Parametric studies were conducted on the model to analyze some key parameters such as seat configuration and impact velocity on the acceleration response. It has been revealed that the foam layer on the seat back has a significant contribution in energy dissipation, and a large amount of kinetic energy of the projectile was absorbed by the vehicle structure, particularly at higher impact velocity. For blast impact, an air domain with ALE formulation was built to allow shock wave transmission. The planar shock wave can travel into the vehicle through an opening. If wave reflection at the internal surfaces is considered, a secondary shock on the head can induce higher ICP than in the nonreflection condition. Comparison of the kinematic responses under the blunt impact and blast loading conditions reveals that under the current loading conditions, the acceleration pulse in the blast scenario has much higher peak values and frequency than blunt impact case, which may reflect different head response characteristics.</p>
