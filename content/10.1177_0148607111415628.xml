<p><italic>Background</italic>: The authors investigated whether an insulin protocol for parenteral nutrition (PN)–induced hyperglycemia is superior to conventional management relying primarily on sliding-scale insulin at a large county hospital. <italic>Methods</italic>: A prospective cohort study with historical controls was completed. Adult patients receiving PN were managed with a protocol that determined insulin doses based on carbohydrate delivery and capillary blood glucose (CBG) if half or more of CBG measurements in the first 24 hours after initiation of PN exceeded 140 mg/dL. Control data were obtained from records of patients who met study eligibility criteria but had been managed before implementation of the insulin protocol. <italic>Results</italic>: Mean CBG after the start of insulin therapy was 138 ± 37 mg/dL for protocol patients and 159 ± 46 mg/dL for controls (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Proportion of CBG values in the target range of 80–140 mg/dL was 60% in the protocol group and 35% in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Hypoglycemia, defined as CBG &lt;80 mg/dL, occurred infrequently but more often in the protocol group (3% vs 1%, <italic>P</italic> = .012). There was no difference in total daily insulin between groups, although protocol patients received mostly scheduled insulin (93% total daily dose), whereas control patients received predominantly supplemental insulin (66% total daily dose). <italic>Conclusions</italic>: Protocol-directed management of PN-induced hyperglycemia is superior to ad hoc insulin dosing.

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>The finding that protocol-directed management of parenteral nutrition (PN)–induced hyperglycemia is clearly superior to management that frequently relies on supplemental or “sliding-scale” insulin suggests a clear alternative strategy to current practice. Glycemic control improved significantly within 24 hours of implementing the insulin protocol and remained significantly better than usual care for the duration of PN. Mean capillary blood glucose was below the threshold of 140 mg/dL, at which there is a significant association between PN-induced hyperglycemia and adverse clinical outcomes. Linking insulin dosing to carbohydrate delivery and substantially increasing scheduled insulin doses appear to be key factors as total daily insulin doses in the protocol and control arms of the study were equivalent.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hyperglycemia is a frequent and serious complication of parenteral nutrition (PN). Depending on the patient population, dextrose infusion rate, and definition of elevated blood glucose, hyperglycemia rates for patients receiving PN may approach 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111415628">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111415628">5</xref></sup> Insulin requirements for patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus are significantly increased during administration of PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111415628">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent studies have identified an association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes for patients receiving PN. Cheung and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111415628">7</xref></sup> found that elevated mean daily glucose level was associated with significantly increased risks of death, infection, sepsis, acute renal failure, and cardiac complications among 109 adult patients receiving PN on 122 occasions. The risk of any untoward effect was increased &gt;4-fold and risk of death &gt;10-fold in the highest quartile of blood glucose level. In a similar study of 464 patients and 498 treatment episodes of PN, Lin and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111415628">8</xref></sup> also found significant associations between hyperglycemia and adverse clinical outcomes, with increased odds ratios for death and other complications ranging from 2- to &gt;5-fold depending on quartile of mean daily glucose. Most recently, blood glucose &gt;180 mg/dL within 24 hours of PN was associated with increased risks of pneumonia, acute renal failure, and increased length of hospital stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111415628">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the predisposition to hyperglycemia during PN therapy and association with poor outcomes, there are few peer-reviewed reports of insulin dosing protocols to control PN-induced hyperglycemia, and none compare hyperglycemia control on protocol to alternative management approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111415628">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111415628">13</xref></sup> We evaluated whether a formal insulin protocol would lead to better glycemic control than current ad hoc attempts at PN-induced hyperglycemia management in a large county hospital.</p>

<title>Research Design and Methods</title>
<p>A prospective cohort study with historical controls was performed. The study was conducted at University Medical Center (UMC), the county hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada. The institutional review boards of UMC and the University of Nevada, Reno, approved the study. Most PN patients at UMC are managed by a service of appropriately trained clinical pharmacists and pharmacy residents. The PN service orders capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring for hyperglycemia at 6-hour intervals during the first 24 hours after initiation of PN (surveillance period). All adult patients age 18 years or older admitted to UMC from August through October 2009 and receiving PN were eligible for inclusion in the study if half or more of their CBG values during the surveillance period were &gt;140 mg/dL regardless of prior history of diabetes mellitus or glucocorticoid therapy. CBG &gt;140 mg/dL was chosen as the threshold for intervention consistent with the current definition of impaired glucose tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111415628">14</xref></sup> Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured in the first 24 hours after PN consultation to screen for occult type 2 diabetes mellitus and determine prehospital glycemic control in patients with known diabetes. Nutrient content of PN and infusion rates were left to the discretion of clinical pharmacists. Patients were excluded from the study if &gt;10% of daily carbohydrate was delivered through the alimentary tract.</p>
<p>Patients who met inclusion criteria were managed by study investigators using the insulin protocol shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111415628">Table 1</xref>. CBG was checked every 4 hours when patients were on protocol with a goal of keeping values 80–140 mg/dL. Insulin was started at an insulin/carbohydrate ratio (ICR) of 1 U/20 g carbohydrate (CHO) for hyperglycemic patients with no documented history of diabetes mellitus and a nondiagnostic hemoglobin A1c (15). If more than half of CBG values exceeded 140 mg/dL, ICR was advanced to 1 U/15 g CHO on day 2 of PN. Subsequent insulin adjustments were made as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111415628">Table 1</xref>. Prandial insulin was generally administered as two-thirds regular insulin (Novolin R; Novo Nordisk, Bagsværd, Denmark) in PN and one-third neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin (Novolin N; Novo Nordisk) in 4 equal subcutaneous doses at 6-hour intervals. Prandial insulin &lt;14 U/d was administered subcutaneously every 6 hours or 8 hours as 3 or 4 equal doses of NPH insulin.</p>

<p>Patients with a history of diabetes or receiving glucocorticoids but had initial CBG measurements &lt;200 mg/dL were started on prandial insulin (1 U/10 g CHO) and basal insulin as NPH insulin 0.15 U/kg/d in 4 doses administered at 6-hour intervals. Prandial insulin was administered two-thirds in PN and one-third as NPH insulin. For example, a 70-kg diabetes patient with initial CBG &lt;200 mg/dL receiving PN with 200 g CHO would be managed with 20 units prandial insulin divided into 14 units in the PN bag and 6 units as NPH insulin; an additional 10 units of NPH as basal insulin would be dosed for a total of 16 units NPH insulin administered 4 units every 6 hours. Diabetic and steroid-treated patients with CBG measurements &gt;200 mg/dL received initial prandial insulin as 1 U/5 g CHO and 0.25 U/kg/d NPH as basal insulin. Insulin adjustments for diabetes and steroid-treated patients with CBG measurements consistently out of target range are also summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111415628">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Daily records of CBG measurements and insulin doses were kept for each patient. Demographic data, including age, gender, prehospital diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, glucocorticoid treatment, primary reason for hospital admission, primary indication for PN, and admitting service, were also collected for all study patients. Protocol patients were compared to study eligible historical controls admitted to the UMC from March through May 2009 and managed by the PN service before the study protocol was implemented. Control patients were managed with UMC supplemental (sliding-scale) insulin protocols, regular insulin added to PN, or basal insulin (NPH insulin or insulin glargine), and CBG was generally checked at 6-hour intervals. Data for control patients were obtained by chart review. All demographic, clinical, blood glucose control, and insulin dosing data recorded for study patients were also obtained for control patients.</p>
<p>The primary end point of the study was the difference in mean CBG after the first day of PN (surveillance period) between protocol-managed and control patients. Secondary end points were the proportion of CBG values between 80 and 140 mg/dL in both groups, frequency of hypoglycemia (defined as CBG &lt;80 mg/dL), total daily insulin dose, and insulin dose distribution (prandial, basal, and supplemental).</p>
<p>The study was terminated at the end of the 3-month enrollment window (August–October 2009). Power calculation showed that a sufficient number of patients would be managed by protocol to detect a 20-mg/dL difference in mean CBG between the protocol and control groups at α (2-sided) = 0.05 with 80% power. Statistical analyses were performed using InStat Version 3.0 for Windows statistical software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California). Student 2-tailed <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction or the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means, and Fisher’s exact test was used to compare proportions, with <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 considered significant. Unless otherwise stated, all results are expressed as means ± standard deviations (SD).</p>

<p>The insulin protocol was used to manage 25 episodes of hyperglycemia in 22 patients receiving PN. The control group consisted of 26 patients managed for hyperglycemia during 30 episodes of PN administration. Patients in both groups were well matched across several categories, including age, gender, weight, proportion with known diabetes mellitus, proportion receiving glucocorticoids, admissions to intensive care units (ICUs), and number of days of PN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607111415628">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal surgery was the most common reason for PN in both groups (controls 42%, protocol 41%), although control patients were more likely to be admitted to the surgery service than protocol patients (58% vs 27%, <italic>P</italic> = .04). Despite the difference in admitting services between the 2 groups, there was no significant difference in hyperglycemia during the first 24 hours of PN before insulin therapy (controls = 166 ± 44 mg/dl, protocol = 179 ± 59 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = .18). No difference in HbA1c between patients with a prehospital diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and patients without a diagnosis (6.4% ± 2.1% vs 5.6% ± 0.8%, <italic>P</italic> = .38) was observed. Three patients without a prehospital diagnosis of type 2 diabetes qualified for the diagnosis based on new HbA1c diagnostic criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111415628">15</xref></sup> No HbA1c data were available for control patients.</p>
<p>Glycemic control was significantly better for protocol-managed patients than for historical controls. The insulin protocol’s impact on blood glucose control is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607111415628">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111415628">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607111415628">2</xref>. Mean CBG for the protocol group was 21 mg/dL lower than for the control group, a highly and statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Protocol patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or receiving glucocorticoids had a higher mean CBG than did protocol patients with neither diabetes nor glucocorticoid treatment (144 ± 45 mg/dL vs 132 ± 23 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = .0002) but still had better glycemic control than the entire control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Although the number of ICU patients in the study was small, blood glucose control for noncritical care and ICU patients in the protocol arm was essentially the same (137 ± 36 mg/dL vs 141 ± 41 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = .32). Glycemic control improved significantly on the first day of protocol-directed management and remained superior to nonprotocol care (primarily sliding-scale insulin) throughout the course of PN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111415628">Figure 1</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607111415628">Figure 2</xref>, protocol-managed patients had a significantly higher proportion of CBG measurements in the target range of 80–140 mg/dL (60%) than did control patients (35%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001 for comparison). Hypoglycemia was infrequent in both patient groups but occurred more often among protocol patients than control patients (3% vs 1%, <italic>P</italic> = .012).

However, the manner in which insulin was dosed differed significantly between the 2 groups. Scheduled (prandial and basal) insulin accounted for the vast majority (93%) of daily insulin among protocol-managed patients, whereas supplemental insulin was the prevalent mode of insulin dosing among control patients (66%), consistent with a high reliance on sliding-scale insulin regimens in the control group. Most scheduled insulin for protocol patients was prandial insulin (71% total daily insulin). Mean ICR was 0.16 ± 0.09 U/g CHO for protocol patients with type 2 diabetes or receiving steroids and 0.07 ± 0.01 U/g CHO for nondiabetic patients who did not receive glucocorticoids. Total daily insulin referenced for weight was predictably much higher for protocol patients with type 2 diabetes or on steroids (0.7 ± 0.3 U/kg/d) than for patients managed for PN-induced hyperglycemia alone (0.3 ± 0.2 U/kg/d).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the past 20 years, multiple studies have demonstrated that protocol-directed management of hyperglycemia significantly improves blood glucose control in both critical care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111415628">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111415628">19</xref></sup> and non–critical care settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111415628">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111415628">21</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to specifically compare an insulin dosing protocol to typical current practice for patients receiving PN. Consistent with other studies of protocol-guided insulin dosing, this protocol significantly improved glycemic control as measured by overall mean CBG, daily mean CBG, and proportion of CBG measurements in the target range of 80–140 mg/dL compared to ad hoc management that relied heavily on sliding-scale insulin.</p>
<p>The protocol in this study compares favorably to others previously published in the peer-reviewed literature. The protocol described by Hongsermeier and Bistrian<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111415628">10</xref></sup> is applicable only to diabetic patients managed with insulin prior to hospital admission. Sajbel and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111415628">11</xref></sup> present an approach using an insulin infusion as the initial insulin dose-finding strategy that may not be practical or permissible outside intensive care or step-down units. Converting patients from regular insulin in PN or therapy with NPH insulin to daily insulin glargine after the initial 3 days of treatment in a mixed population of patients receiving enteral nutrition (EN) or PN yielded CBG approximately 140–150 mg/dL 7 days after the transition to daily glargine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111415628">12</xref></sup> However, our protocol achieved this degree of glycemic control within 24 hours (153 ± 35 mg/dL), and giving all insulin as glargine could predispose to hypoglycemia if PN was interrupted. A protocol employed at the University of Vermont was presented at the 2006 American College of Endocrinology/American Diabetes Association (ADA) Inpatient Diabetes and Glycemic Control Consensus Conference without outcomes data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111415628">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results of this study are likely to be valid indicators of the value of protocol-directed insulin management for controlling PN-induced hyperglycemia. Protocol and control patients were well matched across all important categories of comparison. Historical controls were chosen to facilitate study completion in a timely manner and prevent implementation of the protocol by the PN service or other physicians during the period of study. Although more control than protocol patients were admitted to the surgery service, PN was managed exclusively by UMC clinical pharmacists in both patient groups, and there was no difference in the initial degree of hyperglycemia between control and protocol patients. Global mean CBG, daily mean CBG, and the majority of CBG measurements were below the threshold of 140 mg/dL at which risks for complications of PN-induced hyperglycemia become significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111415628">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study protocol uses prandial and basal insulin to prevent unacceptable hyperglycemia, with dosing guidelines based on other studies and the first author’s experiences managing patients receiving PN. Although total daily insulin doses were the same for protocol and control patients, linking insulin closely to carbohydrate delivery instead of using supplemental insulin to react to hyperglycemia likely accounts for superior glycemic control by the insulin protocol. However, one of the limitations of this study is that it was not designed to determine potential mechanisms of improved blood glucose control.</p>
<p>The small number of patients and short study duration make it impossible to assess the impact of improved glycemic control on patient outcomes. The protocol was implemented by a second-year internal medicine resident physician (NN) under the supervision of an endocrinologist (MGJ). Another study is required to confirm that the protocol can be implemented appropriately by other physicians, midlevel providers, or clinical pharmacists and without endocrinologist oversight. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or receiving glucocorticoids generally achieved good glycemic control, but the protocol performed slightly better for patients without steroid therapy or diabetes. No patients with type 1 diabetes were managed in this study, although type 1 diabetes was not an exclusion criterion in this study. Finally, although hypoglycemia rates were low in both the protocol and control groups, the rate of hypoglycemia was 3-fold higher (3% vs 1%) for protocol-managed patients. However, no severe hypoglycemia occurred, and the hypoglycemia rate for this protocol is much lower than for intensive insulin protocols in the ICU setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111415628">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111415628">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111415628">23</xref></sup> Hypoglycemia should be minimized, although iatrogenic hypoglycemia may not pose the same clinical risk as spontaneous hypoglycemia. For example, iatrogenic hypoglycemia during insulin therapy was not associated with increased mortality risk in a large cohort of patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607111415628">24</xref></sup> This study was not designed to assess clinical outcomes, and the significance of the higher hypoglycemia rate for PN patients remains uncertain.</p>
<p>In summary, this study demonstrates that protocol-directed insulin dosing closely linking insulin to carbohydrate leads to better control of PN-induced hyperglycemia than ad hoc insulin dosing strategies that rely heavily on supplemental insulin. There was a nearly 2-fold increase in target CBG measurements for protocol-managed patients compared to controls. A longer study enrolling a larger number of patients will help clarify the applicability of this protocol in wider hospital practice and the impacts of improved glycemic control on clinical outcomes.</p>
