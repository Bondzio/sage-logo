            <p>An efficient review depends not only on timely approval but also on ensuring the quality of the process from construction of the dossier to the ultimate regulatory decision. Two scorecards were developed through a process of conceptualization, item generation, and reduction, as well as psychometric testing, for regulatory authorities to provide feedback to companies on the quality of their submissions while companies report to authorities on the quality of their review. The scorecards included more than 50 items grouped into 7 domains, including application format, content of the dossier, labeling, scientific advice, conduct of the review, communication, and overall assessment. The scorecards were then tested by 3 major regulatory authorities (Health Canada, Swissmedic, and Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australia) and 4 international pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer). The study participants responded openly to requests for ratings on the quality of performance by the other parties based on retrospective reviews. The data gave insights into different perceptions of quality in relation to submitted data and their respective review procedures. The findings showed the value and applicability of the proposed scorecards.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>During the past decade, major regulatory authorities and pharmaceutical companies have invested considerable time and resources into initiatives to continually improve their approval processes, including quality indicators.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427694">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427694">2</xref>
            </sup> Thus, the aim is for highly efficient and effective regulatory review to ensure that medicinal products are available to patients in a timely manner and companies are able to gain market access for their product sooner. However, time and speed of the review are only one aspect in measuring regulatory performance.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511427694">3</xref>
            </sup> The quality of the process from the construction of the submitted dossier to the ultimate regulatory decision must also be considered and monitored.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427694">2</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Despite the considerable number of analytical and comparative studies on regulatory performance, there has been limited research to date on the quality of the dossier submissions and the quality of their regulatory review.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511427694">4</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511427694"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511427694">6</xref>
            </sup> Such an environment therefore provided the impetus for the development of a standardized and universal tool for the systematic measurement of the quality of submissions and reviews, as well as the quality of the decision-making process.</p>
         <p>The aims of the study were to develop regulatory (ie, companies to assess the quality of review [RRQ-SC]) and industry (ie, regulatory authorities to assess the quality of submission [RSQ-SC]) scorecards and to examine the measurement properties (ie, applicability, practicality, acceptability, validity) of the 2 scorecards in accurately reflecting what they were intended to measure.</p>

               <title>Phase 1: Conceptualization</title>
               <p>Ideas were sought on the conceptual model through discussions with experts working in the pharmaceutical industry and with regulatory authorities. A bibliography review was also carried out to identify the scope and range of the content of the target construct, as well as to determine issues that can be taken into consideration in the development of the scorecards.<sup>

               <title>Phase 2: Item Generation</title>
               <p>Relevant literature was reviewed on good regulatory review practices, submission management, and good practices that are undertaken by companies when assembling a dossier. A literature search was also conducted to identify publications that focus on the degree of partnership and communication between the authority and the applicant throughout the regulatory review process.</p>
               <p>Therefore, an initial pool of items was identified based on the literature review and the input of the experts. The experts were recruited from the major pharmaceutical companies and well-established authorities. They ensured that an adequate sample of items was generated for each content area of the 2 scorecards and that all the potential items for inclusion in the scorecards were considered. Furthermore, the experts assessed each item in terms of its importance to measure the quality of the regulatory review and the dossier application. In a syndicate discussion with the participation of experts, the items were further discussed and resolved as appropriate in cases of overlap or inadequate coverage.</p>

               <title>Phase 3: Item Reduction and Developmental Version of the Scorecards</title>
               <p>An initial qualitative reduction of the identified items was carried out, where items considered inappropriate or ambiguous or duplicates were made redundant or merged with items measuring the same construct. A number of the remaining items were slightly rephrased or modified as statements suitable for the initial scorecard versions. The experts were also consulted during this stage to ensure that the scorecards provide a valid representation of the criterion to be measured. The acceptability, applicability, practicality, and validity of the RSQ-SC and RRQ-SC scorecards were then assessed through a pilot study.</p>

            <title>Testing of the Scorecards</title>
            <p>The pilot study included the participation of 3 well-established regulatory authorities (Health Canada, Swissmedic, and Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australia) and 4 major pharmaceutical companies (AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer). The selected products included in the study were the same 4 new active substances submitted by the companies to the 3 authorities between 2002 and 2004. All the products were reviewed and approved by the 3 authorities so that a cross-comparison of results with respect to the quality of the submissions and the quality of the review process could be made.</p>
            <p>A structured follow-up questionnaire was sent to the study participants to assess the scorecards’ feasibility, layout, and wording. The follow-up questionnaire included specific questions on whether the items included in the various sections of the scorecards were relevant, clear, and unambiguous, as well as sufficiently covered the critical factors that affect the quality of the dossier and the review. Through this questionnaire, the participants were also given the opportunity to indicate other areas that they felt needed to be addressed in the scorecards.</p>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>Based on feedback from the experts, modified pools of 58 items for the RSQ-SC scorecard and 49 items for the RRQ-SC scorecard were developed. This then led to the construction of the initial versions of the RSQ-SC and RRQ-SC scorecards.</p>
         <p>The details of the methodology were covered in a study protocol and were agreed upon by all the participants. Data regarding individual recipients were coded and aggregated for confidentiality reasons. All 4 participating companies returned the 12 completed scorecards on reviews carried out by the 3 authorities. Two authorities completed the scorecards (8 in total) on the dossier applications submitted by the same 4 companies. The third authority, because of its ongoing reorganization, was unable to complete the scorecards, but it provided feedback on the different sections of the scorecard.</p>

               <title>Item Generation</title>
               <p>Based on the literature review and input of the experts described in the Methods section, an initial pool of 65 items for the scorecard on the pharmaceutical industry (RSQ-SC) and another pool of 58 items for the scorecard on the regulatory authorities (RRQ-SC) were identified.</p>

            <sec id="section11-0092861511427694">
               <title>Item Reduction</title>
               <p>During the item reduction phase, the 65-item RSQ-SC scorecard was reduced to 58. Twenty-two of the items from the initial pool were reworded. Seven other items were modified (eg, the item “the extent to which the summaries are linked to the supporting data” was changed to “the extent to which the summaries and overviews are linked to the other part of the dossier”). Furthermore, 7 items were made redundant, whereas 29 items remained unchanged.</p>
               <p>For the RRQ-SC scorecard, a modified pool of 49 items was developed. Eighteen of these items were reworded, whereas 3 were modified and 1 was split into 2 items. In addition, another 10 items were excluded, whereas 26 items remained unchanged.</p>
               <p>Following the item reduction phase, initial versions of the scorecards were developed. The 58 RSQ-SC scorecard items were grouped into 7 descriptive domains—namely, (1) application details, (2) overall assessment, (3) presentation of the dossier, (4) dossier and content, (5) communication, (6) labeling, and (7) general comments. Similarly, the RRQ-SC scorecard items covered 6 domains, including (1) general information, (2) overall assessment, (3) scientific advice, (4) conduct of the review, (5) communication, and (6) general comments.</p>

               <title>Developmental Version of the Scorecards</title>
               <p>The development of the initial versions of the scorecards involved synthesizing the respective items, and due attention was given to ensure that questions were easy to understand and interpret, clear, nonjudgmental, and unbiased. Abbreviations and nonconventional nomenclatures were also avoided.</p>
               <p>The scaling of the 2 scorecards was carried out for the majority of their items in a manner to allow within- and between-authorities and -companies comparisons. A 5-point scale was chosen as it provides precision but at the same time is practical and allows a degree of spontaneity. The response options for ranking the respondents’ level of satisfaction were as follows: 1 = unsatisfactory, 2 = poor, 3 = satisfactory, 4 = good, and 5 = excellent. The option of responding either “not known” in cases for which the required information was not available or “not applicable” when the questions were not relevant to the particular case in question was also provided.</p>

            <sec id="section13-0092861511427694">
               <title>Content Validity</title>
               <p>The initial versions of the scorecards were then evaluated for their content validity (whether the scorecards have the right focus and emphasis for the intended purpose) by a panel of experts using 5 established criteria—namely, language clarity, completeness, relevance, and scaling. A total of 10 amendments were made to the scorecards to reflect the suggestions made by the experts. Twelve items that were not fully relevant were removed to reduce the length of the scorecards. Furthermore, 7 items were reworded and modified to make the items clearer, as well as to eliminate ambiguity, whereas 3 items were merged.</p>
               <p>Due attention was also given to the style and layout of the scorecards. All the items were numbered and organized in a logical sequence based on their content. Clear instructions were also provided on how to complete the scorecard. In addition, at the beginning of each section, the purpose of the questions being asked was highlighted to further assist the respondent when responding to the items. Moreover, a detailed glossary providing definitions was inserted at the end of the scorecards, with the aim of minimizing the risk that respondents may misunderstand or misinterpret the items.

               <p>Both authorities were of the opinion that the dossier applications selected for the study were of a good quality with respect to the format, presentation and flow, ease of navigation, and clarity of language used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427694">Figure 4a</xref>, performance indicators PI 1 to PI 6). The majority of ratings were “good,” and there were also a number of “excellent” ratings. Lower ratings (“satisfactory”/“poor”) were given for the level of completeness of the data set in the dossier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427694">Figure 4a</xref>, PI 7). Such findings highlight the importance of the scorecards in demonstrating areas of company performance that can be improved. These specific data can then be used by companies to improve their processes for future submissions, thus ensuring quality submissions.</p>
               <p>The authorities were satisfied with the overall quality of the summaries and overviews, as well as with the technical content of the dossier. They were also asked more specific questions on the quality of the content of dossier applications. A broad range of ratings were given for the extent to which overviews reflected supporting data, with the larger number of scores being “good”/“satisfactory” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427694">Figure 4a</xref>, PI 14 to PI 16). The same trend was noted for ratings given for the extent to which summaries and overviews were linked to other parts of the dossier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427694">Figure 4a</xref>, PI 17 to PI 19). With respect to whether major issues were addressed and highlighted in the dossier applications to assist the review, an equal number of “good” and “satisfactory” ratings were provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427694">Figure 4a</xref>, PI 20 to PI 22).</p>
               <p>On the extent to which the data supported the proposed label for the 3 sections (CMC [chemistry, manufacturing, and controls], nonclinical, and clinical), the applications were mostly rated as “satisfactory,” with few ratings in the higher scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0092861511427694">Figure 4b</xref>, PI 32 to PI 34). For PI 35 to PI 37, on the completeness of the technical data (for the 3 parts of the selected dossiers), both authorities identified the applications of compounds 2 and 4 that were of a better standard. This demonstrates the value of the scorecards in allowing interesting cross-comparisons to be made between the various applications and identifying the high performers. With respect to PI 38, on the appropriateness of the analyses performed to identify safety signals, compound 4 stood out from the other applications as it received “excellent” ratings from both authorities.</p>
               <p>The authorities’ perceptions were also sought on the applicants’ accessibility, professionalism, and openness. The results showed that the 2 authorities were satisfied with the quality of communication (PI 40) and ease of contacting the companies (PI 41). However, lower overall ratings were reported on the quality of companies’ responses to the questions raised by the authorities (PI 43).</p>
               <p>Additional insights were provided on the quality of dossiers through feedback from the 2 authorities by asking 2 open-ended questions on the critical areas in which the selected dossiers excelled and areas in which improvements could be made (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861511427694">Table 1</xref>).</p>

               <p>The companies gave relatively high scores for consistency of the authorities in following their own guidelines and procedures. The ratings were mostly “good,” with 1 “excellent” score being given. However, there were also 2 “poor” ratings because of concerns of the companies with respect to established procedural timelines not being met and differences in opinion in interpretation of legislation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0092861511427694">Figure 5</xref>, PI 1).</p>
               <p>With respect to the authorities’ consistency in keeping in line with previous precedents, as well as for consistency between the different divisions of the authority, mixed ratings were provided (PI 2 and PI 3). Detailed justifications were provided by companies for the “poor” ratings given such as failure to adhere to an established practice and conflicting decisions being communicated to the applicant from different divisions of an authority for the same dossier application.</p>
               <p>The companies also assessed the required knowledge and experience of the authorities in reviewing the selected dossiers (PI 4). As expected, the majority of ratings were “good,” demonstrating that participating companies considered the authorities to have sufficient knowledge and experience. With respect to the overall quality of communication, most of the ratings were “good,” indicating the companies’ satisfaction with the standard of communication (PI 15). Furthermore, the responses showed that the companies were content with availability of staff (PI 16) and their professionalism, with the ratings given being either “good” or “excellent” (PI 17).</p>
               <p>The degree of transparency (PI 19) for selected reviews was rated as “good” (6 reviews), “satisfactory” (4), and “poor” (2). It was also observed that increased transparency led to quicker resolution of issues, as well as a final label being agreed upon sooner than normal.</p>

               <p>The companies indicated that they were satisfied when there was a timely and efficient review (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861511427694">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, the companies expected the authorities to be consistent in their review and to have an extensive understanding of the therapeutic area of the product being reviewed. Flexibility of the review process with acceptance of additional data is also an area in which the companies attached importance. The openness of staff, as well as having an adequate number of meetings with authorities, was also highlighted by the companies as being essential to ensure quality reviews.</p>

               <title>Applicability and Practicality of the Scorecards</title>
               <p>Applicability and practicality were assessed through the follow-up questionnaire that was sent to the study participants after they completed the scorecards. The majority of respondents agreed that the scorecards covered all critical factors that affect the quality of the dossier and the review. Furthermore, participants found the questions in the scorecards to be clear and unambiguous. These findings demonstrate the practicality and acceptability of the scorecards by industry and regulatory authorities, as well as their applicability and relevance in measuring quality of the submissions and reviews.</p>
               <p>Based on feedback received from participants through the follow-up questionnaire and from lessons learned following the pilot study, a number of improvements were made to the developmental scorecards. One of the major amendments made was the inclusion of clear, specific, and detailed definitions for each rating. These were drawn up for each area of performance covered in the scorecards.</p>
               <p>Another issue that was carefully evaluated following the pilot study was the modification or removal of certain questions that were insufficiently clear, leading to incomplete responses. This was noted in a specific question on the detail provided in the dossier where respondents were unable to complete the question as it was not fully understood. The revised scorecard addressed this shortcoming by including a clearer statement. The value of piloting the scorecards was that it also identified other performance indicators that were not included in the initial study. For example, participants suggested the addition of an area to measure “whether review timeline targets were met.” In addition, the piloting revealed areas that were adequately covered in one scorecard but not in the other. This discrepancy was rectified in the revised scorecards to allow cross-comparisons. Another important outcome of the piloting was the decision that it would be more effective if the question on the overall quality of the review process and the quality of the dossier were placed at the end of the scorecards after companies and authorities have rated and commented on all other sections. This would allow a more accurate reflection of overall quality of the review and the quality of the dossier built on the ratings of each subsection. As a result, a more robust instrument was developed for use by pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The developed scorecard system is an advancement in this field in that aspects of regulatory performance in terms of the quality of the submissions and their review can be systematically assessed through data provided by the regulatory authorities and companies. These scorecards provide a unique and universal model to facilitate feedback at the end of each review.</p>
         <p>Other initiatives have been carried out to assess the quality of the dossiers and their review. However, these initiatives are specific in scope and address the performance of the European centralized procedure and dossier applications submitted through this process.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861511427694">8</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861511427694"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511427694">10</xref>
            </sup> Furthermore, companies at an individual level also undertake strategies to ensure that the dossier is well assembled before submission.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861511427694">11</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861511427694"/>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861511427694"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861511427694">14</xref>
            </sup> The scorecards, however, differ from these exercises in that they can be completed by personnel working within different regulatory processes and procedures. The terminology used and core questions are common across regions while allowing regionally specific data to be completed. In addition, cross-comparisons can be made between the different regulatory authorities and companies.</p>
         <p>The findings indicate how successfully the scorecards could be applied to identify major factors that affect the review process. Moreover, the information is of direct benefit to companies as it highlights, from the regulatory authorities’ point of view, key elements that are essential for ensuring quality of the dossier and hence facilitating the quality of the review.</p>
         <p>The scorecard system was designed on the basis of best practice for industry and good review practice for regulatory authorities using a methodology based on a literature review and the input of experts. This led to the development of 2 robust scorecards (ie, RSQ-SC and RRQ-SC) that were well accepted by participating companies, and regulatory authorities demonstrated their positive reactions to the pilot study and high response rate.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092861511427694">15</xref>
            </sup> The companies and authorities responded openly and without reservations to the scorecards and provided honest and transparent commentary on the quality of the performance of the other parties. Furthermore, the fact that a great majority of the participants completed all parts of the questions indicates the applicability and relevance of the scorecards to assess the performance of companies and authorities. Overall, the outcome of the pilot study confirmed that the approach used was appropriate and practical, encouraging participants to take part in the study. In addition, the instructions and questions in the scorecards were considered by study participants to be clear and well understood. The use of a detailed study protocol with a comprehensive glossary facilitated this process.</p>
         <p>The findings of the pilot study also supported the validity of the scorecards and showed that they comprehensively measure the participants’ satisfaction in the various areas of the regulatory review process. Insights were also provided by the companies on the positive outcomes of the review, such as timely and efficient reviews, open and comprehensive communication throughout the review process, and the carrying out of consistent and thorough assessments. The areas in which the companies had concerns and felt that improvements could be made included agreement with respect to recommendations from other key regulators, increased number of meetings, and reasonable estimates of target date on completion of assessment.</p>
         <p>Similarly, feedback on the companies’ submissions was also provided by the regulatory authorities, with areas in which the dossiers excelled being the organization and presentation of the dossier, as well as the documents complying with regulatory guidelines at the time of submission. Other positive outcomes included well-designed and supported as well as well-written summaries that facilitated the review of the dossier. The areas that the authorities felt needed to be addressed and are of importance to ensure high-quality submissions included incomplete submission of the dossier due to lack of missing data, studies not being submitted in full, and late submission of data. The omission of negative studies and inadequate data were other issues raised by the authorities.</p>
         <p>This study has led to the development of the final versions of the scorecards. One of the major improvements made to the scorecards during the application phase was the inclusion of definitions for each rating response option. The definitions were specific to individual areas addressed in the scorecards. This was to ensure greater consistency in the responses provided and to mitigate any personal bias.</p>
         <p>The findings show that the systematic use of the scorecards can provide a structured and detailed feedback provided by industry and regulatory authorities that could enable the regulatory process to be optimized. Furthermore, use of the scorecards would encourage effective working relationships between industry and authorities by providing a means for open exchange of views, as well as enhancing dialogue. It is hoped that the scorecards gain wider acceptability by the industry at large and regulatory authorities and will become “standard practice.”</p>
