<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Primary aldosteronism is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, suppressed plasma renin activity and autonomous aldosterone production. Unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism are the two common subtypes of primary aldosteronism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312454765">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312454765"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312454765"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312454765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312454765">5</xref></sup> The importance of this distinction cannot be overstated because the former is curable surgically whereas the latter is managed medically. Adrenal venous sampling remains the diagnostic gold standard for identifying the surgically curable form of primary aldosteronism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312454765">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312454765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312454765">8</xref></sup> With regard to selectivity, selective catheterization can be consistently achieved on the left side, whereas on the right side the success rate is lower, even in experienced hands, because of variable anatomy. The right adrenal vein usually enters the inferior vena cava (IVC) directly at a variable angle and sometimes forms a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein before entering the IVC. In less experienced hands, the small size and variable location of the orifice also appear to be associated with a poor success rate. A more rigorous definition of normal variation in the location of the right adrenal vein, based on easily recognized anatomic landmarks with analysis of factors that might contribute to this variation, may provide a higher success rate of adrenal venous sampling especially in less experienced hands. In this study, we describe the spectrum of the location of right adrenal vein, and identify the relationship of location to body mass index in patients with primary aldosteronism.</p>

<sec id="section6-1470320312454765">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>The study population consisted of 95 patients with primary aldosteronism who underwent adrenal venous sampling in our institution. Primary aldosteronism was confirmed with captopril challenge test, furosemide plus upright test and/or salt loading test. After written informed consent was obtained, adrenal venous sampling was performed to determine whether autonomous production of aldosterone was unilateral or bilateral. Height and weight were measured, and body mass index was calculated at the time of admission. Patients with a right adrenal vein which entered the IVC directly or shared a common orifice with an accessory hepatic vein were included, and patients with a right adrenal vein which formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein before entering the IVC were excluded in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320312454765">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320312454765">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-1470320312454765">
<title>Adrenal venous sampling</title>
<p>Adrenal venous sampling was carried out between 9:00 am and 12:00 pm, to minimize effects attributed to circadian variations of cortisol and aldosterone, and after a three-hour rest in the spine position. The procedure was performed through the right femoral vein. The position of the catheter tip was verified by gentle injection of a small amount of nonionic contrast medium, and anterior and lateral views of adrenal venogram were obtained at expiration. Blood was obtained from both adrenal veins and the IVC below the level of the renal veins; the concentrations of aldosterone and cortisol were then measured. The procedure was considered successful if the plasma level of cortisol in the adrenal vein was more than five times higher than that in the IVC.</p>

<sec id="section8-1470320312454765">
<title>Location of the orifice of right adrenal vein during adrenal venous sampling</title>
<p>On the basis of the anterior view of the right adrenal venogram, the cranio-caudal level of the orifice of right adrenal vein was determined relative to vertebral bodies and disks. Vertebral bodies were divided into two segments: upper segment and lower segment. Patients were divided into six groups according to the level of the orifice of the right adrenal vein as follows: Group A; at the level of the lower segment of T11 or above it, Group B; at the level between T11 and T12, Group C; at the level of the upper segment of T12, Group D; at the level of the lower segment of T12, Group; E; at the level between T12 and L1, Group F; at the level of the upper segment L1 or below it.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that the orifice of the right adrenal vein was usually located at a level ranging from the upper segment of T11 to the upper segment of L1, and that its angiographic location was related to body mass index in patients with primary aldosteronism.</p>
<p>Historically, primary aldosteronism was thought to represent less than 1% of hypertensive patients but recent studies suggest that the true incidence is closer 5–10% with two large prospective studies reporting an incidence as high as 11.2% and 14.4% of hypertensive patients respectively. Up to 4.8% of all hypertensive patients may be curable surgically, and as many as 62.5% of patients with primary aldosteronism have a resectable adenoma. There has been resurgence of interest in adrenal venous sampling which is the most reliable method for identifying the surgically curable form of primary aldosteronism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312454765">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312454765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312454765">8</xref></sup> However, adrenal venous sampling is not a technically easy procedure. The reason for abandoning the procedure is the failure to obtain samples from the right adrenal vein in up to 30% of patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312454765">2</xref></sup> as well as the occasional occurrence of painful extravasation. Detailed analysis of the anatomy of the right adrenal vein may provide a higher success rate for this procedure.</p>
<p>The adrenal glands receive arterial blood from multiple sources but the anatomy of the adrenal vein is more constant. The right adrenal vein arises from the anterior margin of the gland just below the apex and courses to the posterolateral aspect of the IVC. In this study, we demonstrated that the orifice of the right adrenal vein was usually located at a level ranging from the upper segment of T11 to the upper segment of L1. These findings were in agreement with those of previous angiographic studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320312454765">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320312454765">12</xref></sup> High-quality computed tomography examination is of enormous benefit in planning adrenal venous sampling. On a multisection scanner with reconstruction at 2 or 3 mm, the right adrenal vein can be identified in more than 50% of patients. In a retrospective review of 104 patients with thoracoabdominal vascular disease, Matsuura et al. also recently showed similar findings by using multidetector computed tomography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320312454765">13</xref></sup> However, there has been no report assessing factors that might contribute to this variation. In this study, we found that the orifice of the right adrenal vein tended to be higher with greater body mass index. The prediction of the location of the orifice of the right adrenal vein before adrenal venous sampling based on this consideration, may provide a more speedy and precise procedure with a higher success rate, especially for less experienced hands. In this study, there was no significant difference in age or gender between the six groups suggesting that these factors did not contribute to this variation. Our findings might be supported by the results of previous studies assessing the height of the diaphragm in the chest radiograph.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320312454765">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312454765">15</xref></sup> In a prospective review of subjects with normal pulmonary function, Suwatanapongched et al. previously showed that the diaphragm tended to be lower with higher age, lower weight, and smaller transverse and anteroposterior thoracic dimensions on chest radiograph.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312454765">15</xref></sup> Given two individuals of the same height who have approximately the same predicted total lung capacity, the diaphragm would be expected to be lower in the individual with a lower weight and a narrower thoracic dimension in order to accommodate the same lung volume. Differences in intra-abdominal pressure or abdominal distensibility due to fat deposition might also affect the level of diaphragm. The level of the right adrenal vein would be largely dependent on the level of diaphragm.</p>
<p>There are some limitations in this study. First, respiratory disorder such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema is associated with a low level of the diaphragm. However, a pulmonary function test was not performed in this study. It was noteworthy that all patients had no clinical symptoms of such respiratory disorders. Second, patients with the right adrenal vein which formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein before entering the IVC were excluded. Finally, an adrenal venogram was obtained only at expiration. We confirmed that the difference in the level of its orifice between inspiration and expiration was approximately one-half of a vertebral body in three patients, but did not confirm in the other 92 patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the location of the orifice of the right adrenal vein was largely related to body mass index in patients with primary aldosteronism. The prediction of the location of the orifice of the right adrenal vein before adrenal venous sampling based on this consideration may provide a more speedy and precise procedure with a higher success rate, especially for less experienced hands.</p>
