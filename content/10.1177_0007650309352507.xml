<abstract>
<p>The authors apply marginalization theory to develop a model of boycotts that incorporates both individual motives and corporate strategic issues. Overall, their analysis of more than 25,000 individual evaluations of 59 companies suggests that members of marginalized groups are more likely to boycott. Individuals are less likely to boycott companies about which they are knowledgeable and more likely to boycott companies that are organized boycott targets. In addition, the authors find systematic differences in the types of boycotts associated with strategic issues that are supported by members of marginalized groups. Overall, boycott supporters tend to be upwardly mobile members of marginalized groups.</p>

<p>The stakeholder management literature advises corporate executives to attend to the demands of those stakeholders on whom their firms most depend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0007650309352507">Frooman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0007650309352507">Mitchell, Agle, &amp; Wood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0007650309352507">Pfeffer &amp; Salancik, 1978</xref>). Ironically, the stakeholders who may be most negatively affected by corporate behavior are those with the least power—marginalized groups. In this article, we suggest that members of marginalized groups are more likely to boycott, a coercive action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309352507">Frooman &amp; Murrell, 2005</xref>) to influence and to change offensive corporate behavior, than members of elite groups.</p>
<p>Contentious debate exists about boycott effectiveness. Firms tend to claim that boycotts have little or no effect on sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309352507">Davidson, Worrell, &amp; El-Jelly, 1995</xref>) to avoid legitimating the tactic. Of course, activists claim success. Academic research finds mixed results, noting numerous factors affect boycott success (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309352507">King, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309352507">2008b</xref>). Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309352507">King (2008a)</xref> recently found that 28% of his study’s corporate targets conceded to boycotter demands. Despite equivocal evidence on their efficacy, boycotts should be a salient strategic issue for managers for several reasons. First, boycotting is a commonly used tactic against firms and may even be increasing. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0007650309352507">Innes (2006)</xref> identified more than 200 U.S. firms subjected to organized boycotts between 1988 and 1995. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309352507">King (2008a)</xref> identified 133 boycotts of 189 target firms reported in five national newspapers between 1990 and 2005. In 1990, Congress relaxed the U.S. National Labor Relations Act allowing unions to call boycotts as complements to or even substitutes for strikes. As a result, unions and other groups (e.g., physicians) have increased their boycott sponsorships.</p>
<p>In addition, secondary stakeholders such as community activists, advocacy groups, religious groups, and NGOs are exploiting advances in communication technology to access information about corporate behavior as well as to increase national and international publicity surrounding boycott calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309352507">Eesley &amp; Lenox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0007650309352507">Martin &amp; Kracher, 2008</xref>). These actions increase corporate costs in terms of legal fees, public relations expenses, and managerial attention as well as tarnish corporate reputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309352507">Eesley &amp; Lenox, 2006</xref>), disrupt business operations, attract media attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0007650309352507">Martin &amp; Kracher, 2008</xref>), and gain regulator attention. Finally, boycotts can be a “concerted refusal to do business with a particular person or business . . . to express displeasure” rather than to specifically drive change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309352507">Garrett, 1987</xref>, p 46-47). Thus a boycott may be an end unto itself.</p>
<p>Within this article, we suggest that marginalization is a factor driving boycotting. Marginalization implies “instability, expendability, lack of power, and an absence of full integration with centralized decision-making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309352507">Arnold, 1995</xref>, p. 88). This status describes several characteristics of boycott supporters identified in earlier research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309352507">Klein, Smith, &amp; John, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">2004</xref>). In addition, characteristics of corporate targets and social issues prompting many organized boycotts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>) relate to concerns of marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Our use of marginalization theory highlights the absence of and reinforces the need to incorporate underrepresented groups in research on boycotting and organization research in general. Women and Blacks have been extensively studied regarding their propensity to join social movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>). Yet other historically marginalized groups remain understudied. In this project, we include Asian Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, as well as women and African Americans.</p>
<p>In addition, most social movement studies have examined ideological support with less attention to actual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650309352507">Barkan, 2004</xref>). One exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0007650309352507">Gerlach (2001)</xref>, who examines social movements from a network perspective and predicts protest group behavior based on their ideologies. If managers are to treat social demands as strategic issues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0007650309352507">Arcelus &amp; Schaefer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309352507">Eesley &amp; Lenox, 2006</xref>), they need to better understand which issues trigger boycott support by specific groups. This will ease managers’ diagnosis of which social issues are strategic issues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0007650309352507">Barr &amp; Glynn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650309352507">Jackson &amp; Dutton, 1988</xref>) and influence their reactions to boycott calls and pressure from interest groups in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309352507">Eesley &amp; Lenox, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the next sections, we briefly review marginalization theory and research on boycotting. Using theory about marginalization and company knowledge, we then develop our model and hypotheses regarding who boycotts which firms. Our analysis of 27,722 individual evaluations of 59 firms reveals that, in general, marginalized group members are more likely to support boycotts. In addition, the basis of their marginalization shapes which boycotts they support. We conclude with some general implications and avenues for future research.</p>
<sec id="section1-0007650309352507">
<title>Marginalization</title>
<p>Marginalization is “the process by which established or emerging elites create socioeconomic relations of superior versus subordinate/dependent through manipulations of labor and distributions of social resources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309352507">Arnold, 1995</xref>, p. 88). While anthropologists debate whether marginalization occurs due to external shocks, such as natural disasters, or individuals’ opportunistic behaviors, they agree that social inequality exists in most cultures. Elites create social structures that maintain and reinforce this inequality. Marginalization is not limited to religious or racial minorities, as women, who comprise the majority of the population in most countries, tend to have access to fewer resources than men do.</p>
<p>Much of the marginalization research has focused on the relationships of elites and dependents with regard to political and legal institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650309352507">Harris, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650309352507">Sam &amp; Berry, 2006</xref>). In the management literature, marginalization has been examined with respect to groups of employees based on race, gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650309352507">Mehra, Kilduff, &amp; Brass, 1998</xref>), sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650309352507">Creed &amp; Scully, 2000</xref>), and part-time employment status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0007650309352507">Lawrence &amp; Clark, 1999</xref>). Marginalization has been shown to be a powerful source of social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0007650309352507">Creed &amp; Scully, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650309352507">Mehra et al., 1998</xref>), which is a critical means of mobilizing stakeholder group members to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0007650309352507">Rowley &amp; Modoveanu, 2003</xref>). Hence this theory can help clarify organizational relationships with external stakeholder groups.</p>
<p>Marginalization is an absence of power or control over resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0007650309352507">Pfeffer, 1981</xref>). Types include, but are not limited to, economic, political, social, and cultural marginalization, each with a lack of resources. Economic marginalization tends to affect racial groups, the elderly, youth, and single mothers with small children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0007650309352507">Young, 1995</xref>). Social and political marginalization often affects those who are economically marginalized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0007650309352507">Kerchis and Young (1995</xref>, p. 23) write
<disp-quote>
<p>Women, African Americans, Hispanics, and gay people are underrepresented in legislative bodies . . . . Women, old people and poor people often find it more difficult to get to public meetings because of responsibilities in the home or lack of transportation. And even when they do attend, they are hesitant to speak out of fear that they may not be articulate enough or that others will not take them seriously.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognition of different sources of marginalization can enhance issue diagnosis. People may achieve financial security, but still suffer from social marginalization. Although cultural marginalization, which often appears in immigration research, is beyond the scope of this project, cultural dimensions may coexist with marginalization based on race.</p>
<p>Many nations have created social programs to reduce or to eliminate structural marginalization. The Indian government has created affirmative action programs to reduce the caste system’s grip on society. The Australian government has initiated programs to empower aborigines. Various U.S. laws and programs have been implemented to reduce marginalization of groups based on gender, age, and race in the workplace and housing market. Next, we review ways in which marginalized groups have attempted to mobilize and empower themselves.</p>

<title>Boycotting and Social Movements</title>
<p>Boycotts are a social action where individuals withhold resources to punish a firm for actions or policies perceived as illegitimate or socially irresponsible and to influence corporate strategy. This coercive stakeholder influence strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309352507">Frooman &amp; Murrell, 2005</xref>) can take the form of undeclared or organized. An undeclared boycott occurs when individuals withhold consumption from a firm without coordination. An organized boycott is considered a social movement, a collective action to produce social change and influence institutions, such as government or firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309352507">King, 2008b</xref>). Similar to marginalization theory, social movement theory has focused on efforts to change government policies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0007650309352507">Meyer, Whittier, &amp; Robnett, 2002</xref>). Interest in social movements in organization studies recently has gained momentum (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0007650309352507">Davis, McAdam, Scott, &amp; Zald, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309352507">King, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>). Because boycotts are a form of social movement, we include relevant literature from both in our review and theory development.</p>
<p>Organized boycotts, divestitures, and buycotts are social movements involving secondary stakeholders who try to influence corporate behavior despite their inability to legitimately participate in organization change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>). Coercive strategies, such as boycotts and divestitures, “involve either the threat to reduce a benefit or increase cost to a firm” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309352507">Frooman &amp; Murrell, 2005</xref>, p. 9) through a refusal to do business with a firm or invest in its securities, respectively. Investment in South Africa has been the divestiture literature’s main topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309352507">Davidson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309352507">Kumar, Lamb, &amp; Wokutch, 2002</xref>). Buycotts, a third influence strategy, are organized attempts to support corporate behavior by purchasing firms’ products.</p>
<p>Most early social movements were political in nature, such as those organized on behalf of women’s rights and Civil rights targeting state and federal government. The 1960s’ California grape boycott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0007650309352507">Smith, 1991</xref>) was the first major boycott to target private industry. This boycott to improve the working conditions of mainly Mexican American farm workers enlisted sympathetic middle class consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0007650309352507">Smith, 1991</xref>). The transition of social movements from political to corporate targets reflects both growing corporate power and limited avenues to influence corporate behavior. Chavez wrote that the grape “boycott is the way we take our cause to the public. For surely if we cannot find justice in the courts of rural California, we will find support with our brothers and sisters throughout the nation” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0007650309352507">Smith, 1991</xref>, p. 21). To reduce structural marginalization of African Americans and other people of color, Jesse Jackson began a campaign to motivate private business to improve employment, business development, philanthropy, and policy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0007650309352507">Cassidy, 1974</xref>). Jackson stated “There must be a renewed focus, research and confrontation with the private sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0007650309352507">Holmes, 1996</xref>, p. D4).</p>
<sec id="section3-0007650309352507">
<title>Boycott Supporters</title>
<p>Boycotters are influenced by their own attributes, group membership, the interplay of the two, and the boycotts’ characteristics. At the individual level, personal prestige, social status, moral motivations, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0007650309352507">Hardin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0007650309352507">Logsdon, 1991</xref>), desire to enact change, and self-enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">2004</xref>) increase participation. At the group level, small group size, coercion, and perceived incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0007650309352507">Olson, 1965</xref>), such as issue egregiousness, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">2004</xref>), social pressure, and boycott–personal goal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309352507">Garrett, 1987</xref>), enhance participation. Personal cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309352507">Garrett, 1987</xref>), constrained consumption, and counterarguments diminish individuals’ boycott propensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2004</xref>). We suggest that marginalization theory complements prior theories such as social movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309352507">King, 2008b</xref>) and social dilemma theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0007650309352507">Sen, Gurhan-Canli, &amp; Morwitz, 2001</xref>) and relates these disparate demographic and psychological characteristics.</p>

<title>Target Characteristics and Boycott Tactics</title>
<p>Activists systematically target firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0007650309352507">Rehbein, Waddock, &amp; Graves, 2004</xref>). Corporate targets tend to be highly visible (e.g., large; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650309352507">Hendry, 2006</xref>) with reputation and economic problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>). Boycotts often target American-owned firms because they may be more “amenable to pressure from American protest groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>, p. 220). Environmental groups target firms that can be identified as the environmental impact’s source, produce significant environmental consequences, are influential in their organizational field, and produce consumer or branded products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0007650309352507">Hendry, 2006</xref>). If the organizational field’s leaders acquiesce, institutional isomorphism suggests that followers will acquiesce as well.</p>
<p>To hurt their targets, boycott organizers have launched new tactics, such as buying full-page ads in popular magazines and newspapers to more directly target the public; producing videotapes; recruiting large vendors, customers, or sympathetic celebrities; sending mass mailings and publishing newsletters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0007650309352507">Eesley &amp; Lenox, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0007650309352507">Martin &amp; Kracher, 2008</xref>); creating blogs and posting Facebook appeals.</p>

<sec id="section5-0007650309352507">
<title>Boycott Effectiveness</title>
<p>As noted in the introduction, consensus on boycott effectiveness and measures remains elusive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0007650309352507">Martin and Kracher (2008)</xref> propose two degrees of protest success dependent on the ultimate end. Ultimately, effective protests change the objectionable business practice. Intermediately, effective protests capture business leaders’ attention, for example, through media coverage. Furthermore, they suggest that effectiveness can be measured in terms of quantity and authority of participants, public impact, and disruption to business.</p>
<p>In his qualitative study of 90 consumer boycotts occurring between 1970 and 1980, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman (1999)</xref> found that 26.7% achieved or partially achieved their ultimate objectives. As noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309352507">King (2008a)</xref> recently found that a similar 28% of the corporate targets in his boycott study between 1990 and 2005 conceded to demands. Thus the success rate of boycotting has been constant over a sustained timeframe. Expectations of boycott success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0007650309352507">Mahoney, 1976</xref>), credible leadership, economic pressure, negative publicity, and less management commitment to stated policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309352507">Garrett, 1987</xref>) enhance participation rates. Boycott effectiveness also can be measured in terms of resource loss. Boycott targets’ product and brand images both decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2002</xref>), due to negative information spillover from one product of a multiproduct firm to other products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0007650309352507">Weinberger, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Most academic studies using event study analysis have found that boycott threats and/or announcements decreased targets’ share price (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309352507">Davidson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309352507">Kumar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0007650309352507">Pruitt &amp; Friedman, 1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King and Soule’s (2007)</xref> finding that stock prices decreased 1% during the 26-day event window was comparable to other significant corporate events. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0007650309352507">Koku, Akhigbe, and Springer (1997)</xref> found that boycott targets’ stock price increased after a boycott threat or announcement. Unfortunately, few studies examine a longer event window to see when and if the stock price recovers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0007650309352507">McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 1997</xref>, for a critique of event studies). A notable exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309352507">Kumar et al. (2002)</xref>, who found that once the boycott related to investment in South Africa was lifted, the 87 U.S. companies that were boycott targets experienced abnormal positive returns of 4.26%. Although beyond the scope of this article, replicating these event studies with longer windows could be a research opportunity.</p>
<p>In the next section, we develop a theoretical framework based on marginalization theory that accommodates both the “who” and “whom” of boycotting to broaden and synthesize research.</p>

<title>Theory Development and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section7-0007650309352507">
<title>Who Boycotts</title>
<p>Our literature review suggests that historically underrepresented or marginalized groups have been most likely to boycott and participate in other social movements. Marginalization is a strong motivator of social identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650309352507">Mehra et al., 1998</xref>). Participation in boycotts may reinforce this marginalized identity.</p>
<p>On one level, individuals decide certain corporate policies or actions are so illegitimate and/or socially irresponsible that they want to change or punish a firm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0007650309352507">Smith, Wokutch, Harrington, and Dennis (2001)</xref> examined the influence of diversity and stakeholder role on corporate social orientation, finding that diversity, gender and race affected perceptions of corporate social performance. Women and Blacks emphasized corporate social performance more than men or Whites did. We suggest marginalized groups are more likely to perceive corporate actions as objectionable.</p>
<p>On a second level, individuals decide which coercive influence strategies, such as divesting or boycotting, are preferable or viable. Marginalized group members possess fewer available influence tactics than elite group members do, and therefore, are more likely to perceive boycotting as a viable action. In addition, members of these groups may identify with the symbolic act of boycotting itself as a prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-0007650309352507">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>Women are marginalized across most cultures, though they are the population majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309352507">Arnold, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0007650309352507">Bullough, Kroeck, Newburry, Lowe, &amp; Prugl, 2009</xref>). They suffer from a lack of access to career opportunities and resources (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0007650309352507">Lobel &amp; St. Clair, 1992</xref>), as well as from underrepresentation in the financial community, politics, and regulatory agencies. Thus, they typically have less influence over corporate behavior than elites. In the United States, women comprise 46.4% of the U.S. labor force, but only 14.4% of corporate officer positions and just 14.8% of board seats in the Fortune 500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0007650309352507">Catalyst, 2008e</xref>). In 2008, women earned 77.1% as much as men, for median income, full-time, year-round workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0007650309352507">Catalyst, 2008f</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender frequently has been studied with respect to boycotts and other social movements. With few exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0007650309352507">Sherkat &amp; Blocker, 1994</xref>), most studies have found women more likely to boycott than men are (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with past results and given their continued marginalization in the United States, we suggest that women will be more likely to support boycotts than men will.</p>

<sec id="section9-0007650309352507">
<title>Race</title>
<p>In most societies, race serves as a powerful source of marginalization. Indigenous peoples such as Native Americans, the Maori in New Zealand, and forest peoples of the Amazon, are marginalized in terms of political, economic, and social power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0007650309352507">Berry &amp; Sam, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0007650309352507">Kvernmo, 2006</xref>). In the United States, racial marginalization has been recognized via antidiscrimination legislation and government census.</p>
<p>Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and, to a lesser extent, Asians remain underrepresented in corporate America, regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. African Americans comprise 11.4% of the U.S. workforce, 8.4% of those in management, professional and related occupations, and 8.04% of Fortune 100 board seats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0007650309352507">Catalyst, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650309352507">Catalyst et al., 2008</xref>). Asian Americans comprise 4.6% of the U.S. workforce, 6.4% of those in management, professional, and related occupations, and 1.11% of Fortune 100 board seats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0007650309352507">Catalyst, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650309352507">Catalyst et al., 2008</xref>). Hispanics comprise 14.1% of the U.S. workforce, 7.0% of those in management, professional, and related occupations, and 3.72% of Fortune 100 board seats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0007650309352507">Catalyst, 2008c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0007650309352507">Catalyst et al., 2008</xref>). Native Americans and Alaska natives comprise about 1.4% of the U.S. workforce and a negligible percentage of professional and related occupations and Fortune 100 board seats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0007650309352507">Catalyst, 2008d</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman (1999</xref>, p. 90) noted, “African Americans have been responsible for more consumer boycotts than all the other (minority) groups combined.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0007650309352507">Sherkat and Blocker (1994)</xref> found being Black positively associated with protest activism. Consistent with a lack of organizational research on other minorities, studies of their boycott participation are much less extensive than those of Blacks. Studies tend to be individual cases, such as Chavez’s grape boycott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0007650309352507">Smith, 1991</xref>), as opposed to broader empirical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>). However, given these minorities’ marginalized status in the United States, we expect them to be more likely to support boycotts than Whites are.</p>

<sec id="section10-0007650309352507">
<title>Age</title>
<p>Definitions of age categories are fluid over an individual’s life span and cross-culturally. Past research suggests a curvilinear relationship between marginalization and age with the very young and very old at the low points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0007650309352507">Arnold, 1995</xref>). Evidence relating age and boycotting is mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman (1999)</xref> found that 48% of local boycott leaders and 56% of protest participants were between 26 and 35 years of age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0007650309352507">Gelb (1977)</xref> found senior citizens increasingly exercising their “gray power” through numerous efforts, including boycotting, suggesting an inverted u-shaped relationship between age and boycotting. Yet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al. (2004)</xref> found no relationship between age and boycotting. Thus, predicting which age group(s) identifies most closely with boycotting is difficult. Boycotts, however, generally focus on current firm activities that coincide with the marginalization of younger people. Older people, by contrast, are less likely to be marginalized in business because they tend to be established and more closely resemble the corporate elite. The average age of the Fortune 500 board of directors was 59 in 2000. Thus, we expect that age will be negatively related to boycott support.</p>
<p>Based on our discussions of gender, racial identity, and age, we hypothesize</p>

<sec id="section11-0007650309352507">
<title>Education</title>
<p>Education is an important vehicle for improving status, thereby reducing some types of marginalization, but leaving others. In the United States, higher degrees lead to higher median salaries (Catalyst, 2008g).</p>
<p>Education also provides access to knowledge about social and corporate issues that incite boycotts, and empowers individuals to try to change conditions. Interest group organizers often target college students, sensing that they are likely sympathizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0007650309352507">Meyer, 2002</xref>). College attendance is positively associated with protest activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0007650309352507">Sherkat &amp; Blocker, 1994</xref>). Overall, education serves the dual roles of mitigating economic marginalization and increasing awareness of strategic/social issues. Thus, although education may allow individuals to overcome marginalized economic status, it provides greater access to information. Thus we hypothesize</p>
<list id="list2-0007650309352507" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: More educated individuals are more likely than less educated ones to support boycotts.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0007650309352507">
<title>Income</title>
<p>Two important forces related to income compete as boycotting influences. On one hand, the economic elite have multiple ways to influence corporate behavior, such as through investment or political processes, thus possibly reducing boycott support. Economically marginalized individuals have fewer avenues to influence firms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, greater family income enables purchase of substitutes. In an earlier study, 41% of boycott leaders had annual family incomes in the study’s highest income category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>). Economic marginalization constrains individuals’ ability to purchase higher price substitutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309352507">Garrett, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0007650309352507">Sen et al. (2001)</xref> found that low product preferences and availability of substitutes increased boycott participation. After controlling for marginalization sources, greater income eases sacrifice, facilitating boycotting. Thus we suggest</p>

<sec id="section13-0007650309352507">
<title>Corporate Boycott Targets</title>
<p>We now transfer attention from groups who tend to boycott to knowledge characteristics of boycotted firms. Prior research suggests boycott visibility and company knowledge are essential aspects of boycott decisions. Stakeholders may attend to issues already identified as critical and strategic by managers, or to issues not yet diagnosed by managers as such.</p>
<sec id="section14-0007650309352507">
<title>Boycott visibility</title>
<p>Social information processing theories posit that characteristics of focal targets, such as information availability or visibility, influence attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0007650309352507">Ross &amp; Nisbett, 1991</xref>). In addition, institutional intermediaries, that is, the media, serve as informational cues influencing the importance of specific issues for public attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0007650309352507">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0007650309352507">Lasora &amp; Wanta, 1990</xref>). Although individuals may boycott products of firms whose policies or actions they consider illegitimate or socially irresponsible, organized boycotts focus collective social attention on these issues, which otherwise would be individual matters. Boycott awareness enhances boycott participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0007650309352507">Garrett, 1987</xref>). Their leaders focus media and individual attention on boycotts to exploit weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>). The tendency of firms’ stock prices to drop significantly after boycott calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309352507">Davidson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309352507">Kumar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0007650309352507">Pruitt &amp; Friedman, 1986</xref>) supports the idea that organized boycotts promote participation. In addition, greater media coverage of boycotts is associated with negative abnormal stock price returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>). Accordingly, we suggest</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section15-0007650309352507">
<title>Cognitive complexity</title>
<p>In addition to information about organized boycotts, individuals can access other information about firm performance such as products, financials, social performance, and work environment. Individuals with complex knowledge structures about a topic are more likely than those with simple ones to construct balanced groupings of attributes, to include both unfavorable and favorable attributes in their descriptions of others, and to integrate apparently conflicting information into a common description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0007650309352507">Linville, 1982</xref>). Of course, it is possible that familiarity with a firm could breed contempt for it. However, greater complexity or knowledge comprehensiveness reflects individuals’ exposure to different elements of performance of which some may be good.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al. (2004)</xref> found that counterarguments about a boycott decreased boycott intent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King and Soule (2007)</xref> found that past media attention mitigated the negative effect of boycott announcements on stock price. Individuals with more comprehensive knowledge about a firm may be less likely to penalize a firm for its negative attributes, such as organized boycotts, because they also recognize its positive attributes. For example, individuals may discount an environmental boycott if they believe that the firm sells quality products and treats employees well. Accordingly, we hypothesize</p>

<sec id="section16-0007650309352507">
<title>Marginalization and Strategic Issues</title>
<p>While some boycotts cover universal issues, others relate to issues with which specific marginalized groups closely identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0007650309352507">Strolovitch, 2006</xref>). Hence, boycott participation may vary across marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Critical to managers’ issue diagnosis is identifying which boycotts pose the biggest threat. Boycotts that hurt a firm’s reputation, stock price, or bottom line are most likely to be strategic issues. To identify these issues, we categorized the boycotts as labor, product, minority groups, religious, and environment (ecological) following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman (1999)</xref>. Because religious issues have both proponents and opponents, we divide this category into conservative and liberal views. We supplement Friedman’s classification with foreignness because foreign firms face a liability of foreignness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0007650309352507">Zaheer, 1995</xref>), which may increase their chance of being boycotted.</p>
<p>Marginalization may influence support for specific boycotts through two mechanisms: attention and issue egregiousness. Because attention is bounded, individuals selectively attend to some informational cues and ignore others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0007650309352507">March &amp; Simon, 1958</xref>). Marginalization may influence boycotting by directing attention to issues that are particularly salient to specific marginalized groups.</p>
<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309352507">Klein et al. (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">2004</xref>) found that perceived egregiousness moderated boycott participation. Marginalized individuals may find corporate actions related to their marginalization most egregious, and thus, more likely support boycotts organized around these issues. Although nonmarginalized individuals also may be sympathetic to these boycotts, we expect their support to occur at a lower rate because the boycotts are less directly associated with their group identification, lowering their engagement and motivation to participate. In the following subsections, we focus on interactions related to attention and egregiousness.</p>
<sec id="section17-0007650309352507">
<title>Gender</title>
<p>Women are likely to find issues about their workplace and traditional gender roles salient and egregious. Women’s social issues include reproductive rights, women’s rights/feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0007650309352507">Strolovitch, 2006</xref>), and workplace gender bias such as sexual harassment, unequal wages, and glass ceilings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0007650309352507">Newburry, Belkin, &amp; Ansari, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0007650309352507">Peirce, Smolinski, &amp; Rosen, 1998</xref>). Surprisingly, although we found little research about boycotts for women’s rights, we found many articles on financial settlements and costs of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0007650309352507">Peirce et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

Women-led groups “have typically launched consumer economic boycotts” because “the traditional division of labor meant that it was homemakers who did the shopping,” and thus, “most directly felt the effect of adverse changes in price or availability of consumer goods” that often preceded their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>, p. 65). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650309352507">Hunter et al.

<title>Race</title>
<p>Race-based marginalization may focus the attention of racial minorities on boycotts related to discrimination in areas such as employment and advertising. In contrast, in the United States, Whites may be less likely to identify with or even be aware of issues related to other races. Coca Cola and Texaco, among others, have faced boycotts threatened or organized to protest bias against African Americans. Although examples of boycotts by other racial minorities exist, they are more anecdotal than for Blacks. Other race-based boycotts include Mexican Americans (e.g., T.V. show representation), Chinese Americans (e.g., Opium Perfume for its insensitive name) and Native Americans (e.g., Crazy Horse Malt Liquor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>).

<title>Education</title>
<p>Issues that inspire boycotts vary in their complexity as well as the directness of their effects. For instance, environmental issues tend to be complex, often involving indirect effects, such as effects of razing Brazilian rainforests on U.S. climate change. Educated individuals are more likely to understand and identify with complex issues. Moreover, environmental groups such as Greenpeace target college students in their efforts. A positive relationship between education and environmental citizenship frequently has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650309352507">Barkan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0007650309352507">Coan &amp; Holman, 2008</xref>). Thus, although less educated individuals may be more marginalized, they may lack access to information regarding environmental issues, leading them to boycott less.</p>
<p>In addition, education may shape political beliefs. In the United States, tensions regarding liberal versus conservative viewpoints have spawned numerous boycotts. A stable and consistently positive relationship has been found between education and liberal viewpoints in the United States (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0007650309352507">Weil’s 1985</xref> literature review).

<sec id="section20-0007650309352507">
<title>Income</title>
<p>Economically marginalized individuals may lack adequate resources to support boycotts because costs of substituting acceptable products for illegitimate ones may be high. In particular, the price of “green” products, such as clean energy, often exceeds the price of substitutes. Income constraints may shift lower-income individuals’ attention from environmental to price issues. Freed from first-level purchasing restraints, higher income individuals can support environmental causes. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650309352507">Barkan (2004)</xref> found no relationship between family income and environmental citizenship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0007650309352507">Coan and Holman (2008)</xref> found a curvilinear relationship between median household income and environmental initiative support.</p>
<p>In addition, income may influence attitudes toward labor issues. Historically, labor boycotts have reflected the distinction between management and labor, and labor’s desire to gain concessions such as higher wages or better working conditions from management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>).

<title>Method</title>
<p>Previous researchers have used several methods to examine consumer boycotts including surveying undergraduates’ support for an actual boycott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2002</xref>), surveying consumers regarding a plant closing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2004</xref>), event studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309352507">Kumar et al., 2002</xref>), and conducting laboratory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0007650309352507">Sen et al., 2001</xref>). To our knowledge, we are the first to combine multiple strategic issues, multiple firms, and marginalization in a single study. To do so, we use data from the Reputation Quotient (RQ) Annual 2001 study conducted by the Reputation Institute and Harris Interactive. One of the authors developed the questionnaire items in conjunction with these organizations.</p>
<p>Database construction consisted of two sampling levels and phases. To develop the firm sample, Harris conducted 5,975 online interviews randomly selected from its Harris Poll Online (HPOL) panel of more than 7 million people and 4,063 telephone interviews in the United States Respondents were asked to nominate two companies they felt had the best reputations overall and two companies with the worst reputations overall. Harris combined nominations of conglomerates, wholly owned subsidiaries, or brands to construct a list of 60 firms named most often.</p>
<p>In the ratings phase, Harris interviewed and asked another 21,630 HPOL respondents to evaluate one or two firms randomly assigned from the above 60 with which they were at least somewhat familiar as determined by a screening question. In this context, awareness or familiarity with a firm reflects the incidence rate within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0007650309352507">Asher, 2004</xref>). If a respondent evaluated two firms, two cases resulted for this analysis. Missing demographic data reduced the sample size, and one firm’s mutual status hindered collecting archival data. The final sample contained 27,722 evaluations or an average of 469 for each of the remaining 59 firms in 20 industries.</p>
<p>Although the United States online population is approaching parity with the general population, some groups are underrepresented online (e.g., people above 65). Thus, we weighted the data to represent the U.S. adult population. Weighting variables included demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, and region), nondemographic variables (i.e., stakeholder status), and a measure of respondents’ propensity to participate in online studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0007650309352507">Pittau &amp; Zelli, 2004</xref>, for an example of weighting for population characteristics).</p>
<p>The <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> reported summary results on corporate reputations from this study on January 16, 2002 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0007650309352507">Alsop, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0007650309352507">Newburry, Gardberg, and Belkin (2006)</xref> used the previous year’s RQ study data to examine organizational attractiveness as an employer.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section23-0007650309352507">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Individual-level data such as boycott experience, company knowledge, and demographic data were collected in the RQ Annual 2001 study. We use two dependent variables. First, we examine <italic>overall boycotting behavior</italic> using the item “In the <underline>past year</underline>, have you chosen <underline>not</underline> to purchase or told someone else <underline>not</underline> to purchase a product or service made or sold by a particular company because the company’s actions or policies conflicted with your values or beliefs?” Respondents chose among 6 responses: “Yes, <underline>I have personally chosen</underline> not to purchase a company’s products or services”; “Yes, I <underline>told someone else</underline> not to purchase a company’s products or services”; “Both”; “Neither,” “Not sure” and “Decline to answer” (underlines in original). Second, we examine <italic>company specific boycotting</italic> using the same question with a specific firm name inserted. For both questions, we recoded the first four responses, such that <italic>neither</italic> equals 0 and <italic>encouraged someone else, personally refused</italic>, and <italic>both</italic> equal 1. We coded “Not sure” and “decline to answer” as missing. Thus, both dependent variables are 1, if the respondent supported a boycott, and 0, otherwise.</p>
<p>Although social desirability bias with respect to self-reported boycotting behavior may occur, a number of factors related to the data collection give us confidence in the data. Several of these are improvements over many published studies in the supportive behavior literature. First respondents were anonymous. Second, the items are consistent with our article’s definitions of boycotting, and were included in a section measuring a variety of stakeholder behaviors including investment, purchase, and employment, allowing respondents to better ground their answers. During its Harris poll and other studies, Harris has collected consistent data on increasing activism among Americans. Finally, Harris also collected data on future boycotting intentions. Although we do not use this data in this project, this may frame the actual boycotting question in respondents’ minds.</p>

<sec id="section24-0007650309352507">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>We use self-reported demographic characteristics. <italic>Gender</italic> is dichotomous (0 = male; 1 = female). We coded <italic>Race</italic> from two items that recognize that respondents may have multiple racial identities. The first item states “Are you of Hispanic origin, such as Mexican American, Latin American, Puerto Rican, or Cuban?” Respondents chose among three responses: “Yes, of Hispanic origin,” “No, not of Hispanic origin,” and “Decline to Answer.” A second item states “Do you consider yourself . . . ?” Responses include “White,” “Black,” “African American,” “Asian or Pacific Islander,” “Native American or Alaskan native,” “Mixed racial background,” “Other race” and “Decline to answer.” We eliminated respondents who chose “other race” and “decline to answer” from the sample. We coded a series of dichotomous variables (1 = <italic>focal race member</italic> and 0 = <italic>not</italic>). Racial categories are not mutually exclusive, but only about 3% of the sample responded to multiple racial categories. Numerous respondents chose both Black and African American. With regard to our dependent variables, <italic>t</italic>-test results indicated that we could combine the two categories.</p>
<p><italic>Respondent Age</italic> is a categorical variable based on a 13-point scale (1 = &lt;<italic>18 years old</italic> and 13 = &gt;<italic>65 years old</italic>). We eliminated respondents under the age of 18 from the sample. <italic>Education</italic> is also categorical (1 = <italic>less than high school</italic>, 7 = <italic>completed graduate school</italic>). <italic>Household Income</italic> is categorical based on an 11-point scale (1 = &lt;<italic>US$15,000</italic> and 11 = &gt;<italic>US$250,000</italic>).</p>
<p>We measured <italic>Cognitive Complexity</italic> based on the question, “How much do you feel you know about (company name) for the following—nothing at all, a little, or a lot?” for five categories: Products and services, vision and leadership, workplace environment, social and environmental responsibility, and financial performance. We totaled the responses for these categories, coded 1, 2, or 3. Scores ranged from 5 (<italic>knowing little about any of the firm’s attributes</italic>) to 15 (<italic>having complex knowledge of the firm</italic>).</p>
<p>For <italic>Organized Boycott</italic>, we first coded a dichotomous variable based on articles from three newspapers with the largest national distribution in the United States. (<italic>USA Today, The Wall Street Journal</italic>, and the <italic>New York Times</italic>) using ABI/Inform and Lexis-Nexis from 1981 to 2001 in a manner consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309352507">King (2008a)</xref>. We searched on each firm name and “boycott” to identify boycotts organized in the United States In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0007650309352507">Davidson et al. (1995)</xref>, we omitted boycotts announced in other countries, example, an Arab boycott against firms doing business in Israel, because they were unlikely to influence U.S. behavior. We identified 38 boycott announcements made over the 20-year period 1980-2000 targeting 24 of our firms. To ensure correct classification, we individually coded the boycotts into our strategic issue categories such as product, environment, and race. We then discussed them to resolve ambiguities. We classified the remaining boycotts, such as patent or monopoly protests, as corporate policy boycotts (only 2 of the total). Only 4, including the 2 corporate policy boycotts, of 38 boycotts were ambiguous. Thus we achieved an intercoder reliability of 89.5%, which is consistent with the 90% intercoder agreement rates found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309352507">King (2008a)</xref> with respect to boycott-related variables.</p>
<p>Because we identified no boycotts of sample firms regarding sex discrimination and non-Black racial minorities, we could not test hypothesized interactions regarding these issues. Moreover, boycotts related to South African divestment emerged as a distinct category, which we separated from boycotts regarding domestic discrimination against Blacks. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0007650309352507">Table 1</xref> contains a list of the strategic issues, for example, targeted firms, the number of firms boycotted in each category, and the number of our sample’s respondents that participated in each of these boycott types. Participation rates for the boycott types range from 4,127 respondents (14.9%) for product boycotts to 991 respondents (3.6%) for boycotts supporting liberal views. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0007650309352507">Table 2</xref> presents the number of firms facing multiple boycotts. Of those with organized boycotts, 14 firms had only one boycott and 4 had three different boycotts organized against them.</p>

<p>When examining interaction variables, it is useful to know the number of observations in each interaction category as this may affect the results’ reliability. Of our 13,056 female respondents, 1,959 (15.0%) participated in product boycotts and 1,161 (8.9%) participated in environmental boycotts. For our racial variables, 251 Blacks (of 2,313; 10.9%) participated in racial boycotts, 109 Blacks (4.7%) participated in South African boycotts and 23 (of 317; 7.3%) Native Americans participated in environmental boycotts. For our categorical education and income variables, values are computed at each education and income level. This corresponds to the number of observations reported in the last column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0007650309352507">Table 1</xref> for the environment (2,682), liberal (991), conservative (1,685) and labor (2,358) boycott categories, respectively.</p>

<title>Control variables</title>

We controlled for the liability of newness with <italic>Company Age</italic>. For foreign firms, we use the ages of their first U.S. subsidiary. We collected measures for company size and ROA from COMPUSTAT and Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

<p>Because our dependent variable is dichotomous, we used logistic regression analysis to test the main and hypothesized moderating effects. Positive coefficients can be interpreted as increasingly the likelihood of boycott support. As our specific firm boycott analyses involved a hierarchical data structure with two levels of nested data (individual and company), we used the hierarchical linear modeling program HLM6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0007650309352507">Raudenbush et al., 2004</xref>) to compute these models. To minimize multicollinearity, we standardized and centered the direct effects prior to creating the moderating effects, with the exception of the binary variables in a manner consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650309352507">Joshi, Liao, and Jackson (2006)</xref>. The logit models’ convergence suggests multicollinearity is not a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0007650309352507">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>). Because the HLM6 program does not allow the computation of variance inflation factors (VIFs), we also recomputed our models in SPSS as an additional method of testing collinearity. VIFs for all variables were well within tolerances.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0007650309352507">Table 5</xref> presents our results. Model 1 tests marginalization hypotheses related to our overall boycotting behavior dependent variable. Model 2 reexamines our individual level variables, along with firm-specific predictors. Model 3 breaks the organized boycott variable from Model 2 into specific boycott issues. Model 4 adds our hypothesized moderating effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0007650309352507">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). We include a column containing odds ratios for each variable to facilitate interpretation, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0007650309352507"><italic>Fortanier</italic> and Kolk (2007)</xref>. The odds ratio measures effect size, based on the ratio of the odds of one event occurring versus another. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that the probabilities of two events occurring (in our study, boycott or no boycott) are each 50%. A ratio greater than 1 indicates the degree to which a boycott is more probable than a nonboycott. An odds ratio less than one indicates the degree to which a no boycott decision is more probable than a boycott decision. To simplify linguistics, we use “boycott” rather than “support a boycott” in our discussion.</p>

<title>Marginalization Hypotheses</title>
<p>In Model 1, we regressed overall boycott support on our demographic variables. Hypothesis 1 predicts that members of marginalized groups will be more likely to boycott than members of elite ones. Counter to our expectations, females are less likely to have boycotted than males (<italic>b</italic> = –.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Consistent with our expectations, Blacks (<italic>b</italic> = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), Hispanics (<italic>b</italic> = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and Native Americans (<italic>b</italic> = .76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are more likely to have boycotted than Whites were. Counter to our expectations, Asians (<italic>b</italic> = –.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) are less likely than Whites to boycott. We ran an additional model controlling for multiple races. The control variable suppressed the Hispanic results, probably because most of respondents with multiple races are Hispanic and two thirds of Hispanics chose multiple races. Age is negative and statistically significant (<italic>b</italic> = –.05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), supporting Hypothesis 1.</p>
<p>Also consistent with our expectation, education is positively associated with boycotting (<italic>b</italic> = .03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), supporting Hypothesis 2. As predicted in Hypothesis 3, household income is positively associated (<italic>b</italic> = .02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) with boycotting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0007650309352507">
<title>Knowledge Hypotheses</title>
<p>In Model 2, we regressed firm-specific boycotting on our demographic, knowledge, and control measures. Although 37.9% of the respondents reported that they supported a boycott in the past year, only an average of 7.8% of respondents reported boycotting the firm to which they were randomly assigned. Thus we expect our marginalization results to differ between our overall boycotting and our firm-specific boycotting analyses.</p>
<p>Examining Model 2, we find that respondents are more likely to boycott a firm with an organized boycott (<italic>b</italic> = .49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), supporting Hypothesis 4. Consistent with Hypothesis 5, cognitive complexity is negative and statistically significantly (<italic>b</italic> = –.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) related to boycotting.</p>
<p>In Model 3, we replaced the organized boycott dichotomous measure with a series of variables representing the types of organized boycotts based on specific strategic issues. Across Models 2 and 3, the findings for our marginalization variables are robust. Only boycotts related to labor issues were significant in this model.</p>
<p>Model 4 tests our hypothesized interaction effects. We found statistically significant relationships for 5 of our 10 hypothesized interaction variables although not all results were in the hypothesized direction. Contrary to our expectations, we found that blacks were less likely (<italic>b</italic> = –.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) to support race-related boycotts (Hypothesis 1c). However, consistent with our expectations, Blacks were more likely to support boycotts related to South Africa (<italic>b</italic> = .91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). We also found that more educated respondents were more likely to support environmental boycotts (<italic>b</italic> = .12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), supporting Hypothesis 2a, and also more likely to support boycotts promoting liberal causes (<italic>b</italic> = .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), supporting Hypothesis 2b. Finally, higher income respondents were less likely to support environmental boycotts (<italic>b</italic> = –.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), contrary to Hypothesis 3a. The remaining hypothesized interactions were not statistically significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0007650309352507">
<title>Post Hoc Analyses</title>
<p>We ran several post hoc analyses to better understand the relationships among our demographic variables and boycott issues. In Model 4, we controlled for boycotting any firm during the past year with no change in our results, with the exception that the education–environment interaction became insignificant. We considered whether the boycott announcement’s age would affect boycott support. It did not. Replacing the boycott dummy with the number of organized boycotts provided robust results.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings challenge, support, and extend prior research on marginalization theory, strategic issues, and boycotting. Our literature review suggested that marginalization has been a mechanism for individual support of boycotts of government institutions and also could motivate boycotts against firms. Yet because firms tend to be more complex and fragmented than government institutions, knowledge characteristics of firms also need to be considered. Overall, our analysis indicates that gender, race, age, education, and household income, as well as firms’ knowledge characteristics influence boycotting behavior. We also find some interactions between specific marginalization and boycott types.</p>
<sec id="section31-0007650309352507">
<title>Marginalization</title>
<p>Although we found support for most of our marginalization hypotheses, some results surprised us. First, contrary to most research on boycotting and women’s marginalization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309352507">Connelley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650309352507">Mehra et al., 1998</xref>), but consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0007650309352507">Sherkat and Blocker (1994)</xref>, women were less likely to support boycotts than men were. For insight, we revisited our data. Not only is our sample more heterogeneous than most primarily White samples but we also controlled for other characteristics, such as socioeconomic status and stakeholder knowledge. Women knew more about the sample firms and were less educated than men were, possibly dampening the effect of being female alone.</p>
<p>Of our racial groups, Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans are more likely to support boycotts than Whites are. Overall, results for Black respondents are consistent with economic data and literature that finds Blacks marginalized in the workplace (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0007650309352507">Connelley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0007650309352507">Mehra et al., 1998</xref>). Two thirds of Hispanics reporting multiple races also reinforces the importance of examining which racial identity is salient (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0007650309352507">Stryker &amp; Serpe, 1982</xref>) when studying Hispanic groups.</p>
<p>In contrast, Asians are less likely to support boycotts than Whites are, perhaps because 61% of Asians are foreign born, compared to 38% of Hispanics and 8% or less for other minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0007650309352507">Council of Economic Advisors for the President’s Initiative on Race, 1998</xref>). Perhaps, Asian experiences in the United States surpass those in their native country, lessening their perceptions of offensive action. Or, they may lack experience with boycotting as a social action. Or, simply, Asian Americans may not perceive themselves as marginalized. Asian Americans are overrepresented in managerial and professional positions but remain underrepresented on corporate boards.</p>
<p>Our education and income results appear to conflict with marginalization as a boycotting motive. Yet they reflect the tension between different marginalization sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0007650309352507">Harris, 1995</xref>) and means. Examining our study data in more detail, the boycott rates for our marginalized groups peak for the middle class with a second peak for some minorities with incomes less than US$15,000. Despite achieving financial security (less economic marginalization), some may still feel marginalized due to race or age, leading them to identify with and support issues related to their social marginalization. Education and income provide access and opportunity for the marginalized and their sympathizers to support boycotts. Unfortunately, to fully examine this tension requires testing 3-way and 4-way interaction effects, which is beyond this project’s scope.</p>
<p>Our company knowledge results also support and extend prior research. Respondents were more likely to boycott firms with boycotts organized against them—providing behavioral evidence to supplement prior studies based on general ideological support. Interestingly, several firms with undeclared boycotts also suffered substantial boycott rates (e.g., MCI WorldCom, Ford, and Sprint). In addition, cognitive complexity decreased boycotting—possibly due to more complex evaluations of firms encompassing both positive and negative information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0007650309352507">Linville, 1982</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0007650309352507">
<title>Strategic Issues</title>
<p>Although we did not hypothesize about the efficacy of boycotts organized around specific issues, the results deserve discussion. Replacing the overall boycott variable with boycott topic variables helps us identify the issues that spur individual action. Consistent with King and Soule (2008), labor boycotts were most likely to prompt boycott support. During the 20-year window that we used for identifying organized boycotts, Blacks were the only racial group in our sample for whom we found national boycott announcements. The boycotts related to policy and financial issues, which were not part of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman’s (1999)</xref> research, did not attract much support. These results could be considered conservative as we asked only about boycotts in the <italic>past year</italic>. It is likely that some respondents supported additional boycotts in the past.</p>
<p>We found statistical support for many of our interaction effects although some occurred in directions contrary to our predictions. Given the small number of boycotts in some categories, these results should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, we believe they add to existing knowledge regarding boycotting, particularly given the limited empirical research addressing specific boycott issues’ appeal to specific demographic groups. The chi-square difference test between nested Models 3 and 4 shows that adding our hypothesized interaction effects produces a model with significantly more explanatory power, difference in χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic>) = 28(10); <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Blacks were less likely to support racial issue boycotts. For insight, we revisited newspaper articles. Blacks interviewed about the Texaco boycott, organized in reaction to executives’ racial slurs, distinguished between corporate executives and station owners. “This little guy is trying to make a living . . . not a man sitting in an office disparaging people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0007650309352507">Salpukas, 1996</xref>, p. B10). Another described a local station owner’s generosity as he “often extends credit, gives people time to pay for repairs and holds welfare checks and other important mail for neighbors.” Respondents may identify with individuals more strongly than they identify with corporate issues. In addition, even after controlling for cognitive complexity, they may consider counterarguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al., 2004</xref>) in their decisions. However, we found a significant, positive effect for Black boycotts related to South Africa.</p>
<p>Consistent with our expectations, more educated respondents were more likely to support environmental and liberal boycotts. We revisited our data for insight into why economically marginalized respondents were more likely to support environmental boycotts than wealthy respondents. The highest support for these boycotts came from respondents in the lower middle class to middle class categories. The specific category varied a bit across the target firms. Our middle class respondents may see boycotting as the most viable coercive action and have sufficient resources to substitute the products of these specific firms with questionable environmental records. Higher income individuals may be better able to pursue other coercive or cooperative actions in support of the environment, such as donating to environmental NGOs, redirecting their attention from boycotting. Or, they may not perceive the environmental issues of these firms as egregious. This issue merits further research.</p>

<title>Contributions and Implications</title>
<p>Our application of marginalization and cognitive complexity contributes to theory, methods, and practice. We showed that marginalization theory can unify and integrate prior boycott research, supporting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0007650309352507">Rowley and Moldoveanu’s (2003)</xref> proposal that interest and identity influence stakeholder group mobilization. We complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0007650309352507">Frooman and Murrell’s (2005)</xref> research on stakeholder influence strategies by identifying a mechanism by which demographic groups react to marginalization. In addition, although individuals may boycott products of firms whose actions they consider illegitimate, organized boycotts provide informational cues via institutional intermediaries that direct social attention to these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0007650309352507">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We joined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">Klein et al. (2004)</xref> in studying actual social movement support through boycott experience, as opposed to stated ideological support, narrowing a research gap noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0007650309352507">Barkan (2004)</xref>. By linking marginalization theory to boycotting and including marginalized groups underrepresented in management science research, such as Hispanics and Native Americans, we also refine knowledge of practical support and social movement theory and fill empirical research gaps. Our findings support evidence in other domains that neither researchers nor practitioners can generalize from Blacks to other races (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0007650309352507">Newburry et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our major empirical contribution is combining individual and firm-level data into a single model to provide a more thorough analysis of the interplay of marginalization and strategic issues than studying individuals and firms separately. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no one has previously examined boycotting behavior using a representative sample of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>Managers must not only identify which social issues are strategic issues but also whether these issues present threats or opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0007650309352507">Jackson &amp; Dutton, 1988</xref>). Understanding which groups (e.g., Native Americans and more educated respondents in our study) are more likely to boycott and which strategic boycotts are likely to influence actual behavior (e.g., labor boycotts in our study) are critical in such activities. Consumer boycotts may be an early signal of changing social norms, such as in the cases of environmentalism and tobacco. With 37.9% of our respondents boycotting over the <italic>prior year</italic>, boycotting is a social action that should not be dismissed. Some respondents continued to boycott some firms even though the protest had a formal ending. For example, the boycott of U.S. firms with South African investments officially ended on September 24, 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0007650309352507">Kumar et al., 2002</xref>). Yet African American respondents, in particular, reported boycotting these firms in 1999. Boycott leaders also should attend to and frame issues for groups most likely to identify with the issue to increase their actions’ efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0007650309352507">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>We need to recognize some limitations and potential extensions to our results. Although our dataset is representative of the U.S. population, it is limited to firms with very visible reputations. Visible firms are subject to more organized boycotts because boycott organizers perceive them to be most vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0007650309352507">Friedman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0007650309352507">Innes, 2006</xref>). However, given the requirements of public polling, incorporating both a representative sample of the U.S. population with a random sample of firms would be difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0007650309352507">Asher, 2004</xref>). In addition, social desirability bias may exist in our self-reported boycott data. Although several aspects of the data collection method lead us to believe this bias has been minimized, as noted earlier, this potential influence on our results exists.</p>
<p>Other limitations provide ample opportunities for extension. Although we find evidence indicating invisible social identity importance (e.g., socioeconomic status, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0007650309352507">Clair, Beatty, &amp; MacLean, 2005</xref>), our data lacks other potentially important invisible sources of social marginalization, such as religion or sexual orientation, that might influence boycotting. Our study is one of the first quantitative ones to include Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. Yet a more fine-grained analysis capturing country of origin as opposed to race could explore how immigrants face different levels of marginalization, assimilation, and acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0007650309352507">Sam &amp; Berry, 2006</xref>). Using direct measures of marginalization rather than demographic proxies would be a next step.</p>
<p>The intersection of marginalization/demographic characteristics such as gender and race-ethnicity or socioeconomic status and race-ethnicity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0007650309352507">Howard, 2000</xref>) would be interesting because patterns of results may differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0007650309352507">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>). Future research might also examine conflicting identities or tensions between personal and social identities with respect to boycotting behavior (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0007650309352507">Kreiner, Hollensbe, &amp; Sheep, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We included boycotts reported in the three U.S. newspapers with the broadest circulation (consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0007650309352507">King, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0007650309352507">King &amp; Soule, 2007</xref>). Local papers also may report local boycotts affecting respondents’ behavior although these boycotts’ effects may be difficult to predict. These may be considered more trivial in nature and produce less support. Alternatively, these boycotts may tap issues particularly relevant to a local community and thus produce strong local results that may be less visible nationally or within the overall profitability of a large firm. Thus the effects of smaller boycotts warrant future examination.</p>
<p>Additional details about boycott lifecycle, sponsorship, and purpose could provide insight into which firms are targeted, who responds, and achievement of stated goals, building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0007650309352507">King (2008a)</xref>. Because many threats are resolved prior to reaching the full boycott stage, examining specific elements related to boycott threats, announcements, and resolutions may contribute to our understanding of boycotting behavior in general. In addition, boycotts organized in reaction to specific incidents may more effectively trigger identities based on marginalization, and thus support, than those comprising a social interest group or an NGO’s agenda, such as Greenpeace or Reverend Jackson’s Operation PUSH.</p>
<p>Because marginalization occurs in most societies and marginalization theory has been cross-culturally validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0007650309352507">Price &amp; Feinman, 1995</xref>), scholars also might study variation in boycotting across institutional environments. National institutional structures vary in the degree to which they marginalize, as well as in marginalization victims. National culture influences strategic issue interpretation and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0007650309352507">Schneider &amp; De Meyer, 1991</xref>) and environmental behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0007650309352507">Hunter et al., 2004</xref>). Anecdotal evidence suggests that organized boycotts are more effective in some Western European nations, such as Germany, than the United States. With the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0007650309352507">Klein et al. (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0007650309352507">2004</xref>), few have examined boycotting cross-nationally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0007650309352507">Meijer and Schuyt (2005)</xref> noted differences in corporate social performance (CSP) expectations in the Netherlands and the United States. In the United States, CSP motivates product purchase, but in the Netherlands, CSP must meet a minimum acceptable level to prevent boycotting.</p>
<p>In addition, technology continues to evolve and ease boycott organization and corporate information distribution. Future research can expand from print media to online protest tactics, such as the role of blogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0007650309352507">Martin &amp; Kracher, 2008</xref>) and social networking sites. As of March 2009, more than 200 groups on the social networking site, Facebook, contained <italic>boycott</italic> in their names.</p>
<p>Finally, our interaction results were limited by the number of boycotts for specific categories. Regarding interaction effects in general, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0007650309352507">Aguinis (1995)</xref> highlights the challenges of finding significant interaction effects when there are “unequal sample size[s] across moderator-based subsamples” (p. 1148). In such instances, moderating effects are rarely spurious but effects that exist may not be demonstrated statistically. Combined with our focus on boycott participation in the <italic>past year</italic>, our analysis and results can be considered conservative.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, boycotting is an effort to punish or alter corporate strategy by reducing financial performance through sales revenue. Media and technology advances have provided opportunities for boycott organizers to distribute their message to a broader audience. We demonstrated that marginalization theory and issue diagnosis can integrate research on boycotting. We explored the tension between economic and social marginalization to better understand motives for boycotting. Synthesizing our study results, a likely boycotter may be someone who has socially marginal roots but is economically upwardly mobile.</p>
