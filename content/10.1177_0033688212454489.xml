<p>Here follows a synopsis of this August 2012 issue:</p>
<p>In <italic>Reading Aloud Activity in L2 and Cerebral Activation</italic>, Osamu Takeuchi, Maiko Ikeda, and Atsushi Mizumoto report on two studies using the brain-imaging technique of near-infrared spectroscopy to determine a cerebral basis for the effectiveness of reading aloud activities. Among areas they investigate are differences in learner proficiency, the difficulty of the materials being read, and the effect of repeatedly reading the same passage aloud. Among their results are the findings that reading aloud in L2 results in a higher degree of cerebral activation than does reading aloud in L1, that reading material beyond a learners’ L2 ability results in low brain activation, and that while repetition as such has little effect, if the material being repeated is cognitively demanding, then it does result in high brain activation.</p>
<p>In <italic>Should we Teach Semantic Prosody Awareness?</italic>, Iain McGee discusses the fact that while attention has been paid to the collocational competence of language learners, the related concept of semantic prosody awareness has been neglected until now. After introducing the concept, he presents data for items from corpus linguistics to demonstrate that while native speakers concur about the semantic prose tendencies of these items, non-native speakers differ in their appreciation of these objects. This suggests that semantic prosody awareness may not develop in learners, and that, if it does so, it does so incrementally. This, in turn, suggests that explicit classroom instruction about semantic prosody can be of value.</p>
<p>In <italic>Planned Focus on Form: Automatization of Procedural Knowledge</italic>, Mohammad Khatib and Majid Nikouee start with the premise that declarative knowledge can be automatized through practice and examine the extent to which knowledge of the present perfect can be automatized two days after practice and can be retained two weeks after practice. Working with two groups of subjects, both of which received rule explanation, mechanical practice, and meaningful practice, but only one of which also received planned communicative practice, they found that the latter displayed both reduced error rate and improved reaction time.</p>
<p>In <italic>Alleviating Test Anxiety for Students of Advanced Reading Comprehension</italic>, Marsha Bensoussan discusses the fact that both students and teachers are frustrated when test anxiety interferes with reliable assessment of levels of language learning. While prior research has found significant inverse relations between anxiety and written test performance, there have been few suggestions for treating and coping with test anxiety. Having collected students’ suggestions for improving their feelings about tests, she then presents an advanced reading comprehension EFL class as an example of a way to apply theories and recommendations for reducing test taking anxiety.</p>
<p>In <italic>Polite Requestive Strategies in Emails: An Investigation of Pragmatic Competence of Chinese EFL Learners</italic>, Wuhan Zhu studies two groups of Chinese university students, English majors and non-English majors, to see whether situational factors such as assessment of social distance or power and rank of imposition have a statistically significant effect on the requesting strategies they use. He finds that both groups exhibit inadequate socio-pragmatic competence and pragma-linguistic knowledge, thus shedding important light on inter-language pragmatics in the Chinese EFL context.</p>
<p>In <italic>Six Functions of Bilingual EFL Teacher Talk</italic>, Ross Forman focuses on “teacher talk” in the context where L2 is confined to the classroom and teachers share L1 with their students. He establishes six broad descriptive categories for teacher talk in bilingual language learning classrooms, namely: animating, translating, explaining, creating, prompting, and dialoguing.</p>
<p>In <italic>Tuning in to Vocabulary Frequency in Coursebooks</italic>, Richard O’Loughlin analyzes beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels of EFL coursebooks using the computer program <italic>VocabProfile.</italic> His results suggest that learners who complete contemporary coursebook series will be exposed to fewer than the first 1,500 most frequent words in English. This clearly has important pedagogical implications as commercially published coursebooks are the sole source of vocabulary learning for many learners.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Potency of ‘READS’ to Inform Students’ Reading Ability</italic>, Shaik Abdul Malik Mohamed Ismail reports on an initiative conducted in Malaysia to gauge students’ real “reading ages.” His study incorporated READS (Reading Evaluation and Decoding System) to ascertain students’ reading ages and comprehension skills at both macro and micro levels and to provide descriptors for what students have achieved so far and what struggling readers lack.</p>
<p>Finally, Stephen Krashen provides us with a Viewpoint article warning us about the dangers of <italic>Academic Jibberish</italic>. After discussing the causes of excessive jargon (as a career strategy to impress those with little self-confidence and/or to deflect criticism), he discusses the negative consequences of jargon: first and foremost, it is a waste of time and energy, but more insidiously, it may, on the one hand, enable bad ideas to survive, while it may also, on the other hand, bury good ideas.</p>
<p>Then, to conclude the issue, Christopher Ward provides a review of Keith Polette’s <italic>Teaching Grammar Through Writing</italic>.</p>
<p>Let me close by announcing once again that henceforth each April issue of the <italic>RELC Journal</italic> will have a special theme. The April 2013 issue, to be guest edited together with Mahmood Reza Atai, will be devoted to the state of language study, teaching, and research in Iran. As all of the articles submitted so far have had to do with EFL in the Iranian context, I would like to put out a call for papers concerning the teaching and learning of other languages in Iran, and most especially for papers concerning the teaching and learning of Persian as a foreign language.</p>
