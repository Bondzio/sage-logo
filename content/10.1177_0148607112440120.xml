<p><italic>Background</italic>: The effect of parenteral nutrition (PN) support supplemented with ω-3 fatty acids was investigated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: Ninety-eight patients with the diagnosis of end-stage liver disease or hepatic cellular carcinoma were admitted for orthotopic liver transplantation at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: diet group (n = 32), PN group (n = 33), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) group (n = 33). Patients in the PN and PUFA groups received isocaloric and isonitrogenous PN for 7 days after surgery. Venous heparin blood samples were obtained for assay on days 2 and 9 after surgery. A pathological test was performed after reperfusion of the donor liver and on day 9. <italic>Results</italic>: Alanine aminotransferase levels were improved significantly by PUFA treatment compared with traditional PN support (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Compared with the results on day 9 in the PN group, a significant difference was seen in the extent of increase of the prognostic nutrition index and prealbumin in the PUFA group. The pathological results also showed that ω-3 fatty acid supplementation reduced hepatic cell injury.

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Nutrition support supplemented with ω-3 fatty acids has been more and more widely used in investigating the protective effects on hepatic ischemia and reperfusion injury and in inflammatory responses. In this study, we have shown that posttransplant parenteral nutrition support can greatly improve metabolism of protein and nutrition states of patients. ω-3 fatty acid-supplemented parenteral nutrition significantly reduces injury of the transplanted liver, decreases the incidence of infectious morbidities, and shortens posttransplant hospital stay. These findings are clinically relevant for guiding surgeons in perioperative medications in liver transplantation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Liver transplantation has dramatically changed the prognosis, morbidity, and mortality of patients with end-stage liver diseases. With improvements in surgical techniques and reduction of complications related to the surgery, perioperative medications have become more and more important in liver transplantation. Most liver transplantation candidates present to the hospital with malnutrition due to severe metabolic alterations. Such a nutrition state greatly affects postoperative metabolism, organ function, and inflammatory reactions. The function of the transplanted liver is harmed inevitably by warm ischemia, cold ischemia, and reperfusion injury. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of the liver is an event involving many factors such as the generation of oxygen free radicals, Kupffer cell activation, release of inflammatory cytokines, and leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112440120">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112440120">2</xref></sup> Based on the pathophysiology of hepatic I/R injury, the current perioperative approaches focus on protecting the liver from inflammatory reactions and microcirculatory disturbance.</p>
<p>ω-3 (N-3) fatty acids are essential, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) derived from fish oil. ω-3 fatty acids mainly occur as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), both of which are anti-inflammatory. Supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids may downregulate proinflammatory cytokine production and modulate eicosanoid synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112440120">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112440120"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112440120">5</xref></sup> Nutrition support supplemented with ω-3 fatty acids has been proven to be beneficial in reducing postoperative infectious complications and length of hospital stay among patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery, especially in those who were malnourished preoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112440120">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112440120">7</xref></sup> Nutrition support supplemented with ω-3 fatty acids has been more and more widely used in investigating the protective effects on hepatic I/R injury and in inflammatory responses. In this study, we investigate whether parenteral nutrition (PN) supplemented with ω-3 fish oil lipid emulsion improves synthetic function and reduces graft injury after orthotopic liver transplantation.</p>

<title>Patients and Randomization</title>
<p>From January 2006 to July 2010, 98 patients were admitted for orthotopic liver transplantation in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery at the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, China, where the authors work. These patients were randomized into 3 posttransplant groups based on the randomization chart generated by the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, Cary, NC): (1) routine treatment and oral diet without additional nutrition support therapy (diet group, 32 patients), (2) PN without supplementation of ω-3 fatty acids in addition to routine treatment and oral diet (PN group, 33 patients), and (3) PN supplemented with ω-3 fatty acids in addition to routine treatment and oral diet (PUFA group, 33 patients). The clinical diagnosis of these patients included hepatic cell carcinoma (39 cases), post–type B hepatitis liver cirrhosis (52 cases), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (2 cases), primary biliary liver cirrhosis (3 cases), drug-induced hepatic dysfunction (1 case), and congenital polycystic liver (1 case).</p>
<p>Demographic and clinical data (including age, sex, Child-Pugh classification of hepatic function, operation duration, anhepatic phase, and postoperative immunosuppression therapy) are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112440120">Table 1</xref>. The difference between the operation duration and anhepatic phase was not significant among the 3 groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Recipients with manifest metabolic diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism) or severe renal abnormality were excluded. No acute rejection, primary transplanted liver dysfunction, or second operation, which may have affected evaluation of liver function and nutrition status, was seen during the first 9 days posttransplantation. The selection criteria for donors in this study included the following: (1) age &lt;50 years, matched ABO blood group, and no history of chronic liver disease; (2) no evidence of malignant tumor, viral hepatitis, or other virus infection; (3) no cirrhosis, mass, or fatty degeneration of the donor liver seen during organ harvesting; and (4) the normal pathologic diagnosis of biopsy of the donor liver. This was a randomized, controlled clinical study carried out in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery according to the principles and guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 2000. The protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital. Voluntary informed consent of the patients was obtained prior to study enrollment.</p>

<title>Treatment</title>
<p>PN was given around the clock for 7 days from the second day after surgery. The diets of the 2 nutrition support groups were isonitrogenous and isocaloric: nitrogen intake was 0.16 g/kg body weight/d, caloric intake was 104.5 kJ/kg/d, and lipid intake was 1.0 g/kg/d. The nonprotein calories were given as dextrose (4.0 g/kg/d) and fat emulsion in a ratio of 2:1. The only source of lipids in the PN group was the standard lipid emulsion (20% emulsion, long-chain triglycerides/medium-chain triglycerides 1:1; Huarui Pharmaceuticals, Jiangsu, China). In the PUFA group, ω-3 fish oil lipid emulsion (Omegaven, 10%, 2 mL/kg/d; Fresenius Kabi Co, Graz, Austria) replaced part of the standard lipid emulsion. Patients in the PN and PUFA groups received 1.0 g amino acids/kg/d, administered as a commercially available branched-chain amino acid solution (20%; Huarui Pharmaceuticals). The proportion of nonprotein calories with nitrogen in both nutrition support groups was 653 kJ/1 g. The ω-3 fish oil lipid emulsion–containing solutions were prepared by a clinical pharmacist under aseptic conditions and adjusted to the weight of each individual patient. The amino acids, fat emulsion, and dextrose mixture with electrolytes, vitamins, and trace elements were administered through a central venous catheter. During the postoperative period, the patients in the diet group received 10% dextrose (4 g/kg/d) and normal saline with a volume and sodium content approximately equal to those of the fluid given to the patients in both nutrition groups. The caloric intake in the diet group was 66.9 kJ/kg/d. As soon as bowel function returned on day 3 or 4 posttransplantation, all patients in all 3 groups received liquid carbohydrate and cow’s milk protein.</p>
<p>The surgical treatment was standardized: modified piggyback orthotopic liver transplantation performed by 3 groups of surgeons using the same technique. Postoperatively, all the patients received the same antibiotics and antiviral drugs, and 20 g serum albumin was given intravenously daily for 5 days to all 3 groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148607112440120">
<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Venous heparin blood samples were obtained on day −1 (the day before transplantation) and days 2 and 9 after surgery. Three types of measurement were carried out. First, a liver function assessment was carried out, which included measurements of serum total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Liver function was determined by an automatic biochemistry analyzer (HITACHI 7600). Second, a nutrition-associated assessment was carried out, which included serum albumin, prealbumin (PAB), total protein, transferrin (TF), and total lymphocyte counting (TLC). Serum albumin, PAB, total protein, and TF were determined by an automatic biochemistry analyzer (Hitachi 7600; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). TLC was performed by an automatic blood cell analyzer (Coulter STKS; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). The prognosis nutrition index (PNI) was calculated as PNI = 0.005 × TLC (10<sup>6</sup>/L) + serum albumin (g/L). The normal value of PNI is more than 50. A PNI value &lt;40 indicates malnutrition. Finally, measurements of serum immunoglobulins (including IgG, IgA, and IgM) and complements (including C3 and C4) were determined by an automatic biochemistry analyzer (Hitachi 7600).</p>
<p>Liver biopsy was conducted with a fine needle after reperfusion of the donor liver and on day 9 after surgery, respectively. Hepatic specimens for light microscopy were fixed with formalin and then embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination.</p>
<p>The assessment of clinical outcome was based on posttransplant investigations concerning anabolic recovery after transplantation as shown by (1) posttransplant mechanical ventilation, (2) total hospital stay, (3) incidence of infectious morbidities (pneumonia, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis, central line sepsis, wound infection, and urinary tract infection), (4) acute or chronic rejection, and (5) mortality (intensive care unit [ICU] mortality, hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, and survival 1 year posttransplant).</p>
<p>Sepsis is defined as the association of a panoply of nonspecific inflammatory responses with evidence or suspicion of a microbial origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112440120">8</xref></sup> These posttransplant parameters were investigated and documented during the patients’ posttransplant hospital stay daily and at postoperative follow-up sessions 28 days and 1 year posttransplant.</p>

<sec id="section7-0148607112440120">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Results are expressed as mean ± SD. Numerical data were analyzed with SAS. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) test was used for multiple comparison to test the effect of time, groups, and the interaction between the time and groups. A <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered significant.</p>

<p>Preoperative malnutrition, stress of the surgical procedure, immunosuppressive therapy, and I/R hepatic injury are all factors that contribute to a persistent catabolic state in the short term in the posttransplant period after liver transplantation.

Although most transplant centers use posttransplant nutrition support for other major abdominal surgery, experience with nutrition support after liver transplantation still remains limited.</p>
<p>Most candidates for liver transplantation have liver cirrhosis. Insulin resistance occurs in nearly all patients with cirrhosis. Consequently, 60%–80% of such candidates are glucose intolerant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112440120">11</xref></sup> Branched-chain amino acids were chosen for this study because they promote protein synthesis in patients with chronic liver disease and avoid the additional metabolic load of the transplanted liver itself, especially in the immediate postoperative period when liver function is abnormal and oral intake is withheld.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112440120">12</xref></sup> Medium-chain triglycerides were included in the regimen to avert glucose intolerance and deposits in the transplanted liver. PAB and TF, which are more sensitive than serum albumin for evaluating protein synthesis of the liver because of their shorter half-lives, were elevated in both the nutrition support groups (PN and PUFA groups). Significant decreases of ALT, TB, and DB levels were observed on day 9 in all 3 groups, with greater significant difference being observed in both the PN and PUFA groups. Significantly decreased posttransplant hospital stay was also observed in the 2 treated groups. On the basis of these results, we have shown that posttransplant nutrition support in the form of a solution enriched with branched-chain amino acids, dextrose, and medium-chain triglycerides might offer a benefit in terms of better protein synthesis and preserved liver function in liver transplant patients.</p>
<p>Ischemia and reperfusion of the donor liver causes a rapid release—a so-called oxidative burst—of reactive oxygen species and activates a variety of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor–α, interleukin-6, endothelin, and prostanoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112440120">13</xref></sup> Supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids may downregulate proinflammatory cytokine production and modulate eicosanoid synthesis. The latter molecules lead to the production of vasodilators with less proinflammatory response than their n-6 counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112440120">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112440120"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112440120"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112440120">17</xref></sup> In our findings, there were greater significant decreases of ALT, AST, TB, DB, and LDH levels observed on day 9 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) in the PUFA group compared with the other 2 groups. The results of histological examination on day 9 revealed marked amelioration of hepatocyte injury and inflammatory cell aggregation in the PUFA group. PUFA therapy could also decrease the incidence of infectious morbidities and shorten the posttransplant hospital stay significantly. The possible mechanisms of ω-3 fatty acids include downregulation of the inflammatory responses to surgery and immune modulation rather than a sole nutrition effect.</p>
<p>ω-3 fatty acids have been shown to modulate the immune response and augment the host immune defenses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112440120">18</xref></sup> Moreover, the effect of ω-3 fatty acids on the immunological function of receptors is of value in posttransplant nutrition support. The measurements of humoral immunity (including IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C4) in this study showed no significant difference among the 3 groups. From this finding, it seems that there is no effect of PN and ω-3 fatty acids on the humoral immunity of receptors. However, the immunological status of patients after transplantation is complex because of multiple factors, such as use of various kinds of immunologic suppression drugs. Therefore, accurate evaluation of the effects of PN and ω-3 fatty acids needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Enteral nutrition is a safer alternative to PN and has the potential advantage of maintaining intestinal trophism more effectively. This effect may help prevent bacterial translocation and enteric-origin infections in patients with cirrhosis. All patients in this study resumed their usual oral diet postoperatively as soon as bowel function returned to maintain intestinal trophism. However, the recipients could not endure a large volume of liquid diet in the early phase after transplantation because of obvious abdominal pain, distention, or diarrhea.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that posttransplant PN support can greatly improve the metabolism of protein and nutrition states of patients. Moreover, ω-3 fatty acid–supplemented PN significantly reduces injury of the transplanted liver, decreases the incidence of infectious morbidities, and shortens the posttransplant hospital stay.</p>
