<abstract>
<p>This article describes a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected jail detainees cared for at the Cook County Jail Clinic (CCJC), Illinois, between January and June 2007. Continuity care engagement (CCE) was defined as being seen at least once within 6 months after release at the designated continuity clinics. Being highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) naïve during or prior to detention, no prior HIV care, and detectable viral load at initial CCJC visit were associated with continuity care nonengagement (CCNE), while being HAART naïve during detention was the only independent predictor for CCNE. Identification of at-risk detainees and interventions based on these findings should be considered to improve CCE in this population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in correctional facilities is about 3 times that of the general population in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812458246">Maruschak, 2008</xref>). At least 8% of all HIV-infected individuals in the United States are currently in jail or prison and one fourth have passed through a correctional facility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458246">White, Tulsky, Estes, Jamison, &amp; Long, 2008</xref>). Despite the high prevalence of HIV infection, HIV care for the incarcerated population is limited by available resources in each individual correctional facility. Resource constraints may lead to inadequate HIV screening, lack of HIV exposure prevention strategies, and lack of discharge planning for HIV follow-up and continuity care in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812458246">Maruschak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458246">Spaulding et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The short-term stays associated with the jail setting pose obstacles for HIV screening, treatment, and prevention, while HIV long-term and comprehensive management is more amenable to the prison setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812458246">Maruschak, 2008</xref>). In addition, the large number of jail admissions, rapid turnover, and frequent court appearances of detainees limit the opportunities for jail physicians to evaluate and treat detainees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812458246">Basu, Smith-Rohrberg, Hanck, &amp; Altice, 2005</xref>). Although discharge plans may be established prior to the release of detainees, numerous factors frequently impede adherence to follow-up, such as social and financial difficulties, substance abuse, reincarceration, underlying mental health disorders, and transportation problems. Furthermore, there is limited data on linkage to continuity care after release among HIV-infected jail detainees.</p>
<p>Since long-term continuity care is critical in HIV management, effort to increase the rate of continuity care engagement (CCE) after release among the detainees is needed. The aims of this study were to describe characteristics of HIV-infected jail detainees and determine characteristics that will predict whether the detainees follow up with medical care after release.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1078345812458246">
<title>Study Design, Setting, and Population</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted among all HIV-infected individuals who presented to the Cook County Jail Clinic (CCJC), Chicago, Illinois, after intake between January 1, 2007, and June 30, 2007. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Cook County Bureau of Health Services (CCBHS) and University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). At the time of the study, Cook County Jail was the largest single-site jail in the United States and on average housed 9,000 to 11,000 detainees in its 15 divisions. The prevalence of HIV infection was 2.6% in 2001 [unpublished data, Chad Zawitz, 2010]. HIV diagnosis at intake was made by a positive antibody screening test using serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a subsequent confirmatory Western blot, taken from all detainees during a mandatory anonymous surveillance study over a 1-week period. All detainees with HIV infection were then referred to CCJC for further evaluation and management by an infectious disease specialist. Following medical evaluation, all HIV-infected jail detainees underwent an intensive case management and discharge planning session with a reentry coordinator. Mental health, substance abuse issues, housing, and other discharge concerns were documented and referrals were placed to appropriate ancillary service providers as indicated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078345812458246">
<title>Jail Clinic Protocol</title>
<p>Approximately 150 newly diagnosed and more than 1,200 known HIV-infected detainees present to CCJC per year. A comprehensive history, physical examination, and laboratory testing, including CD4+ T-cell count and HIV RNA (ribonucleic acid), are performed as the standard of care at each initial visit. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is continued in detainees who have been stable and whose diseases have been controlled on the regimen. At the second visit 2 weeks later, opportunistic infection prophylaxis is initiated according to the national HIV guidelines (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345812458246">CDC], 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345812458246">Panel, 2009</xref>). The initiation and specific regimen of HAART is individualized to each detainee’s unique clinical, social, and community considerations, as well as patient readiness, allergies, underlying diseases, and criteria according to the national guidelines. All detainees who establish care with CCJC are followed up every 1 to 3 months until they are released from the jail. A reentry coordinator at CCJC oversees comprehensive discharge planning (housing, transportation, family and financial support, and substance abuse treatment) for these detainees and offers them referral to the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center clinic (CCC) or UIC clinic (UICC), designated continuity clinics for released detainees. Detainees with prior HIV care at facilities other than CCC/UICC can choose to go back to their previous continuity clinics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078345812458246">
<title>Data Collection and Definition</title>
<p>Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were obtained by review of CCJC paper charts and CCBHS electronic medical records. For this study, CCE was defined as being seen at least once within 6 months at CCC/UICC after the release. Since there have been no previous published data or guidelines that define CCE, the postrelease 6-month time period was chosen based on expert opinion from correctional care physicians (C.Z. and J.Y.). This period of time would allow for the detainees to manage postjail socioeconomic difficulties and be able to establish HIV care. Detainees with prior HIV care outside CCC/UICC or who were reincarcerated within 6 months of the release were excluded from the final cohort analysis, which determined predictors of continuity care nonengagement (CCNE).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078345812458246">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were performed using SPSS, version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois). Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s exact test. Both tests were used to detect the difference in categorical characteristics between the study groups. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. <italic>p</italic> Values less than .05 were considered statistically significant. Variables that were present in more than 10% of patients at a significance level of <italic>p </italic>&lt; .20 were entered into stepwise logistic regression models. Significant variables that were thought to be covariates were grouped, and only one variable from each group was chosen for model entry. The model’s overall robustness was confirmed by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. Adjusted odd ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to identify independent characteristics associated with CCNE.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We identified 172 HIV-infected detainees during the study period. Their demographics and characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458246">Table 1</xref>. Median age was 42 years. Most of the detainees were male (77%), Black (84%), and used alcohol (72%) and tobacco (77%). The two most common concomitant diseases were chronic hepatitis C (24%) and depression (20%). Most commonly reported risk factors for becoming HIV infected were unprotected sex (83%) and injection drug use (37%). One-hundred thirty-four detainees (78%) had received prior HIV care; 71 were CCC patients, 10 were UICC patients, and 53 were patients of other facilities. Among 125 detainees who had been on HAART prior to detention, only 60 (48%) had undetectable plasma HIV RNA. All but 1 detainee (124 of the 125) were continued on HAART during detention (1 refused therapy). Of 47 treatment-naïve detainees, HAART was initiated in 8 (17%). The remaining 39 detainees did not receive HAART due to CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 350 cells/µl (24), release prior to the second CCJC visit (13), or refusing HAART (2).</p>

<p>Of the 172 HIV-infected detainees, 77 were excluded from the final analysis (38 received prior HIV care outside CCC, 38 were sent to prison, and 1 was still in detention at the time of medical record review). There were 95 detainees in the final cohort. Characteristics of the final cohort and excluded detainees were similar except that the excluded population had significantly longer length of stay in the jail and were more likely to be on HAART prior to detention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458246">Table 1</xref>). Among the final cohort detainees, we compared characteristics between those with CCNE and CCE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078345812458246">Table 2</xref>). Both populations had received similar social service and education interventions appropriate for their educational status before release. Being HAART naïve during or prior to detention, no previous HIV care, and detectable viral load at initial CCJC visit were associated with CCNE. In multivariate analysis, three variables were chosen to enter the final model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078345812458246">Table 3</xref>). Being HAART naïve during detention was the only independent predictor for CCNE (aOR 5.92; 95% CI [2.16, 16.24]; <italic>p </italic>= .001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The benefits of HIV continuity care and noninterrupted HAART on AIDS-related morbidity and mortality among incarcerated populations have been demonstrated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345812458246">CDC, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812458246">Maruschak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458246">Pai, Estes, Moodie, Reingold, &amp; Tulsky, 2009</xref>). However, arrangement for continuity care and HAART are complicated in this population. In our study, 31% of the detainees did not establish continuity care with the designated continuity clinics. We found that no previous HIV care, detectable HIV RNA viral load at first visit to the jail clinic, and being HAART naïve prior to and during detention were significantly associated with CCNE. However, only being HAART naïve during detention was found to be a significant independent predictor of CCNE. One possible explanation is that the detainees who are not on HAART perceive themselves as healthy persons and thus would think that HIV continuity care is not necessary.</p>
<p>Another important aim of our study was to describe social and demographic characteristics of HIV-infected detainees in a county jail. Previous studies indicated that a high proportion of HIV-infected jail detainees lacked social support, lived alone, had fair quality of life, participated in unprotected sex, and were not consistently compliant with HAART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345812458246">Clements-Nolle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458246">Pai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458246">White et al., 2008</xref>). In our cohort, we found high rates of active substance use, chronic hepatitis C, and psychiatric disorders. More than 50% of the detainees who had been on HAART did not achieve undetectable HIV RNA. Altogether, these findings suggest that multidisciplinary approaches combining the expertise of infectious diseases physicians, psychiatrists, social workers, case managers, and health educators are needed. Interventions by these specialists should be provided in a comprehensive manner, and soon enough before release since staying in jails may be the only opportunity for some detainees to receive this comprehensive HIV care and education.</p>
<p>There were some recognizable limitations in our study. First, misclassification and recall bias could occur due to the retrospective nature of the study. Some of the detainees might choose to see a physician in a non-CCC/UICC facility unknown to us despite being referred to CCC/UICC and would thus be misclassified into the CCNE group. However, CCC is the most easily accessible and affordable facility for these detainees and, according to our CCJC and CCC data, more than 85% of the referred detainees eventually were seen at CCC within 18 months after release. Thus, the misclassification bias should minimally affect our findings. Second, the small sample size may limit the power to detect other potential risk factors for CCNE, such as alcohol use, injection drug use, and psychiatric disorders. Finally, we excluded a significant number of detainees from the final analysis. However, the final cohort population should well represent the whole study population, given that its characteristics were similar to those of the excluded population.</p>
<p>Efforts to optimize long-term HIV care in incarcerated populations are urgently required. Interventions based on predictors of CCNE should be prospectively studied and implemented to improve CCE. Attention should be focused on detainees who are not on HAART, given that establishing HAART earlier may have the benefit of increasing the likelihood of CCE. Increased CCE among the former jail detainees will allow physicians to provide comprehensive, high-quality HIV care to improve HIV outcomes in this population.</p>
