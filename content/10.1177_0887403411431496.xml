<p>What is a crime? Who is a criminal? I admit to being drawn to the field of criminology when these questions were posed for analysis in the very first course I took as an undergraduate. I remember the intimidating size of the lecture hall, I remember the large number of students, but most of all I remember how the instructor expertly peeled away the layers of complexity on what seemed, at least at first blush, such simple questions to answer. I often find myself thinking back to this moment, especially when I encounter my own students taking their first tentative steps into criminology. In those first few classes together, I attempt to convey something of the deep intellectual curiosity I felt when I was first challenged to think seriously about what we define as crime and whom we define as criminal. Serious, ongoing attention is exactly what these questions deserve; exploring them reveals a great deal about the phenomenon of crime, about our political institutions, about our values, and, ultimately, about our society.</p>
<p>On reading John Hagan’s <italic>Who Are the Criminals?</italic> one finds yet another insightful work by a scholar whose career has so clearly been animated by these very same questions. In this study, Hagan turns his attention to the politics of crime; more specifically, to “the way politicians engage with citizens, academics, and policy makers to shape our thoughts about crime and its control” (p. 1). The book advances three arguments: first, crime policies in America reflect an interaction between politics and ideas; second, the different emphases on “street crimes” and financial crimes in the age of Roosevelt (1933-1973) and the age of Reagan (1974-2008) have had profound implications for class and race inequality; and third, the growth of the prison system has <italic>combined</italic> [emphasis in original] with deregulation of the economy in the age of Reagan to impose unsustainable costs on the United States (p. 2).</p>
<p>Hagan builds these arguments by documenting how shifts in U.S. politics and society have elevated the fear of street crime as <italic>the</italic> critical focus of criminal justice policy. This, he asserts, has transformed what is commonly perceived as harmful conduct; influenced the direction of criminology; reconfigured the size and scope of the penal system; affected the quest for social justice; and, finally, altered the standing of the United States in the world. What concerns Hagan is that both major political parties have adopted a similar posture toward the punishment of street crime and the deregulation of business (p. 9). The fact that politically expedient stances on street crime have been consistently rewarded with electoral triumphs makes criminal justice reform an uphill struggle. But that does not mean that crime and criminals cannot be reframed in a manner that more accurately reflects what is truly harmful. The key, as he writes early on, is to “redistribute the risks and punishments of street and suite crimes in America” (p. 3). The book is timely. The dire economic situation we find ourselves in at the end of 2011 provides a distressing lesson on the consequences of deregulation. And with governments across the United States now forced to implement drastic budget cuts, the search for cost savings has forced even the most conservative states to begin to downsize their prison systems. Together, these two trends may provide the catalyst for what Hagan desires, but it is by no means a certainty. With this in mind, it is indeed appropriate to “engage citizens and criminologists alike—in a process of change” (p. 9).</p>
<p>Those who read this book—and I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the politics of crime control—will find that it provides something valuable: historical perspective. As someone whose own research agenda has shifted toward studying the hypermarginalization and criminalization of the undocumented, it was very useful to read chapter 2, which traces how the fear of immigrants is a thread that connects today’s immigration enforcement policies with those that were pursued in the 1920s. The tactics and strategies of social control may be different, but the underlying fear, one that is stoked for political gain, remains central to understanding this troubling phenomenon. Fear of the urban “inner-city” street criminal (note that I am deliberately using the cynical color coded description) has been similarly exploited for political gain, creating a crime control industry that is arguably one of Ronald Reagan’s most controversial and lasting legacies. Or perhaps it is one of Barry Goldwater’s legacies or Lyndon Johnson’s or Richard Nixon’s. In documenting the roots of today’s crime control policy orientation, Hagan deftly connects all of these political actors, contextualizing their specific political calculus in this policy field. Regrettably, “the lesson is that fear trumps hope in the American crime equation, and in particular it does so through its designations of crime and punishment” (p. 41).</p>
<p>The rest of chapter 2 lays out a pyramidal conception of crime, a dynamic framework for categorizing crime that is influenced by fear of the behavior involved (p. 45). Drawing on numerous examples, including a discussion of the infamous torture memo drafted during the Bush administration and the dubious links between drugs and crime that continue to persist, Hagan demonstrates how public fears are “open to political and other sources of manipulation that by some measures are clearly misguided” (p. 48). These fears—of immigrants, of terrorists, of drugs, and so forth—become connected, intensifying the fear and fundamentally influencing our collective response to crime.</p>
<p>Chapters 3 and 4 organize the evolution of American criminology “along the political fault line that divides the influences of the Roosevelt and Reagan eras in American life” (p. 69). This portion of the book presents an impressive summary of criminological thought over the past eight decades although it unfortunately reproduces the all too common tendency of neglecting the groundbreaking feminist theories that first emerged in the 1970s and which continue to provide critical insights into crime and victimization today. Chapter 3 seeks to explain crime in the age of Roosevelt, a period spanning from 1933 to 1973. Hagan highlights the three classical traditions of the period—structural functionalism, symbolic interactionism, and conflict theory—and argues that each makes a distinctive contribution to our understanding of street, “suite,” and political crime. Hagan contends that the age of Reagan—an era that emerged in the early 1970s and which arguably continues to this day—generated new theoretical ideas that resonated with the fear of street crime triggered by the riots of that turbulent period (p. 100). With the postwar boom supplanted by disinvestment, economic stagnation, and then polarization, and with social changes ushering in the “culture wars,” crime was reframed as a problem of “chronic offenders” and “career criminals.” This narrative shifted attention away from white-collar and political crimes while at the same time ratcheting up deterrence and incapacitation for street crimes. The belief that one could predict, identify, and incapacitate chronic offenders provided Reagan with both an intellectual rationale and a policy foundation from which to justify an expansion in the use of incarceration and a related decline in the commitment to rehabilitation.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that criminology also provided a compelling counternarrative to the focus on individual misconduct. Hagan argues that the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods in the 1990s demonstrated that differences “within and between neighborhoods in resources, including both concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy, account for notable variation in violent crime” (p. 133). This finding, which suggests the need for a significant reorientation of policy to include social and economic interventions at the community and neighborhood level, has not been successful in displacing fear of the street criminal as the driving force behind criminal justice policy. As Hagan states at the end of chapter 4,
<disp-quote>
<p>while power politics during the age of Reagan enabled the crisis framing and the ensuing fear of street crime that led to mass imprisonment, a corresponding normalized framing encouraging a misguided absence of fear resulted in a retreat from the regulation of suite crimes and thereby contributed to the economic collapse. (p. 136)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>How crime was framed in this manner is the focus of chapters 5 and 6. Drawing on critical collective framing theory and frame analysis, Hagan argues that definitions and meanings of crimes and misdemeanors changed in the age of Reagan: “[a] framing process . . . realigned the meanings of street crimes and suite crimes by vilifying the feared offenders of the streets and valorizing the newly freed entrepreneurs of the suites” (p. 137). Chapter 5 connects a number of seemingly disparate processes, events, and policies to support this position. Some of the discussion repeats points made earlier in the book, but others, such as linking U.S. drug interdiction failures to the crack epidemic, are both troubling and convincing. The latter fit perfectly into the emergent street crime “frame,” justifying an ever-tougher law and order response. The growth of mass incarceration and the overrepresentation of racial groups in U.S. jails and prisons, particularly that of African Americans, can quite plausibly be explained with the aid of Hagan’s analysis.</p>
<p>But this is only one side of the equation. At the same time as these disparate threads were weaved into a coherent frame that caused fear and increased the social control of street offenders, a different frame, one geared toward the deregulation of American financial practices, was also constructed. Chapter 6—in my view one of the most effective chapters in the entire book—documents this reframing, along with the havoc it has wreaked in the United States and around the world. The chapter weaves together a litany of infamous financial practices and cases, including the most recent ones involving securitized debt, subprime mortgages, and derivatives, to contrast the age of Roosevelt with the age of Reagan. As Hagan notes, “Roosevelt famously challenged narrow ideas of ‘gangsters’ with broadened images of ‘banksters,’ and it is notable that bankers during the Depression faced both criminal and civil prosecutions when their banks failed” (p. 212). One need only review the events of the past few years to see how much has changed in this regard.</p>
<p>Those familiar with Hagan’s recent work on the Balkans and Darfur will not be surprised by the shift in focus from the domestic to the international that takes place in chapter 7. The chapter applies frame theory and frame analysis “to the international landscape of war, state crime, and international law. The expanded view,” Hagan argues, “casts into relief a framing competition between the <italic>denial</italic> and <italic>deflection</italic> of responsibility for war crimes by state perpetrators and an opposing <italic>denunciation</italic> [emphasis in original] by international bodies” (p. 214). While genuinely illuminating, some may find the discussion and content found in this chapter an awkward fit for this particular book. Critical framing theory certainly helps to make sense of the examples of sexual violence and “state rape” analyzed, but their links to the age of Roosevelt and even to the age of Reagan seem somewhat tenuous. It is the Bush presidency that comes under scrutiny here. Whereas previous chapters successfully link Bush’s domestic street and suite crime policies to the age of Reagan, it is debatable whether the same can be said of his foreign and military policies. Hagan’s discussion of U.S. efforts to frame what took place at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in a way that immunized “military and political leaders from criminal prosecution in domestic and military courts” (p. 222) effectively illustrates the larger point of the book: who is defined as a criminal and what is defined as a crime is inextricably linked to politics and power. The chapter ends with a comparison of the origins and dynamics of “state rape” in preinvasion Iraq and in Sudan. Hagan describes the different framing mechanisms and strategies used by the regimes to deny the status of victims to the targets of rape (p. 253). He concludes, “[f]raming processes have the power to both deny and denounce criminality, and in this important sense, they have the capacity to both cause and deter crime, depending by whom and how they are used” (p. 256). So it is that the chapter ends with an explanation for why the most elementary of criminological questions presented at the beginning of this review are so difficult to answer, yet also so important to explore.</p>
<p>Writing in the epilogue, Hagan states that the prognosis for the age of Obama is unclear. With little over a year remaining until the 2012 general election, it is difficult to detect any significant shift away from the crime policies of the age of Reagan. Street crime and immigration enforcement remain criminal justice system priorities. And while some developments, such as the creation of a consumer financial protection agency, may present institutional reframing opportunities, the specter of terrorism continues to divert resources away from white-collar crime and toward counterterrorism. There is a critical need to think about the nature and definition of crime in the United States and around the world. <italic>Who Are the Criminals?</italic> reminds us of this. Importantly, it also reminds us that we are all part of the reframing process.</p>
