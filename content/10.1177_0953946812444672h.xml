<p>Alexander Sider begins his series of conversations with John Howard Yoder by offering a pungent meditation on the difficulty of receiving Christ as crucified. Yoder is presented in the Introduction, and throughout the book, as one who kept together holiness and the sheer difficulty of receiving the Gospel, what can be termed the task of envisioning history doxologically. A doxological vision of the world resists consequential reasoning and all forms of behaviour which presume to get a handle on history. Historical existence is to be understood from the perspective of the cross and resurrection as the ruling realities of the world. Shifting our gaze away from Yoder as <italic>only</italic> a pacifist, Sider wills to mine the depths of Yoder’s <italic>kenotic</italic> politics that crosses and yet maintains the borders between ‘church’ and ‘world’.</p>
<p>The first chapter brings Oliver O’Donovan’s political theology into contact with some of the strains of Yoder’s thought. The chapter begins, however, with a reading of Hebrews 2, which Sider reads in expansion of his assertion that salvation is created, that is, salvation is gifted and received. Precisely in receiving this salvation the church is ‘the analogy between creation and salvation’ (p. 20), a people whose holiness is in its difficulty. The language that Sider uses to explicate Hebrews is noticeably Yoderian: the Gospel is received as a promise (and so is vulnerable and not ultimately in our possession); the church is both continuous and yet discontinuous with the past; and the heavenly Jerusalem is to be imagined as a city without borders, meaning that the church is a ‘mission that explodes its edges, borders, and walls in the hope of a sociality unmitigated by domination or exclusion’ (p. 29). There is much that Sider clearly appreciates in O’Donovan’s political theology, which he examines through a reading of <italic>The Desire of the Nations</italic>, not least his rich reading of Scripture and his refusal to see politics as a ‘given’ to which the church must correlate its practice, but ultimately O’Donovan elides the boundaries between the church and the world and so is unable to sustain an attention to the promise that what belongs to the church ‘is left open’ (p. 47). O’Donovan’s impulses bespeak a lack of patience. In Yoder’s ecclesiology there is a more thorough-going eschatology: the church is to live responsively in the light of ‘the promise of a way that leads where Christ has led’ (p. 48). By prioritising the language of creation and silencing the suggestiveness of an eschatological hope, O’Donovan, by contrast, loses sight of the church as the analogy between creation and salvation.</p>
<p>The second chapter focuses on historicity and theology via an attention to Ernst Troeltsch. In particular, Sider is interested in how Yoder concentrated on our historical location with reference to the church. Although deeply attentive to historical questions, Troeltsch is ultimately hampered by lacking something which Yoder possessed in abundance: an eschatological imagination that would invite the church to ‘unhandle’ history. Writing in a time when attention to the historicity and contingency of Christianity was pervasive, Troeltsch retained an anxious urge to pursue the absoluteness of Christianity outside its historical contingency. Never one to marginalise the historicity of the church’s action (for somewhere here is its vulnerability), for Yoder, publicity, not absoluteness, is key and he remains less harried by Troeltsch’s lingering concerns to secure Christianity’s historical action. The church’s action is historical precisely as its history is received as <italic>promise</italic>.</p>
<p>The third chapter examines Yoder’s attention to the Constantinian shift in the fourth century, a shift that is important not so much in its finer details (which can in any case be queried by recent historical scholarship) but in its impact upon how the church views history. In this chapter the dominant conversation partner is less clear. Yoder is presented as one who skirts (perhaps for some a little too closely) with primitivist views or with ‘decline’ narratives of the church’s history. Yet what manages to pull Yoder away ultimately from such temptations is his radical restitutionist view of history—there never is or was a time when the church got it just right and consequently primitivist views of church history can only reveal themselves as curiously unhistorical.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter presents a robust critique of Miroslav Volf’s account of non-remembering as necessary to reconciliation in his <italic>Exclusion and Embrace</italic>. Inscribing non-remembering into the Christian narrative ‘can only be a terrible parody of grace’ (p. 159). Why? Volf’s non-remembering is a form of seeking to handle history, rather than exposing our histories to the hope that our pasts can be redeemed. Volf’s non-remembering is therefore a form of eschatological forgetfulness. A community that walks in step with the logic of the cross and resurrection will bear present memories of the past hopefully ‘in light of its participation in the future Christ promises’ (p. 136). In order for the past to be redeemed it needs not to be erased but borne by the community in patient anticipation of reconciliation.</p>
<p>The final chapter wrestles with Yoder’s vision of the church as voluntary, while disentangling Yoder’s ecclesiology from social contract models (a charge associated with O’Donovan). Bringing Yoder into conversation with Alasdair MacIntyre, Sider is careful to clarify that their projects are not mere recoveries of a golden past. For both, such a task would be carelessly unhistorical. Macintyre’s emphasis on the importance of dependency in establishing goods common to life together is a helpful way of dislodging Yoder’s ecclesiology from the wrong kind of non-voluntary model. The church, for Yoder, is non-coercive (membership is not enforced), but it is much more than a collection of people who gather together on the basis of goods they have determined in isolation from one another. Sider’s final conversation partner in this chapter is John Milbank, who elucidates Yoder’s fugitive vision of a church not in possession of itself and in receipt of grace as gift.</p>
<p>The objective of this book is to explore what Yoder has to say about the church’s being in time. Yet, this is much more than a book on Yoder, for Sider successfully chases the implications of Yoderian insights through a series of conversations with non-Mennonite theologians. There is another related way the book can be understood. Sider is aiming to install Yoder as a theologian to be reckoned with by bringing him into contact with that mode of contemporary theology that prioritises the church’s receiving of the Gospel in and through time. It will be good to see future work extend Yoderian insights by conversing with voices resourced more richly by an attention to the priority of divine agency, and particularly the nature of God as triune (a theme not overly emphasised in Yoder or in this book). But this is a necessary task for another book and what Sider has presented us with is an immensely thoughtful and suggestive meditation that will be welcomed by those working on Yoder specifically and political theology or ecclesiology generally.</p>
