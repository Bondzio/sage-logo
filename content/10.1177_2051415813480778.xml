<title>Objective:</title>
<p>In the United Kingdom, adult circumcision is often performed using general anaesthesia. Our aim was to assess our patients’ experiences of local anaesthetic (LA) circumcision and also the attitudes and practices of urologists in Scotland towards this procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2051415813480778">
<title>Patients and methods:</title>
<p>All adult patients undergoing LA circumcision over a 21-month period were asked to complete an anonymous post-operative questionnaire assessing domains such as pre-operative anxiety, anaesthetic discomfort and intra-operative pain. Postal questionnaires were sent to consultant urologists in central Scotland to determine current practice and attitudes for circumcision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2051415813480778">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Seventy-four patients were included, all of whom were happy with their choice of anaesthesia and would recommend the procedure to a friend. Discomfort during anaesthetic infiltration was low, although approximately a quarter of patients reported feeling relatively mild pain intra-operatively. Just over half of the urologists replied to the questionnaire (53%), with the majority not offering LA circumcision routinely, believing it causes severe discomfort and that patients want a general anaesthesia.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>LA circumcision is acceptable to patients, avoids the need for pre-assessment, and offers potential cost savings. Our results challenge the beliefs of a number of urologists that LA circumcision is unacceptable to patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult circumcision is a common urological procedure which can be performed using either local (LA) or general anaesthesia (GA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415813480778">1</xref></sup> In adults, the most common reasons for performing circumcision are for medical conditions such as balanitis, phimosis, paraphimosis or posthitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415813480778">2</xref></sup> In the United Kingdom, it is often performed under a GA with very few publications citing use of LA alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813480778">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813480778">4</xref></sup> In our experience there are potential benefits to patient and health service (NHS) in promoting the use of LA circumcision. These include the avoidance of pre-assessment, shorter recovery times post-operatively and providing an alternative to GA in a group containing many elderly and diabetic patients. Our unit routinely offers LA circumcision to all adults undergoing circumcision, therefore the aim of this audit was to assess our patients’ experience of LA and additionally the attitudes and current practice of consultant urologists in Scotland towards adult circumcision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2051415813480778" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>All patients who underwent LA circumcision between October 2010 and June 2012 were included. All were given the option to have the circumcision performed under either LA or GA during discussion at the outpatient appointment, at which time informed consent was obtained. There were patients who decided to have the surgery performed under GA and this was facilitated for them. These patients were excluded from data collection. All were day-case procedures. A standard method of LA administration was followed for each patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813480778">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813480778">6</xref></sup> A combination of 10 ml 0.5% chirochaine and 10 ml 1% plain lidocaine was infiltrated; 10 ml for a dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) and the remaining volume for a ring block. The DPNB required a 27-gauge needle to be inserted in the midline at the base of the penis. The needle was then directed below the symphysis pubis and angled laterally to the “10 O’clock” position and to a depth of 5 mm below the symphysis pubis. After aspiration was performed, 5 ml of the combined anaesthetic was infiltrated; the same steps were performed at the “2 O’clock” position prior to complete removal of the needle. The ring block was then performed using the remaining 10 ml of anaesthetic circumferentially in a subcutaneous plane at the base of the penis. The patient was transferred from the anaesthetic room to the table, and effective anaesthesia was confirmed using fine forceps prior to the initial incision. Any further anaesthetic was infiltrated as required, with approximately 25% of cases needing some additional anaesthesia before starting the procedure. As with any LA procedure, the lowest dose of additional LA was used to achieve patient comfort, all the while adhering to dosing recommendations.</p>
<p>The exact method of circumcision depended on the surgeon’s preference, but all were standard techniques involving sharp dissection of the prepuce with interrupted sutures to close the wound. A total of seven surgeons were involved in this audit, with a range of surgical experience from core trainee to consultant level, reflecting normal departmental practice.</p>
<p>Questionnaires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2051415813480778">Figure 1</xref>) were completed post-operatively within an hour of the surgery and prior to discharge. These were completed anonymously by each patient. These assessed pre-operative anxiety, anaesthetic discomfort and intra-operative pain using a linear visual analogue score (VAS). We also asked patients whether they felt that informed consent had been gained pre-operatively and also to rate their overall satisfaction of the procedure.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 74 patients underwent LA circumcision during the study period. The median age was 46 years (range 16–85 years). All patients felt they had been given enough information pre-operatively and all were happy with their choice of anaesthetic. The overall mean pre-operative anxiety score was 4.7 (standard deviation (SD) 3.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2051415813480778">Figure 3</xref>) and mean discomfort during anaesthetic administration was 2.9 (SD 2.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2051415813480778">Figure 3</xref>). Of the 74 patients, 24% experienced some pain throughout the operation. The mean intra-operative pain score was 3.3 (SD 1.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2051415813480778">Figure 4</xref>) within these 18 patients. Despite the relatively high number of patients reporting intra-operative pain, all would recommend LA circumcision to a friend. Of this group of patients who experienced pain intra-operatively, the mean anaesthetic discomfort score was 3.6 (SD 1.9). In comparison, the mean anaesthetic discomfort score for those who experienced no pain intra-operatively was 2.5 (SD 2.1).</p>

<p>All patients were discharged to their own general physician after day-case circumcision was performed, as was normal departmental policy. It is therefore not possible to determine the exact post-operative complication rates and long-term functional outcomes; however, to date there have been no LA circumcision patients returning to the outpatient clinics within Lanarkshire with complaints or complications.</p>
<p>The response rate from the consultant urologists was 53% (26/49) for the postal questionnaire. Sixty-five per cent (17/26) did not routinely offer LA circumcision to their patients. The reasons stated for this included a belief that patients would want a GA for the procedure or that LA circumcision would be associated with severe discomfort to the patient. Interestingly, only 54% (14/26) would be persuaded to consider LA as a ‘default’ anaesthetic option if shown evidence that it were equally acceptable to patients and offered the NHS cost-saving benefits.</p>

<sec id="section8-2051415813480778" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adult circumcision has been performed worldwide for centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813480778">7</xref></sup> Prior to the routine use of anaesthesia, this would have been performed with minimal or no analgesia, and indeed to this day in some parts of tribal Sub-Saharan Africa the “right of passage” of a male warrior includes social circumcision without the use of anaesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415813480778">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415813480778">9</xref></sup> The relatively recent correlation between circumcision and the reduced prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has prompted an increased drive by the World Health Organisation to develop outpatient local anaesthetic circumcision provision in Sub-Saharan Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415813480778">1</xref></sup> This highlights the perceived cost-effectiveness, comparable complication rates and acceptability to patients for LA circumcision.</p>
<p>It has been previously reported that the United Kingdom (UK) has a tendency towards a GA for adult circumcision and there are limited UK-based publications which report adult circumcision under LA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813480778">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813480778">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813480778">5</xref></sup> A paper by Sobeh et al. assessed patient perceptions of LA adult circumcision, and their results demonstrated a positive response from a group of 38; of whom 85% were satisfied with their choice of anaesthesia post-operatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813480778">3</xref></sup> In comparison, our larger cohort of patients all expressed complete satisfaction with LA circumcision.</p>
<p>When we assessed the discomfort caused by LA infiltration, we demonstrated that this was generally tolerated very well. The mean discomfort during anaesthetic was only 2.9/10 and there were no obvious associations between pre-operative anxiety and anaesthetic discomfort scores. It was interesting that as high a proportion of patients reported pain intra-operatively, despite testing of the anaesthetic block being part of the standard method prior to the initial incision. We postulate the following reasons for this:</p>
<p>Firstly, we demonstrated that patients who reported pain intra-operatively had a higher mean anaesthetic discomfort score compared to the patients who did not report pain (3.6 and 2.5, respectively); however, these results were not quite statistically significant using Student’s <italic>t</italic> test (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0879). We propose that there may have been some element of reporting error. It seems unusual that patients who report high levels of intra-operative pain would be entirely satisfied with their choice of LA and would recommend the procedure to a close friend. A potential reason could be that patients were not isolating their scores for anaesthetic infiltration and intra-operative pain. This may highlight a potential flaw in the study design. The other factor which may have contributed to the group who experienced intra-operative pain was that we were able to identify one surgeon who had an abnormally high number of patients reporting pain early on in the series. This was addressed by the consultant author (ID) re-educating the individual in the technique of LA infiltration. The subsequent results were improved and this would potentially account for five patients. To fully isolate this inter-surgeon variability, we would have had to consider only one surgeon. We elected not to do this, wishing to present a realistic report of the application of this technique in a general hospital setting. Discounting these five patients who had a higher pain score early on in the study, there were no obvious correlations between the surgeon performing the circumcision and either anaesthetic or intra-operative pain scores. This suggests that even though there are inter-surgeon variabilities in technique, this does not affect the patients’ perception.</p>
<p>Although not separately recorded as part of the study data, the average intra-operative time from infiltration of anaesthesia to leaving theatre was approximately 40 minutes. The approximate length of time taken to infiltrate the LA and wait five minutes would correlate closely with the time taken to perform GA on a patient. We are not claiming any benefit with regards to time and anaesthetic type.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is clearly a cost benefit to performing LA circumcision when compared to GA. Firstly, most men who have GA circumcision performed, certainly within our department, have an LA block (usually 10 ml 0.5% chirochaine) inserted intra-operatively by either the surgeon or the anaesthetist. The same surgical instruments are used regardless of type of anaesthesia. Therefore, the additional cost of an LA circumcision is essentially 10 ml 1% plain lidocaine; cost £0.42.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415813480778">10</xref></sup> When considering the additional factors required for GA circumcision, we can identify several potential savings to the NHS when LA is used. These include the cost of pre-assessment (approximately £50 for nursing time, administration costs, blood tests and other investigations), the GA costs (modest estimate of £200 for anaesthetic professional time and medication, including first-stage recovery costs) and the wider economic benefits of the patient not having to attend pre-assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813480778">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813480778">12</xref></sup> All of our patients listed for LA circumcision are assessed by medical staff in the outpatient setting and details of any previous medical history, drug history and allergies are obtained at this time. Patients taking anticoagulation medication are advised to stop for seven days prior to surgery at this stage. None of our LA circumcision patients are swabbed for methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) as they are not staying in hospital or integrating with other in-patients in the day surgery unit. This compares with GA circumcision patients who require a formal pre-assessment visit which involves an initial nurse-led interview regarding general health and previous surgery, routine observations, investigations in-line with National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051415813480778">13</xref></sup> and further consultant anaesthetist review if significant co-morbidities are identified. All GA circumcision patients who require admission to the urology ward, either pre-operatively or post-operatively, are swabbed for MRSA. It is the authors’ opinion that due to the avoidance of pre-assessment, LA circumcision offers a leniency for last-minute list alterations to maximise theatre utilisation, which is often not as simple for GA cases.</p>
<p>We have to acknowledge that our study focuses on the intra-operative discomfort for patients and that we have not assessed the post-operative period. This is a consideration for the future.</p>
<p>The response rate from consultant urologists was disappointing, though unsurprising for a postal questionnaire. The vast majority of responders do not currently offer LA circumcision to their adult patients. The main reasons cited for this are that patients want a GA for the procedure and that LA would be associated with significant discomfort to the patient. Our results challenge this belief. It was, however, surprising to discover that a large number of urologists would not consider changing their practice if a more cost-effective and equally acceptable method of anaesthesia were identified. These findings are limited by the low response rate by consultant urologists to the postal questionnaire. Therefore we have to acknowledge that these findings may not be a true representation of the global beliefs across central Scotland.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2051415813480778" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that LA circumcision is acceptable to patients. The discomfort experienced during LA infiltration is minimal (2.9/10), and the majority of patients felt no pain intra-operatively. Of those who did experience any discomfort during the circumcision, they had substantially higher anaesthetic scores, which may indicate a flaw in the study design. We were able to determine that a high proportion (65%) of responding consultant urologists in Scotland do not routinely offer LA circumcision because of beliefs that it causes severe discomfort and that patients want a GA. Our results would challenge that belief. All of our patients were happy with their anaesthetic choice and would recommend it to a friend. We believe that our data provide an argument for all adult patients to be offered LA circumcision, which in turn may lead to shifts in practice and potential cost savings to the NHS.</p>
