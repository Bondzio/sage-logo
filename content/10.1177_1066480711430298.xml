<p><italic>Love and War in Intimate Relationships: Connection, Disconnection, and Mutual Regulation in Couple Therapy</italic>, by Solomon and Tatkin, provides an in-depth solution to the barriers of appropriate and committed intimate partner relationships by reviewing the psychological processes that impact development beginning at birth. This richly presented comprehensive text begins by providing an in-depth analysis of the love and war of a couple based on a longitudinal study over a 3-year period. This study took a critical look at the clinical work and psychodynamic treatment that enhanced the ability to conceptualize the principles associated with interpersonal neurobiology. Solomon and Tatkin processed the couple’s ability to remain committed in the relationship based on the individual’s history of secure attachment and varying conditions of stress within the relationship. They particularly examined the differences in how males and females respond to stress and its impact on stress levels in terms of appropriate adjustment and ability to reconnect with the partner.</p>
<p>The authors begin by providing a genogram and family history of Richard and Christine in an effort to diagnose how early childhood experiences impact their ability to develop and maintain intimate relationships. The authors focus on the relationship based on the nonverbal communications and the congruence in their feelings of love connection and war disconnection. From Solomon and Tatkin’s perspective, it appears the couple experienced the deepest vulnerability for disconnection when Richard’s anxiety level increases due to his own health-related emergency. During therapy, he states his father died at the young age of 45, which had a profound impact on the family, particularly his mother. Throughout the text, the authors reflect more on Richard’s mental and emotional impact on the couple’s relationship with emphasis on the use of <italic>psychobiological</italic>
<italic>therapy</italic> as an effective intervention tool. Psychobiological therapy is an intervention process that accelerates the underpinning of everyday behaviors as conceptualized by brain/body in formation in colloquial terms meaning a cognitive-first approach to mental processing as opposed to beginning with body sensation (p. 50).</p>
<p>Solomon and Tatkin provide an accurate snapshot of effectiveness and successful reality of couple’s therapy with multiple examples of the theory in practice. By relying on the therapeutic process involving various couples, the authors give a step-by-step synopsis of the changes and growth among intimate partners. From the initial contact to the conclusion or termination of therapy, the authors conceptualize the dynamics and the successes of each couple.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors provide a neurobiological vocabulary that potential therapists can use to identify ways to deficits in couple’s social and skills and any threats to the response network. Likewise, the authors make available the Adult Attachment Interview a 20-Question scale to assess intimate couple’s experiences that may impact personality development.</p>
<p>Although Solomon and Tatkin make multiple references of how psychobiological therapy impacts intimate couples in reassessing and adjusting to the emotional and psychological constructs within the relationship, the most difficult process is helping individuals understand the impact of early childhood development on current behavior patterns. When dealing with such sensitive issues of emotional adjustment within an adult couple, the dynamics of multiculturalism and the couple’s ethic background need to be considered. The authors did not place any significance on multiculturalism in the therapeutic process.</p>
<p>In <italic>Love and War in Intimate Relationships: Connection, Disconnection, and Mutual Regulation in Couple Therapy</italic>, the authors go through great lengths to share the richness of psychobiological therapy and its special process is undeniably helpful to intimate partners trying to cope with the many barriers that impact emotional and psychological closeness. This thoroughly researched text provides significant statistical outcomes when addressing the many obstacles faced by many of today’s couples. With greater than 50% of marriages ending in divorce, the authors identify many cause and effect realities that hinder progress toward growth among couples. From a counselor educator perspective, this text would be a great tool in helping students identify intervention strategies when counseling couples with intimate relationship issues. This book would also enhance seasoned counselors' ability to interpret the dynamics of early childhood experiences on the emotional impact of closeness necessary to maintain positive outcomes of marriage.</p>
