<p>The topic of diabetic foot is rather extensive and a universal definition does not exist. Yet there are numerous prevailing controversies and unknowns that confound practitioners in the treatment of this ubiquitous condition. Although the spectrum of the diabetic foot involves many aspects of care for these patients, this symposium will explore some of the more clinically relevant aspects that are encountered in daily practice.</p></fn>

<title>Charcot arthropathy: For reasons not entirely defined, there seems to be an explosion in the incidence of surgery for the acute and chronic Charcot foot in the last 5 to 10 years. In spite of technological advances in the areas of fixation and biological enhancement, do you think that the ultimate overall outcomes are any better?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>According to the recent review by Lowery et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012451234">1</xref></sup> most of the data we rely on is based on retrospective studies or single-center case series (level III to V data). With that being said, most specialists in this area are far more comfortable in operating on these complicated patients than we were 30 years ago. According to the review cited above, approximately 76% of patients achieved complete fusion when arthrodesis was performed. Even when fusion is not obtained, a stable fibrous union/pseudoarthrosis can be an acceptable outcome in these neuropathic patients. As early as 1967, Johnson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012451234">2</xref></sup> published a large review on neuropathic fractures and dislocations in which he stated that the magnitude of the disease must be appreciated when contemplating surgery but not approached with dread. He too stated that a stable fibrous union might be an acceptable outcome when osseous union could not be achieved. Nonetheless, these neuropathic patients are at very high risk for postoperative complications, including infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451234">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012451234">4</xref></sup> This places these feet at risk for amputation as a potential complication of surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012451234">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012451234">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Exostectomy (with or without Achilles tendon lengthening [TAL]) is likely the most commonly performed operation in patients with Charcot deformity and ulceration, especially those involving the midfoot. This fairly simple procedure has met with high success rates, although several studies have alluded to the difficulties encountered with lateral column plantar ulcerations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451234">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012451234">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the interest in Charcot foot and ankle surgery over the past 15 years, several algorithms have been developed that facilitate appropriate patient selection based upon deformity. The one put forth by Pinzur in 2007 is appealing due to its simplicity and clinical relevance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012451234">9</xref></sup> Basically, if a foot is plantigrade and not subject to recurrent ulceration, footwear/bracing becomes the preferred treatment approach. Where the foot is not plantigrade but of relatively good bone density, realignment arthrodesis with internal fixation or exostectomy with TAL for those with modest, stable deformities is indicated. Of course the degree of deformity dictates which procedures are specifically indicated. With nonplantigrade foot deformities in patients with very osteopenic bone, realignment arthrodesis with external ring fixation becomes the preferred method for operative correction. Unfortunately, because we have no large prospective comparative studies of surgical and nonsurgically treated patients, we cannot ascertain which patients are best served by surgical intervention and which are served best by conservative therapy. We do not know which sites require surgery and which ones are better treated with footwear therapy. Also, there are no prospective, comparative studies to indicate appropriate timing for surgical interventions, especially during the active phase of the disease process. However, an international consensus document on the subject<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012451234">10</xref></sup> did recommend that Charcot arthropathy of the ankle is most likely best treated by surgical arthrodesis—again, the specific timing of such operations has not been defined.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we do not yet have high-level evidence to support the premise that surgery is the best approach for selected patients with selected deformities. While we do believe that, when indicated, surgical management is an appropriate and foot-salvaging intervention, we cannot with any degree of certitude attest to the fact that these patients will live a longer, more productive life than those managed conservatively. While we recognize that these patients require an extended period of non–weight bearing and immobilization, we have not compared survival (as well as long-term outcomes) to those treated nonsurgically. Hence, the answer to the question of better outcomes becomes more a matter of personal belief and experiences, rather than borne out by prospective data.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>I think that the overall outcomes are better because we are selecting our patients better. Over the past few years, several important points have emerged. There are certain variables that we have control over such as glycemic management and tobacco use. Other variables are beyond our control, such as the deformity, the presence of severe neuropathy, and the presence of an ulcer. I have learned from my own experience that poor glycemic control and active tobacco use are a bad combination in diabetic patients with neuropathy. We need to pay more attention to both immediate and long-term glycemic management.</p>
<p>Another area that merits evaluation includes the potential for vitamin D deficiency in our patients. That should be evaluated preoperatively and corrected prior to attempting elective reconstruction of a Charcot deformity.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1938640012451234">
<title>In particular, with the relatively high complication rate and protracted treatment courses, is the amputation rate any lower with Charcot surgery?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>Any lower than what? Approximately 15% to 22% of patients with a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) will require an amputation for their nonhealing wounds (Ramsey 1999, Lavery 2006). Those Charcot foot patients with ulcers are at higher risk for amputation than those without. In their 2005 study, Saltzman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012451234">5</xref></sup> reported a 2.7% annual rate of amputation while following a primarily conservative treatment protocol for their patients presenting with Charcot neuroarthropathy (CNA). As indicated by Lowery et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012451234">1</xref></sup> there have been no large studies investigating the incidence of amputation in operated Charcot patients, although the incidence of this complication is very variable depending upon the study cited. Nonetheless, the risk of potential amputation is higher in these patients because of their heightened risk for infection as previously mentioned. Notwithstanding the risk for infection, patients with chronic Charcot foot deformities who also have coincident peripheral arterial disease (PAD) will be at greater risk for amputation due to wound healing complications postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012451234">11</xref></sup></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Amputation rates have decreased at our center as experience with Charcot joint reconstruction has grown. Although reconstruction frequently results in protracted care involving revision surgery, wound care, and treatment for osteomyelitis, successful outcomes are more the norm than failures leading to amputation compared to 5 years ago.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>That is a great question and I don’t know that anyone knows the answer. I think that a surgical reconstruction that turns out well (ie, no deep infection, solid union) definitely reduces the risk of reulceration, which in turn reduces the risk of infection and amputation. The paradox is that we may actually do a few more amputations now due to the fact that we have identified some patients who we know will fail any further reconstructive attempts. Our own unpublished data have demonstrated significant improvement in self-reported outcomes in selected patients with non-recontructable Charcot arthropathy and concurrent osteomyelitis who undergo transtibial amputation. We utilized a general survey of overall health (SF 36 Physical Component Score) and a region specific outcome score (Foot and Ankle Ability Measure-FAAM).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section3-1938640012451234">
<title>Is the quality of life and ambulatory capacity for the patient any better in those patients that have had reconstructive surgery?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>No one to my knowledge has yet studied the quality of life in CNA patients who have undergone reconstructive surgery. However, we know that the quality of life in general for Charcot patients is lower than average based upon the Dhawan et al study in 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012451234">12</xref></sup> For those patients that successfully heal and who had been ambulatory prior to the development of CNA, both the quality of life and ambulatory capacity should be expected to improve postoperatively. Otherwise, there is ostensibly no indication for reconstructive surgery.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society gave our Charcot Study Group a grant in 2000 to develop a diabetic-specific outcomes instrument. To validate the instrument, we followed 120 patients in 4 academic medical centers for 3 years. We learned that the quality of life for affected individuals was poor. In some respects, the quality of life scores were comparable to below-knee amputation. These scores did not improve, even with what was considered at the time successful treatment. This study reinforced the observations of many experts who observed poor quality of life in often morbidly obese patients attempting to ambulate with cumbersome accommodative orthoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012451234">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>At about the same time, Bevan and Tomlinson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012451234">14</xref></sup> observed that a weight-bearing anterior-posterior radiograph of the foot was predictive of ulceration and potential deep infection. They determined that the relationship between the forefoot and hindfoot was not collinear—patients were likely to develop wounds overlying bony prominence and progress to deep infection. If that relationship was reasonably collinear, patients could be longitudinally managed with therapeutic footwear. We were retrospectively able to confirm their prospective observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012451234">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most surgeons who advocate surgical reconstruction of Charcot foot deformity have observed an improved quality of life in patients who meet the following criteria of a favorable outcome: (1) ulcer and infection free, (2) clinically and radiographically plantigrade, and (3) able to ambulate in the community with commercially available depth-inlay shoes and custom foot orthoses. My experience with a single-stage correction of the deformity and maintenance with static circular external fixation would suggest high potential for successful achievement of the aforementioned goals with a relatively low complication rate.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Most Charcot Joint reconstructive surgery patients return to community ambulation. Many require bracing, shoe modifications to compensate for limb length inequality, or a Charcot Restraint Orthotic Walker (CROW) boot. Some develop foot ulcers of the forefoot that are not necessarily related to the original Charcot deformity. Because of their neuropathy and history of severe deformity, they should be considered at high risk for foot ulcer and should be followed in a foot clinic on a regular basis.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>This is another great question and to the best of my knowledge no study has compared reconstructed patients versus those who had not had reconstruction or amputation. A painless, stable foot that is able to be fit with extra-depth shoes and an insert maintains quality of life and ambulation standpoint. We have to keep this in context since Charcot arthropathy in general is associated with a very low quality of life. SF36 scores demonstrate that Charcot patients score lower than any other major illness to include heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, and end-stage renal disease. In fact, Charcot patients score more than 1 standard deviation lower than patients with diabetes in general.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1938640012451234">
<title>From a socioeconomic standpoint, is Charcot salvage cost-effective?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>There are currently no studies that support this contention. If, however, such patients can return to a functional condition allowing them to be employed there will be a benefit. As previously mentioned, there are no studies to support survival advantages of surgical reconstruction over nonoperative management.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>I am currently in the process of reviewing my personal database to determine cost-benefit ratios of limb salvage versus amputation in the diabetic foot. I am hoping to have these data available by early this fall.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>Another great question which has not been answered thus far. If you look at the long-term costs of a major amputation, I am sure that Charcot salvage is cost-effective if a satisfactory result is achieved. The first year differential in cost is probably negligible. The same conclusion can be drawn for a nonreconstructed foot that experiences reulceration every year or two. The 2-year cost to treat an ulcer is approximately 28 000.00, so if you can prevent reulceration, this type of surgery should be cost-effective over the long term. The bottom line is that if we select patients for surgical reconstruction properly, we should be able to show that this is cost-effective.</p>

<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>According to both Newman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012451234">16</xref></sup> and Lesko and Maurer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012451234">17</xref></sup> neuropathic dislocations in the absence of fractures are best treated by primary arthrodesis. These dislocations cannot be expected to relocate or “heal.” To the contrary, the instability created usually leads to further disorganization of the pedal architecture and progression of the neuropathic injury. While Newman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012451234">18</xref></sup> has separately classified such an injury as a neuropathic dislocation (distinct from neuroarthropathy), the recent international consensus panel report would consider this injury to be an integral component of the Charcot foot syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012451234">10</xref></sup> Regardless, I would consider this patient to be an optimal candidate for primary arthrodesis after a brief period of immobilization and non–weight bearing to resolve the attendant acute inflammation. Rigid internal fixation would certainly be appropriate. Postoperatively, an extended period of immobilization and non–weight bearing would be required.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>The first “standard” that is missing is a weight-bearing radiograph. Based on these radiographs, I would suspect that this patient is neither clinically nor radiographically plantigrade. When polled, virtually all members of the Charcot Study Group would favor surgical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640012451234">19</xref></sup> Open reduction without fusion is inadequate due to the high risk for redisplacement. Following medical optimization, I would likely perform correction of the deformity with naviculocunieform arthrodesis, using bony resection to affect reduction. I would maintain that correction with a static circular external fixator.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Assuming that the patient has adequate blood flow and no ulceration, I would consider excision of the dislocated navicular and attempt fusion or stabilization of the talus and the cuneiforms. If the foot were plantigrade at that point, I would leave the metatarsal cuneiform joints alone and immobilize until the acute phase has passed (3 months).</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>I would proceed with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) acutely with internal fixation, using additional fixation as needed. I would keep non–weight bearing for 3 months in a total contact cast (TCC).</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938640012451234">
<title>Case 2: How would you manage this chronic dislocation in a morbidly obese (200 kg) 45-year-old male with recurrent ulcerations over the medial aspect of the midfoot? The ulcers heal with nominal wound care when he is at bed rest.

<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>In this young but morbidly obese patient with ankle and likely subtalar joint dislocations with instability, surgical realignment arthrodesis needs to be considered. With recurrent ulcerations and failure of conservative bracing, it is unlikely that there will be improvement in his long-term prognosis without operative intervention. The international consensus panel supports earlier intervention in cases of ankle neuroarthropathy, especially with severe instability. Optimization of his diabetes control, medical comorbidities, cessation of smoking, and weight loss would improve chances for success. Intramedullary rodding and/or circular external fixation would be deemed necessary to provide adequate reduction and stabilization of this deformity. If the patient has concurrent chronic kidney disease, he would be at high risk for infection and amputation. Accordingly, counseling regarding the possibility of this complication would need to be done prior to any operative intervention. Primary amputation would also need to be entertained and discussed with the patient. Healing would be protracted if reconstruction were to take place, while amputation would allow for an earlier recovery. The primary consideration regarding amputation (major) would be his ability to function with a prosthesis. Morbidly obese patients will have difficulty in this regard. A Syme’s amputation would allow for easier ambulation with a prosthesis. Nonetheless, I believe that his ability to return to normal functioning will be compromised no matter what course is taken. At the same time, it is fairly certain that his ability to function with bracing will not improve over time. Considering each of these factors (barring any additional comorbidities), I would proceed with realignment arthrodesis according to the patient’s wishes and full knowledge of attendant complications (including cardiovascular). Intramedullary rodding would likely be the optimal method to maintain alignment (with or without the additional ring fixation). Postoperative antimicrobial therapy until skin healing as well as anticoagulant therapy would be advisable due to his diabetes, ulceration, morbid obesity, and necessary prolonged immobilization. There are no wrong choices in this regard provided that PAD is not present and that this patient is otherwise reasonably medically stable. I would not, however, expect this patient to ever become an independent community ambulator, even with an optimum postoperative outcome.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>Charcot ankle arthropathy has never been demonstrated to be adequately managed with accommodative bracing. I would advise correction of the deformity with ankle fusion. With no infection, I would favor stabilization with a retrograde locked intramedullary nail. In the presence of deep infection, I would maintain the correction with a dynamic circular external fixator.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Prognosis is very poor for any intervention. That said, osteotomy through the medial malleolus followed by talectomy and tibio calcaneal fusion may result in a plantigrade foot. It should be understood that repositioning of the foot under the tibia will be technically very difficult and could be suboptimal in spite of best efforts. Once positioning is achieved, external fixation should be applied to maintain alignment for at least 3 months. If stability is achieved, the fixation can be removed, even if the union is fibrous.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>Personally, I would attempt limb salvage with a medial approach, excision of the ulcer, talectomy to allow reduction, and use of a circular frame. My goal would be realignment and fusion in 1 stage with Ex-Fix. You are going to have pin problems because of the size. Below knee amputation (BKA) is not a great option because of the patient’s size. You may not be able to fit this patient with a prosthesis and Dr. Pinzur has taught me that a knee disarticulation may be the best option in patients who are morbidly obese.</p>

<p>Primary arthrodesis according to the considerations and information provided earlier. While this is not yet a classic Charcot joint, it is at risk for development of such degeneration. There is no chance for optimal resolution with conservative care. Surgical intervention at this time, where there is no osseous disorganization and remaining bone density, would lead to a better outcome than if there was a protracted delay prior to intervention. In this situation, I would suggest both internal and external fixation to provide an appropriate superconstruct.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>This patient is similar to the first patient. This patient will be continuously unstable without arthrodesis. I would recommend ankle arthrodesis with a retrograde locked intramedullary nail.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>If there is no other deformity and no other history of foot ulceration I would consider primary fusion of the ankle joint. If there have been other foot ulcerations or other severe foot deformity I would consider Syme’s amputation.</p>

<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>I would recommend ORIF and primary ankle and subtalar fusion. I would use a retrograde nail. To get a reduction, partial ostectomy of the fib, tibia, or talus may be necessary. I recognize bone quality may be poor and you consider supplemental ex fix on top of IM nail though I am not a fan.</p>
<p>I would recommend ORIF and primary ankle and subtalar fusion. I would use a retrograde ankle arthrodesis intramedullary nail. To achieve a reduction, osteotomies of the fibula, talus and/or tibia may be necessary.

<speaker>Trauma:</speaker>
<p>It is commonly accepted that trauma in the diabetic patient is more complicated than the nondiabetic patient. How do you alter the postoperative course in a diabetic patient compared to the nondiabetic patient (with all other factors being equal)?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>More aggressive intervention in the neuropathic patient. Not all diabetic patients are neuropathic although the majority of long-duration diabetic persons do indeed develop neuropathy. We have shown these patients to be at high risk for development of postoperative complications including infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012451234">4</xref></sup> A word of caution, however, needs to be offered for diabetic persons with PAD—in these individuals, I would be more inclined to treat conservatively as circumstances warrant. Not all trauma requires operative intervention. Nonetheless, for those neuropathic patients undergoing operative intervention posttraumatically, a prolonged period of non–weight bearing immobilization would be required. Several authors have suggested a period of time twice as long as in the nondiabetic individual—perhaps 4 months rather than 2 or 3 months, as circumstances dictate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012451234">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640012451234">20</xref></sup> In these patients, however, the probability of neuropathic arthropathy would be high, and appropriate follow-up care and surveillance would be necessary.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>Dane Wukich has published the best review on this topic. Patients who are medically optimized will have fewer complications than those who are unstable either with respect to their medical comorbidities or longitudinal glucose control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640012451234">21</xref></sup> Due to the window of opportunity associated with trauma, patients are best treated with cardiac optimization and acute glucose control. Once achieved, one should use the same prophylactic antibiotic protocol as in nondiabetics, except for the special circumstance of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) carriers. Careful monitoring for postoperative infection is obvious.</p>
</speech>
<speech>

<p>Fixation, immobilization, and wound care (even primarily closed wounds) should be expected to take more time than for nondiabetic patients, especially if they are significantly neuropathic. More aggressive gait assistance such as crutches, walkers, or even wheel chairs should be utilized to minimize potentially deforming forces in the early preoperative phase.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>Generally, I recommend doubling the amount of hardware, doubling the non–weight bearing period, and doubling the number of office visits. The most important thing is to identify the presence of neuropathy preoperatively. If they have neuropathy, then the risk of infectious and noninfectious adverse outcomes increases dramatically</p>

<title>Are you of the opinion that patients who have surgical intervention for foot and lower-leg trauma are more likely to develop Charcot arthropathy? Why or why not?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>Yes, those with neuropathy are very much at risk for CNA, although there is no certainty. In those without neuropathy at the time of surgery, there is a very low or nonexistent risk for Charcot joint development. Neuropathy is the overriding predisposing factor in this regard.</p>

<p>Judy Baumhauer has identified the cytokines responsible for the development of Charcot joint arthropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640012451234">22</xref></sup> These cytokine spikes appear related to the trauma of the injury, not the surgery.</p>

<p>I have encountered unexpected neuropathic changes, even in the forefoot, after surgery for deformity or trauma in diabetic patients. These have included dislocations, displaced osteotomies, and excessive bone callus. Diabetic neuropathic patients, especially those with suboptimal control, need greater-than-anticipated postop protection after surgical intervention than the general population.</p>
</speech>

<p>I think the short answer is yes because surgery is a form of trauma. I have seen this in a few patients, probably less than 1% of my patients.</p>

<p>Our goal has been to manage patients longitudinally with commercially available depth-inlay shoes and custom accommodative foot orthoses. Prophylactic surgery (generally exostectomy) to avoid foot ulcers is only indicated when the therapeutic footwear options dictate. I earlier discussed my indications for correction of Charcot foot deformity. Again, the goal is commercially available depth-inlay shoes and custom accommodative foot orthoses.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Adequate blood flow, satisfactory nutritional status, reasonable glucose control, and stable comorbidities such as heart disease or renal disease are baseline requirements to expect healing in limb salvage or prophylactic foot surgery in diabetic patients. I don’t like the idea of “prophylactic” surgery and usually will only recommend or perform such procedures in ulcerative deformities that cannot be managed with proper shoes, orthotics, and keratosis management.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>If they have high-risk areas for ulceration such as hammertoes, then it makes sense to correct those. Patients who have forefoot callosities and equinus may benefit from judicious posterior muscle group lengthening, but you have to be careful not to create pressure beneath the heel.</p>
</speech>

<sec id="section10-1938640012451234">
<title>Do you think that there is more medical-legal exposure in those patients who have prophylactic surgery and subsequently have an adverse outcome?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>Absolutely! These patients are at high risk for complications, do not understand the risk for surgery, and there is still a prevailing sense of nihilism when considering operative intervention in the diabetic foot (but not borne out by recent data). Lawyers are fairly aggressive in litigating cases where complications have occurred, especially when protracted periods of conservative care have not been attempted or where there is an inadequate record of informed consent.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no consistency in our medical-legal system. I have observed lawsuits over both complications and not performing surgery. Until there is meaningful tort reform, we should simply do what is ethically correct and back it up with objective evidence.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Medical legal exposure depends on thorough preoperative counseling of the patient. The risk and benefit of any proposed intervention should be clear to the patient, who should then participate in the decision-making process. The higher the expectations of the patient without understanding the potential complications, the greater the medical legal exposure.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>No more than any other patient population if you follow normal technique. We are dealing with a high-risk population, and if you can prevent an ulcer you can prevent an infection and potentially an amputation. Patients need to be educated preoperatively.</p>

<title>Amputation: Using the following examples, when amputation is necessary, do you try to preserve as much anatomy as possible or do a definitive traditional procedure at a functional length?</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold>Amputation of the fourth and fifth rays:</bold> Would you do a transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) or isolated ray resection?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>Depending on the vascular status and extent of tissue loss, I would initially attempt ray amputation of one or both rays. Primary closure (or delayed primary) is preferred. Where extensive soft-tissue loss is present, a modified TMA would be performed to provide for primary coverage.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>Amputation decisions should be individualized based on the needs of the individual patient. The goal of treatment is commercially available depth inlay shoes and custom accommodative foot orthoses. Bony prominences should be avoided. I, therefore, tend to do traditional levels that go overboard in preserving length. I avoid resection of more than 1 ray. Feet with multiple ray resections tend to be difficult to accommodate in therapeutic footwear and often develop late deformity. I will generally perform a fifth-ray resection in the presence of osteomyelitis but not for ischemic disease. I attempt to maintain the base of the fifth metatarsal (insertion of the peroneus brevis) to avoid late varus deformity.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>I will usually amputate the affected rays only as a first stage. I will monitor the patient closely after surgery and try to manage any potentially ulcerative keratosis with prescription shoes and orthotics along with callus care. If reulceration occurs, I would then proceed to transmetatarsal amputation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>I would do a ray resection, but if I perform a fifth ray resection I take great care to preserve the insertion of the peroneus brevis. If you sacrifice the base of five and the peroneus brevis insertion, varus deformity results from overpull of the posterior tibial tendon. If I have to resect the fifth metatarsal base I would consider a primary or staged transfer of the posterior tibial tendon to the lateral part of the foot to restore balance.</p>

<p>First-ray amputation is acceptable in older, relatively apropulsive individuals. Younger, more active individuals find first-ray resection to be more disabling. These patients are often best served with a more proximal standard amputation.

<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>I would consider amputating at this level but would move to a Chopart amputation as circumstances dictated (ie, level of infection, necrosis, tissue loss, etc). While I do not routinely perform an Achilles lengthening procedure for my forefoot amputations or TMAs, I would certainly consider such procedures concurrent with Lisfranc’s amputation. For Chopart amputations, I perform an Achilles tenotomy at the same operative session.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>“In situ” amputations leave feet that are difficult to manage with commercially available therapeutic footwear. I avoid custom footwear due to the prolonged time that it takes to obtain such devices.</p>

<p>Chopart is my preferred midfoot amputation, provided that I have an adequate plantar flap for primary closure.

<p>Chopart’s amputations have been successful in my patients with low demand, such as household ambulators only. I lengthen the Achilles and try to tack down anterior group tendons around the distal talus, even grooving the talus to minimize the equinus effect. A plastizote-lined ankle foot orthosis (AFO) also helps protect the remaining partial foot.</p>

<title>Entire foot amputation: Syme or BKA; Please elaborate.</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>I have had reasonable success with the Syme amputation and have published our experience with this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938640012451234">24</xref></sup> The determining factors for success of a Syme amputation are an intact plantar heel pad free from infection and adequate perfusion, especially a patent posterior tibial artery. Pinzur has also published his experience with this operation (2003) and found fairly good success when appropriate patients were selected for the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938640012451234">25</xref></sup> Eckhardt published his results with the Syme ankle disarticulation in patients with Charcot foot deformities and found this to be a viable option in patients with recalcitrant infection and osteomyelitis of the midfoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938640012451234">26</xref></sup> This operation remains a final option for appropriate patients at risk of limb loss. Although prosthetic fabrication and fitting has some difficulties, once applied, patients can walk with a minimum of difficulty.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, major amputation becomes necessary in cases of extensive infection, osteomyelitis, tissue loss, or gangrene. This is especially problematic in patients with PAD who have nonreconstructable disease or who fail revascularization. Those patients in whom limb salvage operations (including Syme amputations) fail will require subsequent below- or above-knee amputation. Since survival rates are not good for major amputations in patients with diabetes (approximately 50% or worse 5-year survival), limb salvage procedures should be attempted when feasible. However, patients who are nonambulatory, who have severely decompensated heart disease, or who are on hemodialysis might consider primary amputation. In patients with severely unstable, unbraceable, or infected Charcot foot deformities with good perfusion, major amputation needs to be considered as a viable option to restore the patients’ independence. This is a difficult decision for both doctor and patient but one that nonetheless needs to be considered.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>My next proximal level is the Syme’s ankle disarticulation. Amputation at the transverse tarsal joint (Boyd or Chopart) is prone to develop late equinus deformity. Even if successful, the patients will develop an apropulsive gait pattern. It is my opinion that they are far better served with a well-performed Syme’s ankle disarticulation. Again, we have published excellent results with the Syme’s amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938640012451234">25</xref></sup> The energy cost of walking is far less than a below-knee amputation, and these patients rarely require training on a rehabilitation unit.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>As with all partial foot amputations, adequate blood flow, adequate nutritional status (serum albumin at least 2.5 gm/dL), and otherwise stable comorbidities such as heart and renal disease are necessary to expect healing. If these factors are not adequate, it does the patient a disservice to attempt a salvage procedure that could take a year out of their life to try healing before a definitive higher-level amputation is finally performed. In general, the more damaged the foot and the sicker the patient, the more inclined I am to recommend a transtibial or higher amputation and focus on rehab rather than encourage multiple futile attempts to salvage an extremity that may not be useful in the long run.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>I have very little experience with the Syme amputation, but Drs. Frykberg and Pinzur have reported reasonable results and I would consider this a good option in this scenario.</p>

<p><bold>Concomitant gastrocnemius recession:</bold> What criteria do you use when deciding whether to do a gastrocnemius recession or tendo-Achilles lengthening with any or all of these amputations?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>I only perform routine concomitant Achilles tenotomy when doing a Chopart amputation. While some surgeons routinely perform a concomitant TAL with TMAs, I have not been impressed with the need to do this since not all such patients develop clinically significant equinus deformities. I prefer to evaluate each patient individually. If no equinus is present, TAL or gastroc recession is not performed at the time of amputation. Conversely, if it is present, such associated procedures will be performed. In long-term follow-up of these patients, a TAL might become necessary if they develop distal stump ulcers. My rationale against routine performance of TAL is to avoid calcaneus deformities and ulcers due to rupture or overlengthening of the tendon. With Syme amputation there is, of course, no need for this, and I do not address the Achilles tendon at all when performing this particular operation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>I routinely perform a percutaneous tendon Achilles lengthening with tarsal-metatarsal amputations. I have a low threshold to perform a tendon Achilles lengthening in transmetatarsal amputations in patients who appear prone to develop late varus.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Forefoot reulcerations, Lisfranc and Chopart’s amputation patients appear to benefit from either procedure. In the past, we commonly performed percutaneous tendo-Achilles lengthening but recently have been doing more gastroc recessions. The excessive weakening noted in some of my patients after Achilles lengthening appears to be less of a problem with gastroc recession, which still achieves sufficient correction of equinus to reduce forefoot pressures that lead to ulceration.</p>

<title>Compliance: Many have believed that the diabetic patient is inherently less compliant than the sensate, nondiabetic patient. Yet little concrete evidence supports this notion. Do you believe that the neuropathic diabetic patient is less compliant? Why or why not?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>Yes. Peripheral neuropathy in effect detaches the foot from the patient’s body and mind. Insensitivity equates in many cases to denial of the foot’s existence. While Vileikyte has shown an association with depression as a risk for such nonadherence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938640012451234">27</xref></sup> the fact remains that most of our neuropathic patients have “central neuropathy”—with attendant noncompliance to appropriate foot care and prevention protocols. Of course, lack of foot care education, obesity, and blindness also come into play in this regard. Those patients who receive appropriate foot care education have been shown to develop fewer subsequent ulcerations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938640012451234">28</xref></sup></p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Pinzur:</speaker>
<p>The nursing literature has clearly demonstrated cognitive and judgmental deficits in long-standing diabetics. This is worse with less-optimal longitudinal glucose management. These patients are not noncompliant; they are unable to be compliant. Total joint replacement patients retain information from preoperative classes. Similar-aged diabetics have poor retention from classes and require individualized ongoing patient education. We need to be aware of this unique aspect of this patient population and customize our treatments to the needs of the patients. We also need to remember that many of these patients are morbidly obese. Patients rarely maintain a non–weight bearing status following treatment of a hip fracture. How can we expect a morbidly obese patient with balance instability to remain non–weight bearing? We need to adapt our treatments to the needs of the individual patients.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Neuropathy is directly related to poor control as documented in the Diabetes Complications and Control Trial as well as the United Kingdom study on complications and control. My experience has been that the most severely neuropathic patients are those with poor control and compliance with their diabetes care in general. Further, the insensate patient can develop ulcerations, fractures, or dislocations that are not taken seriously simply because they don’t hurt. A big part of our counseling these patients is warning them about the risks of sensory loss.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>No I do not, and I chastise my residents for this point. They walk because they are neuropathic and have balance issues. They don’t feel pain.</p>

<sec id="section14-1938640012451234">
<title>If the diabetic patient is indeed less compliant with regard to the issue of non–weight bearing, should we adapt our surgical or nonsurgical approaches to “allow” for this lack of adherence?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>Yes, we must plan for it. This is the reason why we keep our patients non–weight bearing (even in circular frames) and why we do not allow them to change their own dressings. For the ulcerated foot, we tend to “force” compliance by applying total contact casts or irremovable walking boots to provide adequate offloading. Both have been shown to be equally effective in promoting wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938640012451234">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>How does the issue of compliance interface in the medical legal arena when there is an adverse outcome?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Frykberg:</speaker>
<p>I believe that the patient has a responsibility nonetheless to participate in their own care. While it is incumbent upon the practitioner to provide proper education and counseling for the patient, the patient has the responsibility to cooperate in their postoperative care. As previously mentioned, when there is documentation of such education and appropriate informed consent, the medicolegal implications should be mitigated.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sage:</speaker>
<p>Patients bear responsibility for their care as well as the doctor. If they have been educated about their condition, the effects of neuropathy, and risks of noncompliance with recommended treatment, then I think the doctor’s obligations have been met. I do not discharge noncompliant patients, but I am careful to document the degree to which they have followed prescribed treatment, so that if an adverse outcome occurs, it is clear that this is not the result of substandard medical care.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Wukich:</speaker>
<p>You just need to document this and what you advised. Before surgery, I tell neuropathic patients that there is a 10% to 15% chance of infection, and two third are mild and can be treated with oral agents. I tell them that hardware failure is the real problem. I also tell them that if all goes badly, they could end up with an amputation, and if they can accept that, surgery is reasonable. If they say they can’t, then I tell them they should consider nonoperative treatment of nonemergent conditions.</p>
