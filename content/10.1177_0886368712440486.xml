<p>In this brave new economic world, salary dollars have become a precious commodity. An expense that is fixed and—for all practical purposes—forever, salary dollars must be managed with care in an environment where both flexibility and return on investment are at a premium.</p>
<p>This article offers five key strategies for getting the most from salary dollars in these high-stakes times.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368712440486">
<title>Not Just Competitiveness, But Competitive Advantage</title>
<p>It is no longer enough to mimic the salary practices of your labor competitors, to simply pay as much as (or, if you can, more than) they do. A competitive salary program today is one designed to use available salary dollars to create competitive advantage. If salary dollars represent a fixed, long-term investment for the organization, how do you manage them to generate positive impact over that timeframe? What capabilities or skills, imperative to the organization’s future, should you use for those salary dollars to grow? How best and through what means can this be done? Do you take that 3% budget and spread it evenly across most of the population, with small pockets of differentiation for the outlying highest and lowest performers, or do you use it to begin crafting the workforce you will need for future success?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368712440486">
<title>Proactive Dollars Trump Reactive Dollars</title>
<p>In tough times, it is easy to fall prey to a shift from proactive to reactive salary management. Regular salary program audits are pushed aside for more urgent matters. Salary ranges and grade assignments are reviewed in response to specific employee departures or hiring issues. Salary actions increasingly take place outside the regular salary review cycle, in reaction to complaints and issues. The presence of constant activity creates a false sense of security that salaries are being managed and problems are being dealt with, when the truth is that you’ve shifted to a whole new compensation philosophy, that of “paying the squeaking wheel.”</p>
<p>The problem with this philosophy isn’t just the message it sends—that the way to earn more is to complain or threaten to resign. It is the fact that your precious salary dollars are being spent fixing problems rather than motivating people, building capabilities or calling attention to important goals. Reactive salary adjustments are invariably bigger than proactive ones, and they are rarely as well spent as those delivered with a proactive message and intent. Take the steps necessary to get a handle on the state of your salary program, to know where your gaps and weaknesses are. Proactively plan how to allocate available dollars in a manner that reflects the longer term priorities and needs of the organization.</p>

<title>Reverse the Tragedy of the Commons and Drive Salary Accountability</title>
<p>To the extent that you plan to link salary dollars to performance or to skill or capability growth, there must be a mechanism in place to hold decision makers accountable to this intent. Too many managers see their primary objective in the salary review process as getting the highest possible salary increase for their reports, however that might be accomplished. This brings us a modern-day version of the classic Tragedy of the Commons. For the unfamiliar, the theme underlying the Tragedy dates all the way back to Aristotle but was popularized in modern times by an essay of the same name written by Garrett Hardin. At its essence, it describes the dilemma that is created when the short-term interests of individuals are put at odds with the long-term interests of the group. According to Wikipedia’s summary of Hardin’s article,
<disp-quote>
<p>This story describes a group of herders having open access to a common parcel of land on which they could let their cows graze. It is in each herder’s interest to put as many cows as possible onto the land, even if the commons is damaged as a result. The herder receives all the benefits from the additional cows but the damage to the commons is shared by the entire group. Yet if all herders make this individually rational decision, the commons is destroyed and all will suffer.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Reversing this particular tragedy to maximize the long-term return on the organization’s salary spending requires more than just manager training. You can train people all you like, but until there are consequences introduced for not taking the easy road, too many managers will stick to that path. For this reason, organizations are increasingly turning to cross-manager calibration to drive truth and accountability into salary decisions. As a wise colleague once said: Never underestimate the power of public embarrassment!</p>

<sec id="section4-0886368712440486">
<title>Make the Call: Cost of Labor or Cost of Living?</title>
<p>There is a critical distinction regarding the purpose of base salaries that every organization should make—decisively and publicly, a distinction that often goes missing in everyday salary conversation. This is the distinction between cost of labor and cost of living.</p>
<p>Cost of labor reflects what the market offers, the going rate for a specific type of work or skill set. Cost of living reflects the cost of goods used by a typical consumer, including items such as housing, groceries and transportation. I advise my clients to be very, very clear on what their salary program is designed to deliver. Is it meant to reimburse employees for their cost of living? Or is it meant to provide a competitive base salary for the responsibilities employees perform and the particular capabilities and skills they offer the organization?</p>
<p>Salary dollars spent in the service of a fuzzy purpose are unlikely to deliver a strong return. How can we truly gauge their impact? By allowing conflicting messages to enter into our dialogue about salaries, we create confusion and dissatisfaction among employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368712440486">
<title>Manage That Message</title>
<p>Salary dollars are not just a prized commodity, they also represent a sensitive and emotional topic. As employees grow more demanding of information and transparency, the stakes for pay communication are going up. This means that salary programs must be communicated as carefully and as thoroughly as they are designed. The core messages about their purpose and workings must be crisp, easy to understand and hard to misinterpret. These foundational messages can’t just show up on a one-time memo or semiannual newsletter. We must embed them in every conversation and interaction that employees have with the organization about their pay. That level of connection is necessary to inspire trust and belief among employees, both essential to getting the most from that precious salary spend.</p>
