<abstract>
<p>Granulomatosis and angiitis (GPA) is a multisystemic disease characterized by a granulomatous inflammation, tissue necrosis, and vasculitis of small and medium-sized blood vessels. Although the disease has a predilection for the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys, any organ system may be affected. Here, we present a case of generalized GPA manifested initially by necrotizing isolated parotitis and later by pulmonary–renal syndrome. Simultaneously with pulmonary hemorrhage, our patient developed an antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) presenting with deep vein thrombosis and strongly positive lupus anticoagulant. To the best of our knowledge the coincidence of parotitis and pulmonary–renal syndrome due to GPA and APS has never been reported previously.</p>
<p>Concomitant venous thromboembolism may be life-threatening in a patient with GPA. Early diagnosis and institution of the proper therapy are critical in order to prevent organ damage.</p>

<p>Granulomatosis and angiitis (GPA) is a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis involving the nose, paranasal sinuses, lungs, and kidneys.</p>
<p>There are very few reports on generalized GPA presenting as parotitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313475692">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313475692">8</xref></sup> We report on an additional patient with a necrotizing unilateral parotitis who developed a pulmonary–renal syndrome as a manifestation of GPA simultaneously with a secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313475692" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 58-year-old man was admitted to the otorhinolaryngology department because of a sudden swelling and erythema of the left parotid gland that started 5 days before admission and was unresponsive to oral antibiotic treatment. He had a low grade fever, night sweats, and weight loss of 10 kg during the last 3 months. Blood analyses were unremarkable except for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 89 mm/1st hour (normal 0–24) and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 5 mg/dl (normal value 0–0.5). Ultrasound of the parotid glands was normal, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hypodensic lesion in the left parotid gland. A biopsy of the gland revealed a necrotizing parotitis. Initially the patient responded well to prolonged intravenous antibiotic treatment. One month later he was hospitalized in our internal unit complaining of recurrent left parotid swelling and pain, bilateral pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, high grade fever (39°C), and leg edema. General examination revealed high blood pressure and bilateral severe leg edema. Blood tests revealed an ESR of 110 mm/1st hour, normocytic normochromic anemia (Hb 9.5 g/dl), serum urea of 220 mg/dl (normal value 44 mg/dl) and serum creatinine of 8.9 mg/dl (normal value 0.6–1.2). Urinalysis showed proteinuria and active urinary sediment (red blood cells and cellular casts). Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) were consistent with bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and nodules.</p>
<p>Immunological testing showed the presence of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-ANCA) with specificity for anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Anti-PR3 antibodies were found at an increased level of 14 (normal level is 0–11). The patient was diagnosed as having generalized GPA and started on hemodialysis, oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg/day) and pulse methylprednisolone (1 g/day) for 3 days followed by oral prednisone (60 mg/day). Under this treatment, fever and hemoptysis resolved and dyspnea improved.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, the patient developed recurrent hemoptysis and deterioration of the right leg edema. His Hb dropped to 8.4 g/dl. Doppler ultrasound disclosed a right femoral vein thrombosis. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) indicated a pulmonary hemorrhage with no evidence for pulmonary emboli. Work up for the hypercoagulability state revealed strong positivity for lupus anticoagulant (LA), which was confirmed by the second assay after 3 months. All other antiphospholipid antibodies were negative. Complement (C3 and C4) levels were normal and antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were negative. Plasmapheresis was initiated and performed alternately with hemodialysis. The patient was started on intravenous cyclophosphamide (500 mg) and an additional 3 days of pulse methylprednisolone, and an umbrella was inserted. After the resolution of pulmonary hemorrhage, a full anticoagulation with warfarin was started. Within a month, hemoptysis and parotitis resolved, and congestive state and general condition gradually improved. His renal function stabilized with a urea level of 120 mg/dl and a creatinine level of 3 mg/dl and became hemodialysis independent. The patient was discharged on an oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg/day), oral prednisone, warfarin and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole three times per week. After 4 months of follow up in rheumatology and nephrology clinics, the patient remained in clinical remission. His ESR, CRP and Hb normalized and renal function was stable (urea 100 mg/dl and creatinine 2.6 mg/dl). CT scan showed disappearance of several pulmonary lesions and no evidence for deep vein thrombosis was found by Doppler ultrasound.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313475692" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>GPA is a systemic disorder which needs to be recognized early and treated with immunosuppression. The classic presentation is the triad of upper airway involvement, lower respiratory involvement, and glomerulonephritis. There are two types of GPA: systemic, which is characterized by necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and limited, in which the kidneys are spared. Rarely, isolated parotid inflammation may be an initial symptom of systemic GPA, making the diagnosis more elusive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313475692">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313475692">6</xref></sup> Various combinations of salivary gland involvement may be seen, with bilateral or unilateral parotid swelling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313475692">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313475692">8</xref></sup> Diagnosis is complicated by many other conditions resulting in parotitis, such as infections, tuberculosis, Sjogren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, and malignancy. A biopsy specimen of salivary glands in GPA patients reveals a parenchymal and a vascular pathologic condition. Salivary parenchymal changes include the histologic triad of granulomatous inflammation, necrosis, and vasculitis of the small and medium-sized arteries and veins. This triad is seen in only 16% of the specimens, whereas two of these features are evident in 22% of the biopsy specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313475692">8</xref></sup> ANCA is positive in 67% of the patients who have the limited form of GPA, which is often the case in patients with salivary gland symptoms.</p>
<p>In the presented case the biopsy specimen showed necrotizing changes, which were attributed primarily to infection. However, constitutional symptoms including low grade fever, night sweats, and weight loss should have raised the suspicion of other diagnoses, such as GPA. Early testing to c-ANCA supplies supplementary information and should be prompted when additional manifestations occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, our case is of particular interest because of the association of pulmonary–renal syndrome as a manifestation of GPA and APS presented by deep vein thrombosis with a strong positivity for LA.</p>
<p>The pulmonary–renal syndrome represents a combination of diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. It may be caused by Goodpasture’s syndrome, ANCA-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and infection-associated or drug-induced glomerulonephritis, and may be a serious life-threatening event. Under the treatment for GPA, our patient developed simultaneous deep vein thrombosis and recurrent hemoptysis. The differential diagnosis of the hemoptysis at that time was pulmonary–renal syndrome or pulmonary emboli. After exclusion of pulmonary emboli by MRA plasmapheresis, repeated daily pulses of methylprednisolone and an intravenous pulse of cyclophosphamide were instituted with a good response. Several studies have suggested the effectiveness of plasmapheresis combined with immunosuppressive therapy in the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis manifested by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and/or severe renal impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313475692">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313475692">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, a high incidence of venous thromboembolism in GPA patients has been reported in a large prospective study (Wegener’s Clinical Occurrence of Thrombosis (WeCLOT)).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313475692">12</xref></sup> The reason for these data is unidentified, although an increased frequency of low titers of anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies was found in GPA patients. This finding, as well as the presence of anti-β2 glycoprotein I (anti-β2-GPI), did not correlate with thrombotic events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313475692">13</xref></sup> Another interesting study showed a prevalence of definite APS of 6% (9/144) in the population of patients with primary systemic vasculitis. Moreover, 8% (12/144) have positive serology for aCL or LA, or both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313475692">14</xref></sup> The prevalence of the three common mutations associated with hypercoagulability (factor V Leiden, G20210A mutation of prothrombin (factor 2), and C677T mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene) was comparable in GPA patients and the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313475692">13</xref></sup> Another study also failed to detect other hereditable or acquired causes of venous thrombosis in GPA patients (malignancy, surgery or trauma, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, immobilization, obesity, smoking, and thrombophilic defects).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313475692">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>These facts have raised the possibility that the thrombosis may be associated with the vasculitis itself. Interestingly, most venous thrombotic events reported in ANCA-associated vasculitis occurred during active disease. Moreover, venous thromboembolism is seen in PR3-ANCA positive GPA patients more frequently than in myeloperoxidase-specific ANCA (MPO-ANCA) positive patients with microscopic polyangiitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313475692">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313475692">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313475692">16</xref></sup> It is possible that endothelial damage in active disease may result in active phlebitis and therefore may be a trigger for venous thrombosis in GPA. However, no active phlebitis of medium and large-sized veins was demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313475692">17</xref></sup> Therefore, the influence of ANCA and endothelial dysfunction on the thrombosis in GPA patients remains unclear. In our patient the deep vein thrombosis was most likely due to APS with LA positivity, although other risk factors cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge this is the second described case of GPA with pulmonary hemorrhage and APS. In the previous report, a 27-year-old man developed fever, polyarthralgias, palpable purpura, renal failure, pulmonary nodules, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the presence of ANCA positivity and was diagnosed as having GPA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313475692">18</xref></sup> After 2 months of successful treatment he was readmitted to the hospital because of cough, fever, arthralgia, and a swollen lesion in the left leg. The diagnosis of APS was established based on the pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, and strong positivity for IgM aCL, IgM anti-β2-GPI, IgM anti-phosphatidylserine, and IgM anti-phosphatidylinositol.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we present here a case of a generalized GPA manifested initially by necrotizing isolated parotitis and later by a pulmonary–renal syndrome. Concomitant venous thromboembolism as a presentation of APS may be a life-threatening event in a patient with GPA. An understanding of whether the vascular involvement is associated with vasculitis or thrombosis or both and institution of the proper therapy are critical in order to prevent organ damage.</p>
