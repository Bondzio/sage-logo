<abstract>
<p>Web 2.0 is one of the most rapidly growing web applications; to understand such technologies and related management practices adopted by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the USA, this study reviews major Web 2.0 technologies, presents a conceptual model of Web 2.0 applications, and analyzes SME Web 2.0 usage. In the conceptual model, Web 2.0 applications were organized around three major application categories: social networking, information sharing, and collaboration. User space was classified into three interaction spaces: business-to-employee-to-employee space, business-to-employee-to-consumer space, and business-to-employee-to-business space. To analyze the Web 2.0 practices of one hundred US SMEs, data were collected from the websites of the 50 ‘best SMEs’ to work for in America in 2009 and from the websites of a further 50 SMEs randomly chosen from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://manta.com">manta.com</ext-link>, an online source of SMEs. For statistical analyses, <italic>t</italic>-tests were conducted. While most of the 50 ‘best SMEs’ adopted Web 2.0 to some degree, the analysis shows that the other SMEs need to increase their efforts to improve their performances, to connect with consumers and to remain competitive.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the early 1990s, the internet and world wide web have affected the dynamics of corporate competition, globalization, lifestyles, customer relationships, and technological innovation. They have revolutionized the process of buying, selling, and exchanging products and services, and spawned a host of business models and technological innovations. Web innovations have provided opportunities to improve existing business processes and develop new business models and applications. Recently, the web paradigm has shifted from a business-centered to a user-centered model; this has been termed. ‘Web 2.0,’ coined by Tim O’Reilly in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611409785">O’Reilly, 2007</xref>). The concept of Web 2.0 began with a conference brainstorming session between O’Reilly and MediaLive International (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611409785">O’Reilly, 2005</xref>) and since then, Web 2.0 has become a web platform able to rapidly access a large pool of consumers.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 has changed the nature of the user from a content consumer to a content generator. In contrast, the pre-Web 2.0 era was characterized by read-only websites and proprietary web applications however, Web 2.0 brought about a variety of interactive community-based initiatives that leverage data, harness distributed intelligence, and utilize a rich multimedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611409785">O’Reilly, 2005</xref>). These community-based initiatives include collaborative advertising (e.g. Google AdSense), P2P file sharing (e.g. BitTorrent), user-generated content (e.g. Wikipedia), and social bookmarks (e.g. del.icio.us, Digg), to name a few. The contribution by internet users to the content creation of websites has been dubbed ‘user generated content’ (UGC). While technological distinctions between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 are often not clear in some areas, the social and technological environment for positive user participation and interactivity epitomizes Web 2.0.</p>
<p>Many companies saw the potential benefits of Web 2.0 and have capitalized on it; such extensions of Web 2.0 has been described as ‘enterprise 2.0’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611409785">McAfee, 2006b</xref>). User-generated content helps to understand customers’ preferences and support instantaneous, custom-tailored customer experiences (e.g. Amazon’s book reviews, Blockbuster’s movie recommendations). The ‘wisdom of crowds’ is yet another business area which utilizes the aggregation of information in groups (e.g. the sales forecast at HP through prediction markets and the ‘Connect and Develop’ platform at Procter and Gamble). Crowdsourcing is also explored to leverage web-based mass collaboration (e.g. Pepsi’s marketing campaign in early 2007 which allowed consumers to design a Pepsi can).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611409785">econsultancy.com (2010)</xref>, among 500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK in 2009, 17% are actively using Twitter, and around 40% of respondents use it more than LinkedIn or Facebook. While no single economic theory can fully explain the sources of value creation of e-business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611409785">Amit and Zott, 2001</xref>), the potential of value creation may be derived from four interrelated dimensions: efficiency, complementarity, lock-in, and novelty. In a similar vein, values derived from Web 2.0 may be assessed from these four dimensions.</p>
<p>Whilst SMEs are a vital component of all economies; so for example, 99.7% of all US employers, are responsible for about half of all private sector jobs, and generate about half of private GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242611409785">Small Business Administration, 2006</xref>) when compared to large firms, they face a number of barriers to the adoption e-commerce attributable to various adoption barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611409785">Al-Qirim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611409785">Lockett and Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611409785">MacGregor and Vrazalic, 2007</xref>).</p> <p>However, recent technological advances enable SMEs to level the playing field somewhat; for example, e-commerce has not only expanded information reach and richness, but has also lowered technological barriers regardless of the firm size and resources. While large firms have been the early adopters and beneficiaries of most innovations, an increasing number of SMEs are also rapidly adopting innovations to better serve customers, improve productivity, extend market base, and remain competitive. At the center of most new innovations lies the internet. Web-based EDI allows SMEs to readily take advantage of such technologies and Web 2.0 is further closing the resource gap between large and small firms. However, Web 2.0 on its own can hardly create a sustainable competitive advantage for SMEs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611409785">Barney (1991)</xref> suggested that advantage-creating resources must have four conditions: value, rareness, inimitability, and non-substitutability. As Web 2.0 technologies are now widely available and easily substitutable, early adopters’ advantage will be rapidly eroded thus, all firms that utilise the unique value of Web 2.0 through superior management skills, innovation, and business process reengineering are likely to enjoy sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Recently, Web 2.0 for SMEs has been subject to considerable attention; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611409785">Mata and Ramirez (2009)</xref> examine how Web 2.0 can be used to expand exports among Costa Rican SMEs willing to enter into new international markets. However, despite the heightened interest in Web 2.0, there is still a lack of conceptual models as well as empirical studies concerning the applications of such technologies for SMEs. Our study aims at bridging a gap by proposing a conceptual model of the Web 2.0 usage spaces and applications; in addition, content analysis of US SMEs establishes a benchmark for SME Web 2.0 adoption. Our literature review, conceptual model, and content analysis will provide a basis for further research.</p>
<p>The main purposes of this study are to develop a conceptual model of Web 2.0 technologies and to investigate their usage by SMEs. The findings of this study are drawn from out literature review, conceptual analysis, focus group study, and analysis of 100 US SMEs Web 2.0 usage. The article proceeds as follows: Section Two presents a literature review on SMEs and Web 2.0; section three develops a conceptual model of Web 2.0 applications in businesses. Section four analyzes Web 2.0 usages by selected US SMEs and finally, Section five concludes with managerial implications and future research directions.</p>

<title>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs)</title>
<p>According to the United States Small Business Administration (SBA), Section 3 of the Small Business Act of 1953 defines an SME as ‘one which is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.’ The US SBA defines different size standards for each industry. The SBA states that it has established a ‘size standard’ for most industries that relate to the dollar size of the business or the number of employees it has, adjusted for industry. The number of employees is 500 for most manufacturing and mining industries and 100 for all wholesale trade industries, while SMEs for the services industry are defined in terms of annual receipts of US$6 million. In both the USA and the EU, classification of an organization as an SME or SMB plays an important role in eligibility to apply for grants, loans, and other types of government funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611409785">Kendall and Kendall, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0266242611409785">
<title>Web 2.0</title>
<p>Web 2.0 refers to the multitude of new ways that the internet is used as a platform for developing and hosting software applications and developing and exchanging digital contents by businesses and users. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611409785">McAfee (2006a)</xref> coined the term ‘enterprise 2.0’ to describe companies buying or building platforms with wikis and other social media to support and enhance the continuously changing and emergent collaborative knowledge works across the enterprise. A recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611409785">McKinsey (2008)</xref> survey indicates that ‘a growing number of companies remain committed to capturing the collaborative benefits of Web 2.0.’ According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611409785">Forrester Research (2009)</xref>, the investments in social media are expected to grow by more than 15% annually over the next five years (from the level of US$1 billion today) despite the current recession. Web 2.0 has already had considerable on the manner in which people interact and upon business operations. The following points outline major Web 2.0 applications including social networking sites, blogs, folksonomies, and wikis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0266242611409785">
<title>Social networking sites</title>
<p>Social networking sites (SNS) use web-based technologies to allow individuals to form or maintain online social connections and share their skills, talents, knowledge, and/or preferences with other members. Boyd and Ellison define social networks as ‘web-based services that allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611409785">2007</xref>: 211). While every social networking site requires its members to create a profile, each has different purpose and targets a certain user population. For example, Facebook focuses on students’ friend networks, while LinkedIn focuses upon business networks, and MySpace concentrates on special interest topics such as movies and hobbies.</p>
<p>Firms began to use SNS in a variety of ways; some leverage their own internal SNS to increase efficiency in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611409785">Middleton, 2008</xref>) whilst others use it to facilitate recruiting and connecting potential contributors for distributed innovation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611409785">Cash et al., 2008</xref>). As a recruiting tool, SNS enables the observation of candidate behaviours within an online setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611409785">Henricks, 2009</xref>). Firms can also use social networks to engage in direct market research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611409785">Henricks, 2009</xref>) and to maintain positive relationships with customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611409785">Parise et al., 2008</xref>). LinkedIn’s new service, Company Groups, allows all of a company’s employees to subscribe to a single private web forum where they can talk to one another, share ideas and ask company-related questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0266242611409785">
<title>Blogs</title>
<p>Blogs (short for weblogs) are online journals characterized by short entries and regular updates. Blogs are inherently flexible and can be used for a variety of purposes, ranging from personal opinions to knowledge management initiatives and customer relation tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611409785">Ives and Watlington, 2005</xref>). Personal or public websites are used to host blogs and the posted messages can be distributed to other sites or readers via RSS. One of the most useful features of blogs is the functionality that allows readers to comment on each entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611409785">Kolbitsch and Maurer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611409785">Rosenbloom, 2004</xref>). This enables open discussion for every post (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242611409785">Zerfass and Boelter, 2005</xref>). The collective comments and links on blogs form a clustered network termed the blogosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611409785">Schmidt, 2007</xref>). A variety of public blogging services are available to individuals and firms. For example, Twitter is the most popular social networking and microblogging service, thriving on constant change and updates. Tweets are text-based posts of up to 140 characters displayed on the author’s profile page and delivered to the author’s subscribers who are known as followers. Authors can restrict delivery to those in their circle of friends or allow open access.</p>
<p>Firms can use public or private blog sites to provide a communication channel between themselves and customers. The publication of a blog enables the firm to interact directly with consumers. Leading firms like Boeing, IBM, and GE are all early adopters of corporate blogs. While the blog can be used for public relations, it can also be used to promote new products and receive consumer feedback on products and services. For example, GE makes public announcements on their blog sites, asks their employees to contribute articles/opinions on various topics, and invites other employees and customers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ge.geglobalresearch.com/blog">http://ge.geglobalresearch.com/blog</ext-link>). Internal corporate blog sites offer a communication channel for individual employees to express themselves and share information thus, they can be used as a knowledge repository to store expert knowledge, experiences and as a connection point among employees.</p>

<sec id="section7-0266242611409785">
<title>Collectively arranged metadata – folksonomies and tags</title>
<p>Collectively arranged metadata arise from user participation in the classification of digital objects. Collectively arranged metadata become more useful as greater numbers of users participate in the creation. The process of individually assigning metadata about objects such as URLs, images, videos, and texts is described as folksonomy or tagging. The process of assigning tags or labels to websites is also referred to as social bookmarking; the primary benefit of this is to find information more easily and accurately. Folksonomies have become part of social software applications such as bookmarking and photograph annotation, and have become an important alternative to search engines or other instruments for navigating the web. An empirical analysis of the complex dynamics of tagging systems has shown that consensus around stable distributions and shared vocabularies emerges, even in the absence of a centrally controlled vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611409785">Halpin et al., 2007</xref>). Some of the popular tagging sites include del.icio.us – a social bookmarking system and Flickr – a photo publishing/sharing site.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0266242611409785">
<title>Wikis</title>
<p>Wikis are easy-to-use, browser-operated platforms that enable collaborative publication on the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611409785">Ebersbach and Glaser, 2005</xref>). Wikis also embody a specific mindset towards the accumulation of knowledge; they allow many individual participants to contribute to an online document or discussion, usually via centrally managed content management systems. In contrast to blogs, the content of wikis tend to be less biased, as authors allow readers to co-edit the original document. Through multiple revisions of a document by a group of co-authors, the content becomes more credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611409785">Kolbitsch and Maurer, 2006</xref>). One of the most successful applications of is Wikipedia, a popular online encyclopedia for which any member can contribute and edit content. However, the open collaborative nature of public wikis raises concern about the validity of information contributed by the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611409785">Priedhorksy et al., 2007</xref>); therefore, validity checks are applied to contributions.</p>
<p>For businesses, wikis serve as an excellent technological platform for knowledge management and can facilitate innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611409785">Tapscott and Williams, 2007</xref>). Corporate wikis can also be used as a collective intelligence tool to tap the expertise of a large group rather than an individual. Firms have the opportunity to derive value from the mass collaboration of the public that participates in wikis. By allowing consumers to contribute ideas revolving around products, the firm can not only develop the core consumer base, but also create values for any consumer that can benefit from the collaborative works. Internal wikis can be applied to a number of possibilities, such as collaborative knowledge management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242611409785">Wagner, 2004</xref>) and are an excellent project management tool due to their ease of use and update capability; they can be created at any time during the project and updated constantly.</p>

<sec id="section9-0266242611409785">
<title>SMEs and Web 2.0</title>
<p>Firms adopt Web 2.0 to provide internal and external users with the means to contribute collective creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611409785">Hargadon and Bechky, 2006</xref>) and open innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242611409785">Chesbrough et al., 2006</xref>). Organizations such as Procter and Gamble, Amazon, and others have gained significant experience and benefits from the applications of Web 2.0 technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611409785">Bughin and Manyika, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242611409785">Koplowitz and Young, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611409785">McAfee, 2006a</xref>). It needs to be understood that capturing benefits from Web 2.0 technologies differs substantially from that within other information technology (IT) projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611409785">Bughin and Manyika, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611409785">De Hertogh and Viaene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242611409785">Koplowitz and Young, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611409785">McAfee, 2006a</xref>).</p>
<p>According to McKinsey’s survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611409785">2007</xref>), Web 2.0-based applications affect a wide spectrum of marketing activities ranging from building products or brand awareness to sales services. A recent survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242611409785">Stelzner (2009)</xref> on the status of Social Media marketing found that 81% of respondents indicated that it had generated exposure for their business, 61% that it had increased traffic/ subscribers and opt-in lists, 56% that it had resulted in new business partnerships, and 45% had reduced their overall marketing expenses. Similarly, information from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611409785">Aberdeen Group (2009)</xref> found that for 70% of the participating companies (described as Best-in-Class and Industry Average performers) the use of Social Media as marketing strategy increased the return on marketing investment, improved the likelihood of customers recommending their products, and improved the customer acquisition rate.</p>
<p>Prior studies suggest that SMEs pass through a set of adoption stages from email use, to a web presence, to e-procurement, and e-commerce adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611409785">Daniel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611409785">Rao et al., 2003</xref>). Web 2.0 enables SMEs to collaborate on innovations to solve business problems using RSS Feeds, podcasts, social networking sites, smartphone schedules, iPhone apps, web-base collaboration, wikis, mapping, and blogging. It is relatively easy to use, inexpensive, and widely available, and therefore, enables SMEs to reach resources and customers previously dominated by large firms. While investing in Web 2.0 applications can potentially be rewarding, SMEs face a number of inhibiting factors such as money, expertise, and time. Studies indicate that firm size is an important determinant of a firm’s involvement and decision process in acquiring Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611409785">Dholakia et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611409785">Van der Veen, 2004</xref>). Large firms have the budget, expertise, and economies of scale to adopt new ICTs and can take the risk of exploring new technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611409785">Clemons and McFarlan, 1986</xref>). For SMEs, lack of money, personnel, and time have been barriers in adopting online technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611409785">Van der Veen, 2004</xref>) however, the advent of lower cost and easily accessible Web 2.0 technologies has lowered the adoption barriers of such online technologies.</p>
<p>SMEs who manage their ICTs strategically and in alignment with their business strategy reap financial benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0266242611409785">Wynn, 2009</xref>); however, whilst adopting such technologies can be challenging for smaller firms’; numerous studies it is suggested suggest that SME information system selection is often focused primarily on improving operational processes rather than achieving strategic objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611409785">O’Regan and Ghobadian, 2007</xref>). Portfolios of information systems misaligned with existing business strategies do not enhance organizational flexibility in responding to market changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611409785">Levy and Powell, 2005</xref>). These studies suggest that Web 2.0 should not be a part of marketing strategy, but part of an enterprise-wide business and IT strategy. It is critical to see the impact of Web 2.0 on the entire organization and develop a coherent set of applications which match the needs of particular firms.</p>
<p>The development of appropriate competence and investments in staff training has been identified as a central factor to successful e-business implementation and use in smaller firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611409785">Fillis et al., 2003</xref>). E-business competence is important for SMEs in order to understand the implications and to develop the distinctive capabilities needed to perform well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611409785">Grandon and Pearson, 2004</xref>). Since employees are also users and contributors of Web 2.0 contents, it is imperative for them to understand the impact of Web 2.0 on the business and undertake training for improved competence.</p>
<p>The potential for poor information in online settings is always a concern and is particularly relevant regarding wikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611409785">Priedhorksy et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, firms should seek to validate information available in public sources before making significant investments based on such information. Web 2.0 promotes low quality user-generated content, threatens intellectual property rights, and confuses people by blurring the boundaries between original content and advertising. On a positive side, Web 2.0 promotes the idea of free expression and has become the new source of consumer influence and empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611409785">Gillin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611409785">Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611409785">O’Reilly, 2005</xref>). Skepticism clearly exists as to how enterprise 2.0 can truly be exploited, either because technologies are complex, or because of major organizational bottlenecks in hierarchy and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611409785">Davenport, 2007</xref>). Therefore, a well-planned enterprise-wide Web 2.0 architecture needs to be established for user (employee, consumer, and business partners) generated contents – which media to use, who to manage, how often to manage, what contents, and who are the consumers of the contents – employees or customers, potential customers, or general public. SMEs need to redesign their website to improve the usability, aesthetics, and interactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611409785">Constantinides, 2004</xref>), and develop mechanisms to process user-generated contents. A well-designed and usable website is necessary not only as the company interface to the online market but also as a platform that will actively support Web 2.0 applications and crowd sourcing activities.</p>
<p>A review of the literature on Web 2.0 adoption indicates that past studies have focused mainly on the impact of Web 2.0 on corporate processes, the importance of social networks and Web 2.0 applications for businesses. Given the limited resources of SMEs, Web 2.0 may close the resource gap between SMEs and large firms due to low cost and easy accessibility. To increase competitiveness in the digital economy, SMEs need to understand how Web 2.0 will support the enterprise business processes and create values. The development of a conceptual model of Web 2.0 applications and observations of best practice SMEs are needed.</p>

<title>A conceptual model of Web 2.0 business applications</title>
<p>Various types of Web 2.0 applications have emerged and business are increasingly utilizing these facilities. However, despite it’s growing popularity, there has been little research on a conceptual model of Web 2.0 or its characteristics consequently, this section presents such a model based on application types and user interaction spaces to help firms develop Web 2.0 adoption strategies. The conceptual model facilitates a solid understanding of the nature and effects of Web 2.0, reduces the trials and errors in the implementation process, and maximizes the value of investment.</p>
<sec id="section11-0266242611409785">
<title>Conceptual analysis</title>
<p>Previous studies on Web 2.0 have mostly focused on the roles and application of this technology. However, as web technologies advance, the need for developing a framework of Web 2.0 applications that reflect their unique characteristics and capabilities has increased. In order to meet our specific research purposes, this study adopts a typology approach to model development. Typologies are specific rather than general classifications and are generated through qualitative classification rather than quantitative or statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611409785">Bailey, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In developing the conceptual model, three Web 2.0 support types are identified: social networking, information sharing, and collaboration. These three types are chosen based on the selection criteria of research purposes, significance of dimensions, and parsimony of the conceptual model. Social networking Web 2.0 facilitates and expands the networks of businesses and customers on the internet. It enables users and businesses to form and maintain connections with each other. Social networking Web 2.0 has also been widely used to discover latent ties among people, and recast weak ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611409785">Haythornthwaite, 2005</xref>).</p> <p>Information sharing Web 2.0 facilitates creating, storing, refining and sharing information between users on the internet and can be viewed as a structured or unstructured exchange of information in order to support social and active learning among participants. Collaboration Web 2.0 supports and enhances the collaborative works on the internet this refers to complex interdependent and interactive works toward a shared goal or goals and assisting in facilitating goal-oriented teams in the process of problem solving and group decision making. Web 2.0 user interaction space is classified into three spaces: business-to-employee-to-employee space, business-to-employee-to-consumer space, and business-to-employee-to-business space.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0266242611409785">
<title>Business-to-employee-to-employee space</title>
<p>Business-to-employee-to-employee space refers to a space created exclusively for a business organization and its employees; it enables businesses to complement existing e-commerce applications by integrating multiple Web 2.0 platforms. Some of these platforms include knowledge management initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611409785">Cayzer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611409785">Shimazu and Koike, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0266242611409785">Wagner, 2004</xref>), project management efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611409785">Miller, 2006</xref>), and social networks that connect employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611409785">Middleton, 2008</xref>). This is secure internet- or intranet-based space and unlike typical business-to-employee e-commerce, which focuses mostly on one-way communications, this encourages employee-to-employee networking, information sharing, and collaboration. Employee-to-employee communication and collaboration has also been found to impact upon productivity; in 2008, the travel agency Connections launched a social networking site enabling its employees to digitally share travel experiences believing that sharing such experiences would enrich employees’ support to customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611409785">De Hertogh and Viaene, 2010</xref>). Businesses play a central role in this space by consciously designing Web 2.0 tools, creating and managing content, supporting active employee-to-employee interaction and involvement, and analyzing employee generated content. Businesses should establish a Web 2.0 portal as a gateway to all corporate Web 2.0 tools, and set the strategic direction for future Web 2.0 investments. Internal blogs are used to announce corporate news and events and corporate wikis are used to conduct group works. Executives use internal blogs to publicize initiatives within firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242611409785">Schwartz, 2005</xref>). Innovative use of Web 2.0 for consumers and business partners may be pilot-studied in this space. Knowledge management, training, ERP (enterprise resource planning), SCM (supply chain management), CRM (customer relationship management), research and development, and human resources are areas where potential value can be derived from this internal Web 2.0. Value creation achieved in this space include employee empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611409785">De Hertogh and Viaene, 2010</xref>), employee participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611409785">Ward, 2007</xref>), employee loyalty, knowledge management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611409785">Boughzala and Limayem, 2010</xref>), and improved information quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611409785">Chen and Plott, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0266242611409785">
<title>Business-to-employee-to-consumer space</title>
<p>Business-to-employee-to-consumer space is formed for a business organization, employees, and consumers. This is an extension of business-to-consumer e-commerce and can be designed as public and/or private. Business-to-employee-to-consumer space enables businesses to interact dynamically with their consumers via multiple Web 2.0 platforms. Firms initiate this space, and employees can then engaged in dialogue with consumers. For example, in 2006, to respond to the public complaints and concerns of bloggers, Dell created a blog to interact directly with consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611409785">Jarvis, 2007</xref>). By allowing customers to use a corporate blog, an organization may be viewed as more customer-centered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611409785">Singh et al., 2008</xref>). Three major interactions occur in these spaces: business to consumer, and employee to customer, and business-to-employee-to-consumer. Firms have to invest in the content creation and in the design/implementation of tools to encourage active customer interaction and involvement; they can keep consumers informed of products or services via tools such as RSS, Twitter, and blogs. In such spaces, employees are asked to write blog articles and consumers invited to comment on them. An increasing number of companies use videos and pictures to enhance public relations; in this space, consumer product reviews are solicited, analyzed, and integrated into improvement programs. In addition, consumers may participate in the co-creation of products and services as crowdsourcees. Marketing, sales, product development, and logistics benefit from this space which serves as a business intelligence system at low cost. Benefits include consumer loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611409785">Freed, 2007</xref>), open innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611409785">Huston and Sakkab, 2006</xref>), increased consumer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611409785">Fleck et al., 2010</xref>), targeted marketing, leveraging custom-tailored experiences, and capturing consumer data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611409785">Bughin et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0266242611409785">
<title>Business-to-employee-to-business space</title>
<p>Business-to-employee-to-business space is for a business organization, its employees, and its business partners, such as suppliers and distributors; this is an extension of business-to-business e-commerce and designed to be private. The multiple Web 2.0 communication and collaboration platforms strengthen the relationship between business partners; firms can utilize Web 2.0 to collaborate with customers and partners in an effort to generate new design innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242611409785">Brown, 2008</xref>). Unlike business-to-business e-commerce, employees active participation in this extranet-based secure space is encouraged. While business-to-employee-to-consumer space emphasizes social networks, this space emphasizes information sharing and collaboration among employees and business partners. For example, Netflix and Facebook are integrating their platforms for inter-firm information sharing. Here business partners share experiences, problems, and ideas about products and services. By engaging employees rapid and proactive measures are taken to problems and opportunities arising from the business partner side. Purchasing, manufacturing, inventory, product development, and warehousing benefit from this space. Potential benefits include partnership relationship management, enhanced business intelligence, innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611409785">McAfee, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611409785">2006b</xref>), increased productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611409785">Allee, 2003</xref>), and better knowledge management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611409785">Boughzala and Limayem, 2010</xref>).</p>

By combining the Web 2.0 user space and Web 2.0 support types, Web 2.0 applications can be divided into nine categories with the three user interaction spaces on a vertical axis and the three Web 2.0 support types on the horizontal axis. Each interaction cell represents the specific user space and support type for particular business processes/activities. Some business processes/activities may belong to more than one cell, and the same Web 2.0 tools may be utilized for more than one business process/activity. The bottom row shows the web applications that support each Web 2.0 support type. The last column shows the benefits/values derived from the specific user interaction spaces.</p>

<title>Analysis of SMEs, Web 2.0 usage</title>
<p>Various Web 2.0 tools of relevance to SMEs were identified by detailed identification processes. These identification processes included three focus group discussions with 12 users, corporate document analysis, and surveys. A content analysis of the focus group discussions was performed to identify major Web 2.0 tools used by SMEs; the responses were categorized and classified and coded for tabulation purposes. These responses were augmented from existing literature in order to draw a wider and more in-depth analysis. Finally, 15 Web 2.0 technologies were identified. These 15 Web 2.0 technologies were named and organized around three major categories: networking, information sharing, and collaboration. The networking category includes LinkedIn, Facebook, MySpace, and corporate social networking sites. The information sharing category includes map, video sharing, photo sharing, del.icio.us, Digg, other bookmarks, RSS, and podcast. The collaboration category includes twitter, blogs, and wikis.</p>

<p>Our study also found that networking is the most widely used Web 2.0 application followed by information sharing, and collaboration. The usage differences of the 100 SMEs between the three categories were also analyzed. For a more detailed analysis, we also compared the Web 2.0 usages between the three categories by the best SMEs and the other SMEs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0266242611409785">Table 7</xref> shows that the usage difference between information sharing and collaboration for the best SMEs is significant at a significance level of 0.05. While the usage difference between information sharing and collaboration in the 50 best SMEs is statistically significant, the usage difference between information sharing and collaboration in the other 50 SMEs is not.</p>

<p>In the social networking area, LinkedIn is most widely used, followed by Facebook and MySpace. Seventy-seven percent use LinkedIn, 47% use Facebook, and 7% use MySpace. It is noted that many SMEs use more than one social networking site. The predominant popularity of LinkedIn seems to be due to its focus of business networking.</p>
<p>The second category is information sharing. Map applications are the most widely used (such as Google maps and Yahoo map, MapQuest using mashups); video sharing is the second most widely used, followed by RSS and social bookmarks. It is noted that the information sharing category shows the largest usage difference between the best SMEs and the other SMEs (81 times vs 34 times) with the 50 best SMEs utilizing RSS and Podcast actively, compared to minimal use by the other 50 SMEs.</p>
<p>The third category is collaboration. Forty-two percent of the SMEs use Twitter. Twenty-eight percent of the SMEs use a blog, followed by wikis (15%). The ‘best’ SMEs and the comparator group exhibit the same usage patterns in this category. Among the 15 Web 2.0 applications, LinkedIn (77%), Facebook (47%), and Twitter (42%) are the most widely used applications.</p>
<p>While SMEs in the USA in our study show that Web 2.0 adoption is gaining momentum, the adoption rate is still much lower than that of large firms. According to Bughin’s global survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611409785">2008</xref>) of companies of all sizes; 32% of the firms adopted Wikis, 34% RSS, 29% Podcast, 34% Blog, and 24% social networking. With the exception of social networking, SME adoption rates other Web 2.0 applications are far lower than those within the Bughin survey.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many firms have opened up social networking sites and built blogs to post new product news and innovations along with solicitations for comments. Web 2.0 has opened new opportunities for customer relationship management, communication, and collaboration for SMEs, but except for ‘best practice’ SMEs, most of have not fully utilized these tools. Like other IT investments, Web 2.0 investments are subject to resource limitations but have emerged as a powerful method for both user participations and interaction. The adoption of Web 2.0 is less complicated and less costly due to its wide diffusion and technological advances.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 is now widely used by large firms to establish networks with business partners, consumers, and employees, to solicit innovative ideas and suggestions, and to promote long-term relationships with consumers. Given the current technological advances and the pace of environmental change, SMEs must proactively embrace Web 2.0 technologies and redesign their core business processes in order to maximize their values. The widespread adoption of Web 2.0 by SMEs will help to ‘level the playing ground’ with large firms. The choice of Web 2.0 technologies and management practices is a managerial decision on the part of the company, as there is a tradeoff between technology and cost.</p>
<p>We classified Web 2.0 into three support types: networking, information sharing, and collaboration. We also classified user interaction space into three categories: business-to-employee-to-employee space, business-to-employee-to-consumer space, and business-to-employee-to-business space. Although many SMEs use Web 2.0 as a complementary marketing and management resource, there are few studies on how they use it. The ‘50 best SMEs’ were chosen to understand Web 2.0 capabilities and management practices adopted by the leading SMEs, a further 50 SMEs were randomly selected to understand Web 2.0 capabilities and management practices of typical SMEs. The 15 Web 2.0 applications utilized by these 100 US SMEs were analyzed; while most of the 50 best SMEs adopted Web 2.0 to some degree, the analysis shows that the other 50 SMEs need to increase their efforts to improve their performances, to connect with consumers, and to stay competitive. Specifically, the further investment of Web 2.0 in information sharing and collaboration is necessary.</p>
<p>Web 2.0 is being adopted as a new technology tool, but still exhibits a long tail of limited critical mass and success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611409785">Davenport, 2007</xref>). Our study of SME Web 2.0 usages can serve as a guideline for any small firm attempting to assess the need for this technology. As Web 2.0 becomes a strategic necessity, companies that do not utilize it will be at a critical strategic disadvantage; for SMEs, the competitive advantages of the Web 2.0 adoption derive from a balanced combination of state-of-the-art web technologies and best management practices.</p>
<p>Like most other empirical studies, this study is not without limitations. While the Web 2.0 adoption by the best 50 SMEs serves as a benchmark, they are not necessarily representative of all US SMEs. Therefore, caution is needed in interpreting and applying the results. To understand the current state of adoption by SMEs in the USA, further research needs to be undertaken with broad samples of SMEs. The second limitation is that the current study did not conduct analysis of the users’ interaction spaces of the US SMEs. An in-depth analysis of the three spaces may provide additional insights on how the SMEs utilize these spaces. The third limitation is that the current study primarily focuses on the technical and managerial aspects of Web 2.0. A perception of Web 2.0 by SME managers and employees may affect their adoption of Web 2.0. Future research needs to explore the behavioral aspects of the users in SMEs. Finally, skepticism still exists as to how Web 2.0 can truly be exploited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611409785">Davenport, 2007</xref>). There are reports of Web 2.0 failures; a study of large firms’ social networks concludes that less than 25% of corporate social software initiatives could gather more than one thousand members despite significant investments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242611409785">Worthen, 2008</xref>). It is also worth attempting to measure return in investment (ROI) of Web 2.0 technologies.</p>
