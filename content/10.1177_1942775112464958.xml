<abstract>
<p>This article considers the implications and effectiveness of a performing arts-based pedagogy in the professional development of school leaders. It reports on the findings from a study that exposed educational leaders to methods of dramatic analysis as a means of reflecting on the ethical dilemmas found in personnel management. Through the dynamic enactment of dramatized scripts representing highly charged situations in school leadership, participants came to recognize the limitations of merely discussing cases, the benefits of active learning to developing empathy amid the complexities of schools, and some of the ethical challenges inherent in their roles as school leaders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Education is necessarily a moral enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1942775112464958">Hallinger &amp; Heck, 2002</xref>), and whether one is a site based or system administrator, making difficult decisions is inherent to the profession. Ethical questions can range from the abstract—“What do we mean by morally good?”—to the concrete—“What is the right thing to do in a specific classroom?” A fundamental challenge facing educational administrators and school leaders then is to join the heaven of grand visions, lofty ideals, and moral principles with the earth of concrete actions that actually work. How can they make better judgments about different, often competing, ethical approaches amid a background of psychologically complex human interdependency?</p>
<p>Applying frameworks for ethical decision making to hypothetical situations in open dialogues between leaders creates awareness of the different approaches that could be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464958">Begley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464958">W. C. Frick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1942775112464958">Reitzug, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1942775112464958">Shapiro &amp; Stefkovich, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1942775112464958">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1942775112464958">Velasquez et al., 2009</xref>; among others). But in what ways does talking about an ethical framework result in an empathetic understanding of complex decision-making processes? Do the approaches typically used in educating school leaders help them consider not only the inputs to decision making, such as an ethical framework, but also the outputs, experienced as the reality and impact of the decisions themselves? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1942775112464958">Tuana (2007)</xref>, simply identifying that a situation involves an ethical issue does not necessarily mean that one experiences the action as ethical or feels any personal investment in the ethical decision-making process. For Tuana, moral imagination, ethics sensitivity, and ethical reasoning skills are as important as all other kinds of literacies with which schools traditionally concern themselves. Given this critical role that Tuana ascribes to the moral imagination, methods that help exercise the moral imaginations of school administrators and leaders seem worthy of careful examination. Therefore, something more than just access to a moral or ethical framework is necessary. We argue that stories of lived experience are critical to the learning process, and advocate for the use of arts-based methods to exercise the moral imagination of administrators in preparation programs.</p>
<p>Overall, teaching with cases is common in business and public administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464958">Brennan &amp; Ahmad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464958">Gloeckler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464958">Hallahan &amp; Kauffman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464958">Mintzberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112464958">Ruggiero, 2002</xref>) as well as in educational administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1942775112464958">Ashblaugh &amp; Kasten, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464958">Kowalski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112464958">Midlock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1942775112464958">Strike, Haller, &amp; Soltis, 2005</xref>). It is assumed that in the workplace, educational leaders will be able to draw on these hypothetical cases to inform their real-world decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1942775112464958">Strike et al., 2005</xref>). However, it may not be fair to assume that simply through reading and discussing other people’s decisions one becomes an effective decision maker in any local context given the unique, creative tensions between the multiple constituents involved in schooling.</p>
<p>In fact, classic cases rarely illustrate the complexity of the power or status differentials between characters. They may also lack the emotional nuances or rituals that exist in schools between people who construct uniquely lived, embodied realities. Consequently, even after having studied cases at some point in their professional preparation, school leaders could become overwhelmed as they attempt to solve problems with complex, interpersonal dimensions. Furthermore, they may have examined ethical dilemmas in an isolated context and not been given an opportunity to witness the playing out of an ethically charged scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1942775112464958">Strike et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this interdisciplinary research study was to examine the nature of school leaders’ learning when they engaged in a performing arts-based androgogical approach to case study as one dimension of their professional development. Although the methods explored here are focused on the adult learner, we will refer to the teaching methods of the workshop as pedagogical in the most general sense. The research examines the effects of studying educational leadership cases as theater, and includes significant explication of the parallels between the seemingly disparate, certainly unique terminology, approaches, concerns, and methods of each field. It reports on the outcomes of workshops that exposed educational leaders to methods of dramatic analysis, process, and performance as a means of reflecting on the ethical dilemmas found in personnel management.</p>
<p>This was not a workshop in which the text was improvised or ever changing. Nor was it a workshop that let educational administrators merely role-play. All participants were directed as an actor would be. Just as with traditional cases, the dramatized cases were written prior to the workshop; participants could constantly refer to and grapple with the texts. This directed, fixed-script approach was analyzed for the way in which it might shift participants’ experience from knowing about the ethical dimensions of decision making to gaining an affective, emotional understanding of the complexity of school administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112464958">Clark, Dobson, Goode, &amp; Neelands, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Three ethical dilemmas were explored in the dramatic texts developed for the workshop: the ethics of supporting an underperforming teacher over a long period of time while students are obviously suffering; the ethics of determining discrimination in the midst of curricular reform calling for a new team; and the ethics of how to fire a teacher in an ambiguous situation while retaining that person’s dignity. The three plays, titled <italic>Grace Period, Discriminating</italic>, and <italic>How to Fire a Teacher</italic>, respectively, were performed on the last day of the workshop. Every participant had a very specific role as a unique stakeholder in the situation. The intent of the study was to examine how the rigor and learning modalities of dramatic art may help educators focus on ethical decisions in educational administration and develop more robust understandings of school leadership.</p>

<sec id="section2-1942775112464958">
<title>A Reliance on Cases</title>
<p>Case study approaches can be described as short, realistic, action-oriented story-like accounts designed to raise issues and provide some insight into the context of the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1942775112464958">Fry, Ketteridge, &amp; Marshall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112464958">Ruggiero, 2002</xref>). In addition, when written well, they describe practitioners in action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464958">Hallahan &amp; Kauffman, 2006</xref>). In fact, many authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464958">Brennan &amp; Ahmad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1942775112464958">Gloeckler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1942775112464958">Hallahan &amp; Kauffman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464958">Mintzberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1942775112464958">Ruggiero, 2002</xref>) contend that case study approaches in teaching, which have had a long, celebrated history in disciplines such as law and business, have now become synonymous with education for management and leadership preparation. Proponents of this pedagogical approach argue that the reading of cases is a practical way to expose students to a variety of management problems, to which they can apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1942775112464958">Sawyer, Tomlinson, &amp; Maple, 2000</xref>). They also claim that the case approach can span the gulf between theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1942775112464958">Strike et al., 2005</xref>). Some even allege that case studies make learning come alive because cases mirror real life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464958">Graham, 2011</xref>). Cases, it is suggested, let students share knowledge and insight, draw on their own experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1942775112464958">Graham, 2011</xref>), and learn from others’ mistakes without the heavy costs associated with making the same mistakes in a real-life situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1942775112464958">Gurd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1942775112464958">Smith, 1987</xref>). Regardless of the reason why the case approach is heavily used in leadership preparation programs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1942775112464958">Leavitt (1991)</xref> noted that there is an almost religious devotion to it because many professors believe that this is the best way to learn how to manage schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464958">Kowalski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1942775112464958">Midlock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1942775112464958">Strike et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, critics of the approach contend that, oftentimes, cases are presented and studied as shallow renditions of life gutted of context and devoid of emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464958">Mintzberg, 2004</xref>). Indeed, others have argued that the case approach has proven to be a poor method of learning the kind of proactive skills required to balance against the kind of reactive pressures that are present in many difficult management decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1942775112464958">Smith, 1987</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464958">Mintzberg (2004)</xref>, a vociferous critic, invoked the language of marketing approaches to critique the case approach and highlight the fact that it fails to capture the dramatic tension of real-life experience, as he states:
<disp-quote>
<p>Dozens of students sitting in neat rows pronouncing on stories they read the night before captures the essence of leadership, exposes the big picture, gives them responsibility for decisions, promotes learning by doing, puts the students at home in any management situation, turns them into risk takers, and makes them general managers. It all sounds a bit silly, except for the fact that tens of thousands of graduates have left Harvard believing it. (p. 51)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, although the proponents of the approach claim it engages students in thinking about how to apply management concepts, almost all cases present static events that ignore the dynamic processes of management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1942775112464958">Brennan &amp; Ahmad, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464958">Mintzberg, 2004</xref>). Others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1942775112464958">Argyris, 1980</xref>), contend that the approach not only fails to teach students to question the underlying values and policies operating in their firms but also actually encourages the opposite.</p>
<p>It is not the aim of this article to provide a comprehensive critique of the value of the case study approach as a pedagogical tool. Rather, we simply present that for decades, rightly or wrongly, many professors involved in the preparation of educational leaders have relied, perhaps to some degree heavily so, on these mostly sedentary approaches and low-stakes environments with the belief that they would engender in students the ability to lead schools from an ethical center.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1942775112464958">
<title>Ethics, Morals, and Values in Drama and Educational Leadership</title>
<p>There is a growing empirical literature within the field of educational leadership that attests to practitioners struggling with negotiating competing and irreducible value stances and moral standpoints from their various publics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1942775112464958">W. C. Frick, 2009</xref>). For educational leaders, the key conflict is experienced as value incongruity between the personal and organizational/ professional; part of moral leadership is the very real intrapersonal grappling that occurs when normative rationality and technical rationality do not align (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464958">J. Frick &amp; Frick, 2010</xref>). In drama, as well as in literature, this friction is referred to as the central conflict within a play and it is expected to exist; everyone working on a play seeks to know the conflict to gain understanding. In plays as in life, different characters operate from differing ethical frameworks, and that helps us see how different ways of prioritizing our values lead to different perceptions and actions, ultimately creating harmony or dissonance within our experience. The dramatic arts help us to fully perceive the multiple humanities operating within conflict and challenge us to take a creative risk that, though not harmful, is more challenging than a traditional role-play reading task in a classroom.</p>
<p>Decisions guided by any ethical framework have the potential to cause conflict because they reflect one set of priorities, which may or may not match all other possible sets of priorities. For example, if a school leader values the quality of relationships and creating a sense of belonging and mutuality over other considerations, then he or she might use what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464958">J. Frick and Frick (2010)</xref> called an “ethic of connectedness” which has specific implications on our actions or decision-making processes. In an ethic of connectedness in schools, peer support, peer norms, curricular evaluation, and staff and administrator training all aim to develop and enhance a sense of connectedness in the school community. Strategies for increasing connectedness within a school setting are always multifold, but no matter what the source or system, creating trusting relationships among students, teachers, staff, administrators, and families is always a part of the equation of an ethic of connectedness. The negative implications of a well-earned spirit of connectedness might be a closing off to newcomers or outsiders, or the devaluing of individual accomplishments.</p>
<p>Second, for every ethical framework one can study, there is a parallel in the dramatic arts that practices that ethic or gives it praxis. For example, part of the disciplinary intent of theatrical training is to understand connectedness not only as a concept but also to experience it in every project and endeavor. Connectedness is fostered, demanded, practiced, applied, and eventually mastered in the ensemble-driven enterprise of creating a performance, as is the ethic of critique, care, and so on. The language of ethics is strongly present in the language theater artists use to fathom the meaning of any dramatic work and accomplish it as a creative act. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1942775112464958">Spolin (1963)</xref> would say the dramatic arts take as their focus the central problem of being a human being.</p>
<p>There is no understanding of ethical frameworks without some discussion of underlying values that shape them. Our values have syntax and are nested in ever-expanding circles or spheres, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1942775112464958">Begley (2004)</xref> who said that in matters of values, we move from what is in our closest circle, considerations of self, to our motivations, to our understandings, to our values, and then end with attitudes that lead to actions. The values syntax of Begley resembles the theatrical process used in actual production-oriented theater or process-oriented theater like applied drama. One begins with understanding one’s character and his or her motivations, given knowledge and values. Then one creates movement, gesture, vocal inflection, and interactions with others that express the attitudinal posture of the person, which gives rise to believable and likely actions such a person would make. This is precisely why the art, which can spring out of absolute fiction, rings so compellingly true. Applied drama helps us witness the values syntax in the order Begley suggested, and helps us create images and referents for what an ethics, such as an ethic of connectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464958">J. Frick &amp; Frick, 2010</xref>), or any other ethical framework might look like. Case studies may be more like dramatic scripts than has been acknowledged. They simply may need to be played out before us and not just read in solitude for their full import to be discovered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1942775112464958">
<title>From Framework to Outcomes: Witnessing Dramatic Decision Making</title>
<p>Rather than considering just one ethical framework, such as that of critique, or care, or connectedness, among others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1942775112464958">Shapiro and Stefkovich (2011)</xref> offered that the ethic of profession encompasses all the ethical perspectives, and that school leaders can and should utilize multiple ethical perspectives as needed or even simultaneously. They also point out that such solutions are highly significant in a more complex, globalizing world with increased diversity of students and stakeholders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1942775112464958">Eyal, Berkovich, and Schwartz (2011)</xref> noted that the adoption of the multiple ethical paradigms approach to dilemmas faced by principals contrasts with earlier approaches that assumed ethical dilemmas should be solved by adopting a single ethical posture, and then they go on to develop an instrument to test which of the multiple paradigms might or might not tend to correlate.</p>
<p>With this recent emphasis on a kind of breadth from multiple, simultaneous ethical frameworks working together as backdrop, we turn to the applied drama to help us visualize how that looks when working within this directed, fixed-script method. In watching or doing a play with a set outcome, that is, an outcome based on a complex network of decision making and interactions, which has been derived from the content of a standard case study, one can witness characters who may be motivated by multiple ethical perspectives trying to do the right thing. In addition then, by contrast, one can observe that the actions born from difficult ethical dilemmas tend to have a singularity about them that belies the multiplicity that the reasoned, integrative, and most likely thoughtful decision-making process might have actually entailed. The decision to fire a veteran teacher may have come about through the application of multiple ethical frameworks applied by well-intentioned administrators trying to do the right thing, but when accomplished has the same strong effect as if one had only been motivated by a single thought, such as, “I want to get that teacher fired.” Not an ethical motivation at all, it seems, and yet, the result is similar if not equal.</p>
<p>What a drama about such a decision-making process does is allow us to see the funneling effect of ethics on action and feel what is at stake as we see who benefits most and who is most pained. Drama prevents us from ignoring the intensity of the inevitable outcomes of our ethical decisions, no matter how well synthesized or multiple are the ethical frameworks that led us to them. The directed, fixed-script method reveals to us what any good comedy or tragedy would, that is, that actions are rarely perceived exactly as they are intended to be perceived, and that the results of our decisions rarely feel or are understood exactly as we had predicted they would be.</p>
<p>What is critical to this interdisciplinary work is to acknowledge that without imagination, we cannot perceive even one outcome, let alone the infinite that are possible. Drama helps us access the moral imagination and watch how things actually or potentially play out. In the workshop, we consciously apply one ethical framework based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464958">Begley (2010)</xref>, to all of the performed scenarios, and have found this to be very generative in terms of dialogue and thoughtful inquiry. Others could of course be used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1942775112464958">
<title>Drama As a Conceptual Orientation for Educational Leadership</title>
<p>Most ethical frameworks stress the cognitive domain, articulating those things that are easily verbalized or reasoned. Yet, the psycho-emotional domain features prominently in the most difficult interactions between school staff and administrators and among administrative teams, as does a physical reality in which these interactions take place. We sought a new conceptual orientation for understanding the fuller picture of school leadership, and particularly for understanding how relationality, a cognitive, psycho-emotional, and physical phenomenon, is felt by stakeholders in decision-making processes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464958">Katz and Quill (2008)</xref> argued that although one might be able to teach about ethical virtues through the detailed analysis of cases, learning about them through an art like literature, for example, offers distinct insights into what characters do in actually making decisions. For Katz and Quill, the characters found in novels
<disp-quote>
<p>often have to “muddle through” messy situations and make decisions on a less than fully rational basis, sometimes misunderstanding their own motivation and/or the situations they find themselves in, but dramatizing how deeply embedded features of their character manifest themselves through their conduct. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They also contend that the meaning of cases will be amplified if they are refashioned as literary works because when presented as static facts, cases lose the significance of the nuances that shape the dynamics of human interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1942775112464958">Katz &amp; Quill, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the process of turning cases into well-written, possibly more nuanced literary works, though admirable, has its limits. This process still fails to call on the bodily kinesthetic dimension of our knowledge and does not require us to exercise our intuition or imagination in any communal space. Real decision making happens in real time, on our feet, and requires an attunement to reason and intuition and others. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1942775112464958">Spolin (1963)</xref> suggested about the dramatic orientation in general, “the intuitive can only respond in immediacy right now. It comes bearing its gifts in the moment of spontaneity, the moment when we are freed to relate and act, involving ourselves in the moving, changing world around us” (p. 4). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942775112464958">Grosz (1994)</xref> reminded us that lived experiences are always embodied. In this way, although the best-written stories might allow us to imagine what we might do if we faced a similar situation, only drama provides us with an approximation of how we might act and actually feel were we to be placed as an actor who had to play the scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1942775112464958">Grosz, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>We realized that methods that performing artists routinely use to create and understand a fictional character can conversely be used to gain familiarity with the nonfiction characters with whom we all work, and are. The embodiment of the decision-making process involves the physicalization of the dynamics between persons, where actual, often unstated objectives usually complicate stated objectives and where uneven status levels play out in the midst of a negotiation in wordless ways. People’s feelings are rendered visible to us in actions, revealing a dramatic tension inherent in a whole range of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1942775112464958">Meyer, 2004</xref>). We turned to the art of drama to help us understand and process the content of highly charged decision-making moments in schools because it can hold this complexity.</p>

Frick and Frick (2010)</xref> have explored the importance of an ethic of connectedness for effective school leadership and the experience of a school district in nurturing and building a connectedness within the school community. They contend that this ethic of connectedness must be enculturated. The disciplinary term <italic>ensemble-building</italic>, which is used in the theater arts to describe those processes and methods that create interpersonal and intrapersonal trust, care, listening, attentiveness, responsiveness, and reliability, can perhaps best be understood, in educational leadership ethics terms, as an example of the ethic of connectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464958">Frick &amp; Frick, 2010</xref>) that seems so desired in the quest for real school improvement. The theater arts, by developing an ethic of connectedness, or by being ensemble-building enterprises, then, contain within them the acculturated practices for which Frick and Frick are calling, which is why synthesizing tactics between the theater arts and educational leadership becomes compelling and natural to consider.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1942775112464958">J. Frick and Frick (2010)</xref>, community is not defined as an entity but rather an ongoing set of processes that include communication, dialogue, and collaboration. This position purports that being and acting ethically cannot be achieved without collective commitment to the constructive methods of communal process.</p>
<p>How then do we get to know an ongoing set of processes that comprise such a place as a school? Sedentary reading seems to fall short as an answer. Solo decision making seems to lack the reality check of a dynamic workplace. Enacting the above propositions with educational leaders through the use of applied drama requires the very clear modeling of a collective commitment to constructive methods of communal processes. Alternative approaches that help us study leadership in its three-dimensionality seem worthy of consideration given the recent scholarship in educational leadership ethics that points in these directions.</p>
<p>If we look at the lists of traits or dispositions of moral leaders, as delineated, for example, in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1942775112464958">Starratt (2004)</xref> as responsibility, authenticity, and presence, or in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1942775112464958">Begley (2005)</xref> who proposed reflective self-honesty, relational sensitivity, and dialogical openness, what emerges are qualities of character that are easily and readily available to analyze, enact, and practice in an interdisciplinary manner. Each trait above has a potentially performative aspect. We can literally witness these qualities as they are actively lived in our colleagues whom we admire. Although we cannot stare at our coworkers, in attending to drama, we are given permission to gaze at a play that is somewhat life-like and can elicit profound emotion and cognition, even kinesthetic response, simultaneously.</p>
<p>The inherent by-products of the theater processes include being accountable to others to do one’s part; being real or finding the reality within an imagined situation long enough to hold it and study it and feel it; being in the moment; discovering truths; being sensitive to others by seeing and listening; taking in all viewpoints, including personal history; and immersing oneself in a world of dissonant or consonant beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1942775112464958">Spolin, 1963</xref>). Applied theater counts on these disciplinary specific educational benefits without pointing toward a professionally produced final product as the goal of doing theatrical exploration.</p>
<p>The extensive applications of dramatic methods from the art of theater, broadly conceived, to other subjects has yielded dozens of categories under the broadly arching terms of <italic>process drama</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1942775112464958">O’Neill, 1995</xref>) or <italic>applied drama</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464958">Nicholson, 2005</xref>) that have unique histories but also do at times overlap in their techniques and outcomes. Oftentimes, these forms of drama rely heavily on improvising roles and not knowing how things will turn out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464958">Nicholson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1942775112464958">O’Neill, 1995</xref>). Conceptually, they are modes of learning that allow learners of any age to use imagined roles to explore issues, events, and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1942775112464958">Crumpler, Rogers, &amp; Schneider, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing heavily on process and applied drama techniques, the directed, fixed-script approach focuses participants on learning and thinking about some of the ethical dilemmas inherent in educational administration, gives them the foundational content one would have in a traditional case study, and allows them to develop an embodied understanding of complex decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112464958">Clark et al., 1997</xref>). With drama as a conceptual orientation for understanding the dynamics of leadership, we attempt a more authentic, more fully realized simulation of the lives of school leaders.</p>

<title>Engaging Drama in School Leadership</title>
<p>The illuminations of the intersections and mutual implications between theater and ethics in the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112464958">Ridout (2009)</xref> provided the theoretical orientation used in this study. Ridout suggested that theater is exceptionally well suited to dramatize ethical situations. Ridout posits that since the time of Plato, the theater, though the home of fiction, is a practice and a place through which we can experiment with ethical action and seek truth.</p>
<p>In this interdisciplinary work, we turned to the theater arts for their analytic methods, vocabulary and dynamic embodiment of human situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112464958">Ridout (2009)</xref> helped bridge the idea of drama and ethics as he pointed out that the two fields revolve around the same core question, insofar as both theater and ethics ask, “How shall I act?”</p>
<p>The study attempted to illuminate not only how theater might provide an avenue to study ethical acts but also how it might allow students to gain a sense of embodying them. This is significant because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112464958">Begley (1999)</xref> argued that preparation programs designed for educational administrators should not treat ethics as another management strategy to be observed from a distance. Rather, professors of educational administration ought to immerse educational leaders in the struggles associated with the challenges of determining what is right, not just what is most expedient, or efficient, or effective under a specific set of circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1942775112464958">Begley, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the theoretical orientation provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112464958">Ridout (2009)</xref>, three key questions about developing school leaders warrant serious consideration:</p>
<list id="list1-1942775112464958" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How might insights and techniques lent from theater methods help educators to more actively construct and engage new understandings of the typical situations encountered in the school as a workplace environment?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How might theater broaden our understanding of difference and help educators develop empathy?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When given opportunities to experience the dynamics of human interplay from a dramatic perspective, do educators experience new attitudes, outlooks, or capabilities regarding their felt understanding of the ethical dimensions of school leadership?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This study attempted to answer these questions by observing and also asking educators to share their experiences of participating in a workshop that used an innovative directed, scripted approach to explore some of the ethical dimensions of school leadership.</p>

<title>Methodological Approach</title>
<p>Many researchers have realized that disciplinary specialization has costs, not the least of these being fragmenting knowledge and narrowing understandings that only partially inform problem solving encountered in real life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1942775112464958">Kafatos &amp; Eisner, 2004</xref>). Educators are not purely students of some subject matter. Rather they should be students of problems, and problems cut right across the borders of any subject matter or discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1942775112464958">Popper, 1963</xref>). Artists consider their work in making a scene come to life to be a problem-solving endeavor. Thus, this study adopted an interdisciplinary orientation that allowed for the creative and critical expression of knowledge, skills, and dispositions from two seemingly different specialties. Taken together, theater and educational administration integrate two different sets of problem-solving skills as a means to shed new light on contemporary problems in personnel management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1942775112464958">Brewer, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>When academic researchers collaborate with theater artists, they bring together their respective areas of expertise to a project and create a synergistic product that more effectively balances science and art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1942775112464958">Saldana, 2010</xref>). It is fairly accepted that interdisciplinary approaches, when they bring together the authentic learning from their respective fields or disciplines, can yield great insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1942775112464958">Popper, 1963</xref>). Theater is an interesting partner to education because theater is a powerful tool for building community. It is also a creative, social activity that allows for the exploration of concepts, issues, and problems central to the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1942775112464958">Clark et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>An interpretative analytic framework and case study methodology were used in this qualitative, arts-based research study. Because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112464958">McCammon (2007)</xref> contended, “the dominant methodology in drama/theater education research is the descriptive case study,” (p. 950) our project, which reenvisions the use of cases in educational leadership development, became a case study in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464958">McMillan, 2010</xref>). <italic>Arts-based research</italic> is an umbrella term for diverse research practices and can include, among other things, performance scripts and theater performances as methodological tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1942775112464958">Hesse-Biber &amp; Leavy, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our interest in meanings, perspectives, and understandings led us to apply a qualitative research approach to the entire workshop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112464958">Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2012</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1942775112464958">Belliveau and Lea (2011)</xref> asserted, arts-based research often draws on traditional qualitative research tools to gather data, and these data collection tools can include items such as open-ended questionnaires and field notes. Thus, the primary sources of data came from participants’ responses to a set of pre- and postworkshop open-ended questionnaires, and from nonparticipant observer field notes made during the workshop by a research assistant who was not a workshop facilitator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112464958">Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112464958">McCammon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464958">McMillan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1942775112464958">Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The preworkshop questionnaire consisted of eight items that asked participants to provide some background demographic data about themselves and to note any previous experience with case study pedagogical approaches to exploring ethical dimensions of school leadership. The postworkshop questionnaire, which consisted of 12 items, asked the participants to express their opinions about the value of this directed, fixed-script approach and also included questions about key concepts participants thought they might take away from the workshop. The open-ended questionnaires were designed to allow participants to provide answers to open questions in their own terms or in a manner that reflected their own perceptions rather than those of the researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1942775112464958">Johnson &amp; Christensen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The nonparticipant observer recorded the specific activities of the workshop and noted participant comments and interactions that the research assistant felt noteworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464958">McMillan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1942775112464958">Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2010</xref>). Throughout the data gathering, the researchers tried to remain cognizant of the caution offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1942775112464958">Beare and Belliveau (2008)</xref> who suggested that one of the biggest challenges in art-based approaches to research is maintaining a balance between the art and research foci.</p>
<p>The researchers did not attempt to predict what the outcomes might be for participants, but analyzed the data using a recursive, also referred to as a constant-comparative, approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464958">McMillan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1942775112464958">Plano Clark &amp; Creswell, 2010</xref>) to see whether this unique endeavor in professional development for school leaders might in some small ways build their perceptions of their creative capacity as active and empathetic learners, and deepen their awareness of the ethical dimensions of educational leadership.</p>
<p>The recursive analysis involved identifying a set of key themes by reading and rereading the questionnaires and field notes, and organizing themes into a coded hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464958">McMillan, 2010</xref>). Clustering lower order codes developed higher order themes. This approach allowed flexibility in some of the themes being developed a priori from the literature review, whereas other codes were developed during the analysis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1942775112464958">McMillan, 2010</xref>). All methodological procedures complied with ethical guidelines approved by two university ethics boards.</p>
<sec id="section8-1942775112464958">
<title>The Participants</title>
<p>A total of 3 men and 11 women participated in the study. Seven of the participants held formal school leadership positions, such as principal, vice-principal, or department head. Three were teachers. Two others held leadership roles at either a postsecondary institution or in education-related community-based programs. Finally, two of the participants were full-time students who aspired to be educational administrators at some point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1942775112464958">
<title>The Workshop</title>
<p>The authors cofacilitated a 2-day intensive workshop in theatrical methods for educational leaders focused on developing, studying, and experiencing directed, fixed-script dramas. The workshop, which drew on classic and contemporary ensemble-building methods that are frequently applied in the service of developing performing arts projects, is best characterized as a form of applied/process drama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1942775112464958">Nicholson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1942775112464958">O’Neill, 1995</xref>) as it was largely process oriented and not designed for a performance for a larger audience external to the workshop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1942775112464958">McCammon, 2007</xref>). As such, the participants had to work alone in writing, drawing, thinking, and moving; with a partner in pair-share exercises; accomplish dozens of carefully ordered and progressively challenging movement and vocal exercises like mirroring, statues, action/reaction; and in discussing the ever changing and developing sense of trust, ensemble, connectedness, etcetera, they might be experiencing. They also worked in small groups to rehearse and perform their assigned play, taking roles that did not reflect their current professional position. Thus, we had principals playing students, teachers playing administrators, and so on.</p>
<p>Each group worked with the director to explore entrances, stage movement patterns, interrelations between characters, postures, gestures, vocal choices, and concluding stage pictures. All of the choices made were built on the vocabulary of theater we had established through the entire workshop. Life experience and imagination helped participants create believable portrayals of their characters. The entire group functioned as a cohesive ensemble in exercises, discussions, and during large-scale group drawings and brainstorming projects. All of this served to warm-up and free the body, voice, and mind for the culminating work of staging the plays in small groups for other participants to witness and discuss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1942775112464958">Spolin, 1963</xref>). Group discussion, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1942775112464958">Begley’s (2010)</xref> framework, on the ethical dilemmas highlighted in each script followed the performances. A final, individual-written reflection concluded the workshop.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1942775112464958">
<title>The Scripts</title>
<p>In this project, we scripted and dramatized fictional but universal narratives that had been previously taught as straightforward cases in an education graduate-level course. The important intervening step between the stand-alone cases borrowed from an educational administration course and the fixed scripts was the writing of a fictional book-length narrative that created a literary arc through all of the stories and put them in relation to one another. The scripts, fully formatted with stage directions and settings, were adapted from various scenes in the book-length narrative. As mentioned previously, three one-act plays titled <italic>Grace Period, Discrimination</italic>, and <italic>How to Fire a Teacher</italic> were used at this workshop.</p>
<p>Participants each took a role in one of the one-act scenarios and were able to witness the other plays as audience members. The nuanced coaching and direction mimicked a professional theater setting, with director as dramaturg, facilitator of creative choices by the actors, movement and vocal coach, and integrator of all elements. This approach in part addresses the criticism supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1942775112464958">Abbs (1992)</xref>, who alleged that drama, used extensively as a medium for cross-curricular learning, has lost its integrity: “Devoid of art, devoid of the practices of theater, devoid of artistic and critical terminology, drama became a method of teaching without a subject” (p. 2). The high quality of the presentations and moments of authentic insight about human nature, discovered through the directed, fixed-script method, conveyed the ethical dilemmas in each scenario all the more clearly.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the strong performances elicited from this process, the intention of the workshop was to explore the complex intersections of methodologies in drama, educational leadership, and ethics that might facilitate understandings and the construction of meaning among educational leaders when exposed to these two worlds of expertise with ethical concerns as an intersection; it was not to turn participants into advanced actors or educational leadership professionals into directors.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings drawn from the analysis of the data collected during the workshop revealed that, overall, the participants found that a theatricalized approach to understanding the ethical dimensions of decision making for educational leaders had tremendous value. For the purposes of this article, we focus on three emergent themes that presented themselves in the written comments of several participants and were supported by the data derived from the field notes. The first theme was the participants’ reactions to a theatrical approach to studying cases in general. The second was their perceptions about and experience of theater as an imaginative experience of otherness. The third theme highlights their perceptions of leadership and ethics not only as understood cognitively but also as developed through the embodied, felt dimensions of the physical and emotional learning domains.</p>
<sec id="section12-1942775112464958">
<title>Scripts and Dramatic Approaches Get Cases on Their Feet</title>
<p>It was clear to all participants who read the workshop description that we were going to approach typical school leadership cases differently. It is therefore not surprising that throughout the workshop, participants took numerous opportunities to articulate that they found the idea of studying cases as scripts interesting in many ways. However, what emerged in the analysis of the data were actual values statements regarding the worth of an intentional, embodied, active mode of learning in their field. In fact, they made a point to note, variously, how this approach to understanding the contextual dimensions of school leadership was different from other ways they had studied educational leadership, and they seemed intrigued by what the workshop might offer. This sentiment is illustrated by the comments made by two participants, who stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Usually when we discuss [educational leadership] cases we are on the outside of case studies looking in, but this is very different. (P-14)</p>
<p>[I find it] much easier to internalize by seeing the situations performed. I hate being asked to read through a case so that we can then discuss it. I was happy when I found we could watch them and “do” them instead of just reading about them. (P-3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During the workshop exercises and rehearsals, many participants noted that the scripted and enacted approaches were unlike other experiences with more traditional approaches to learning from cases. For example, participants stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>This workshop approach was so much less theoretical than the traditional case study approaches [I am used to], and I like this one better. (P-10)</p>
<p>I know I remember much more through acting than simply reading a study in an education class. (P-7)</p>
<p>I think most people understand situations better when they can see them played out in front of them. (P-2)</p>
<p>Most of the cases I had read previously were in the context of legal case studies, where you tried to guess the verdict and why the jury decided that way. They were mostly put into a win/lose situation. (P-8)</p>
<p>Usually it [studying cases] is a solitary study and personal reflection, or sometimes it involves a passing, small-group discussion. But, it’s usually not a personally creative and physical investment. (P-14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of the participants’ comments illustrate that although traditional teaching approaches to studying cases might be touted as pedagogical tools that allow students to think on their feet, the participants did not perceive that those approaches really allowed for purposeful, embodied interaction with experience.</p>
<p>In addition, many of the participants agreed that their past experiences of enacting cases in educational leadership, oftentimes described as role-plays, were awkward or limited ways of understanding the dilemmas or construction of meanings those cases were purportedly meant to deliver. For different reasons, they had found the role-plays frustrating. A powerful example was offered by one of the participants who contrasted his previous experiences of role-plays with the theater methods and approaches of the workshop:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve had some experience with role-plays, which were often open-ended by design. But, these written scripts were not. It was different knowing where or how the story will end and having to try and work within that, and it focused me to think about the specific words and actions, and not just portray the facts of the case. (P-14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, a number of participants explained how they had experienced open-ended role-plays, where a partially sketched-out character description lets learners improvise multiple outcomes and interactions. Many expressed that the usefulness of unscripted role-plays had depended on the quality of each individual’s improvisational skills, which were not always refined enough or even enough to make the case seem realistic. They also noted that oftentimes, the usefulness of the exercise suffered as the performance tended to degenerate into frivolity. As one participant stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the time, when we’ve done role-plays, things have gotten carried away and people start to bring in things that have nothing to do with the case. I am not sure if they are overly self-conscious or what, but in the enjoyment of playing a role they overact and the whole thing becomes unrealistic. (P-11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One innovative aspect of the workshop that elicited favorable comments was how it involved theatrical techniques, stage direction, and relied on a script that could be read, studied, and returned to. The following statement of one participant, which was recorded during one of the workshop breaks, illustrates this sentiment:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think there is a lot that can learned by drawing on the [drama] techniques we learned and used [in the workshop] to help us learn how to reflect on some of the really hard ethical challenges that come with being a leader. (P-2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants remarked that they saw unique value in the use of scripted plays as learning tools for those who are, or hope to be, school leaders. They felt the script and stage direction helped them develop awareness of some of the complex, organizational politics that are involved in many decision-making processes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The scripts were so real in many ways. In exposing others to these kinds of personnel dilemmas, I think it can prepare them to think on their feet through simulation rather than a trial-by-fire, real-life first-time exposure . . . This process definitely helped validate a process of feeling my way through the possible outcomes of the real-life dramas we can expect to encounter. (P-10)</p>
<p>I definitely think I learned more about what leaders go through, and will retain the information. I am kind of surprised how much I enjoyed the theatricalized scripting of case studies. (P-12)</p>
<p>I think this [experience] absolutely helps me envision a solution or multiple solutions to the real-life problems in ed. leadership, in different ways than I did before. (P-11)</p>
<p>It was almost nightmarish to go home the first night, crack open the script, and read about a dilemma I had just lived and suffered through recently at my school. I might not have believed every detail otherwise, but it was all there. (P-6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Frequently in rehearsing and acting out the scripts during the workshop, it was noted by the nonparticipant observer that the participants made comments that the factors that are considered by administrators in their decision-making processes were not really as black and white as many might have previously thought. By literally having to jump into a role, armed with some tools with which to do so, the participants indicated that they were immersed in the communal, ensemble dynamic of live theater, which was a new way of knowing for many of them, and involved gradations of meaning rather than easy pronouncements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1942775112464958">
<title>Opportunities to Imagine and Enact Provide a Greater Sense of Empathy</title>
<p>Not only did participants note that their understandings of the complexity of the ethics of personnel management in schools increased, but they also described how taking on a character that was different from their own seemed to open them to experience another’s perspective that they would otherwise not have known. One participant remarked at the end of the first evening that she had been cast in a role that put her into the position she was hoping to one day hold, that of school principal. She noted that, in preparing for a role in the scene she had been led to reflect deeply on who she would be in actuality someday, and in her notes, she mentioned that she had never actually visualized herself as principal until that workshop experience. Other people also said they were playing roles they did not hold currently but that one day they could indeed see themselves in those positions.</p>
<p>It seemed that participants could easily commiserate with the teacher and student characters found throughout any given play, having for the most part lived both roles, though they were often challenged by playing teachers or students that bore little or no resemblance to their own attitude, experiences, or circumstances. It was the hard reality of administrators and human resources staff trying to do the right thing that captured their imagination. The ethical dilemmas faced by those in charge of the hiring, retention, and firing of teachers were quite intriguing for many participants who had never had to deal with those particular ethical issues, as supported by one participant who stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I may be able to act out various scenarios on my own to practice, visualize and feel the consequences of various solutions . . . But, I’ve never seen human resources this way. (P-7)</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two further examples of how the workshop deepened understandings and transparency of the impact of the kind of personnel-related issues that transpire in schools are illustrated by the following comments:
<disp-quote>
<p>The [scripts] helped me envision what the human resources people go through when faced with some really tough challenges. (P-7)</p>
<p>I’ve always felt that our district human resources [personnel] had it hard, especially as I watched the painful process of a school in my former district being shut down. Now even more, I do not envy their job. It’s clear that the work takes a toll on them. (P-5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The empathy expressed for those in the role of human resources directors in schools alone was significant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a number of participants noted that the theatrical approaches of the workshop enlivened their overall perspectives on all relationships in schools. For example, in a conversation with one of the workshop facilitators, a participant stated, “I started to wonder what [I would do] if I was that character instead of this one? How should or would I act in that situation?” (P-1), whereas another participant commented, “I’ve been thinking: If I was his character [pointing at another participant], what would I do or want to do in the scene? This [approach] helps support a process of thinking through the possible outcomes of some real-life dramas.” (P-9)</p>
<p>Several of the participants stated that they had been told in lectures or workshops that it was important for those in leadership positions to try to see the challenges they faced from multiple perspectives but had not been exposed to a practice that could teach a person what this really meant. In this workshop format, the notion of empathy was not just a notion to be spoken about but had to be enacted to fully understand the drama. This can be illustrated by the following comments two participants shared:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Now] I appreciate more and get a feeling of the story behind the story, and the perspective that brings from having to act it out. (P-3)</p>
<p>I’ve lived many of these scenes from [only] one side and never knew how being on the other side felt. (P-11)</p>
<p>Theater allows us to digest an issue from a different perspective. (P-12)</p>
<p>Regardless of what your truth is, you know, those things you hold to be true, now I can get a sense of how others may perceive my actions and me differently than I perceive my own actions. (P-5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Throughout the second day of the workshop, many of the participants noted that the characters in the scripts often resonated with them personally, as they had to navigate through messy situations and make decisions on less than a fully informed basis. Participants appreciated the way art allowed them to hold complexity, if only in an ephemeral way, long enough to witness its many facets, one of which is this walking in the shoes of another.</p>
<p>Interestingly, no one thought that having his or her own perspective challenged was a bad thing, and some of the participants were clearly moved by the mental and emotional pain and suffering of certain characters. Participants seemed welcoming of the possibility that by working through the cases as scripts and building compassion for multiple characters in a scenario, they might be more astute and alert to the right course of action should they encounter a situation like this in the future:
<disp-quote>
<p>Drama does help you see many sides of an issue and gives you a chance to think creatively how you might act in the same situation. (P-2)</p>
<p>If I really want to practice being in the shoes of someone else and anticipate their motivations or get their perspectives, I need chances to try it out . . . Drama is real-life emotional engagement in a specific situation. (P-14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Seeing things before they happen, and experiencing facets of the human condition that we would never otherwise see, may be two of the great gifts of theater not only to education but also to the world.</p>
<p>Another dimension of empathy that was written and spoken about by educational leaders in the workshop was their growing awareness themselves as creative beings:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had already thought about leadership as being somewhat creative, but now my thinking about leadership as a creative act has changed. (P-14)</p>
<p>My thinking about myself [as a leader] has [actually] changed as a result of the workshop. (P-4)</p>
<p>I’d already considered leadership to be a kind of artistic act, both literally and figuratively, and this workshop simply reinforced that for me. (P-5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because the artistic self can go unnourished in our professional “day jobs,” rediscovering that self could be seen as a form of self-empathy or compassion for self. In addition, some participants noted that the workshop became more revelatory than they had expected, insofar as it revealed a more explicit philosophical understanding of the connections between creativity, ethics and leadership:
<disp-quote>
<p>The workshop showed me that as a teacher or leader I have a great capacity to teach others how to be creative. Leadership is not black and white but mostly grey . . . and drama shows that. (P-7)</p>
<p>I’ve never thought of leadership as a creative act, not really. But after this workshop I guess I will from now on. (P-3)</p>
<p>Now I am thinking that leadership is about strategy, tact, human relations and sensing others. [I now see that] the same is true for acting. (P-2)</p>
<p>Decision-making, at least ethical decision-making, means considering more roles, considering more people. Rather than taking one of the obvious solutions, I ought to consider my and other’s reactions to ethical dilemmas. (P-1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, the interdisciplinarity of the workshop connected to many participants’ intuitive notions of how leadership demands a sort of creativity in action. If empathy itself is a creative act of the imagination, without the fostering of creativity, empathy might be limited. Here, it appears that the workshop provided real opportunities to develop both.</p>

<title>A Directed, Fixed-Script Approach Develops a Felt Sense of Relational Trust</title>
<p>The participants commented on how being directed and acting through the scripted plays helped them develop a different understanding of how interpersonal relationships are felt in ethically charged situations. As one participant wrote in response to a question about what he might take away from the workshop in the postworkshop questionnaire,
<disp-quote>
<p>The thing that I think will most resonate with me in my day-to-day work in schools will be the reminder to take time to build trust and give opportunities for successful interaction before entering high stakes work or decision-making. (P-9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many also noted how the use of scripts and having to act in the real time of the workshop performance enhanced their understanding of the importance and complexities of what it means to be committed to relationships in the workplace. One participant stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Other experiences that I’ve had in studying educational administration seemed to lack the human dimensions of trust building. I also found it a real challenge to try and reflect on what is going on in the relationship in many case studies previously as it was presented as if the relationship existed outside of time. (P-11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants suggested that although they had known that education is based on various dimensions of human morality and relationship, they had never really felt how hard it was to try and live out all of the competing commitments that exist between people who work in schools:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve always known it’s [teaching and learning] about relationships and building trust, but it also just takes time and lots of effort. In the plays I could feel that. (P-10)</p>
<p>When we were working on our scripts in a group, and maybe because of the vocal and theater exercises we practiced, I began to really consider the question of how it feels to develop trust with someone. Maybe it has something to do with dismantling boundaries between people; I am not sure but it makes me think. (P-12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many noted how the workshop allowed them to move beyond thinking about their bodies in a self-conscious manner, and begin to experience how their bodies felt as they enacted scripts that depicted ethically charged scenes. As two participants noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>What stood out for me is the fact that ethics and theater can be [so] closely related. In the midst of the dramas I experience in school, the ones I know I feel even when I try not to think about how I feel, I now get a sense of how I might be able to detach myself and try to feel the situation as a scene. I think this will help me in my work with people. (P-3)</p>
<p>I do need to remember that I do not know the entire personal situation of every person involved. There is a certain amount of empathy that needs to take place when knowing a situation will not turn out well for someone involved. But, tough decisions do need to be made. (P-8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, the participants noted that taking time to act and also watch scenarios between characters representing school staff opened some avenues of reflection on the topic of relational trust and its impact on school culture and climate. The participants expressed that by engaging stories as scripts—and literally performing ethical dilemmas—that the relationships between stakeholders in the cases were brought to life. The rehearsal and performances of the cases illuminated the reality of personal human experiences and the importance of relationships. Many noted how the dramas helped them better understand how ethical dimensions of educational leadership might be practiced.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In educational leadership preparation, thinking through or talking through scenarios brought up in cases is a predominate mode of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1942775112464958">Kowalski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1942775112464958">Strike et al., 2005</xref>). Exercises that claim interactivity or kinesthetic components, like traditional role-play, are often low-stakes activities and can be conducted without challenging values or ethical practice deeply or transforming meaningfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1942775112464958">van Ments, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1942775112464958">Wilheim, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Repositioning leadership preparation in a creative, interactive, fully-kinesthetic atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1942775112464958">Nicholson, 1999</xref>) made sense to the workshop participants of this study who engaged with passion, energy, and thoughtfulness, and who seemed satisfied with their ability to go out on these creative limbs of imaginative dramatic play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1942775112464958">Egan, 1992</xref>). Indeed, the arguments made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1942775112464958">Mintzberg (2004)</xref> regarding the lack of tacit knowledge in the case approach and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1942775112464958">Smith (1987)</xref>, who characterized some of the pedagogical uses of the traditional case study approach as poor methods for learning the kind of proactive skills required in management decisions, were strengthened by the consistently positive response of participants experiencing this arts-based and certainly more kinesthetic approach. It was clear that there was tremendous value in allowing people to move beyond the reconfirming dialogues they have with themselves in their heads as they study cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1942775112464958">Takacs, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>After experiencing these creative processes, participants questioned other more staid modes of learning, perhaps because the content of the cases was delivered or experienced through multiple learning literacies. In addition, because we did not design this project to include a norm by which we could make a more quantitative comparison of the learning gains when these exact three themes were taught as more straightforward cases in a graduate classroom setting, we had to rely on the participant’s own memory of their experiences with studying similar case content in a typical graduate school class. Although it would be interesting to create such an experiment, that was not the intent of this particular research project. Indeed, the workshop methods allowed administrators, teacher-leaders, and graduate students vistas into the real, felt dimensions of educational leadership using learning literacies in an integrative way that allowed the space for the discussion of all of the methods they have used to develop their approach to ethical decision making thus far. The pedagogical approach of the workshop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1942775112464958">O’Toole, 2009</xref>), by virtue of engaging the theater arts, required that the cognitive, affective, and psycho-motor domains be explored simultaneously and fully to create a believable, multidimensional character who would bring to life the words in the fixed scripts and embody the connectedness of people facing an ethic dilemma in which conflict is inherent.</p>
<p>It also appears that by inhabiting a role and physically walking in someone else’s shoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464958">Kana &amp; Aitken, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112464958">McNaughton, 2004</xref>), learners can access a fuller picture of human frailty and strength. Empathy is seen as the process of putting one’s self in the place of another and trying to experience the events of her or his life from that person’s perspective. We begin to empathize when we get a felt sense of what it might be like to think, feel, or just be like another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1942775112464958">O’Toole, 2009</xref>). The findings suggest there is value in exploring theatrical ways of thinking about ethics, ones in which we “judge our behavior in the guise of an imaginary ‘spectator’ within us” and also “see others in light of our own creative imaginings of being them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112464958">Ridout, 2009</xref>, p. 33). What started to emerge in this study was this intentional investigation of otherness as a trait of an effective leader, in essence, the moral imagination that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1942775112464958">Tuana (2007)</xref> articulated as a base for ethics. Applied drama developed a trusting environment in which to act out these sometimes trying or even traumatic narratives that are all too recognizable by the seasoned school administrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1942775112464958">Kana &amp; Aitken, 2007</xref>) such that learners could empathize with the humanity in each and every character within a scenario.</p>
<p>The embodied learning assisted the ethical inquiry that was a through line of the workshop content. When there is a crisis or a reckoning in personnel management in schools that requires a creative and ethical response, people in proximity with one another move through the problems in an embodied way while thinking about and feeling them. Arguably, although the intentions or reasons for an act tell us something about the morality of the individual, it is the ends of the act that tell us about the morality of the action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1942775112464958">Ciulla, 2007</xref>). Ultimately, the study of ethics, usually the domain of lecture and discussion, came alive through the dramatized scenarios that each participant lived through in the nuanced fiction, that is, theater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1942775112464958">O’Neill, 1995</xref>). Clearly, ethics is grounded in practice, and theater and ethics are about how one ought to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1942775112464958">Ridout, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1942775112464958">Starratt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The present analysis suggests that, at a minimum, theatrical approaches to the ethical dimensions of leadership are worthy of consideration by those invested in finding effective ways that support the ongoing development of school leaders. The findings of this study suggest that such theatrical approaches have the potential to contribute to effective leadership in multiple ways, some of which have been illuminated. The special relevance to school leadership, indeed any form of organizational leadership, revolves around the fact that leadership is enacted from a leader and follower perspective. The drama found in school leadership can be viewed as a metaphor for understanding human behavior as staged performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1942775112464958">Sinha, 2010</xref>). We can read others and be read like a character in a play. The gestures, posture, voice, and word choices we use are expressive; even when we mislead, we are expressive. A leader who finds ways to stay in office most of the day is acting like he or she does not want to be seen in his or her school. A leader who gets angry while explaining that everyone needs to be more civil with one another cannot hope to fulfill the request. A leader who takes time to listen fully to a teacher’s complaint may have acted just like the complainant in another scenario earlier in his or her own professional life. When we take, even temporarily, drama as a conceptual orientation for our work in schools, much is potentially revealed to us about ourselves and our potential to contribute creatively, compassionately and ethically to a school’s climate and culture.</p>
<p>One of the unique facets of this workshop was the pairing of two people as facilitators who admittedly could not do one another’s work. The results of this research do not show so much how one teacher not schooled in theater may take on portions of this work, but rather how two disciplinary specialists can provide something as an artist—educational researcher practitioner pair. Thus, the encouragement is given to practitioners in the field of educational and leadership ethics to collaborate with skilled and experienced performing artists whose dramaturgical skills can explore key themes in another’s field of inquiry. Such collaborations should yield more lively and engaging enactments of small scenes or larger one-act plays in the classroom, and will hopefully build upon this present research. The only way to gain access to theatrical methods to replicate or integrate them into one’s own teaching is to experience theater as an embodied art through full investment into the learning process with a skilled mentor or facilitator. After that experience, the educational practitioner will have a multitude of tactics from which he or she may draw to implement elements of appropriately.</p>
<p>Clearly, what is needed is more empirical research that tests some of the ideas proposed in this article. Given the complexities that are inherent in school leadership, more robust understandings of what constitutes effective preparation pedagogies hold great promise not only for those who lead schools but also for all those who invest in educational success.</p>

<sec id="section16-1942775112464958" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Strengthening the capacity for potent and authentic leadership in contemporary school contexts is more important than ever. Educational leaders are not passive recipients of a story that occurs at school but are, instead, active participants in their events, tensions, problems, and solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1942775112464958">McNaughton, 2004</xref>). We suggest that in this second decade of the 21st century, we should consider an inspired turn in leadership development that, at its best, demands and supports new goals such as skill-building, mindfulness, creativity, and dialogue.</p>
<p>We found strong indications that the performing arts disciplines provide us with alternative pedagogical approaches to generate meaningful and lasting insight into the stories inevitably found in leadership preparation programs. Further iterations of the workshop will need to be conducted and researched for us to better understand correlations between specific elements of the entire process and the ways in which these are creatively and intellectually interpreted by participants. Although not conclusive, the findings of this study point toward a natural fusion of the ethical and the creative act, and how theater methods like the closely directed, fixed-script approach we have developed can provide a tangible experience of that integration.</p>
<p>School leaders, who might generally admit to dreading the drama of the workplace, were given access to useful ethical frameworks that could help them evaluate difficult real cases more responsibly and responsively. The stories they enacted became poignant, tense, gut-wrenching vistas into the profession, and the discussions regarding ethical choices in educational leadership became passionate, emphatic, and clarifying. Whereas we have the possibility of ignoring concepts we should be exposed to when they reside as cases, stories made real through collaborative dramatization and reflection are arresting, demanding, and unforgettable.</p>
<p>Imagine reframing the drama of the workplace as a means to understand how to better problem-solve. The drama in school leadership, when perceived as an unforeseeable series of chaotic, not-in-the-plan behaviors of coworkers, is depleting. The drama in school leadership, when studied as drama through dramatic means, transforms by bringing forth in the leader a creative, collaborative sensibility. Leaders trained in this way, who learn to anticipate complexity and develop empathy, who are aware of the thorny situations that will inevitably present themselves, and who know how to actively engage in complex decision making, will likely be better prepared to thrive in the diverse and changing world of schooling in the 21st century. The leader who asks himself or herself “How shall I act?” needs to be given time and space and direction to reflect on that felt understanding in community with others; the leader who considers his or her role as inherently creative and ethical will not be stuck in a singular, bounded vision of a situation, but will live out the answers to that profound question in ways that surely benefit the complex collaboration we call school.</p>
