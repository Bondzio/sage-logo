<p>In <italic>Imagining Black Womanhood</italic>, Stephanie D. Sears tackles complex questions surrounding identity work by asking how identity is negotiated across power, race, gender, and age. Conducting ethnographic research at the Girls Empowerment Project (GEP), an after-school program for young girls living in low-income housing, Sears examines how the participants and the women who run the organization negotiate and construct black womanhood. By creating a social space for the girls and women of Sun Valley, the GEP becomes a site for multi-class and multi-generational women to contest what is black womanhood, with the girls’ “politics of respect” coming into conflict with the women’s “politics of respectability.”</p>
<p>Sears situates identity work in the organizational context of the GEP; this approach provides an understanding of how the individual and the collective are part of the identity work process. She offers the term “organizational power matrix” to reveal how organizational environment, culture, and structure can be domains of power in identity work. Setting the stage for her analysis, the author provides an overview of the emergence of the GEP in response to the sociopolitical and institutional environment of the early 1990s that produced “The Urban Girl” stereotype. Sears discusses the GEP’s culture of empowerment that created a black-female-only space where the girls could express and create their cultural identity. Further, the structure of GEP allowed for multi-directional power relations between the girls and women. Negotiation of identity comes to the fore during the GEP’s public dance performances. The girls express their femininity through hip-hop dance, seeing it as a part of the authentic black identity, and thus essential to their construction of black womanhood. This comes into conflict with the staff’s Afrocentric womanist femininity that resists the hypersexualized and objectified black, female body. In the end, contestations of identity work in the organizational context create a space where the girls are able to imagine, construct, and negotiate their own version of black womanhood with that of the staff.</p>
<p>Sears’ accessible writing style and captivating vignettes would fit well in undergraduate courses on race or gender and sexuality, while its theoretical contribution on identity work offers compelling discussions for graduate seminars. This book would also be a useful resource for activists and community organizers in understanding inherent power relations in any social justice project.</p>
