<abstract>
<p>This article presents a case study that investigated primary school students’ social interaction while working in small groups in science. The aim was to identify what characterizes and triggers students’ efficacious interaction in collaborative learning situations. This was done by exploring and analyzing students’ and groups’ task involvement and the quality of their activity. The micro-level analysis proceeded first by identifying episodes of group task involvement and evaluating the quality of these interaction episodes. Next, the transitions between episodes were explored by identifying what triggered the shifts between task involvement levels. Ten hours of video observation data captured fourth-grade students, aged 9 to 10, in two groups of 3 students studying “the vital conditions of life” for 5 weeks. The main findings indicated that efficacious interaction demanded collaboration between group members and required active participation and productive on-task working. Three types of triggers were found to cause changes in students’ activity, of which the group progress trigger was the most powerful for increasing, and the contextual trigger the most powerful for decreasing the activity. These findings shed light on certain aspects of efficacious interaction that will help us to identify details of efficacious interaction in future studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Previous small group interaction research has extensively described practices, processes, and conditions that lead to effective interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1046496412437208">Cohen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046496412437208">Greeno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046496412437208">Soller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1046496412437208">Tuyay, Jennings, &amp; Dixon, 1995</xref>). The focus of these interaction studies has been on investigating the form and the content of individuals’ behavior, specifically social interaction. Thus the main interest has been in investigating the features, forms, and nature of group interactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046496412437208">Mercer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1046496412437208">Webb, Troper, &amp; Fall, 1995</xref>) and identifying different patterns and episodes that are conducive to learning in small groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046496412437208">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1046496412437208">Hogan, Nastasi, &amp; Pressley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1046496412437208">Mercer, 1996</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1046496412437208">Johnson and Johnson (1996)</xref>, effective small group interaction can be described as group work in which all group members contribute to solving a problem and spend minimal time doing off-task activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046496412437208">Soller (2001)</xref> extends this definition by suggesting factors indicating effective interaction in collaborative learning: namely, participation, social grounding, active learning conversation skills, performance analysis, and group processing. Interaction is effective when it fulfills the characteristics of these factors. In other words, to be able to measure effectiveness, these objectives need to be achieved.</p>
<p>Effective small group interaction can also be discussed from the point of view of efficacious interaction. The concept of efficacious interaction originates from sociocognitive theory, which emphasizes that self-efficacy beliefs have a central role in human performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046496412437208">Bandura, 1986</xref>). According to this approach, self-efficacy influences several aspects of agentic behavior that are important for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1046496412437208">Bandura, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046496412437208">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046496412437208">Zimmerman, 2000</xref>). In this study, these beliefs are seen as creating a mental capacity for students to participate and engage in social interaction and in productive on-task working. We argue that efficacious interaction depends on engagement in collaboration in which group processes, such as working methods, tools, shared goals, and roles, are socially negotiated within the group’s learning situation. Therefore, we believe that efficacious interaction can be reached in authentic learning situations by exploring and analyzing students’ and groups’ task involvement and the quality of their activity.</p>

<title>Self-Regulated Learning and Efficacious Interaction</title>
<p>The field of educational research is actively seeking solutions to promote each learner’s active engagement in learning––in other words, each one’s efficacious learning. Self-regulated learning (SRL) research has provided valuable information regarding how efficacious learners develop learning skills and use them effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1046496412437208">Boekaerts, Pitrich, &amp; Zeidner, 2000</xref>). By integrating cognition and motivation, engaged learners are empowered to take a purposeful role in their own learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1046496412437208">Schunk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1046496412437208">Zimmerman, 2000</xref>). Cognitive studies have emphasized investigating individuals’ knowledge structures and cognitive strategies. These studies have indicated, for example, a number of cognitive strategies that enhance learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1046496412437208">Paris, Byrnes, &amp; Paris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1046496412437208">Weinstein, Husman, &amp; Dierking, 2000</xref>) and have shown how these skills can be learned and developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1046496412437208">Winne, 2001</xref>). From a motivational point of view, research has provided important information concerning how motivational constructs such as self-efficacy, attributions, intrinsic motivation, and goals trigger a learner’s cognitive skills and further influence achievement and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1046496412437208">Eccles, Wigfield, &amp; Schiefelt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1046496412437208">Graham &amp; Weiner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1046496412437208">Pintrich &amp; Schunk, 2002</xref>). In all, learning is a proactive process in which self-motivated efficacious learners act as agents of their own behavior and, by using effective learning strategies, achieve desired results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1046496412437208">Zimmerman, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Efficacious Interaction in Collaborative Learning</title>
<p>Previous studies of SRL have typically acknowledged the social and contextual nature of learning. Recent research has emphasized practices, processes, and conditions that lead to effective social interaction and the construction of knowledge in different learning situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046496412437208">Hmelo-Silver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046496412437208">Hmelo-Silver &amp; Barrows, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1046496412437208">Soller, 2001</xref>). Collaborative learning is generally seen as mutual engagement of participants in a joint effort to solve the problem together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046496412437208">Roschelle &amp; Teasley, 1995</xref>), where sharing authority among group members is very important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496412437208">Dillenbourg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046496412437208">Roschelle &amp; Teasley, 1995</xref>). In learning situations where the aim is to work in groups, collaborate, and create something together, individual motivation and learning skills are further challenged by the learner’s social skills. A key to successful collaboration in these learning situations is social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1046496412437208">Kreijns, Kirschner, &amp; Jochems, 2003</xref>). For example, studies of collaborative learning and peer interaction in different settings and contexts have identified specific interactions that seem to promote learning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1046496412437208">Barron, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496412437208">Dillenbourg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1046496412437208">Roschelle &amp; Teasley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1046496412437208">Stahl, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1046496412437208">Mercer (2000)</xref> described how learners participated in educational activities by characterizing the features, forms, and nature of group interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1046496412437208">Hiltz’s (1994)</xref> findings underlined the importance of social interaction stating that the process of developing shared understanding through interaction is the natural way for people to learn. These studies have shown that when students are interacting, they elaborate on their understandings and become aware of their thinking processes. Learning is seen not only as taking place in the learner’s mind but also as a process of meaning-making within social practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496412437208">Kumpulainen &amp; Wray, 2002</xref>). The practices of sharing and constructing perspectives in collaborative interactions seem to also promote reflection, planning, and metacognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1046496412437208">Arvaja, Häkkinen, Eteläpelto, &amp; Rausku-Puttonen, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, efficacious interaction is investigated within collaborative learning situations, where one of the key features is collaborative problem solving. In collaborative problem solving, students co-construct knowledge through productive interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1046496412437208">Hmelo-Silver, 2004</xref>). When students work in small collaborative groups, they learn what they need to know to solve a problem. There are a variety of techniques that might help establish productive collaboration and effective interaction. For example, scripted cooperation and the use of student roles have all been used to support effective collaborative learning and interaction in small groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1046496412437208">King, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1046496412437208">Weinberger, Ertl, Fischer, &amp; Mandl, 2005</xref>). These roles help ensure that all group members are cognitively engaged in joint problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1046496412437208">Hmelo-Silver, 2003</xref>). Collaborative learning situations create opportunities for efficacious interaction by engaging students to productively work on-task and by encouraging them to ask questions of each other, explain and justify their opinions, articulate their reasoning, and elaborate and reflect on their knowledge, and thereby motivating and improving learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496412437208">Dillenbourg, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>The Aim of This Study</title>
<p>Efficacious interaction has not been comprehensively studied in earlier studies. Despite extensive studies of effective small group interaction, there seems to be little, if any, evidence on the elements of students’ efficacious interactions in small-group learning contexts. The earlier research on efficacy has been dominated by the individual psychometric tradition where the measurements of efficacy have been targeted to the individual interpretations of students’ own efficacy, not as an interactive construct observed in student interactions. Therefore, the aims of the present study are to identify (a) what characterizes and (b) what triggers efficacious interaction in collaborative learning situations. The specific research questions are</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>This case study focuses in detail on two 3-student (<italic>N</italic> = 6) small group interactions while working on a science task. The participants were fourth-grade primary school students aged 9 to 10 who participated in a science project for 5 weeks. Students were familiar with each other and were used to working together during various school lessons. Teachers assessed members’ learning success, so that both groups contained high and low achievers, and determined how the groups would best collaborate. According to the teacher’s evaluations and ratings, all group members possessed the same level of prior knowledge and had equal learning skills. Group A consisted of two girls, Hanna and Anna, and one boy, Jake. Group B was composed of two boys, Simo and Aaron, and one girl, Sara.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1046496412437208">
<title>Context</title>
<p>The students studied a science topic from the learning kit called <italic>vital conditions of life</italic>, which was divided into seven different subtopics: water, air, nutrition, heat, light, family, and human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1046496412437208">Malmberg, Järvenoja, &amp; Järvelä, 2010</xref>). The task was to construct shared understanding of the vital conditions of life. The pedagogical task structure provided guidelines for the groups regarding how to get started. This was done by asking the groups to assign roles to each group member. Three roles were provided: leader, recorder, and information seeker. The leader was responsible for keeping the group focused on the assigned task and for making sure that all members of the group were participating and contributing to the group’s assignment. Jake and Aaron were chosen for these roles. The recorder was responsible for writing up notes of the material that was contributed by each group member and for preparing materials for the presentation, which took place at end of the project. Anna and Sara were chosen for these roles. The information seeker was responsible for preparing and organizing the information search, gathering materials or resources for the group, and monitoring the use of materials. Hanna and Simo were chosen for these roles.</p>
<p>The working process during the collaborative group work included four phases. First, students internalized the requirements of the task by discussing and planning their goals and strategies for achieving them. This phase also included negotiating each other’s roles. Next, they researched the topic. In the third phase, students brought together their knowledge of the topic and decided on which subtopic(s) to concentrate. In the last phase, students prepared a presentation of chosen subtopic(s) for the whole class. In all these phases, the students were simultaneously involved in the group’s task execution and shared tools and activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1046496412437208">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>This case study consisted of video observation data of the groups’ interactions in these collaborative learning situations. The groups were videotaped with three cameras. Two cameras were focused on the group’s primary working stations while the third camera captured students working elsewhere in the classroom. Both groups’ working processes were videotaped during 20 lessons, resulting in above 10 hr of video observation data.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<sec id="section10-1046496412437208">
<title>Qualitative Analysis</title>
<p>This case study was based on the assumption that efficacious interaction is reached when students are actively and collaboratively involved in social interaction. The micro-level analysis proceeded first by sequencing the whole set of transcribed video observation data into episodes of groups’ task involvement (Järvelä, Veermans, &amp; Leinonen, 2008). Functions identified in the students’ actions and utterances were coded into four task involvement categories: <italic>no one is working</italic> (OFF), <italic>one student is working</italic> (ON1), <italic>two students are working</italic> (ON2), and <italic>the whole group is working</italic> (ON3).</p>
<p>The second phase of the analysis concentrated on analyzing the quality of the groups’ on-task episodes. This analysis was grounded in the theoretical perspectives of social learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1046496412437208">Levine, Resnick, &amp; Higgins, 1993</xref>) and on recent developments of collaborative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496412437208">Dillenbourg, 1999</xref>). Through the theory-driven content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046496412437208">Chi, 1997</xref>), collaborative on-task categories (ON2, ON3) were divided into five categories of collaborative and cooperative interaction. Collaborative interaction refers to activity where group members worked together as a group. This includes three categories: (a) equal participation and productive on-task work, which appeared typically when a group’s goals and roles were clear for each member and when group members were equally engaged and collaborated to work with their assignment, (b) student helping and assisting another student, and (c) silent and intensive work, which occurred only if preceding episodes contained discussions or negotiations regarding the goals or roles of each group member and if students were aware of how their individual work would contribute to the success of the group’s assignment. Cooperative interaction refers to activity in which group members worked separately. It includes two categories: (a) unequal participation and unproductive on-task work, which occurred when students disagreed with either the goals or roles of their working and (b) working on-task individually, which typically occurred when students did not want to use the same tools or a shared working space or when, for some reason, they were not interested in collaborating with one another.</p>
<p>In the third phase, the qualitative content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1046496412437208">Chi, 1997</xref>) focused on identifying the triggers that affected student interaction during collaborative group work. In this study, triggers were factors or events regarding a group’s interaction that influenced its members’ task involvement and the quality of their interaction. Triggers were investigated in the transitions between episodes (Järvelä et al., 2008; Järvelä, Salonen, &amp; Lepola, 2001) by exploring the reasons why students’ task involvement levels changed—that is, why students decided to start or quit working on a task. These reasons were coded into three trigger categories made up of factors that either increased or reduced a student’s efficacious activity. (a) An individual progress trigger refers to an individual’s positive or negative comments or actions that affected one’s own activity. Examples of the factors included in this category include making comments in regard to knowing what to do, actions such as changing one’s working method or an individual’s physiological state. (b) Group progress trigger refers to positive or negative evaluations, comments, or actions made by others; these are implemented, for example, through social reinforcement. (c) Contextual trigger includes factors within the pedagogical structure, such as the presence of the teacher, help from people other than group members, cameras and microphones, or filling out a motivation scaffolding sheet.</p>

<title>Reliability of Qualitative Proceedings</title>
<p>The analysis of reliability covered all three phases of analysis. The primary coder instructed a second coder about the coding principles by providing coding schemes that included categories, definitions, and a list of what to identify. These principles were negotiated before the second coder started to classify the reliability of the coding. However, the intercoding process was blind.</p>
<p>The reliability analysis was applied to refine the coding scheme and improve the results of the analysis. In this study, the reliability of the coding scheme was analyzed by measuring internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha. The average correlation of each coding scheme item with other coding scheme items was determined; 0.7 is acceptable. The reliability of data analysis was analyzed using Cohen’s Kappa, which is commonly used to quantify intercoder reliability; 0.5 is considered to be acceptable. In the first phase, the reliability coding aimed to analyze task involvement episodes. Internal consistency of the coding scheme was 0.986; intercoder reliability was 0.922. The second phase of reliability analysis focused on the quality of interaction. Internal consistency of the coding scheme was 0.846; intercoder reliability was 0.742. In the third phase, the reliability analysis focused on triggers that initiated transitions between episodes. Internal consistency of the coding scheme was 0.846; intercoder reliability was 0.509.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1046496412437208">
<title>Statistical Measures</title>
<p>The qualitative analysis was complemented by statistical measures. Cross-tabulation was conducted to measure the relations between both task involvement and quality of interaction and triggers and changes in activity. One episode represented one unit of analysis. One unit of analysis included coding for task involvement and quality of interaction as well as coding for triggers and changes in activity. The effect sizes for χ<sup>2</sup> were calculated using Cramer’s V.</p>

<title>Groups’ Task Involvement</title>
<p>In the task involvement analysis, the groups’ interactions were coded as being in either off-task (OFF) or on-task (ON1, ON2, ON3) categories, resulting altogether in 241 task involvement episodes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1046496412437208">Figure 1</xref> illustrates one example of task involvement episodes. The example is from a video that lasted 20 min and contained eight episodes. Off-task activity referred to a situation in which students’ activities did not focus on the task—this included playing around, discussing free-time activities, or doing absentminded activities. Functions that were related to on-task activity referred to instances in which students worked on the task by planning and discussing the task or the topic and when they searched for information, worked with notes, made a mind map, or practiced their presentation.</p>

<p>On the ON1 level, one group member worked on a task while others were on the OFF level. On the ON2 level, two group members worked on a task––either individually with notes or together sharing the responsibility of the task. One group member was on the OFF level. On the ON3 level, the whole group focused on doing the task either individually or collaboratively.</p>
<p>The groups’ task involvement is described in more detail in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1046496412437208">Table 1</xref>. For both groups, the most typical task involvement level was ON1, describing 31% of the groups’ use of their time. Group A had a total of 134 episodes, during which this group was active in some of the on-task levels 76% of the time. The most frequent task involvement level was ON2, which described the group’s activity 29% of the time. Group B had 107 episodes, of which the group worked on task 77% of the time.

<p>The task involvement analysis showed that group members internalized the task’s requirements by discussing, planning, and negotiating their goals, strategies, and roles for working. It is notable that Hanna and Simo were the most active members in their groups and worked on the ON1 level more often than others. Although both of them were designated as information seekers, they also adopted other roles to ensure that the group work would be productive.</p>

<p>Data analysis shows that most of the time groups’ social interactions were collaborative in nature, the category of equal participation and productive on-task working being the most typical (41%). In group B, the collaborative interaction could appear as silent episodes when the group members worked intensively for 5 to 24 min without talking. Although the working in these episodes was done silently, during preceding episodes group members discussed and negotiated goals for each individual’s work and were aware of how their individual work would contribute to the group’s assignment. For example, the comic-drawing episodes were characterized as such. In cooperative interaction, the predominant category was working on a task individually (33%).</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate the characteristics of collaborative interaction. In Example 1, the group had difficulties beginning their work, and one group member sought help from the teacher. The teacher encouraged group members to start planning the comics together, thereby enabling the students to change the direction of their activity so that it became more productive. Example 2 illustrates how one student helped and assisted another student in the gStudy environment and enabled her to continue with the task.</p>

<p>The following examples present descriptions of the episodes that characterized cooperative interaction. In Example 3, the leader abused his role and caused unequal participation and unproductive on-task working between group members.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Example 3</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The group has chosen nutrition as their subtopic of “Vital conditions of life.” Aaron makes sure that Sara and Simo know what they are expected to do. Instead of participating in the work, he just sits back and watches the others do their share of the work. Sara is working intensively with nutrition notes in gStudy while Simo is looking for information in textbooks. However, Simo has lost his focus on the group’s task and is concentrating on information about water, which is not the group’s subtopic.</p>
<p>Example 4 presents an episode where students worked on-task individually in the group but are not aware of each other’s activities.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Example 4</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Group members are working individually. Aaron and Simo are looking for nutrition information. Aaron is reading a textbook while Simo is looking on the Internet. He is also working with the group’s notes in gStudy. Sara is writing the plot of the group’s comic in the group’s notebook. The group members are not communicating with each other about the information they have found or about the plot of the comic.</p>
<p>It can be seen that in these episodes the students did not communicate at all. Instead of engaging in collaborative learning and productive on-task working, they tended to concentrate on completing the task. In these episodes, the individual working processes seemed to be more important than working on a task collaboratively.</p>

When students were working on the ON3 level, the quality of their interaction was typically collaborative in nature. In other words, when the working level was ON2, the group members worked on the assignment individually, and when working on the ON3 level, they implemented equal collaboration between group members. The findings were similar in both groups.</p>

<p>Individual progress trigger refers to an individual’s positive or negative comments or actions that affected one’s activity by either increasing or decreasing it. For example, activity usually increased when a student had a clear vision of the task and knew how to proceed with it. On the other hand, when a student had difficulty concentrating, or when the task was no longer interesting, his or her activity was decreased. Group progress trigger refers to positive or negative evaluations, comments, and actions from others that influenced some of the group members’ task involvement. Typically, this included different forms of social reinforcement, such as verbal praise, or nonverbal communication, such as smiles, frowns, and gestures, that increased students’ activity. Contextual trigger refers to factors derived from the pedagogical structure, such as the presence of the teacher or help from people other than group members that increased the student’s activity. Factors from the surrounding context, such as cameras and microphones, or factors from the pedagogical task structure, such as filling in a motivation scaffolding sheet, were most often the cause of a decrease in student activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1046496412437208">Figure 2</xref> illustrates how triggers occurred in video observation data.

<title>Triggers of On-Task Activity</title>
<p>Interaction was increased in 164 transitions. Group progress trigger most frequently influenced the groups’ on-task activity (54%). Generally, at times when group progress triggers increased the group’s activity, the triggers were found to contain elements such as encouragement, getting help or support, and positive impact on modeling others. At such times, students discussed the task or the topic, or worked with notes or their presentation. In Example 5, the group progress trigger is illustrated. The group members are discussing the task requirements and planning the working processes. Individual progress trigger influenced the groups’ on-task activity 40% of the time. The students progressed when they had a clear vision of the task and when they self-regulated their course of action. Usually, individual progress triggers prompted students to work individually with notes or search information. In Example 6 below, Hanna tried to start working and asked for help from peers and adults several times. For some reason, she was not able to start working and became bored. She decided to start writing notes from the textbook into the group’s notebook. Contextual triggers increased the groups’ activity 5% of the time. This is illustrated in Example 7, in which the teacher’s help allowed the group to overcome the setback of not knowing how to proceed.</p>

<p>The trigger that most often increased activity was the group progress trigger, which only rarely decreased activity. The contextual trigger had the reverse affect: it usually triggered a decrease and only a few times increased activity. The effect of the individual progress trigger equally increased and decreased activity. Findings were similar in both groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study focused on investigating small group interaction by identifying the characteristics and triggers of efficacious interaction in collaborative learning situations. The main findings propose that efficacious interaction is defined by active participation and productive on-task working and is enhanced and maintained through collaboration between group members. Three types of triggers were found affecting change in students’ activity, and the group progress trigger was related to an increase in students’ collaborative interaction during 54% of the increased-activity transitions. These findings are new and complement the traditional research on classroom engagement.</p>
<p>Previous SRL and social interaction research has indicated that the relationship between learning and interaction is extremely complex. These processes are constructed by the participants and shaped by their intentions and interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496412437208">Kumpulainen &amp; Wray, 2002</xref>). Recent research has shown how collaborative learning gives students more opportunities to participate in, observe, reflect on, and practice socially shared ways of knowing and thinking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496412437208">Dillenbourg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1046496412437208">Hmelo-Silver &amp; Barrows, 2008</xref>). As a result, the role of practices that support collaborative learning and social interaction have increased in today’s classrooms. It is important to better understand the processes and conditions that take place during interactions between students in the context of small group learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046496412437208">Greeno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1046496412437208">Tuyay et al., 1995</xref>). Yet it seems that merely providing opportunities to participate in social interaction does not necessarily lead to meaningful and effective learning experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1046496412437208">Kumpulainen &amp; Wray, 2002</xref>). We argue that when studying students’ social interactions in collaborative learning situations, we need to consider new concepts and new ways to analyze it to measure effectiveness. In this study, active participation and productive on-task working was used to describe efficacious interaction. It was analyzed through task involvement and quality of interaction and by identifying triggers causing the changes in students’ activity. We believe that by doing this we will be able to see more in social interaction and in overall learning process.</p>
<p>In this study, efficacious interaction was supported by reciprocal attempts to create joint meaning while working collaboratively on task. This is in accordance with many studies that have stressed the reciprocal understanding in collaborative interaction. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1046496412437208">Häkkinen and Järvelä (2006)</xref> found that reciprocal understanding and sharing was critical for higher level collaborative web-based discussions in a higher education context. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1046496412437208">Byman, Järvelä, and Häkkinen (2005)</xref> showed that reciprocity was an essential component not only of social interaction but also of successful virtual interaction. In individualistic interaction, instead of engaging in joint reasoning and meaning-making, the students tended to concentrate on completing the task. In these episodes, an individual’s working processes seemed to be more important than working on a task collaboratively. This reflects the need for individual, self-regulated learning skills as well as for shared, group-level regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1046496412437208">Hadwin, Järvelä, &amp; Miller, 2011</xref>). The results support the idea that the social context created by a collaborative task structure engages students in a social interaction. However, the dynamics of small group interaction seem to pose both opportunities and challenges for students engaged in productive and effective learning. These findings indicate the importance of students’ social and cognitive skills in addition to their level of motivation in maintaining productive and task-focused interaction.</p>
<p>The earlier research on efficacy has been dominated by the individual psychometric tradition where the main method used has been self-report questionnaires (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046496412437208">Bandura, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1046496412437208">2006</xref>). Thus the measurements of efficacy have been targeted to the individual interpretations of students’ own efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1046496412437208">Bandura, 1997</xref>), not as an interactive construct observed in student interactions. We have not found other empirical studies using video data analysis on efficacious interaction. The methodological challenge was whether the episodes of efficacious interaction could be identified from video observation data. Therefore, the micro-level analysis concentrated first on the elements of group interactions in terms of task involvement. The analysis of task involvement was carried out by identifying the episodes of task involvement (Järvelä et al., 2008) and exploring the quality of group interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1046496412437208">Dillenbourg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1046496412437208">Levine et al., 1993</xref>)—in other words, considering to what degree the work was shared during these episodes. The main findings of this case study indicate that simply working on the task did not guarantee that the group’s work was collaborative in nature. To reach the level of efficacious interaction, students needed to be actively involved in the task, and the quality of their work needed to be collaborative in nature. Collaborative interaction contains many of the same elements that have been found to be effective in learning, such as shared ways of knowing and thinking as well as participation in joint meaning-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1046496412437208">Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1046496412437208">Greeno, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Analyzing the total amount of time spent on task involvement levels did not reveal enough about the nature of social interactions. To gain a deeper understanding of the connection between task involvement and efficacious interaction, the trigger analysis concentrated on investigating the transitions between task involvement episodes (Järvelä et al., 2008) by exploring the reasons why students stopped working or decided to start working again. Three trigger categories were found. All three types of triggers were found to increase the groups’ efficacious interaction, although the role of the contextual trigger was minimal. The <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1046496412437208">appendix</xref> summarizes the manner in which the qualitative analysis was carried out by providing a coherent picture of how the video observation data was analyzed. The intention was to show how the triggers functioned in the interaction and how the quality of the interaction was analyzed.</p>
<p>Reliability and validity issues of all kinds apply to video-based data just as they apply for any other kind of quantitative or qualitative data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1046496412437208">Derry et al., 2010</xref>). The reliability of qualitative analysis was performed to all three phases of analysis and to whole sets of video data. An independent coder coded 100% of the videos. Cronbach’s alpha and Cohen’s kappa were used to establish internal consistency and intercoder reliability for a second coder. The qualitative analysis was complemented by statistical measures. Crosstabulation was conducted to measure the relations between, on one hand, task involvement and quality of interaction and, on the other, triggers and changes in activity. Also, the effect sizes for χ<sup>2</sup> were calculated using Cramer’s V. Our study contributes to the existing body of research concerning how to use both theory-driven content analysis and pure content analysis to analyze social interactions recorded through video observations.</p>
<p>There are some limitations in this case study that are derived mainly from the research design. Because of the small sample size, the results of this study cannot be generalized. Therefore, this case study has focused on describing the elements of efficacious interaction through micro-level analysis. Because of the limited data regarding students’ experiences of social interaction, it was not possible to analyze students’ prior relationships. After all, given children of this age group, the group members’ prior relationships could be one possible component influencing the nature of the group interactions.</p>
<p>In the future, the aim is to identify the characteristics of efficacious students in different kinds of collaborative learning situations and to observe students in an authentic classroom environment. The objective for future research is to shed light on different factors that influence and are related to the overall progress of efficacious interaction in collaborative learning. Examining both efficacious interaction and efficacious students requires a research approach that combines situated measures of how individuals experience learning activities in collaborative learning situations with conventional measures of individuals’ cognitive skills and affective beliefs. Although the video observation method will have a strong role in future data collections, other data sources, such as self-reports or stimulated recall data, need to be used to gain further insight into the processes of efficacious interaction in collaborative learning situations.</p>
