<abstract>
<p>This paper reports on a survey carried out on academics in five Malaysian research-intensive universities, investigating their readiness to self archive in Open Access institutional repositories. The study revolves around the following issues: (a) academics’ awareness of self archiving in an institutional repository within their institution; (b) their perceptions about self archiving scientific information into institutional repositories; (c) their perceptions regarding obligations to self archive in institutional repositories; and (d) the possible reasons that inhibit them in contributing to institutional repositories. The answers were identified from 72 academics through a web-based survey. The study reveals that the majority of academics in this study have no or little knowledge of, or experience with, institutional repositories and are unfamiliar with self-archiving opportunities. However most of them endorse the principle of Open Access and are willing to contribute content to an institutional repository if an opportunity arises or if mandated by their funding institutions. Those who agree to self archiving see it to be beneficial in the author’s life as it enhances visibility and recognition of the author’s work, but the main problem encountered is the fact that researchers feel it is time consuming. The major barrier to self archiving is fear of plagiarism. In light of these results, there is a need to create more awareness and to educate authors on the importance of self archiving. Ensuring free electronic access to public-funded research lies with the funding institutions, especially universities, which should set up appropriate repository infrastructures, advocate the public good and ethical implications of open access and even mandate self-archiving of research they fund.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The information landscape has witnessed tremendous changes in the past decades devoted to the process of web-based scholarly communication, especially in how and why scholars disseminate, search and cite information through formal and informal channels. Academics and their research-based institutions are often regarded as producers of primary research. It is imperative for these institutions to develop and acquire better means of collecting, preserving and disseminating the scholarly output that they produce. Open Access as a new channel for scientific knowledge dissemination begins to be embraced by these institutions to enhance research impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912450450">Foster and Gibbons 2005</xref>), as a way to reduce costs and increase access to a wide range of scholarly information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912450450">Crow 2002</xref>), and to disseminate and enhance awareness among researchers of the availability of research-based literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266666912450450">Zainab 2010</xref>). Many universities around the world have steadily adopted Open Access institutional repositories in order to provide open access to their intellectual output. As such, faculty members within the academic institutions, who are considered the primary producers of research literature, are faced with the task of taking up self-archiving in institutional repositories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912450450">Chan (2004</xref>) reiterates that as research becomes more data intensive, a scholar’s ability to store, access and share primary data will be crucial to the advancement of scholarship. The advocacy and promotion of Open Access and self archiving is imperative and self-archiving remains an essential component for institutional repository success.</p>
<p>The Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) describes Open Access as: “…free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912450450">Budapest Open Access Initiative 2001</xref>). The free availability of resources is facilitated by self-archiving practices of scholars to deposit copies of their research papers, through the submission of full-text and metadata, in digital repositories or open archives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912450450">Miller (2006</xref>) defines self-archiving as “the publishing by an author of his or her own work, on a personal or institutional website or in a repository, in addition to its publication in a journal”. Open Access Initiatives (OAI) strategies robustly promote self-archiving, and the issues surrounding academic researchers’ contribution to and adoption of institutional repositories remain a significant part of the literature. </p>
<p>Open Access institutional repositories are still a new and growing phenomenon in a developing country such as Malaysia and Malaysian scholars are still coming to terms with the concept of self archiving scholarly output. By 2007, most of the universities in Malaysia were still in the process of establishing and developing institutional repository services in a bid to enhance the visibility and the impact of the research generated within those universities. However, studies found that faculty in a research intensive university had little awareness of OAI and institutional repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912450450">Abrizah 2010</xref>) and self-archiving practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912450450">Kiran and Chia 2009</xref>), or if they were aware of their existence, they remained detached from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912450450">Abrizah 2009</xref>). Consequently, there is a discrepancy in academics’ attitudes towards open access institutional repositories and self-archiving practices. </p>
<p>This study is concerned about the extent to which Malaysian scholars in research intensive universities are aware of institutional repositories and self-archiving practices, as well as the conditions that inhibit them to self-archive. Self archiving in this study is seen from the viewpoint of authors and their willingness to self archive articles, pre-prints and post-prints, in institutional repositories. The five research universities in Malaysia provide an exceptional venue for the study since they engender prolific academics and significant research output. Investigating scholars’ adoption of self-archiving is important because user adoption is critical in determining the feasibility and successful implementation of new technology-based communication channels such as OAI. The OAI movement is unlikely to be successful unless there are enough scholars who provide content to institutional repositories. This makes it pertinent to address Open Access awareness and to clarify authors’ attitudes on those issues that are impeding their uptake and use of institutional repositories. </p>

<title>Review of literature</title>
<p>Awareness remains indispensable with regards to self-archiving. It is only when researchers are aware of what Open Access and institutional repository is, and its impact and existence within their institutions, that they will be willing to contribute materials. The adoption problem in Open Access and self-archiving has been discussed in the literature, that depicts that authors lack awareness of the existence of institutional repositories and remained hesitant towards adopting self archiving. Studies have found that many academic authors are not familiar with the concept of institutional repositories and are hesitant to make self-archiving a priority, while some who had heard of it remained largely ignorant of its implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266666912450450">Swan and Brown 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912450450">2005</xref>). A survey by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266666912450450">Rowlands and Nicholas (2006</xref>) in America demonstrated a generally low level of institutional repositories awareness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666912450450">Van Westrienen and Lynch’s (2005)</xref> European survey also reported low faculty participation in self-archiving. Researchers mainly preferred to submit manuscripts to faculty pages or research group websites. After examining faculty awareness of institutional repositories, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912450450">Kim (2011</xref>) found that though awareness had increased amongst certain institutions, it was still very low. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912450450">Davis and Connolly (2007)</xref> reported that Cornell's institutional repository is largely under-populated and underused by its faculty because the faculty have little knowledge and little motivation to use the repository. </p>
<p>The literature has also reported the adoption of self-archiving habits by academics as a complex and slow process “due to inertia on the part of faculty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912450450">Ferreira et al. 2008</xref>), and records the following obstacles: fears that self-archiving would mean more work for faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912450450">Davis and Connolly 2007</xref>), doubts and difficulties related to copyright issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912450450">Gadd, Oppenheim and Probets 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912450450">Kim 2011</xref>), authors’ lack of knowledge regarding the advantages of Open Access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912450450">Creaser et al. 2010</xref>), and faculty perception of the insignificant value of an institutional repository to their scholarly endeavour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666912450450">Jantz and Wilson 2008</xref>). A further major impediment to self archiving is seen from the viewpoint of time consumption; some researchers consider the entering of extra bibliographic data to be rather arduous and complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912450450">Hey 2004</xref>). Cornell researchers surveyed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912450450">Davis and Connolly (2007)</xref> described the learning curve associated with the institutional repository as a deterrent. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912450450">Salo (2008</xref>) noted that there are other issues involved in the amount of time and difficulty it takes to self-archive publications, including investigating publisher permissions, digitizing paper documents, and ensuring privacy for certain kinds of research data.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912450450">Chan (2004</xref>) reiterates that as research becomes more data-intensive, a scholar’s ability to store, access and share primary data remain crucial towards advancing scholarship. More recent studies found that the attitude of researchers towards self-archiving is positive; out of 40 participating researchers in one study, 37 could imagine self-archiving again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266666912450450">Linde et al. 2009</xref>). This is because it brings about increased dissemination and more citations. Swan, in his article on ‘Open Access for Indian Scholarship’, quotes one author who acknowledged the importance of self-archiving and how it had not only given instant worldwide visibility to his work, but led to his papers being accepted into international conferences/journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266666912450450">Swan 2008</xref>). Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912450450">Bernius, Hanauske and König (2009</xref>) conclude that the Green Road to Open Access, especially self-archiving in subject-based repositories like arXiv.org or RePEc is a very valuable solution for scientific communities. Though some authors have been hesitant, some of these barriers have begun to be overcome and self archiving remains an integral part of promoting institutional repositories. </p>
<p>After conducting a study aimed at evaluating the success of open access self-archiving in nine well-established institutional repositories worldwide that run E-prints as their repository software, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266666912450450">Xia and Sun (2007</xref>) found that most depositing was done by the librarian or administrative staff and not by the authors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666912450450">Chan, Kwok and Yip (2005</xref>) concluded that the real challenge faced by institutional repositories is not technical implementation, but the cultural change necessary for them to become embedded in the activities and normal behavioural pattern of researchers. As researchers’ contributions to institutional repositories remain an important factor for their success, mandates have been introduced to make it obligatory for researchers in certain institutions to self archive. Studies have proved that the best way to ensure that authors comply with self archiving is through mandating them to do so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912450450">Swan and Brown (2005</xref>) found that almost 95 percent of the survey participants would comply with a mandate from their employer to deposit copies of their articles in an institutional or subject-based repository. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912450450">Pinfield (2005</xref>) noted the effectiveness of mandate policies. This is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912450450">Sale (2006</xref>) who noted that there is a significant difference in deposit rates between universities with mandates and those without. Sale concluded that any institution that does not have an institutional mandate in its kitbag is wasting money establishing a repository. This goes to support Harnad’s assertion that the only way to achieve significant progress toward self-archiving is through mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666912450450">Harnad and McGovern 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912450450">Guterman (2008</xref>) noted that institutional policies mandating self-archiving in institutional repositories have started to get momentum in the United States since Harvard University’s faculty approved such a policy. </p>

<title>Objectives and method</title>
<p>This study aimed at contributing to the literature on the adoption of Open Access repositories by exploring academic researchers’ perceptions regarding their obligations to self archive in Open Access repositories. It is a part of a larger study that evaluates academics in Malaysian universities’ readiness to self-archive in Open Access repositories, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, which postulates the four constructs of UTAUT (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions) and the academics’ behavioural intention to self-archive in institutional repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266666912450450">Singeh, Abrizah and Karim 2013</xref>). The main objective of the present study was to determine the perceptions of Malaysian authors regarding their obligations to self archiving in Open Access repositories within the research intensive universities. It sought to address the following research questions or hypotheses:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>What is the level of awareness among Malaysian authors regarding institutional repositories and self archiving?</p>

</list></p>
<p>The study was carried out by means of a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was first tested with a small pilot group of six academics in the field of library and information science (LIS). The researchers incorporated their suggestions and feedback into the questionnaire. The survey was conducted through web-based questionnaires administered to a random sample of 350 faculty members at five research intensive universities in Malaysia from a population of 5000 academics, sampled by using the Krejcie and Morgan method with confidence value of 95 percent. These research universities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666912450450">Table 1</xref>) were chosen because they have institutional repositories in place and the faculty represented a population who would be expected to know more than the average about self-archiving. An email invitation was sent to all academics in the sample. The email, with a brief introduction for the survey which hoped to encourage cooperation from participants, contained a hypertext link to the survey database hosted by SurveysPro (http://esurveyspro.com). After three rounds of distribution, 76 messages were returned as undelivered. Responses were received from 108 researchers, of which 36 that were either incomplete or contained skipped answers were dropped from the analysis. Consequently, the researchers analyzed 72 responses – an active response rate of 20.6 percent, which is fairly typical of online surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912450450">Gravetter and Forzano 2008</xref>). A total of 47 (65.3 percent) of these respondents reported having had self-archiving experience’, whereas 25 (34.7 percent) reported having had none. </p>

<p>Descriptive statistics using frequency distributions, percentages and mean were performed to analyse the data. Due to the relatively small number of responses, some subject areas or academic disciplines are represented by fewer than 10 respondents, so it is risky to generalize too much from these data. However, these results can still give an indication of trends and attitudes that can be further explored in future, more extensive studies. </p>

<sec id="section4-0266666912450450">
<title>Results and findings</title>
<p>The results highlighted the responses from 72 academics at the five research universities in Malaysia, on their attitude towards open access and institutional repositories, advocacy undertaken, and why the reluctance in contributing to institutional repositories. </p>
<p>Respondents were first asked whether they had ever used or accessed their university’s institutional repository. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266666912450450">Table 2</xref>, all of them reported having used the repository; however, only 65.3 percent (47) of them had self archiving experience. The number of respondents who had never practiced self archiving was 25 (34.7 percent). It should be noted that those who answered ‘Yes’ to self archiving were allowed to answer all questions whereas those who said ‘No’ were directed to another part of the questionnaire which required them to identify barriers to self archiving. </p>

<p>Respondents were asked how frequently they used their university’s repository to deposit materials, search for materials and refer students and other researchers. The results from 45 complete responses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266666912450450">Table 4</xref>) show that, in general, respondents had not made institutional repository usage and self-archiving a regular habit. In all three cases, most of the respondents reported using the repository only rarely or occasionally. Twenty percent (9) of the respondents reported depositing materials and referring others to the repository constantly, while more than one third (35.5 percent) claimed to locate, search and retrieve materials from the depository on a constant basis.</p>

<p>Respondents were asked who should be responsible for handling tasks in the institutional repository: should it be the duty of the authors or the system administrators? As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266666912450450">Table 5</xref>, most respondents felt that most of the tasks should be left in the hands of the authors. Only in respect of converting files to the latest version and converting source material to appropriate formats did most respondents think the tasks should be left to the system administrators. </p>

<title>Barriers to self archiving in institutional repositories</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0266666912450450">Table 8</xref> shows that respondents who claimed to practice self-archiving considered the major barriers to self archiving to be: concern on plagiarism, concern that others might alter their work without their permission, concern about the possibility of changing or deleting their work, concern about the newness and small scale of the repository, and concern over copyright. The least important obstacles were fear of depositing their works with works from other disciplines, low prestige of the repository and fear of subjecting their work to quality control. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0266666912450450">Table 8</xref> presents the findings of the barriers based on ranking of mean scores.

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This study has provided an insight into Malaysian academic authors’ perceptions towards self archiving adoption. The results depict that a majority of the authors are unaware of or unfamiliar with self archiving and the existence of institutional repositories, while not all respondents had made usage in terms of access and depositing of materials a frequent practice. The benefits of visibility and recognition for the author and his/her works are considered suitable reasons to self archive. However, plagiarism and concern that others may alter their work without permission, are the first concerns of both those who do and those who do not self-archive. Respondents are of the view that instituting mandates by the universities will encourage self archiving. They feel that authors handle most of the self archiving responsibility. The only tasks they thought administrators should handle were the conversion of files to the latest versions and converting source materials to appropriate formats. Almost all the respondents considered that authors should make decisions to delete work (93.3 percent, 42) and to provide abstracts (91.1 percent, 41). This is consistent with the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912450450">Abrizah (2009</xref>), in which respondents also agreed that it was their responsibility to provide an abstract of their work and to delete their work. </p>
<p>The findings on what inhibits Malaysian authors to self-archive are consistent with those of previous studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912450450">Allen (2005</xref>) found that those who are not willing to deposit materials into institutional repositories are concerned about plagiarism. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912450450">Pickton and McKnight (2006</xref>), ownership of copyright and plagiarism were among the greatest deterrents to Open Access for students. According to the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912450450">Abrizah (2009</xref>) concerns about copyrights and plagiarism might impede self archiving. However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912450450">Pickton and McKnight (2006</xref>), the risks of copying, altering and plagiarizing are not only problems faced by institutional repositories but also problems for other digital sources. This is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266666912450450">Watson (2007</xref>), who noted that concerns about self archiving were associated with risks that exist with sharing work in any format, not just in an institutional repository. For instance, the risk of plagiarism, or that others might use the work for unauthorized commercial gain. </p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912450450">Sale (2006</xref>) researchers tend to be ignorant about copyright issues and their confusion over what is acceptable according to their publisher agreements leads to the tendency to be over-cautious. Copyright concerns about Open Access are mainly directed to Open Access repositories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912450450">Foster and Gibbons (2005</xref>) found that the respondents wanted to be sure that they were not violating copyright issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266666912450450">McCulloh’s (2006)</xref> study also looks at copyright restrictions as a potential barrier to Open Access. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912450450">Davis and Connolly (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912450450">Kim (2011</xref>) noted copyright concerns and additional time as some of the barriers to adopting self archiving. One of the reasons reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912450450">Swan and Brown (2005</xref>) for authors’ reluctance to self-archive their work was the amount of time required. Time was also another factor involved in depositing work to QUEprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266666912450450">Watson 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper’s findings indicate that the obstacles highlighted by the respondents are mainly related to authors, which corroborates with other studies. A useful lesson from this survey is that if authors are not willing to self-archive because of these barriers, Open Access initiatives by their respective institutions would not succeed. The results reveal, however, that there is still a great need for promotion in order to create more awareness. If Malaysian universities want institutional repositories to be successful, then authors need to be educated on the importance of self archiving articles into institutional repositories. This will definitely boost self archiving adoption. </p>
<p>This present study will shed light on the state of awareness and readiness to self archive in institutional repositories. Knowing what factors predict readiness to self archive would allow institutional repositories administrators to ensure greater and more effective participation in self archiving among Malaysian authors. Knowledge of what makes authors more predisposed to self archiving would pave the way for greater participation and involvement. This would eventually make institutional repositories and self archiving a success within research universities in Malaysia. Additionally, knowing whether Malaysian authors would consider it obligatory to self archive would help administrators to formulate policies regarding institutional repository self archiving. Finally, identifying the major obstacles to self archiving would enable institutional repository administrators to effectively resolve them by addressing each and every one of these obstacles.</p>
