<abstract>
<p>In 2007, model Katy French was arguably the most talked about and photographed woman in Ireland. Rising to prominence via tabloid scandal and reality TV, French experienced a sharply pitched fame trajectory that culminated in her death that same year, which was attributed to a drug overdose and created a national media and political furor over cocaine use. Building on the work of scholars working within British or American contexts, I scrutinize French as a tabloid and reality star in Ireland. Both lauded and castigated as an icon of the so-called “Celtic Tiger,” French, I argue, acted as nexus point for hot-button social issues related to sexuality, femininity, consumerism, multiculturalism, and national values. My examination highlights the workings of postfeminism in a neoliberal Ireland and reveals the persistence of conservative patriarchal ideologies distinctly at odds with the national self-image during a boom period of unprecedented economic growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In January 2007, the model Katy French came to public notice in Ireland via a tabloid scandal splashed across the front pages of a popular Sunday newspaper. Over the course of 2007, French became “Ireland’s best-known model” (O’Toole 2007). Her celebrity reached its apex in October on reality television screened by Ireland’s national broadcaster and culminated in her death, attributed to a drug overdose,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476412457080">1</xref></sup> in December the same year. Born in Switzerland to British and Australian parents and educated at private school, French was regarded as emblematic of a generation of middle-class young people who had come of age during the 1992-2007 “Celtic Tiger,” a period of unprecedented economic growth and an era in which media discourse frequently styled Ireland as a progressive country that had shrugged off the repressive Catholic ideology of the past. In this article, I argue that French acted as a nexus point for a number of pressing social issues in Ireland—sexuality, femininity, and national values, such as consumerism, multiculturalism, immigration, and whiteness. Although the Celtic Tiger was widely seen, both positively and negatively, as a time during which the Catholic Church’s authority had been undermined and moral strictures had loosened, the narrative of rapid national and social progress was dependent on the suppression of evidence to the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">Meaney 2010</xref>, xiv–xv). My examination of her celebrity here reveals the workings of postfeminism in a neoliberal Ireland and the persistence of conservative patriarchal ideologies distinctly at odds with national self-image during the Celtic Tiger years.</p>
<p>French’s celebrity highlights Ireland’s predisposition to lodge national hopes and disappointments in the figure of a symbolic female. Related to this is the long tradition of symbolically representing the country and the Irish as feminine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412457080">Haslam 1999</xref>, 2). As Gerardine Meaney notes, there is a slippage between how Ireland-as-a-woman has been traditionally represented and how Irish women were and are perceived—In visual culture, particularly in film, representations of Irish women have stood for representations of Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">2010</xref>, 22–23). Two figures in particular run parallel—Ireland as a sweet but untamed girl and Ireland as a suffering and/or nurturing mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">Meaney 2010</xref>, 27). In the Victorian press, Ireland was popularly depicted as Hibernia, a delicate young girl on the verge of catastrophe, who needed the protection of the wiser, older, and stronger Britannia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412457080">Haslam 1999</xref>, 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">Meaney 2010</xref>, 23). From the early twentieth century, the image of Hibernia was displaced and updated by the trope of the “wild Irish girl”—a young woman characterized by “rebelliousness, seductiveness, tragic potential, moral ambiguity and red or very dark hair” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">Meaney 2010</xref>, 24). This representation of the Irish woman/Ireland-as-woman is most famously depicted (and in part parodied) by Maureen O’Hara as Mary Kate Danaher in John Ford’s 1952 film <italic>The Quiet Man</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">Meaney 2010</xref>, 25). In her cinematic depiction, the wild Irish girl refreshes the sexual, political, and/or social order through love and romance, but is also tamed by marriage.</p>
<p>While French might be read as contemporary take on this trope, she conspicuously failed to be “tamed”—Rather, she appeared to revel in her “wildness” and was duly punished for it. Although the switch to a neoliberal economy brought about changes in Irish conceptions of the family, sex, and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412457080">Kennedy 2003</xref>, 95), and Celtic Tiger Ireland was seen as discarding Catholicism, there remains a “deep ideological conflict about sex and sexuality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412457080">Inglis 2005</xref>, 33). An examination of French’s star image reveals an Ireland grappling to integrate postfeminist discourses of “empowered,” sexually performative essentialized femininity into a culture where traditional and patriarchal tropes of ideal femininity as well as Catholic sexual morality still hold significant sway.</p>

<title>Stars versus “Tabloid Trash”: A Question of Authenticity</title>
<p>In January 2007, French achieved notoriety when an acrimonious argument with her then-fiancé, restaurateur Marcus Sweeney, took place in front of photographers from the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic> newspaper. The public nature of the spat, and the accompanying photographs of French modeling lingerie, became a media sensation. From this point on, French became the focus of intense scrutiny in both old and new media platforms. Throughout her subsequent career, French’s celebrity was created by a series of newspaper interviews and appearances, and reached its apex when she appeared on <italic>Celebrities Go Wild</italic>, a reality television competition screened by Ireland’s national broadcaster, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) in October 2007, less than two months before her death.</p>
<p>French’s fame is best understood through Chris Rojek’s idea of attributed celebrity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412457080">Rojek (2001)</xref> distinguishes between three types of celebrity—ascribed, achieved, or attributed. While these categories may overlap, ascribed fame comes about through familial lineage, achieved celebrity is based on an individual’s perceived accomplishments, and attributed celebrity “is largely the result of the concentrated representation of an individual as noteworthy or exceptional by cultural intermediaries” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412457080">Rojek, 2001</xref>, 17–18). Fame is also, of course, hierarchical in that certain types of celebrity are seen as more valid than others across a spectrum that has arguably widened in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412457080">Collins 2008</xref>, 87–110; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457080">Turner 2004</xref>, 52–67). Those whose fame is constructed primarily through the tabloid, reality, or lifestyle media are seen as lacking accomplishment and occupy a subordinate position.</p>
<p>As Graeme Turner notes, in popular culture, a number of contradictory discourses inform the construction of celebrity. These opposing ideas play into how a celebrity is understood or written about:
<disp-quote>
<p>Audiences place individual celebrities somewhere along a continuum that ranges from seeing them as objects of desire or emulation or regarding them as spectacular freaks worthy of derision. Mostly celebrities attract one form of response rather than the other . . . but it is possible to attract both from different constituencies—or even from the same constituency. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457080">Turner 2004</xref>, 55)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Turner describes celebrity as the human equivalent of Daniel Boorstin’s “pseudo event”—“fabricated for the media and evaluated in terms of the scale and effectiveness of their media visibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457080">2004</xref>, 5). French’s critics regarded her fame and the incident that brought her to public notice as pseudo events—She was “a celebrity . . . famous for doing nothing whatsoever” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457080">Twenty Major 2007</xref>). French generated and garnered much media interest throughout 2007, but the antecedents of her fame marked her as a subordinate celebrity less than deserving of public notice.</p>
<p>French’s celebrity was not only questioned in terms of whether or not it was merited, but from early on questions were asked about the authenticity of the “breaking scandal” that brought her to public attention. In April 2007, during one of her first television appearances, French was asked if the spat with Sweeney had been a “stunt,” which she denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1527476412457080">O’Hara and Morrison 2007</xref>). The idea of authenticity is a key feature in how celebrity is read—As Richard Dyer has argued, the media construction of a star encourages us to believe we have access to the reality of the person behind the image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412457080">1986</xref>, 2). Interviews and biographies “are devoted to the notion of showing us the star as he or she really is. . . . ‘beyond the image’ . . . there is a rhetoric of sincerity or authenticity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412457080">Dyer 1986</xref>, 11).</p>
<p>While the rhetoric of sincerity is necessary, it is complicated by consumers’ skepticism. Mark Andrejevic argues,
<disp-quote>
<p>Contemporary image culture teaches both the inevitability of contrivance, and paradoxically, the need to penetrate it . . . to avoid the risk of being seen to be a dupe who is taken in by the lure of the image. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476412457080">2009</xref>, 322)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Reality television further complicates the ideas of authenticity. Despite its claim to represent the “real,” reality programming contains scripted elements such as simulated settings, competitive rituals, or costuming, which change “participants’ performances into something considerably more . . . than everyday behaviour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1527476412457080">Ytreberg 2006</xref>, 432). Participants in reality television “may be told not to ‘act’. . . but they nonetheless perform in a highly scripted field” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476412457080">Lacey and McElroy 2010</xref>, 259). The demand for an unscripted feel in a scripted environment means participates are required to be “more than themselves” yet are open “to condemnation for being inauthentic” (McElroy 2009, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476412457080">Lacey and McElroy 2010</xref>, 259). Audiences may not expect reality programming to be wholly unscripted or unstudied—Audience reception studies indicate that, for certain viewers, the pleasure of reality television is largely the uncovering of “the ‘authentic’ moments within the tension between the constructed and the real” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412457080">Collins 2008</xref>, 104). However, authenticity, or at least the performance of it, is crucial for reality and subordinate celebrities to maintain media interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527476412457080">2</xref></sup> To be seen as authentic, minor celebrities must “stay within their designated personalities”—By doing so, “they can be assured attention and even respect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457080">Palmer 2005</xref>, 49). If, however, the celebrity is seen as inauthentic, too striving for fame or deviating from his or her given role, a media backlash follows.</p>
<p>After the gossip surrounding the end of her relationship with Sweeney, French’s continued media presence was predicated on her, to use Boorstin’s term, “well-knownness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457080">Turner 2004</xref>, 79) to the media. Although French was not widely known at the time, on January 21, 2007, Egan reported the split with Sweeney calling French “one of Ireland’s top models” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412457080">2007d</xref>) and claimed that she had “refused to comment on the incident.” One week later, Egan followed up his initial report with three pieces about French, this time referring to her as an “Irish supermodel” in all three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412457080">2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412457080">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412457080">2007c</xref>). Egan’s reports included a number of abusive text messages allegedly sent by Sweeney to French. However, he maintained that the model was “maintaining a diplomatic silence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412457080">2007c</xref>) about the texts but was forced to go public about the break-up at Sweeney’s insistence. Whether or not this was done with her collusion, Egan created a public character for French, casting her as an unwilling participant in the media storm erupting around her. French’s fame can be seen as attributed, both in Rojek’s and the conventional sense of the word—Egan intimated that French had garnered a large degree of achieved celebrity before January 2007, which paradoxically acknowledged her as newsworthy while establishing her as such.</p>
<p>French may have initially been reluctant to discuss her private life in the papers, but this changed. In an interview with the magazine <italic>Hot Press</italic>, she told the journalist Jason O’Toole, “I wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth” (2007). In this interview, French described herself as a media operator: “When a journalist calls me about a story, I have to think, ‘OK, what’s my strategy? What cards am I holding that I can haggle with a bit?’” French thus repositioned herself from a reluctant participant in the media to someone who explicitly used it.</p>
<p>When asked if she thought her interview with O’Toole would change the public perception of her as a “dumb blonde,” French responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>I know—and my mother and my close friends know—that the image portrayed of me in the tabloids is far, far from what I am. . . . It is a persona that makes me money. It is a business and you have to treat it like a brand. (J. O’Toole 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Dyer notes, “It is one of the ironies of the whole star phenomenon that all these assertions of the reality of the inner self . . . take place in . . . the mass media” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412457080">1986</xref>, 15). Here French drew a distinction between her public and private selves, suggesting that some media representations are more valid than others. Chris Rojek has argued that celebrity operates by implicitly splitting the individual into public and private selves, “the <italic>I</italic> (the ‘veridical’ self) and the <italic>Me</italic> (the self as seen by others)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1527476412457080">2001</xref>, 11). New celebrities, particular subordinate celebrities, often find that “their public face does not really belong to them” and may be at odds with their self-perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457080">Palmer 2005</xref>, 43). French’s use of the word “persona” is telling—By claiming that there was a significant gap between the <italic>I</italic> and the <italic>Me</italic>, she both distanced herself from unflattering public perceptions while claiming a modicum of control over them. However, by claiming that the public Katy French was as a “brand” used for economic advantage, French put a question mark over the idea of authenticity, made her ambition known, and turned upside down the character of the unwitting celebrity that had been created by Egan.</p>

<sec id="section3-1527476412457080">
<title>Celebrities Go Wild</title>
<p>Turner claims that there are two major avenues through which the “ordinary” person can access celebrity—reality television and the Internet. Discussing franchises such as <italic>Big Brother</italic>, Turner argues that “media producers have taken control of the economy of celebrity by turning it into an outcome of programming strategy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457080">2004</xref>, 54). This allows producers to minimize conflicts of interest between a celebrity’s personal objectives and producers’ commercial interests—A star manufactured through a television program is beholden to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457080">Turner 2004</xref>). Internet stars, however, “create their own sites, generate their own content and design their own performances of themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1527476412457080">2004</xref>, 65). Although these are opposing methods of accessing celebrity—a controlled industry process versus a “do-it-yourself” approach—both can be seen in the construction of French’s celebrity. As the newspaper to “break” the story of the French-Sweeney split, the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic> manufactured a celebrity to which it initially had exclusive access. Although French was not dependent on this media source, she maintained a close relationship with the newspaper, so much so that the broadcaster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527476412457080">Ryan Tubridy (2007)</xref> referred to her celebrity image as the “<italic>Sunday Independent</italic> Katy French”. However, French also worked closely with a number of tabloids setting up “paparazzi” shots and creating content—thus designing her own performance of herself. Like reality television, scripted paparazzi shots demand an unscripted feel; failure to achieve this will mean the images are read as staged. Toward the end of 2007, this strategy backfired. As Palmer notes, “a shrewd understanding of how best to deploy the faded commodity of themselves in the new marketplace of celebrity does not fall naturally to many people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457080">2005</xref>, 42). Seen as inauthentic, desperate for notice and deviating from her given role, French was called a “mistress of spin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527476412457080">Mullally 2007</xref>, 11), and derided for being “addicted to self-publicity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457080">Harrington 2007</xref>, 22).</p>
<p>In October 2007, French took part in the reality television contest <italic>Celebrities Go Wild</italic>. Similar to the UK gamedoc, <italic>I’m a Celebrity . . . Get Me Out of Here, Celebrities Go Wild</italic> pitted contestants against one another in a supposedly harsh environment to raise funds for charity. <italic>Celebrities Go Wild</italic> cemented French’s celebrity by introducing her to a national audience. However, like contestants on <italic>I’m a Celebrity</italic>, which is repeatedly described in the UK media as a vehicle for former stars and minor celebrities, French’s willingness to take part in a reality show, particularly one seen as poorly conceived and executed, denoted her as striving for fame. As Alison Hearn argues, “Reality shows formally enact the process of commodification and promotion. . . . marketing people, by providing the means by which contestants can become saleable image commodities—or branded selves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412457080">2009</xref>, 168). This is arguably more the case when contestants have already achieved some public recognition beforehand, and it is possible that French saw reality television as an opportunity to ascend the celebrity hierarchy. During a posteviction interview, French quipped to the host, “Maybe I’ll have your chair one day,” in response to a question regarding her plans for the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527476412457080">Tubridy 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite completing all the challenges, French was the first contestant voted off <italic>Celebrities Go Wild</italic>. However, in a television interview, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527476412457080">Ryan Tubridy (2007)</xref> claimed that French’s appearance on <italic>Celebrities Go Wild</italic> had allowed the nation access to the person behind the tabloid images and that this supposedly authentic self was “better” than the celebrity image that had earned her the invitation to appear in the first place. Tubridy told the model that “a lot of people thought very highly of you after your appearance on the show because all they were used to was tabloid Katy French.” As Nick Couldry writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Every gamedoc has a specific myth about how it represents the social world. A number of British shows rely on the myth that, in the face of extreme physical challenges . . . an important aspect of human “reality” is shown. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412457080">2009</xref>, 88)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1527476412457080">Tubridy (2007)</xref> suggested to French that there was a direct correlation between external reality and the image mediated through reality television. Similar to her <italic>Hot Press</italic> interview, French claimed that her tabloid image was at odds with her private self: “I nearly start to believe it myself sometimes.” Given Tubridy’s flattering description, French was unlikely to challenge the idea that <italic>Celebrities Go Wild</italic> afforded her an opportunity for authentic self-presentation. Once again, French complicated the rhetoric of sincerity. By accepting the myth that reality television affords greater access to an authentic self than the tabloid media, French implied that the public had been duped inadvertently or intentionally by the very avenue through which her celebrity had been constructed.</p>

<sec id="section4-1527476412457080">
<title>Sex, Scandal, and Femininity</title>
<p>The celebrity hierarchy has a gendered dimension—The tabloid celebrity gossip designated as “trash” concentrates overwhelmingly on female celebrities, and it is popularly believed that consumers of this form of news are female. While in theory, any ordinary person can achieve attributed celebrity, in the contemporary media landscape, subordinate celebrity is most frequently typified by women who, either deliberately or unwittingly, become objects of scrutiny through avenues such as sex scandals (Monica Lewinsky, Rebecca Loos), sex tapes (Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian), reality television (Jade Goody, Snooki), or because of their relationships with celebrity men (Coleen Rooney, Abbey Clancy). Such subordinate celebrities may be written about as figures of ridicule, disparaged as being famous for “nothing,” or seen as exemplifying how fame, particularly female fame, has been divorced from merit or achievement in the contemporary media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476412457080">Negra and Holmes 2008</xref>, 2–3). French’s celebrity was engendered by a media scandal and initially established by coverage in one particular newspaper, the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic>, and through one journalist, gossip columnist Barry Egan.</p>
<p>Through her association with the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic>, French’s celebrity became emphatically linked with the tabloid press. Although printed in broadsheet format, from the early 1990s, the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic> adopted many characteristics associated with tabloids, such as lifestyle features and celebrity gossip, and offers its readers “sex and sin with politics and punditry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1527476412457080">F. O’Toole 1993</xref>, 6). Over the course of the last twenty years, the newspaper’s political and social commentary has often been authored by well-respected male figures, such as the historian Conor Cruise O’Brien and the novelist Colm Tóibín, whereas the “sex and sin” is most associated with the newspaper’s female journalists. Examples include “The Keane Edge,” a social and political gossip column by Terry Keane, and the “03 Team,” a group of female journalists who, during 2003, gained prominence—and derision—for their lifestyle features and accompanying photographs in sexualized poses or revealing clothing. Although initially championed by a male gossip columnist, French’s celebrity was constructed through the gendered frame of the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic>’s “sex and sin” output.</p>
<p>In addition to its tabloid character, French’s celebrity was marked as largely unmerited because of her work as a model. Although Egan referred to French as an “Irish supermodel,” models occupy a low position in the Irish celebrity hierarchy. Although there are Irish male models, the term <italic>Irish model</italic> when used by journalists and commentators refers exclusively to women and operates as both a feminized and pejorative designation. It does not apply to fashion models with international careers, but to “a distinct type of model; a glamorous girl, aware that she would not necessarily make it as a model elsewhere” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412457080">Kiernan 2011</xref>, 16). These models work exclusively in Ireland, command low fees, and are most in demand for product launches and press-calls where they appear in the derided “‘bikini on Grafton Street’ shot” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527476412457080">Sweeney 2010</xref>). Irish models have a certain degree of fame, and are given significant representational space, particularly within tabloid publications, but this is not matched with cultural capital or economic power. Irish models are seen as manifesting a subordinate form of celebrity positioned somewhere between topless models, tabloid stars, car show girls, and beauty contest winners.</p>
<p>Despite its emphasis on family values, in American postfeminist culture, the stigma previously associated with pornography, as a form of labor and a consumption practice, has largely been eradicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527476412457080">Negra 2009</xref>, 99). Linked to this is postfeminism’s frequent emphasis on the sexually performative female body, which is seen as, inter alia, denoting self-care, essential femininity, and empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527476412457080">Negra 2009</xref>, 123). Arguably the same is largely true of British postfeminism. In Ireland, however, the sexually performative female body is frequently regarded as socially problematic—not from a feminist perspective in terms of exploitation or restriction, but from an ideological standpoint as sexually immoral: “Anything having to do with sex is usually cast as a social problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412457080">Inglis 2005</xref>, 33). Irish unease with female sexuality is foregrounded in popular discourse surrounding Irish models. The faint mocking of Ireland’s local models is generally understood to be benign, but it suggests unease or ambivalence with displays of female sexuality and ambition, particularly when one is used in service of the other. These women are habitually described in terms suggesting that their work is similar to striptease or vaguely related to the sex industry. Irish models use their “sexuality to get ahead” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412457080">Kiernan 2011</xref>, 16); they are “comely beauties smiling lasciviously . . . in various shades of undress. . . . [because] sex sells” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1527476412457080">Sweeney 2010</xref>). Allusions to the sex industry could be seen in the press surrounding French. She was described as “a model who gets paid for posing in her underwear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412457080">Byrne 2007b</xref>, 19) or as having “hit the headlines for posing in her knickers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476412457080">McElroy 2007</xref>, 5). Even Egan, the columnist who first championed French, insinuated that her career was less than respectable: “Marcus took grave exception to Katy’s penchant for taking her clothes off for money . . . in her professional capacity as one of Ireland’s top models, we hasten to add” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1527476412457080">Quinn and Egan 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Bruce Babington asserts that stars “reinforce ruling values, sometimes articulating oppositional meanings, as they play out a culture’s conceptions of individuality, masculinity and femininity. . . . They also articulate . . . what the culture prizes as national characteristics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412457080">2001</xref>, 19). Individuals become stars because they seem to tell us something about who we are or what we aspire to as a nation. Contemporary female celebrities, in particular, act “as lightning rods for a range of concerns” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476412457080">Negra and Holmes 2008</xref>, 4). French’s star image has been read as uniquely pertinent to the final years of the Celtic Tiger, and she was described in hyperbolic terms as a “role model for a generation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412457080">Clifford 2007</xref>, 11) whose death “reflected the worst excesses of Celtic Tiger, tabloid-driven celebrity culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412457080"><italic>Hot Press</italic> 2010</xref>). During 2007, French was closely associated with discourses of sexuality, femininity, and consumerism and her celebrity must be understood as operating in the intersecting spheres of neoliberal capitalism and postfeminism. As Debbie Ging argues, in a neoliberal postfeminist Ireland, “freedom is understood less as the legacy of second-wave feminism and increasingly as something given to us by an open, liberal market which celebrates female empowerment in the form of ‘girl power’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412457080">2009</xref>, 53). French was a self-described advocate of “girl power” and was widely held to be a proponent of liberal sexual freedom as well as an exemplary model of consumerism and feminine self-care “groomed to the nines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527476412457080">Prone 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>While the contemporary media offers rewards to subordinate celebrity women prepared to trade on their sexuality, Irish society reads such women ambivalently at best; although their entrepreneurial zeal is lauded, they are also severely judged for violating traditionalist norms of femininity. As Tom Inglis has argued, repressive Irish attitudes have roots in Victorian beliefs about sex and sexuality. Although these spread throughout Britain and America,
<disp-quote>
<p>What made Ireland unique was how deeply Victorian attitudes and practices penetrated into the Irish body and soul. . . . how long these attitudes and practices lasted, and how this antisexual regime was linked to the absence of discourses and conduct that challenged or resisted the dominant obsession with purity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412457080">Inglis 2005</xref>, 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>French needed a delicate balancing act to negotiate these contradictory requirements of contemporary Irish society, and did this by presenting herself as both hypersexual and celibate. In her October interview with <italic>Hot Press</italic>, French discussed her love of sex, masturbation, and sex toys. However, she also claimed to be single and to dislike casual encounters as sex was the “most personal thing that you can do with someone physically” (J. O’Toole 2007). In a follow-up interview, French clarified,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think a lot of Irish women are as hung up as Irish men on the whole Madonna/whore complex, and they find it hard to accept that I am not a tart but that in the right relationship I can really embrace and enjoy my sexuality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476412457080">O’Connor 2007a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>French’s choice of words is significant. While she accused Irish women of holding regressive views of sex, her claim that she was not a “tart” suggests that French accepted the sexual double standard, or at least realized that it persisted in contemporary Ireland.</p>
<p>Following her <italic>Hot Press</italic> interview, French began to attract a greater amount of negative press. Claire Byrne compared French unfavorably with the British glamor model Jordan (also known as Katie Price) claiming that French’s work for the charity Goal was incompatible with her role as “someone who takes off her clothes for money” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412457080">2007b</xref>, 19), and asked, “Do you really want to hear a model talking about her sex toys and sexual exploits one week and telling you about the plight of the Third World the next?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412457080">2007b</xref>, 19). French’s response was typically postfeminist, employing the rhetoric of choice and describing Byrne as a proponent of an obsolete, extremist feminism:
<disp-quote>
<p>In many ways she reminds me of what [Irish journalist] John Waters so memorably dubbed the “feminazis”—this notion that if you want to be a strong woman you need to hate men and wear dungarees and eschew femininity. . . . Claire Byrne seems to espouse what Joan Didion called “wounded bird feminism”—but I suppose I’m more an exponent of “sassy bird feminism.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1527476412457080">O’Connor 2007b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps more controversial was French’s admission to J. O’Toole (2007) that she would consider an abortion if she were to fall pregnant during the peak of her career. Celtic Tiger Ireland grew more comfortable with myriad forms of sexual display—lap dance clubs and pole dance exercise classes became popular across the country—but increased reproductive rights were not concomitant with this supposed sexual liberation. Abortion remains illegal except where the mother’s life is endangered by continuing a pregnancy. French clarified her position in an interview with the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic>: “I wasn’t in any way being some kind of cheerleader for abortion. . . . I am as pro-life as the next person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476412457080">O’Connor 2007a</xref>). This may have been an exercise in damage control. However, given the relative circulation figures of <italic>Hot Press</italic> (less than 20,000) and the <italic>Sunday Independent</italic> (more than 250,000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412457080">ABC Ireland 2007</xref>), it is possible that French saw this interview as an opportunity to generate controversy. Toward the end of the interview, French claimed that she had considered taking a vibrator as her “luxury item” on <italic>Celebrities Go Wild</italic>, but had decided on mascara, because, “After all, a girl’s gotta look her best” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476412457080">O’Connor 2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this statement was no doubt tongue-in-cheek, by linking these two disparate items, French can be seen to be operating in a postfeminist cultural landscape with its consistent emphasis on the necessity of feminine self-care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1527476412457080">Negra 2009</xref>, 123) and where the need to be sexually attractive is believed to be of more importance than second-wave feminist arguments around female sexual fulfillment and sexual objectification. That French chose to end this interview about the controversial topic of abortion in a seemingly flippant manner points to what Angela McRobbie has called “a tidal wave of invidious insurgent patriarchalism which is hidden beneath the celebrations of female freedom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527476412457080">2008</xref>, 539). Under the guise of challenging patriarchal Irish Catholic norms and positioning herself as “part of a new generation,” French submits to conservative expectations of sexuality and femininity. Despite declaring that “how someone can be pilloried for being open about sex, given what we know about the fruits of repression in this country, is quite staggering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1527476412457080">O’Connor 2007a</xref>), French makes what amounts to an apology for her previous statements about abortion and plays with the idea of a postfeminist version of transgressive sexuality, only to reassure readers that she is conventionally and traditionally feminine after all.</p>

<title>“Bad Behavior” versus National Values</title>
<p>Ryan Tubridy was to be proven incorrect—French’s reality television exposure did not garner the model greater respect. While not all the press around her had been positive, after French’s statements about sexuality and abortion, and her admission that she had taken cocaine—contemporaneous with her appearance <italic>Celebrities Go Wild—</italic>the media became significantly more disparaging. From this point on, French was increasingly written about through the frame of “train-wreck” female celebrity of the kind exemplified by UK “bad girls” such as Kerry Katona and Katie Price. French’s birthday party was held at the Krystle nightclub in Dublin on 29 November. In 2007, Krystle was one of Dublin’s newest and most high-profile nightclubs, and was arguably the premier representational space for the Celtic Tiger cubs—the generation that had come of age during this time of financial prosperity and social transformation. Krystle’s reputation was built on a series of newspaper reports styling it as a celebrity playground. Unlike Dublin’s other exclusive nightclub, Lillie’s Bordello, whose status derives from many years of hosting international stars, Krystle’s celebrity clientele was typically young, female, and Irish, including a number of Irish models and former Miss World, Rosanna Davidson. The club attracted Ireland’s burgeoning paparazzi, and pictures of local celebrities entering or leaving the venue were popular with the tabloid press. In the weeks before her birthday, rumors fueled by French had circulated that a number of high-profile celebrities were due to attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1527476412457080">J. O’Toole 2009</xref>, 198). None did, and the press gave unfavorable reports of the party, calling it “more akin to a meeting of the National Union of Journalists than a birthday celebration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412457080">Byrne 2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>As Gareth Palmer argues, subordinate celebrities who are seen to be determinedly pursuing fame are designated as D-List when the public, at the behest of the media, decide that their moment has gone. The D-Lister is “someone who has failed to grasp their true economic value in the system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457080">Palmer 2005</xref>, 40). D-List fame leaves a celebrity vulnerable to punishment through a tabloid cycle of celebration, transgression, punishment, and redemption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1527476412457080">Palmer 2005</xref>, 46). During October 2007, French’s statements about abortion and drug consumption seemed to signal that she had entered the transgression phase of the cycle. Through her participation in celebrity reality television and by using her birthday party as a media event, French was seen to exceed her allotted position in the celebrity hierarchy and was punished for it. Patrice Harrington’s report on the party included a quote designed to put French back in her place: “She’s a cheap glamour model, isn’t she? Or a lapdancer. I can’t wait to meet her. She should be intellectually stimulating” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457080">Harrington 2007</xref>). This quote, attributed to a contestant from <italic>Big Brother 7</italic>, describes French as tawdry, sexually immoral, connected with the sex industry and stupid, as well as occupying such an inferior position in the celebrity hierarchy that she was unknown to fellow D-Listers.</p>
<p>The female celebrities designated as “train-wreck” by the media are most commonly white. Media eviscerations of these women contain an undercurrent of dismay that they are violating the behavioral codes of whiteness, which marks them as “white trash” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476412457080">Negra and Holmes 2008</xref>, 5). Gender and class politics are clearly at work in the treatment of celebrities such as Katie Price and Britney Spears. Such women are “presented as ‘over-reachers’, reverting to their original class characteristics in grotesque displays of recidivism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1527476412457080">Negra and Holmes 2008</xref>, 5). Class politics of a different sort are at play in the media treatment of celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Katy French. These women are castigated for breaches of white and middle-class propriety. Reports of French frequently mentioned her privileged childhood, at times inferring that she had flouted middle-class obligations and expectations: “Her father harboured dreams, she says, of sending her to U.S. Ivy League college Dartmouth. Instead, his firstborn makes a living baring her behind on Grafton Street to sell phones” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457080">Harrington 2007</xref>, 22).</p>
<p>French’s whiteness was made to do political work. Born in Switzerland to English and Australian parents, accounts of the model often highlighted her multicultural status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412457080">Harrington 2007</xref>, 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1527476412457080">J. O’Toole 2009</xref>, 15). French could be used as shorthand for a gratifying perception of the country that had gained currency in the popular imaginary—that of an economically dynamic, multicultural Ireland. Parallel to positive associations of Ireland as a welcoming, culturally diverse space were popular fears that the country was being “swamped” by immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527476412457080">Loyal 2003</xref>, 75). There was a gendered dimension to this xenophobia—pregnant nonnational women were seen as a particular menace with popular discourse positing that such women were overwhelming Irish maternity hospitals while their nonnational offspring threatened the racial and ethnic profile of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">Meaney 2010</xref>, 4). In 2004, these fears were harnessed, resulting in an almost 80% vote for a constitutional amendment limiting citizenship. As Gerardine Meaney argues, the ease with which this was achieved indicates that racism is not a marginal factor in Irish politics, but that racism is constitutionally enshrined as a structural principle in national identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412457080">2010</xref>, 4–5). In popular Irish discourse, immigrants are divided into “desirable” and “undesirable” subjects—some linked to ideas of sophistication and positive globalization while others are associated with misuse of the welfare system, fraudulent marriages, and criminality. Government statements frequently claimed that Ireland’s welfare system was “being systematically abused by unscrupulous asylum seekers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527476412457080">Loyal 2003</xref>, 84–85). In some ways, French was used as an alibi for structural racism, particular when contrasted to “undesirable” migrants. With her Swiss, British, and Australian antecedents, French could be held up as an example of a new multicultural Ireland, while her appearance—blonde and lightly bronzed—presented no challenge to white hegemony.</p>
<p>Interestingly, French’s status as a nonnational was rarely brought to the fore when censuring her. Instead, criticism of French was analogous with criticism of the country, with French being asked in some way to “answer” for negative aspects of Irish culture. An opinion piece in the <italic>Sunday Tribune</italic> alleging that the then-Taoiseach (prime minister) was guilty of dishonesty argued that “Bertie Ahern is an ideal Taoiseach for the country that produced Katy French” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412457080">Doyle 2007</xref>, 20). Criticism more properly directed at political corruption, the neoliberal free market economy, or postfeminism was targeted at French, who was seen to exemplify negative aspects of Irish life, and her name became shorthand for the perceived failings of Celtic Tiger Ireland. According to one blogger, “It’s a sad indictment of our times that someone like Katy French can permeate our culture so widely” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1527476412457080">Twenty Major 2007</xref>). As Anna Watkins Fisher has argued, media interest in celebrity train-wrecks peaks at moments of political volatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1527476412457080">2011</xref>, 311). French’s death was contemporaneous with the “death” of the Celtic Tiger. Despite the economic fallout from the global recession, the collapse of the Celtic Tiger economy, and the concomitant political turmoil this engendered, during her final days French was front-page news. French was both lauded for her groomed appearance and castigated for brash consumerism as if these two were unrelated. While commentators stopped short of blaming French for the state of Ireland’s economy, she was held as an example of all that was wrong with the nation’s finances, in part shifting the blame for economic instability from the government to the young, irresponsible female consumer exemplified by French: “Young, beautiful and seemingly wealthy, Katy French personified the illusory and facile notion that you can have it all in our ‘modern, sophisticated’ Ireland” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412457080">Clifford 2007</xref>, 11). Emblematic of an extravagant and irresponsible use of both public money and consumer credit, French became “the symbol of an era. An era of bling and consumption and show” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1527476412457080">Prone 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>During the Celtic Tiger years, government ministers, education and business commentators, and the media suggested that young people were ill-prepared for Ireland’s evolving economy, had unrealistic demands, and had to adjust themselves to access the opportunities of neoliberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412457080">Hanafin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476412457080"><italic>The Irish Independent</italic> 2006</xref>). If French can be seen as somehow representational of a generation of Celtic Tiger cubs, then her attempt to leverage her initial tabloid exposure into a media career can be read as a form of entrepreneurialism. As such, what was popularly seen as a striving for public notice can instead be read as an attempt to create a market for what she had explicitly referred to as her “brand,” even though this required her to engage in labor, which made her feel “silly” (J. O’Toole 2007). In Ireland, neoliberal politics, postfeminism, and a commercialized media have all facilitated regressive gender stereotypes. Neoliberalism, with its stress on market forces, ensures that the most profitable constructions of gender prevail; sexism is repackaged as ironic or somehow progressive, and the rhetoric of free choice is employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412457080">Ging 2009</xref>, 53–57). For all her talk of “sassy bird feminism,” French was, she admitted, willing to “play up to” the image of herself as a “dumb blonde” (J. O’Toole 2007) when it was profitable. To call French “the person who brashly represented the hedonism and consumerism of contemporary Ireland” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1527476412457080">Mullally 2007</xref>, 11) or “an icon of the Celtic Tiger era” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1527476412457080">J. O’Toole 2009</xref>, 239) seems unfair. Katy French was not a symbol of Celtic Tiger Ireland, but her celebrity—with all the tensions and controversy it provoked—was indubitably a consequence of it.</p>
