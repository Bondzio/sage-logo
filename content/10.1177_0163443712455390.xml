<p>This article examines cultural quota debates in the context of local music content provision in Australia and New Zealand. The commercial radio industries in both countries are examined for the different ways in which the local music industries attempt to negotiate changing perceptions of the ‘national’ in the shift from analogue to digital media environments. A call for new configurations of local media as cultural exception is made, given the profound shifts in global cultural trade and digital media spheres, where reliance upon older notions of cultural nationalism is less stable.</p>

<p>The cultural quota has retained its relevance for many nations, and extends back into the mid 20th century. Sometimes regarded as a blunt and controversial means to ensure cultural protection for nations with lower cultural output, they have been most visible in the traditional audio-visual sectors (film, music, television, radio). Nations as culturally diverse as South Africa, France, Canada, Poland, South Korea, Portugal and Malaysia possess quotas, principally for their local broadcasting industries, and with different emphasis applied to community, public and commercial media. For some, notions of the ‘national’ have been extended to encourage music production in the national or regional language. Quotas exist in Canada and France, for example, in relation to the airplay of French songs, although doubts exist regarding their effects upon preferences for the local product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0163443712455390">Wolther, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, drawing on interviews conducted as part of the Australian Research Council project Policy Notes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163443712455390">1</xref></sup> I examine the music quota debate in New Zealand and Australia for several reasons. First, notions of cultural trade inequities and cultural identity have not withered. Despite the speed and growth of digital media networks, many in the cultural industries in both countries still speak of the need to encourage local production. This is particularly the case in New Zealand, given its smaller population and media infrastructure:<disp-quote>
<p>We are at risk of complete domination by America and all the UK media.… [I]t’s important to have a New Zealand artistic voice. Because of the size of our economy, it’s very difficult.… So the only way that we can really compete is by some form of subsidy from the government, some form of investment by the government in the hope that there is, you know, a significant return. (senior New Zealand music industry executive, interview December 2009)</p>
<p>I think that if countries like New Zealand, Canada and France didn’t invest in pop musicians then all we would hear would be American and British music. What sort of message is that for our young musicians coming through, with all the kids who want to write songs about us, or hear songs about us? I mean, it still gives me a thrill to hear Don McGlashan singing about Dominion Road.… [Y]ou got to have music that’s about us, and it’s so important for our soul. (senior New Zealand Arts Ministry executive, interview December 2009).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was a common theme among those we interviewed, although many were similarly keen to emphasize that the ‘cultural cringe’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0163443712455390">2</xref></sup> was no longer a local factor in cultural policy decisions. Nonetheless, global music trade flows, and the implications for national identity, remain prominent in policy discussions.</p>
<p>Second, this debate forms part of a longer history of work on ‘small nation’ musics and the cultural and economic challenges they face (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712455390">Malm and Wallis, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163443712455390">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163443712455390">Robinson et al., 1991</xref>). The premises of this earlier work have changed in light of substantial regulatory, technological and cultural change for all cultural industries. How have contemporary media technologies, with their ability to diffuse content and audiences, affected meanings of both the ‘local’ and the ‘national’?</p>
<p>Third, attempts to actively revive the music quota debate in Australia are evident across several industry and government platforms. Battle lines have firmed between the music and radio industries, with the latter raising the continuing need for quotas. Quotas are also an issue within the Australian government’s recent and ongoing reviews of public broadcasting, digital media and convergence. These will also be examined in the context of a politics of media and cultural regulation, and shifts from national self-regulation to global governance through trade forums.</p>
<p>In a comparison of these two countries, I am keenly aware of substantial structural differences and imbalances. With its population of 22 million, Australia retains considerable advantages in economies of industrial scale. The long history of New Zealand musicians looking to the Australian market for recording and live music careers is evidence that regional hierarchies exist in relation to global opportunity; ‘small’ is always a relative term in music economies. Yet both nations have similar histories in radio, including initial broadcasting models based upon the BBC; the development of tightly formatted music stations in the 1980s; and subsequent deregulation from the 1990s leading to greater foreign ownership and national networking.</p>
<p>While radio remains the preoccupation, I will consider here how and where the promotion of local music is situated within ever broadening media platforms. The case studies below have obvious and particular local contexts, yet they also reveal how different national media histories provoke different industrial and governmental responses. They offer some insight into how governments are attempting to balance cultural and industrial objectives, and the competing interests of different media sectors.</p>
<sec id="section1-0163443712455390">
<title>New Zealand</title>
<p>Unlike Australia, New Zealand considered the music quota relatively late as a form of local industry assistance. Even then, moves in the mid 1980s towards a mandatory 10% quota were hampered by industry strategies to prolong discussions without taking legislative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712455390">Pickering and Shuker, 1994</xref>: 74–5). Efforts were also made at a time of considerable flux in the media industries. From 1988 to 1991, the national government produced a flurry of deregulation, including the removal of laws ensuring local ownership, networking and content; the establishment of Radio New Zealand as a ‘state enterprise’; and the auctioning of spectrum to dramatically increase the number of commercial stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712455390">Neill and Shanahan, 2004</xref>: 108–9). In 1991, another quota proposal of 15% was defeated in parliament, deemed to be ‘from another era’ and out of step with the prevailing mood for deregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712455390">Pickering and Shuker, 1994</xref>: 76). Despite the proliferation of stations, concerns remained about the diversity of content, and the radio industry’s unwillingness to observe even small doses of airplay for local artists:<disp-quote>
<p>The most efficient thing to do was to just import American formats. And so they did, and New Zealand radio was playing American formats, and there was no provision for New Zealand content.… DJs couldn’t, apart from the odd specialist program, they lost an ability to put their own choices of music in there. In fact, a lot of the formats had gaps every 15 minutes and they would just do the little station ID … and that was a shocker. (senior New Zealand industry executive, interview 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tenure of the Labour government led by Helen Clark (who also took on the Arts portfolio) from 1999 produced a different regulatory environment. In 2001 the Clark government proposed a 25% quota, introduced a greater number of stations for minority cultures and interests, and stated its interest in a dedicated youth station. In similar ways to how Australian quota policy was enacted, the threat of an imposed mandatory quota saw the radio industry agree in 2002 to a voluntary quota of 20%, to be achieved by 2006:<disp-quote>
<p>We did a lot of work with Labour [in Opposition], talking to them … we showed them every year the international royalties coming from APRA [Australasian Performing Rights Association] were getting greater and greater. And that was mainly thanks to a couple of songs, but it adds up to a huge amount. So it was ‘Don’t dream it’s over’ [Crowded House], a huge hit in the States and later, ‘How bizarre’ [OMC], which was a hit around the world. And just those two things made them understand that it was an industry and that if it was encouraged you could get more of this. (senior New Zealand industry executive, interview 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The introduction of KIWI FM in 2005 was widely seen as a move to stall attempts to introduce a national public youth broadcaster. While it has a 100% New Zealand content policy, KIWI is a commercial operation that operates with some non-youth presenters, and is not nationwide in its reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712455390">Mollgard, 2005</xref>). The station appeared towards the end of a decade of expansion by the major networks, encouraged by an industry landscape that did not focus explicitly on local content, and governments that sought to remove obstacles to commercial growth. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712455390">Neill and Shanahan (2004)</xref> have pointed out, there were particular ironies related to the deregulation era: the greater competition for audiences that drove tighter formats and the reliance upon international hits (and station owners) made compliance with quotas that much harder.</p>
<p>The interesting point of exception in the Kiwi context is that of New Zealand On Air (NZOA). As an independent funding body established in 1991, it has provided a distinctive set of alternatives to assist local music production. This has been achieved though a series of ‘supply side’ funding schemes (recording, video production) coupled with targeted industrial strategies (plugging local content to radio stations, funding specialist New Zealand music stations). This is an extraordinary mechanism of cultural policy, with the state centrally located between musicians, radio and the recording industries, despite criticisms about the selection of recipients, the genres supported and that the ‘partnership’ between state and industry may be overly driven by commercial imperatives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712455390">Scott, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Sitting on a wall pinned above [a radio program director’s] computer was a tatty list of the radio promo people from all the big companies … Sony … EMI, Warner’s and Universal, and there was NZ On Air, and I thought [snaps fingers] right, we’ve done it. We have become as important to that radio programmer in making his radio station work as EMI, Warner’s, BMG, Universal and so on.… By trying to get New Zealand music on the radio, I thought that was the business we were in – and it is the business we’re in – but by getting more New Zealand music played on the radio, we have built, some people say an industry, but I say we’ve built an audience. (one of the founding strategists for NZOA, interview December 2009)</p>

<sec id="section2-0163443712455390">
<title>Australia</title>
<p>Australia has adopted a more conventional path, with local music quotas first established in 1942 at 2%. Unlike New Zealand contexts, Australian debates of the 1940s and 1950s had broad, cross-party agreement on the need for local support in the absence of any sustained industry or public demands; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712455390">Counihan (1992)</xref> points out, the radio quota served as the principal form of industry assistance until the 1980s. The Australian music industries shared New Zealand’s preoccupation with the dominance of U.S. and U.K. musics across broadcasting soundscapes, evident in the local content stipulations established for the national broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Commission, designed to ensure a voice for Australian orchestras. The radio quota has been a straightforward, ostensible achievement, ‘commonly seen as the most successful of government interventions into the media because (so the argument goes) it literally brought an industry into being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0163443712455390">Turner, 1994</xref>: 340).</p>
<p>As arguments that an emerging local music industry could not compete with international production increased in scope and sophistication, so too did the quota levels: 1956 (5%); 1973 (10%); 1976 (20%). In 1999 it was raised to 25% for mainstream pop/rock, with a quarter of this to be material less than 12 months old, complemented by community broadcasting quotas of 25%; many music-focused stations such as Fbi in Sydney and RRR in Melbourne have local content figures of up to 50%.</p>
<p>Radio quotas, particularly through the 1980s and 1990s, meshed well with and fostered the emergence of Australian pop and rock acts, twinned with new local recording companies and pub performance circuits. The conversion of the Sydney-based 2JJ into the national public youth broadcaster Triple J was also an important moment in ensuring a solid platform of promotion for Australian bands. Because the arguments and implementation have been relatively straightforward, I’ll concentrate here on more recent developments that have challenged quota orthodoxies.</p>
<p>Australian radio has been remarkably consistent in its opposition to local content stipulations. In the 1940s, the argument was that Australia did not have sufficient material to sustain a quota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712455390">Counihan, 1992</xref>); in the 1970s, recording companies were provided with ‘free’ promotion of their product at no cost, according to stations. In a 2001 submission to parliament on regional radio, FARB (the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters) stated:<disp-quote>
<p>there is a massive reverse subsidy to the recording industry by radio.… The amount of ‘free’ commercial airtime for Australian music on FARB’s 235 member licencees (sic) resulting from these quotas would run into the hundreds of millions of dollars a year. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712455390">FARB, 2001</xref>: 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Those in favour of the current content code also believe the peak representative body for the commercial radio industry, Commercial Radio Australia (CRA), did not fulfill its regulatory obligations in its failure to consult widely and early with other stakeholders about its latest form of opposition. Much of the music industry discovered CRA’s intentions through a small advertisement placed in <italic>The Australian</italic> newspaper in early 2010. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance argued its opposition on three central grounds: that the removal of local content on digital soundscapes abrogated the cultural aims of ‘Australian identity, character and cultural diversity’; that local content actively contributed to diversity, rather than reducing it; and that the likely scenario of stations solely airing foreign material was a distorted use of the public spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712455390">Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In July 2010, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) agreed with the CRA in granting digital stations an exemption from the music quota. Apart from enabling ‘licensees the flexibility to experiment with programming formats’, a key argument was that the federal government had waived local quotas for the suite of new digital television stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712455390">ACMA, 2010a</xref>). CRA’s Joan Warner has argued that:<disp-quote>
<p>The exemption from the Australian music local content quotas for digital-only radio services enables the radio industry to develop and explore the impact of new services, formats and genres. The commercial radio industry is quite obviously committed to supporting the music of Australian artists, with initiatives such as the New Artists 2 Radio competition now in its ninth year. Ultimately the commercial radio industry wants to provide listeners with the formats and, as part of that, the music our listeners want to hear. Given the opportunity to develop a range of new genres, digital radio may well over time lead to more Australian music being played on radio and more opportunities not only for artists but for new on-air Australian radio talent. Code 4 [local content code] will be reviewed as part of a formal review held every three years. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0163443712455390">The Music Network, 2010</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Warner points to CRA’s ‘New Artists 2 Radio’ competition as evidence of the organization’s commitment to Australian content. Open to acts aged between 15 and 35, the winner receives airplay, a digital distribution deal and a small range of ‘live performance opportunities’ connected with CRA events in ‘nurturing and supporting Australian music talent’ (CRA, 2011). Warner is looking to receive similar rebates from the government that television has received in recognition of the costs of switching to digital transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712455390">Jackson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>What will digital radio sound like beyond its transformative, ‘settling in’ period? Some signs are already there: Austereo has ‘Radar Radio’, dedicated to new music, and ‘Barry’, a comedy station. At the same time, ‘program diversity’ or ‘experimentation’ at some stations has meant the establishment of niche stations playing a single artist. Austereo’s brief airing of ‘Radio Gaga’ (Lady Gaga), ‘Pink Radio’ (Pink) and ‘High Voltage Radio’ (AC/DC) stations in 2010 provoked AMRAP, the federally funded Australian Music Radio Airplay Project, to produce ‘Midnight Gaga Radio’, a looped mashup of Midnight Oil’s ‘Beds are Burning’ and Lady Gaga’s ‘Poker Face’:<disp-quote>
<p>Do ACMA and CRA seriously believe that devoting a radio station to advertise a single American pop star is a legitimate and innovative use of Australia’s radio spectrum? (AMRAP manager Chris Johnson cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712455390">Eliezer, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This debate cannot be dissociated from a more serious theatre of war between the radio and the music industries. The Phonographic Performance Company of Australia (PPCA) has lodged with the High Court of Australia an application to lift the 1% cap on radio broadcasting royalties established in 1969, citing much higher rates paid by the radio sector in other national markets, and the current rate’s disproportionate share related to the heavy lifting done by music across formats (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163443712455390">PPCA, 2011</xref>). Warner has explicitly drawn quota considerations into the royalty cap battle:<disp-quote>
<p>If something happens to the 1 per cent cap because it’s supposedly an unfair acquisition, what about the music quota which is forced supply of a product? … Is there unfair acquisition of our only product, which is air time, by a forced supply from a particular group of music companies? (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0163443712455390">Sexton, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This places CRA at odds with itself. The ‘Code of Practice 4’ states:<disp-quote>
<p>The commercial radio industry is committed to supporting the music of Australian artists and composers … [it] will continue to encourage the increased production by the record industry of Australian music relevant to stations formats and the preferences of the Australian listening public.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>How seriously can this support be taken when the CEO believes that the provision of Australian music is ‘forced supply’? These types of statements have to be placed in a much longer historical context that points to CRA critiques against <italic>any</italic> form of regulation as a poor alternative to self-regulation. The pattern of CRA relationships with governments during the last decade has been to simply argue that all regulation is commercial death, including imposed local news content, advertising standards or licence conditions imposed after the infamous ‘cash for comment’ scandal that revealed prominent talk format announcers being paid for adopting the positions of their key advertisers.</p>
<p>Yet the more vigorous (and perhaps honest) stance by CRA is indicative of a changed environment, under a Labor government with different priorities from previous ones. In 1994 the Keating government’s Arts Minister, Michael Lee, openly harangued commercial radio for favouring ‘hits and memories’ formats over new Australian content. The Rudd government’s Arts Minister, Peter Garrett, expressed an intent to ‘encourage ongoing exposure and increased diversity of Australian contemporary music across various platforms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712455390">Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, 2010</xref>: 12). However, any ministerial defence of the music quota as part of cultural identity/character/diversity questions was noticeably absent in the wake of the ACMA ruling. Missing, too, were arguments that the quota fulfilled a pivotal aspect of circularity in production, consumption and employment activity. Music radio remains a significant part of the music industries chain. Airplay drives sales, which drives local signings; and quotas ensure that commercial stations look at the independent sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712455390">Mason, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There is also the issue of quantity. In 2010, Australian music content accounted for only 14.2% of tracks released (13,778 tracks out of a total of 96,804) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712455390">AMPCOM, 2010</xref>: 17). In the same year, only 30 Australian acts made the Top 100 Album Chart and, as some indication of radio’s ability to squeeze dry successful formats, 27 releases from 2009 remained on the Top 100 Chart for 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712455390">ARIA, 2011</xref>). In the Top 100 Singles Chart, 14 Australian acts are included, with a chart position no higher than No. 34 (ibid.). While it possesses a sophisticated live recording, education and media infrastructure, Australian popular music clearly cannot dominate its own local market, unlike other mature western producers/markets.</p>

<sec id="section3-0163443712455390">
<title>Culture, trade and digital media</title>
<p>The cultural quota remains contentious, to say the least, in a world that is supposedly moving (albeit gradually) to free trade environments, and in the absence of national protections. Successive world trade negotiations (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade – GATT; Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights – TRIPS) have produced much heat over the extent to which cultural production should remain protected, backed by the increasing power of the World Trade Organization seeking deregulation. In particular, the US sought the classification of audio-visual services on the internet as ‘virtual goods’ under GATT, to deliver liberalization, the standard by which all new digital media content and services/carriers will be classified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163443712455390">Puppis, 2008</xref>: 412). Within GATT discourses of ‘non-discrimination and market access’, motion pictures were deemed the sole exemption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163443712455390">Puppis, 2008</xref>: 409).</p>
<p>New Zealand was the only nation to join the US in opting for liberalization of its audio-visual industries in the GATT round (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163443712455390">Puppis, 2008</xref>: 411). The next Labour government found that:<disp-quote>
<p>We have unilaterally disarmed ourselves on trade but very few others have been so foolish. We’re now left with perfectly legitimate calls for local content and people saying ‘You can’t do that because of GATS’. This seems a bit ridiculous. (Prime Minister Helen Clarke cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712455390">Kelsey, 2003</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Australia brokered its own Free Trade Agreement with the US in 2004. In retaining its local broadcasting content quotas, the Australian government agreed to waive them for future media platforms, while the existing analogue quotas cannot be increased. This was deemed acceptable in return for Australian access to agricultural, financial services and other U.S. sectors. In relation to New Zealand, the Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement, entrenched by the Australian High Court in 1998, ensures that New Zealand audio-visual content is regarded as ‘Australian’ in Australian markets. While ‘cultural values’ can be part of economic discourses of trade, cultural ‘exception’ conveys abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163443712455390">Throsby, 2001</xref>: 133). The music quota is further evidence of Australia’s ambiguity in trade policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712455390">Flew and Cunningham, 2002</xref>) that plays both sides of the street: supportive of local content provisions, but also broadly supportive of global free trade.</p>
<p>The internet is already challenging the former certainties of both public and commercial broadcasting in providing more specialized services; de-centred spaces that preclude public debate/nation-building; and advertising changes to niche buyers, rather than measurement of mass audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712455390">Nightingale, 2004</xref>). Like other media forms, digital alternatives bypass the politics and regulation related to nation-building discourses. Global digital delivery systems – iTunes, Last.fm, Pandora, Spotify, etc. – at least in part live up to the ‘innovation’ hyperbole in offering a diversity of streamed content. As digital media consistently improve their ‘massification’ of niche musics, the presence of popular sites for Australian content can be lost in the mix (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712455390">Cunningham’s 2011</xref> discussion of digital opportunities for Australian film). This requires new thinking about where music publics are, and the right mix of public/commercial platforms that ensures that local priorities are maintained.</p>
<p>These questions have been explored in New Zealand in the context of a 2007 review of NZOA, which argued for greater integration with digital media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712455390">Brown and Dubber, 2007</xref>: 30). A further 2010 review of NZOA’s music schemes found that youth utilized radio, television and the internet in almost equal portions in their music consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712455390">Caddick, 2010</xref>: 112), with calls for greater presence and strategy on social media platforms, including iTunes, Facebook and YouTube. New Zealand’s key interventionist body in the music chain had moved beyond the quota debate. Guided by the Caddick report, NZOA’s new scheme announced in May 2011, ‘Making Tracks’, replaced its former album and new recording schemes and radio pluggers with the funding of 200 recording/video projects per year, the appointment of broadcast promotions and repertoire personnel, and the notable addition of a digital music strategist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712455390">NZOA, 2011</xref>). The Australian government’s 2010 ‘Strategic Contemporary Music Industry Plan’ discussion paper also sought views on ‘financial support to assist new and emerging artists and bands to produce broadcast-ready, and commercially viable, products for radio’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712455390">Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, 2010</xref>: 12). It seems that Australia is not averse to importing New Zealand policy as well as its music.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For all the discussions about new digital media platforms, radio retains considerable influence and presence. In Australia, music remains the most popular listening form (75%) with the 15–24 and 25–34 age groups on radio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712455390">ACMA, 2010a</xref>). In early 2011, commercial radio experienced a 5.79% increase in advertising revenue in its metropolitan markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163443712455390">CRA, 2011a</xref>). One year after digital stations started to broadcast, 2011 data reveals a digital audience of 523,000, with 150,000 digital radios sold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712455390">Frost Global, 2011</xref>). In New Zealand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712455390">Brown and Dubber (2007</xref>: 15) found that ‘nearly all participants (92.9%) listened to the radio on an average day, with 35.2% listening for up to an hour, and a further 27.2% listening for up to two hours’.</p>
<p>What are the right policy settings for the significant number of music listeners who ‘keep appointments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712455390">Brown and Dubber, 2007</xref>: 12) with traditional media in national markets? In similar ways to the relationships between ‘indie’ recording labels and the larger multinationals, commercial radio remains a critical endpoint for the substantial A&amp;R (Artists &amp; Repertoire) work performed by the community and public radio sectors. Those who advocate ‘choice’ for both broadcasters and audience in arguing that the quota is a classic distortion of markets ignore the fact that ‘“choice” is dependent upon what is actually available through local markets’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712455390">Pickering and Shuker, 1994</xref>: 94). Governments have in the main ignored the primary locus of music activity – recording and associated publishing profits – and instead focused on funding for touring and related activities. This has not diminished the usual arguments for providing assistance to the broadcasting industries: that local audiences need access to local stories as a fundamental part of everyday life. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712455390">Flew and Cunningham (2002</xref>: 50) point out that ‘“pro-social” initiatives such as the local content quota have rested historically upon a quid pro quo, where incumbent broadcasters have been protected from potential new competitors’.</p>
<p>This case study reveals that such national broadcasting contracts are now on very shaky ground. Digital media has shattered the previous neat and tidy compartmentalization of audiences and stations. The profusion of access sites reveals the increasing power of the consumer, and increased competition among broadcasters for market share. National syndicated station franchises have lost their monopoly status as music carriers; recent and emerging digital platforms threaten their protection from foreign media. As they scramble to compete with other hardware and software devices when, how and who audiences listen to is increasingly less predictable. The music quota is not currently used to ‘shield the community from infection by foreign cultural influences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163443712455390">Throsby, 2001</xref>: 132), as older discourses explicitly proposed. Former binary arguments between ‘local’ and ‘foreign’ content can no longer be sustained at a time when the global cross-pollination of ideas, musicians, live and recording personnel, not to mention media platforms, increases. Further, the pattern of global trade negotiations suggests that cultural exception arguments will be increasingly difficult to make.</p>
<p>What does the ‘national’ mean for national popular music markets in complex digital media environments? The history of quota debates shows an extraordinary similarity to industry arguments across different nations. The music industries see their importance as content drivers across platforms, in providing content for radio, television, film, the internet and live venues. For the radio industries, music is a business cost, or the provision of free promotion of music. This returns us to the importance of government, and the extent to which they prioritize ‘culture, trade or industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712455390">Cloonan, 2007</xref>). If radio is now simply assessed through industrial frameworks, policy will emphasize profits and viability, with none of the usual government demands catering to local audience or national concerns. If content floors are eventually abandoned, cultural arguments will need to find resonance in targeted assistance that properly deals with new digital soundscapes. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712455390">Given (2003</xref>: 94) has argued, ‘promotion’ policies (rather than protection) are only successful through provision of ‘carriage on the most widely used distribution systems’.</p>
<p>As media industries and governments attempt a greater presence on digital, on-demand platforms, different references to and constructions of cultural nationalism will have to be made. This will be increasingly difficult as the music and broadcasting industries continue to disagree about territorial and digital rights and roles. In the meantime, how new online radio stations are used – whether they reinforce international playlists or promote national artists – requires greater scrutiny. This indicates a need to ensure that discussions about the cultural value of particular media – what they look and sound like, and how their value can be assessed – are not removed in the rush to cater to individual industry sectors that advocate ‘forced supply’ arguments around media content without proper consideration of the circular benefits for national industries and audiences.</p>

<p>The term ‘cultural cringe’ derives from a 1950 essay by A.A. Phillips, with the central argument that Australian artists, writers, musicians, theatre and film performers struggle against the perception that the local cultural product is always inherently inferior to the overseas one, particularly British and European culture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163443712455390">Phillips, 2006</xref>).</p></fn>
