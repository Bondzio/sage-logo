<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The objective of this study is to examine the differences in receipt of diabetes education according to risk factors that are associated with the disease, including race/ ethnicity, region, and rural/urban location.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713480002">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>National data from the 2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were analyzed to examine likelihood of receipt of diabetes education in terms of race, urban/rural location, and region.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713480002">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of 1747 adults with type 2 diabetes, 65.6% were white, 15% black, and 19.4% other. In addition, 49.3% were male, 50.6% female; 46.9% were under age 64; 39.8% had more than high school; 34.1% were from low-income households, 35.1% middle income, and 30.8% high income; 39.5% lived in the South while other regions were equally represented; 80.6% lived in rural areas; 63.7% did not receive any type 2 diabetes education. Patients in the South were least likely to receive education (67.5% did not). Logistic regression demonstrated that being black (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.84) and living in an urban area (OR = 1.40, 95% CI, 1.00-1.97) were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving diabetes education. By contrast, being 65 or older was associated with lower probability of receiving education (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40-0.87), as was lack of insurance (OR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.33-0.88)</p>

<sec id="section4-0145721713480002">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Being black independently increased likelihood of receiving diabetes education, but living in rural areas, being uninsured, and living in the South reduced chances one would receive this helpful information. Therefore, further research should examine benefits of leveraging technology such as telemedicine to improve delivery of diabetes education to those living in rural areas.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is widespread, with an estimated 25.6 million people diagnosed with the disease in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713480002">1</xref></sup> Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and lower limb amputations, and individuals with the disease suffer higher levels of depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713480002">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713480002">2</xref></sup> The course of type 2 diabetes is largely determined by lifestyle choices individuals make, such as medication adherence, diet, and exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713480002">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713480002"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713480002">5</xref></sup> As with most chronic diseases, care for patients with type 2 diabetes is best achieved by a multidisciplinary team.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713480002">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713480002">7</xref></sup> That is, in addition to direct medical care, behavior change experts and health educators can play important roles in treating any disease that is directly affected by lifestyle behaviors. Thus, enhancing one’s quality of self-management, especially for individuals with type 2 diabetes, will be central to positive outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713480002">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713480002"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713480002">10</xref></sup> For example, diabetes education not only improves outcomes and enhances glycemic control, but it is a cost-effective intervention that effectively promotes increased self-management behaviors and can also reduce the need for more costly medical treatments and other health services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713480002">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713480002">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, Lutfiyya et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713480002">12</xref></sup> note that almost half the adults living in the United States with type 2 diabetes indicate they have not received formal diabetes education. This is unfortunate as data support that adherence increases when education is provided, even via telephone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713480002">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713480002">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713480002"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713480002">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although research underscores the importance of diabetes education in self-management of diabetes, it appears that some of those at highest risk of the disease may be less likely to receive this information and training. Specifically, those in rural locations may face obstacles to receiving this information and may thus not acquire pertinent skills that are required for successful self-management of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713480002">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713480002">11</xref></sup> Moreover, individuals living in rural areas are also at higher risks for receiving less than adequate care and are typically older, live below poverty level, and are less likely to have a high school education, indicating they are likely to have low health literacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713480002">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713480002">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713480002"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713480002">18</xref></sup> Similarly, Kukafka and Yasnoff<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713480002">18</xref></sup> found that a lack of health literacy leads to the practice of unhealthy behaviors and contributes to more hospitalizations and overall poorer health among those living in rural regions. For instance, individuals living in rural areas have a 17% higher prevalence for type 2 diabetes than individuals living in urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713480002">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713480002">17</xref></sup> Additionally, cultural and race-based differences in type 2 diabetes prevalence have been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713480002">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713480002">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713480002">19</xref></sup> According to the American Diabetes Association, 12.6% non-Hispanic blacks have type 2 diabetes compared to 7.1% non- Hispanic whites in the United States, with the largest group of diagnosed individuals with diabetes residing in the Southern states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713480002">20</xref></sup> Aside from geographic location, other barriers may prevent individuals with type 2 diabetes from receiving important health education, such as education level, socioeconomic differences, health care provider availability, and lack of health insurance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721713480002">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713480002">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although data indicating the lack of diabetes education due to barriers are available, and although preliminary data show promise in improving knowledge and behaviors through education,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713480002">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713480002">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713480002"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721713480002">25</xref></sup> there is still limited information that specifically compares the differences in education provision in terms of risk factors for the disease, including age, urban/rural and racial differences, and educational differences. It may be the case that lack of education is in fact contributing to the potency of these risk factors, but no data exist to demonstrate that individuals with these risk factors are less likely to receive diabetes education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713480002">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713480002">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The objective of this study is to examine the differences in receipt of diabetes education according to risk factors that are associated with the disease, including race/ethnicity, region, and rural/urban location. We hypothesize that individuals of different races/ethnicities, individuals living in rural and urban areas, and those living in different regions will differ in likelihood of receipt of education.</p>

<title>Research Design and Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-0145721713480002">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>An analysis was performed using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721713480002">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721713480002">27</xref></sup> household consolidated file component. The MEPS is cosponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics. The MEPS sample is drawn from reporting units (individuals related by blood, marriage, adoption, or other family associations, interviewed at the same time residing in the same dwelling) in the previous year’s National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative sample (with oversampling for blacks and Hispanics) of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. The household component collects detailed information for each person in the household on demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, medical services utilization, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment.</p>
<p>The household component of the MEPS uses computer-assisted personal interviewing technology (CAPI) and overlapping panel design to collect 5 rounds of interviews over a 2½-year period. Over subsequent years, the rounds are used on a new sample size of households, creating overlapping panels of survey information. When combined, the data provide current and continuous estimates of health care expenditures.</p>
<p>Participation in the MEPS household component is voluntary. Respondents receive $25 for each of the 5 rounds of interviews completed and $5 for each self-administered or child questionnaire completed.</p>
<p>Response rate to the household component ranges from 65% to 71%, whereas conditional rounds for years 2 through 5 is always over 90%.</p>

<sec id="section7-0145721713480002">
<title>Demographic Variables</title>
<p>Age was categorized as less than 45 years, 45 to 64 years, and 65 years and older. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other. Marital status was categorized as married or not married. Education was categorized as less than high school graduate, high school graduate, or greater than high school graduate. Employment was categorized as employed or unemployed. Income was categorized as low, middle, and high. To determine where the sample was located, region was divided in Northeast, South, West, and Midwest. Health insurance was categorized as any private, public only, and uninsured. The variables related to education were categorized as: receipt of education as yes or no; type of delivery as no education, from phone call, from nurse, home visit, and from specialist; and mode of delivery as phone call, face to face, and did not receive education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721713480002">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Three types of analyses were conducted for this study. First, sample percentages were used to calculate each demographic variable. Second, chi-square statistics was applied to test the association between receiving diabetes education and demographic characteristics. Third, logistic regression models were used to assess the independent associations between receipt of diabetes education, race/ethnicity, and geographic classification (metropolitan statistical area), adjusting for demographic characteristics. Logistic regression converts raw values into probability scores, allowing one to interpret associations and odd risk ratios among categorical level variables (e.g., male vs female). Whereas a simple chi-square allows one to determine risk ratios between one variable and one other variable, logistic regression allows one to determine how several variables contribute to the risk ratio of a single variable. Moreover, logistic regression illustrates the unique risk accounted for by each variable model, controlling for every other variable in the model. The model refers to the set of risk variables selected and their order of entry. Thus, one can control for demographic variables (gender, socioeconomic class) at the first stage of the model and then enter the variable of unique interest at the second stage where the variance accounted for by the demographic factors will already be controlled. The risk ratio demonstrates strength of association, and a risk ratio of 1.55 indicates an increased risk of 55%, for example, whereas a risk ratio of 2.00 would indicate a 100% increased risk and a risk ratio of −1.20 would indicate a reduced risk of 20%. All analyses were performed with STATA V10 and a 2-tailed alpha of .05 was used to assess for significance.</p>

<p>Demographic characteristics for this sample of 1747 adults with type 2 diabetes are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713480002">Table 1</xref>. Of the sample, 65.6% were non-Hispanic whites, 15% non-Hispanic blacks, and 19.4% other race or ethnicity. The proportion of men and women was almost similar (49.3% and 50.6%, respectively); 46.9% were between 45 and 64 years old, 40.0% older than 65 years old; 59.4% married; 39.8% had education after high school, and 35.2% completed high school. For income, 34.1% were from low-income households, 35.1% middle income, and 30.8% high income. As for region, 39.5% lived in the South, and the remainder was evenly distributed throughout the Northeast, West, and Midwest (18.5%, 20.7%, and 21.2%, respectively). The majority of this sample (80.6%) lived in rural areas compared with 19.4% living in urban areas. Finally, 93.2% received usual health care; 62.3% had private insurance, 30.6% had public insurance, and almost 7% were not insured.</p>

<p>Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721713480002">Table 3</xref> show the pattern of receipt of diabetes education by demographics. In all, 42.5% of non-Hispanic blacks received education, compared to 34.8% of non-Hispanic whites and 36.0% of other race/ethnicities. People younger than 45 years old tended to receive slightly more diabetes education (41.8%) than those 45 to 64 years old (38.5%) or older than 65 years (31.6%). In addition, 38% of married people received education compared with not married (33.5%) as well as people who have more than a high school diploma (39.4%). High-income (38.2%) and middle-income (37.3%) respondents tend to receive more diabetes education than low-income individuals (33.1%). When looking at urban and rural differences, 37.9% of patients living in urban areas received education compared with only 28.9% in rural areas. The South is the region least to receive education, with 32.5%, and most of the education is received through the usual source of care (36.3%). Finally, 38.1% of people with private health insurance tend to receive education compared with those with governmental insurance (34.7%), and less likely to receive education are those who are uninsured (25.2%).</p>

<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145721713480002">Table 4</xref> presents the adjusted logistic regression analysis. Being African American increased the likelihood of receiving diabetes education 38% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.84), a finding confirmed in the adjusted model 2 by demographics, usual source of care, and insurance (OR = 1.49, 95% CI, 1.07-2.05); adjusted model 4 by demographics, usual source of care, insurance, and region (OR = 1.55, 95% CI, 1.11-2.16); and adjusted model 5 by demographics, usual source of care, insurance, and metropolitan statistical area (OR = 1.42, 95% CI, 1.02-1.98). By contrast, being 65 or older was associated with lower probability of receiving education in models 2 by demographics, usual source of care, and insurance (OR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.40-0.87); 4 by demographics, usual source of care, insurance, and region (OR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.41-0.90); and 5 by demographics, usual source of care, insurance, and metropolitan statistical area (OR = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.39-0.87). Similarly, being uninsured reduced the odds one would receive any education according to models 2 by demographics, usual source of care, and insurance (OR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.33-0.88); 4 (OR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.33-0.89); and 5 by demographics, usual source of care, insurance, and metropolitan statistical area (OR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.34-0.89). There was also an increased association between diabetes education and living in an urban area (OR = 1.40, 95% CI, 1.00-1.97).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined the likelihood of receiving diabetes education with respect to one’s race or rurality of one’s residence, among other demographic factors. As hypothesized, significant differences were found among urban/rural and race with respect to receipt of diabetes education. Although a majority of the sample reported they had not received any diabetes education, data in this study clearly indicate that diabetes education is most frequently given to non-Hispanic blacks residing in urban areas. Furthermore, compared to rural populations, urban non-Hispanic blacks who received diabetes education were younger, married, achieved education beyond high school, and were in the middle- to high-income bracket. Additionally, this study showed that the Southern region offered the least frequent diabetes education and patients only received usual source of care. Lastly, the findings showed that individuals with no insurance were less likely to receive diabetes education than those with private or even governmental insurance.</p>
<p>The findings of this study are significant and reveal important information regarding the lack of diabetes education among rural minority populations, especially those residing in the South. Interestingly, this study shows a distinct gap in existing knowledge and reveals a need to focus on offering education to rural minority populations.</p>
<p>Although the importance of diabetes education is well documented in improving outcomes, increasing self-management behaviors, and achieving glycemic control, most efforts have been directed to minority groups living in urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713480002">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713480002">11</xref></sup> While the research focus on minority populations, who are at higher risk, is a positive development, research examining the differences in mode of delivery among rural and nonrural populations is relatively sparse. This study provides initial support for the potential that at least part of the poor treatment response and increased diabetes in rural populations may be due to their lower likelihood of receiving diabetes education.</p>
<p>Data from this study revealed that region and race/ethnicity play an important part in determining whether one will receive diabetes education. Specifically, this analysis demonstrated that rural populations, which present with the highest diabetes prevalence, are less likely to receive any disease education. This underscores a critical concern, as previous research showed that educational interventions, even if delivered via telephone, may improve health outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes by improving self-management practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713480002">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713480002">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713480002"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713480002">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713480002">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713480002">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721713480002">28</xref></sup> This study also demonstrated that education was disproportionately offered across rates in race, income, educational attainment, and lack of insurance. It is crucial that clinicians develop educational interventions tailored to meet the needs of these groups as well.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of this study. First, these data do not provide age of diagnosis, nor do they reveal when diabetes education occurred among the patients who received education. Moreover, it is possible that patients may have moved to different geographic regions between diagnosis and study assessment. Additionally, the content and quality of diabetes education was unknown, and core parameters, for example, whether they received follow-up sessions, were unspecified. Third, this investigation does not consider whether diabetes education was provided while the patients were enrolled in an intervention or other study, which may have affected the results.</p>
<p>Significant differences were found when comparing urban/rural and race in the receipt of diabetes education. Urban non-Hispanic blacks were more likely to receive diabetes education compared to their rural counterparts. Studies show that the South has the highest rates of diabetes compared to other regions of the United States and is limited to usual source of care. Finally, patients that have some form of health insurance, such as governmental or private, were more likely to receive diabetes education. With all of this in mind, it is critical to create appropriate educational interventions to improve outcomes for the rural populations living with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, further research should examine benefits of leveraging technology such as telemedicine to improve delivery of diabetes education to those living in rural areas who are confronted with barriers to access of care.</p>
