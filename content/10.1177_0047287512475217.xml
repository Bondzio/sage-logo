<abstract>
<p>Recent press reports and complaints by hoteliers have called into question the credibility of travel-related user-generated content (UGC). Yet our understanding of the role of credibility perceptions in the context of UGC is limited, notwithstanding the rising interest in social media. Using an online survey of 661 travel consumers, this study applies the component-based structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares to examine online travelers’ perceptions of the credibility of UGC sources and how these perceptions influence attitudes and intentions toward UGC utilization in the travel planning process. The model also draws on the theory of homophily to make predictions about the antecedent of credibility. Results validate the Source Credibility Theory in the context of UGC but also accentuate the central mediating role of attitude. In addition, the study finds support for perceptual homophily as a critical determinant of both credibility and attitude. Theoretical and managerial implications are highlighted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The past decade has witnessed remarkable interest in the application of social media to the hospitality and tourism domain. Much of this interest has arisen from the emergence of Web 2.0, which has resulted in numerous user-generated content (UGC) websites such as social networking, online travel communities, and review sites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287512475217">Gupta and Kim (2004)</xref> described such websites as “coffee shops” where people are able to “find and then electronically ‘talk’ to others with similar interests” (p. 2679). Here, people “meet and discuss on forums and bulletin forms or exchange information on social networking sites” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475217">Chung and Buhalis 2008</xref>, p. 1). UGC has become a major source of information for travel consumers. Studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512475217">Fotis, Buhalis, and Rossides (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512475217">Cox et al. (2009)</xref>, among others, demonstrate that individuals are increasingly utilizing information from UGC websites to make travel-related decisions and to shape perceptions and images about destinations and travel offerings. In response, many hospitality and tourism businesses have been integrating UGC websites into their online business strategies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the character of UGC prompts several concerns, some of which are rooted in the subjective nature of online travel opinions and the tricky task of evaluating the opinions of complete strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512475217">Dellarocas 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512475217">Litvin, Goldsmith, and Pan 2008</xref>). This is further heightened by several recent media reports where credibility of user-generated content has been brought into question. Perhaps, the most high-profiled example concerns TripAdvisor—the largest travel-related UGC site—with allegations that it contains nearly 27,000 legally defamatory reviews (<italic>The Times</italic> 2011, July 16). Also, TripAdvisor was recently ordered by UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to rewrite its “trust” claims amid complaints by some hotels. ASA further warned TripAdvisor and user-generated review sites in general not to claim or imply that all their reviews are honest and trustworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287512475217">BBC 2012</xref>, February 1; 09:59 GMT). Following this ruling, TripAdvisor has removed all references to the term “trust” from its UK homepage (i.e., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tripadvisor.co.uk">tripadvisor.co.uk</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Though the issue of deceptive postings is currently being addressed by TripAdvisor and other UGC platform providers, credibility perceptions in the context of travel-related UGC still merit increased scholarly attention. While numerous studies have examined user-generated sites in recent times (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287512475217">Cox et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512475217">Casaló, Flavián, and Guinalíu 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287512475217">Bronner and de Hoog 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287512475217">Fotis, Buhalis, and Rossides 2012</xref>), the credibility of UGC has seldom been a matter of prime interest, particularly in hospitality and tourism research. Few studies have however examined the credibility of expert recommender systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0047287512475217">Yoo and Gretzel 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512475217">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0047287512475217">2011</xref>), ambivalent online reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512475217">Xie et al. 2011</xref>), and the impact of online travel reviews on credibility of hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287512475217">Sparks and Browning 2011</xref>). Thus, despite the rising interest in social media, our understanding of the role of credibility in the usage process is limited. Using the component-based structural equation modeling approach of partial least squares (PLS-SEM), this study examines travel consumers’ perceptions regarding the credibility of UGC sources and how such perceptions may influence attitudes and intentions toward UGC utilization for travel planning. The article is structured as follows. First, we provide a review of theoretical perspectives that are relevant for a proper understanding of the study’s context. The next section presents the research model and the proposed hypotheses. The methods applied in this study are explicated in the subsequent section before presenting the results. We then discuss the results and the implications for theory and practice.</p>

<title>Travel Planning and UGC</title>
<p>In view of the opportunities offered by emerging web technologies, travelers’ behavior vis-à-vis information search and travel planning is changing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287512475217">Werthner and Ricci (2004)</xref> noted that “a new type of user is emerging, one who acts as his or her own travel agent and builds a personalized travel package” (p. 101). Travelers are becoming more independent, searching for their own information and making their own decisions about destinations and services with less or no involvement of travel intermediaries. In the past, such travelers often relied on the websites of service providers, destination marketers, and intermediaries for travel information. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475217">Chung and Buhalis (2008</xref>, p. 72), the “type and relative importance of information sources have changed over time.” They explain that the proliferation of information available on the Internet from a glut of various providers has heightened concerns about credibility. Earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287512475217">Senecal and Nantel (2004)</xref> had suggested that many consumers are cynical about any form of information that apparently promote the interest of the creator of that information and, thus, may prefer to rely on fellow consumers to obtain their evaluations about services and products. As a result, a rising number of travelers are resorting to UGC websites for travel-related content that has been posted by travel consumers rather than by service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287512475217">Gretzel, Yoo, and Purifoy 2007</xref>). Also, a number of scholars conjecture that since noncommercial information is perceived to be more objective and credible, consumers tend to regard information from their peers as more trustworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512475217">Litvin, Goldsmith, and Pan 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287512475217">Chung and Buhalis 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Credibility Concerns about UGC</title>
<p>Yet the very nature of UGC prompts several concerns that relate to credibility. Some of these concerns are seated in the subjective nature of the views of UGC contributors. Readers of user-generated reviews, for instance, are confronted with the tricky task of evaluating the opinions of complete strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512475217">Dellarocas 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287512475217">Park, Lee, and Han 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512475217">Litvin, Goldsmith, and Pan 2008</xref>). In online settings, most of the cues that assist in the proper interpretation of opinions (such as acquaintance with the person providing the information; inferences from the person’s facial expression, mode of dressing, etc.) are lacking. Another concern with UGC websites is that they include contributions from a blend of amateur, semiprofessional, and professional people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287512475217">Burgess et al. 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the ease with which online identities can be changed makes UGC vulnerable to various forms of strategic manipulation and abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512475217">Dellarocas 2003</xref>), and thus poses additional challenges to the interpretation of this type of content. For instance, travel operators—posing as independent reviewers—can use fake online identities and post dishonest comments and reviews and, as a result, promote their reputation or tarnish that of competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512475217">Ibrahim 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512475217">Litvin, Goldsmith, and Pan 2008</xref>). Earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512475217">Preece (2000)</xref> has pointed out that online communities means different things to different people. For some, they conjure warm, fuzzy, reassuring images of people chatting and helping each other. For others, they generate dark images of conspiracy, subversive and criminal behavior, and invasion of privacy. Recent media reports about some criminal acts (such as kidnapping, fraud, child rape, etc.) perpetuated through popular UGC websites like Facebook and MySpace gives credence to the latter assertion. Other press reports about some managers paying webmasters of UGC sites to delete consumers’ negative comments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287512475217"><italic>China Daily</italic> 2010</xref>, June 17; p. 1) draw credibility concerns. A report by Travolution further reveals that hoteliers are being contacted by dubious organizations offering to write positive reviews of their hotels on high-profile sites like TripAdvisor for a monthly fee. The report further illustrates this with one hotel that had managed to get some glowing reviews posted online before it had even begun operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287512475217">Fox 2010</xref>). Lastly, the mediated nature of UGC websites raises concern about the trustworthiness of their operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512475217">Gretzel 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Source Credibility</title>
<p>Credibility can simply be defined as <italic>believability</italic> of some information and/or its source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475217">Hovland, Janis, and Kelley 1953</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512475217">O’Keefe (2002)</xref> describes credibility as judgments made by perceivers regarding the believability of communicators. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512475217">Tseng and Fogg (1999)</xref> further explain that credible people are believable people and credible information is believable. A review of extant literature shows that the concept has been applied in different contexts to different entities including human, media, technology, and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512475217">Metzger et al. 2003</xref>). In addition, several dimensions of source credibility have been proposed (e.g., dynamism, attractiveness, authoritativeness, character). While many of these dimensions have been contested, there seems to be a general agreement on the dimensions of trustworthiness and expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287512475217">Tseng and Fogg 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287512475217">O’Keefe 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512475217">Pornpitakpan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512475217">Yoo and Gretzel 2008</xref>). These two dimensions also appear to be the most relevant to the particular context of UGC. Thus, in this study, we conceptualize credibility as a two-dimensional construct, with expertise and trustworthiness as distinct dimensions. Trustworthiness describes the degree of confidence in the source’s “intent to communicate the assertions” they consider “most valid [true]” whereas expertise refers to the extent to which UGC contributors are perceived to be “a source of valid assertions [truth]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475217">Hovland, Janis, and Kelley 1953</xref>, p. 21). In a recent review of literature on source characteristics in the context of human–human, human–computer, and human–recommender system interactions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0047287512475217">Yoo and Gretzel (2011)</xref> found that many cues that have been identified as influential in other contexts are yet to tested with regards to recommender systems. Research findings in communication studies suggest that people are less likely to give attention to any media that they judge as not credible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512475217">Metzger et al. 2003</xref>). Hence, credibility is critical if UGC websites are to compete with other information sources, particularly those from service providers. Credibility is even more important in the travel planning context because of the intangible nature of tourism products (which offers very limited physical cues for evaluation before purchase) and the economic and psychological risks associated with travel decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287512475217">Loda, Teichmann, and Zins 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The particular context of UGC presents some challenges for credibility perceptions. On one hand, travelers may consider UGC to be credible because it originates from other travelers who are regarded as having no commercial interest. A study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287512475217">Park, Lee, and Han (2007)</xref>, for example, suggests that user-generated reviews are believed to be more credible than information provided by suppliers of products and services. A more recent study performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287512475217">Dickinger (2011)</xref> that compared the trustworthiness of three different online channels reports that UGC appears to be highly trustworthy. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of UGC raises credibility concerns. As noted in previous discussions, concerns pertaining to the vulnerability of UGC to strategic manipulation and abuse by some service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287512475217">Ibrahim 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287512475217">Litvin, Goldsmith, and Pan 2008</xref>) and uncertainties about the trustworthiness of the website operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287512475217">Dellarocas 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287512475217">Gretzel 2006</xref>) are among several issues that raise credibility questions about UGC.</p>
<p>Often, travelers consult UGC sites with a decision task in hand such as choosing accommodation, selecting a destination, and/or leisure activities. Ultimately, the degree of credibility allotted by travelers to the sources of UGC will determine how influential UGC would be in their travel plans. The relationship between source credibility and attitude has been validated by researchers in marketing contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475217">Hovland, Janis, and Kelley’s (1953)</xref> seminal report demonstrated the positive influence of expertise and trustworthiness on attitude by revealing findings from a number of previous studies. More recently, several empirical studies from varied contexts have also established the importance of the source expertise and trustworthiness factors in determining attitudes and information acceptance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287512475217">Sussman and Siegal 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512475217">Pornpitakpan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512475217">Cheung, Lee, and Rabjohn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512475217">Jin et al. 2009</xref>). A study carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512475217">Ohanian (1991)</xref> demonstrates that perceived expertise and trustworthiness positively influence attitude change in the context of celebrity endorsement advertising. In online contexts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512475217">Jin et al. (2009)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287512475217">Sussman and Siegal (2003)</xref> found positive relationships between source credibility and information usefulness. Consumer research studies further provide empirical support for a direct relationship between source credibility factors and intention to purchase (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512475217">Ohanian 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287512475217">Cronin and Taylor 1992</xref>). In the particular context of travel information search, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512475217">Kerstetter and Cho (2004)</xref> found source credibility to be the strongest predictor of the type of information source used. Although the extent to which these findings apply to new and emerging Web 2.0 platforms is unclear, there is a reason to believe that online travel consumers’ credibility perceptions will have a positive effect on their attitudes and intentions toward UGC utilization for travel planning, and hence the hypotheses:</p>

<sec id="section7-0047287512475217">
<title>Perceptual Homophily</title>
<p>Homophily is defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287512475217">Rogers (1983)</xref> as the extent to which individuals are similar in terms of certain attributes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512475217">Brown, Roderick, and Lee (2007)</xref>, however, observed that recent conceptualizations of homophily in the online environment refers more predominantly to shared interest and shared mindset. Research on homophily has suggested that people tend to interact with similar others, an observation termed as “like-me” principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512475217">Laumann 1966</xref>). Given the subjective nature of online opinions, the proposed model integrates <italic>perceptual homophily</italic>, also known as “perceptual affinity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512475217">Gilly et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Perceptual homophily concerns the similarities among people regarding their likes, dislikes, values, and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287512475217">Bruyn and de Lilien 2008</xref>). People often regard others who are similar to them as credible sources. In online settings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287512475217">Wang et al. (2008)</xref> found that the perception of homophily regarding people in an online support group wields influence on credibility perceptions. Earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287512475217">Wright (2000)</xref> had reported that perceptions of similarity among online support group users may be correlated with source credibility. Prior research in other contexts have also found credibility perceptions to be influenced by other aspects of homophily such as gender similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287512475217">Pearson 1982</xref>) and language intensity similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287512475217">Aune and Kikuchi 1993</xref>), among others. For individuals seeking information to make travel decisions, it can also be assumed that the more UGC contributors are perceived to be similar in terms of worldview, mindset, and travel behavior, the more likely the information seeker would accept UGC for travel planning. In the context of UGC utilization for travel planning, this perception can be viewed from at least two perspectives.</p>
<p>On one hand, travelers may consider their viewpoint to be similar to that of UGC contributors, compared to other sources of travel information. This is because UGC originates from travelers who have experienced the product or destination in question. Their opinions are therefore from the consumers’ perspective; hence, the prospective traveler might consider that as more credible. On the other hand, prospective travelers may perceive the travelers posting UGC to be completely different from them and therefore regard their opinions and advice as irrelevant to their travel situation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287512475217">Williams et al. (2010)</xref> noted, “one reviewer’s boisterous students on spring break enjoying themselves could be another’s dangerously drunk rowdies” (p. 125). Similarly, one person’s idea of “value for money” or “a good hotel room” might be different from another person’s. In view of this, individuals’ perceptual homophily with the travelers who post UGC is likely to influence credibility perceptions and attitude toward UGC use for travel planning, and thus the hypotheses:</p>

<p>In several studies, attitude has been regarded as a central mediator of behavior and an antecedent of behavioral intention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512475217">Ajzen and Fishbein 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512475217">Ajzen 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287512475217">Wang and Ritchie 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0047287512475217">Zhang and Lei 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287512475217">Eagly and Chaiken (1993)</xref> described attitude as a tendency to evaluate an entity with some degree of favor or disfavor, ordinarily expressed in cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses. Attitude has also been defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287512475217">Ajzen (1989)</xref> as an individual’s “disposition to respond favorably or unfavorably to an object, person, institution, or event” (p. 241). The attitude construct in our study is used in reference to the use of UGC for travel planning. Attitude toward a website has been found to be influential in online consumer behavior settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287512475217">Castañeda, Frías, and Rodríguez 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512475217">Casaló, Flavián, and Guinalíu 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287512475217">Casaló, Flavián, and Guinalíu (2010)</xref>, for instance, found attitude to be a significant determinant of the intention to participate in firm-hosted online travel communities. We therefore hypothesize the following:</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Previous studies suggest that credibility dimensions and measurements may vary based on the type of source(s) being evaluated and the context in which such evaluation transpires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512475217">Metzger et al. 2003</xref>). Metzger and colleagues consider the multiplicity of scales to measure source credibility as emerging from disagreements over the relative importance of various dimensions, which mirrors the priority of each researcher. This study adopts the most common approach in the literature by measuring credibility with the factors of expertise and trustworthiness. The scales for perceived trustworthiness and expertise were adapted from studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287512475217">Ohanian (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287512475217">1991</xref>), which established their reliability and validity. Perceptual homophily was measured based on an adaptation of the scale by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287512475217">Gilly et al. (1998)</xref>. The attitude scale was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287512475217">Moon and Kim (2001)</xref> whereas new measures of behavioral intention were developed based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512475217">Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1989)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287512475217">Gefen, Straub, and Boudreau (2000)</xref>, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287512475217">Venkatesh et al. (2003)</xref>. A seven-point Likert-type scale was used for the measurement of behavioral intention (1 = strongly disagree; 7 = strongly agree) and perceptual homophily (1 = not at all similar; 7 = extremely similar). The items of the remaining constructs were measured with seven-point semantic differential scales. To assess content validity, we asked 10 academic experts to rate the appropriateness of each item and suggest alternatives where necessary. To make the final selection of measurement items, we relied on a pretest with a sample of 201 online travel consumers in August 2011, prior to the main survey. Principal components analysis (PCA) was further used to validate the measurement items.</p>

<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Data were collected using a Web-based survey. The use of such a uniform data collection method helps to minimize social desirability bias and controls for response styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287512475217">de Leeuw 2008</xref>). Besides, online surveys have been applied successfully in recent hospitality and tourism research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287512475217">Hung and Law 2011</xref> for a review). We conducted an online survey from September 9 to 20, 2011, through Toluna, Inc. The survey targeted the general online population of Singapore that travels for leisure and plans travel online. To qualify for participation in the study, respondents were required to (1) have taken, at least, one leisure trip in the last 12 months preceding the survey and (2) have used the Internet to search for travel information. To ensure that respondents clearly understand the phenomenon under study, they were directed to the user-generated reviews of hotels on TripAdvisor. Respondents were then required to familiarize themselves with the content and respond to the survey accordingly. The TripAdvisor-branded sites make up the world’s largest travel community, in excess of 65 million unique monthly visitors, and more than 60 million reviews and opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287512475217">TripAdvisor, Inc. 2012</xref>). Responses were screened for data quality. Out of a total of 1,034 responses, 338 were screened out because the respondents did not meet the sample criteria. Of the 696 qualified responses, an extra 35 was discarded for various reasons such as missing cases and outliers. This resulted in a usable sample of 661 cases.</p>

<sec id="section12-0047287512475217">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Prior to estimating the structural model, a PCA with oblique rotation was conducted to test for potential measurement problems. The result of the PCA supports the scales’ unidimensionality and reliability. The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy verified the sampling adequacy for the analysis; KMO equals 0.959, which is far above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287512475217">Kaiser’s (1974)</xref> minimum threshold of 0.5. The communalities after extraction were all greater than the 0.60 threshold of average community required by Kaiser’s criterion. Bartlett’s test of sphericity χ<sup>2</sup>(300) = 17337.151, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, indicating that correlations between items were sufficiently large for PCA. The PCA generated theoretically meaningful components as each item loaded precisely on its proposed latent construct without any cross-loadings. All the factor loadings were satisfactory, reporting absolute values that range from 0.704 to 0.936 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0047287512475217">Appendix A</xref>).</p>
<p>For the estimation of the model with the empirical data, the partial least squares (PLS) path modeling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287512475217">Wold 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512475217">Hair et al. 2012</xref>) was applied using the SmartPLS 2.0 (Beta) M3 software application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287512475217">Ringle, Wende, and Will 2005</xref>). PLS, which is a component-based SEM technique, was chosen over the more common covariance-based SEM techniques such as maximum likelihood because of its robustness with fewer identification issues and thus avoiding estimation problems and nonconvergent results. Also, PLS is the most suitable SEM technique for prediction-oriented research and research that is exploratory or involving the extension of existing structural theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512475217">Henseler, Ringle, and Sinkovics 2009</xref>). Among others, PLS has the advantage of not holding the distributional assumption of normality, making less demand on measurement scales, able to work with much smaller as well as much larger samples, and readily integrating formative as well as reflective constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512475217">Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512475217">Hair et al. 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>Detailed descriptive statistics relating to the respondents’ characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287512475217">Table 1</xref>. Out of a total of 661 respondents, 53.1% were females, with males constituting 46.9%. Respondents varied widely in terms of age with the greater part in their thirties (32.5%), twenties (25.4%), and forties (24.5). About half of the respondents had earned a bachelor’s or higher degree. Though all the respondents had embarked on a leisure trip in the last 12 months preceding the survey, approximately 89% of them were certain of taking another trip in the subsequent year. In addition, respondents were typically regular Internet users who either use the Internet several times each day (82.3%) or once daily (12.0%). Since the interest of this study is in construct associations and not descriptive insights, we refrain from weighting the sample elements.</p>

<title>Measurement Analysis</title>
<p>PLS path model analysis shows that all measures meet the commonly suggested criteria for measurement model assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287512475217">Chin 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287512475217">Henseler, Ringle, and Sinkovics 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287512475217">Hair et al. 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0047287512475217">Appendix B</xref>).

<p>Discriminant validity was then assessed using two approaches.

Second, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287512475217">Fornell and Larcker (1981)</xref> criterion was applied by testing whether the square root of each construct’s AVE is greater than its correlation with each of the remaining constructs.

Hypothesis 1-1, which assumes a direct positive relationship between trustworthiness and attitude, received strong support (β = 0.422, <italic>t</italic> = 9.214, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Though hypothesis 1-2, which proposes a direct relationship between trustworthiness and behavioral intention (β = 0.126, <italic>t</italic> = 2.799, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was significant, the effect was weak. On the other hand, expertise has a strong positive direct effect on attitude (β = 0.218, <italic>t</italic> = 4.874, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), but its direct impact on behavioral intention was not supported (<italic>β</italic> = 0.037, <italic>t</italic> = 0.883, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Perceptual homophily has very strong direct relationships with both trustworthiness (γ = 0.455, <italic>t</italic> = 13.446, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and expertise (γ = 0.473, <italic>t</italic> = 14.228, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and is also found to be directly related to attitude (γ = 0.138, <italic>t</italic> = 3.748, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), hereby supporting hypotheses 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3. Similar to previous studies on attitude, hypothesis 4 positing a direct effect of attitude on behavioral intention received strong support (β = 0.649, <italic>t</italic> = 17.746, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The Sobel Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287512475217">Sobel 1982</xref>) verified the significance of the indirect effect of expertise on intention via attitude (coefficient = 0.141, <italic>z</italic> = 4.761, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study applies the component-based structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares to examine online travelers’ perceptions of source credibility in the context of UGC and how these perceptions affect attitudes and intentions toward the utilization of UGC for travel planning. As hypothesized, the study found significant support for the impact of source credibility perceptions on attitude toward using UGC. This would imply that online travelers are more favorably disposed toward the use of UGC for travel planning if they believe that UGC is from credible travelers. This finding is consistent with the results of earlier studies on the relationship between source credibility and disposition toward information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512475217">Lafferty and Goldsmith 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512475217">Kerstetter and Cho 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287512475217">Cheung, Lee, and Rabjohn 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287512475217">Jin et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Credibility is regarded as a fundamental cue in the decision-making process that impacts not only individuals’ overall attitude but also their behavioral intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287512475217">Manfredo and Bright 1991</xref>). Researchers argue that a highly credible source stimulates and aids the activation of more favorable behavioral intentions toward a message, product, or service, while the opposite inhibits any such influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512475217">Lafferty and Goldsmith 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512475217">Metzger et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287512475217">Kerstetter and Cho 2004</xref>). A study carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512475217">Xie et al. (2011)</xref>, for instance, found perceived source credibility of online reviews to have a significant effect on participants’ intention to book a hotel. Our study, however, yielded mixed results regarding a direct relationship between credibility factors and online travelers’ intention to use UGC for travel planning. The direct effect of source expertise on behavioral intention was not supported while trustworthiness only had a weak effect on behavioral intention. This result highlights the central mediating role of attitude. While attitude fully mediates the relationship between expertise and intention, it partially mediates the link between trustworthiness and intention.</p>
<p>The results may also imply that even as credibility perceptions are very critical in determining online travel consumers’ attitude toward using UGC, perhaps there are other factors that travelers consider to be much more crucial when deciding to use UGC for travel planning. Given that UGC sites represent information system (IS) application, IS theories such as the Technology Acceptance Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287512475217">Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw 1989</xref>) or the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287512475217">Venkatesh et al. 2003</xref>) could shed further light on other potential determinants of usage intention. For instance, studies that have examined information system adoption have generally found that constructs other than attitude are significantly linked to usage intentions, although the specific set of significant predictors varies among studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0047287512475217">Sussman and Siegal 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287512475217">Venkatesh et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The results also suggest that trustworthiness and expertise dimensions of source credibility have differential importance in affecting attitude and behavioral intention. Our study found trustworthiness to be more influential. This mirrors previous research on source credibility in other contexts. Findings of a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512475217">Pornpitakpan (2004)</xref> show that trustworthiness is more impactful than is expertise. An earlier study performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287512475217">McGinnies and Ward (1980)</xref> had also reported that a trustworthy communicator is more influential than an untrustworthy one, regardless of his or her expertise. Furthermore, of the three predictors of attitude proposed in this study, trustworthiness wielded the strongest impact. This implies that trustworthiness lies at the heart of travel consumers’ attitudes toward user-generated content; and hence in cases where it is perceived to be compromised, the potential impact could be very severe.</p>
<p>Perceptual homophily proved to be crucial in determining credibility perceptions as well as attitudes toward UGC. This confirms the validity of the “like-me” principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287512475217">Laumann 1966</xref>) in our study’s context. This could be a major driving force behind the rising importance of user-generated websites. Earlier, research on online communities from the general IS and social psychology literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287512475217">Preece 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287512475217">Brown, Roderick, and Lee 2007</xref>) have suggested that people go online to find “similar others” to interact with. This same concept can be transferred to travelers’ search for online information. Online travelers tend to look for “similar others” for travel advice, and user-generated platforms make this possible. Perhaps this explains the reason why some UGC sites highlight on their homepages, statements such as “where travelers like you store their free travel blogs” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Traveloblog.com">Traveloblog.com</ext-link>), “reviews from . . . cruisers like you!” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="Cruisereviews.com">Cruisereviews.com</ext-link>), and “the perfect trip, network with like-minded travelers from across the globe” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="iloho.com">iloho.com</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>As online travelers seek information from various social media platforms, credibility has become a major concern in the current Web 2.0 environment. This paper demonstrates the relevance of the source credibility model and the theory of homophily in understanding online travelers’ attitudes and intentions toward the use of UGC in the travel planning context. First, this study conceptualizes source credibility as a construct with two distinct dimensions (trustworthiness and expertise). Second, the study shows source credibility to have a strong influence on attitude but weak direct effect on behavioral intention. Third, the study explains 58% of the variance in intention to use UGC for travel planning, thus capturing the majority of the variance in behavioral intention. Fourth, it offers support for the role of perceptual homophily in driving credibility perceptions and attitudes. Also, the results suggest that credibility dimensions wield differential weights. Finally, the structural model underscores the central mediating role of attitude. In sum, the model allows us to examine source credibility in the context of UGC and how these perceptions determine travelers’ attitudes and intentions toward UGC utilization for travel planning. The results of the Stone–Geisser’s <italic>Q</italic><sup>2</sup> Test offer strong evidence for the model’s predictive validity. The examined model adequately predicts each endogenous latent construct’s indicators. Findings hold key implications for theory and practice.</p>
<sec id="section20-0047287512475217">
<title>Implications for Theory</title>
<p>While credibility has become a major problem for social media platforms and despite the fact that concept source credibility was introduced over half a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287512475217">Hovland, Janis, and Kelley 1953</xref>), the concept relatively has not been given sufficient attention in online travel contexts, particularly in the present Web 2.0 environment. Earlier, credibility studies in the general literature have, for the most part, focused on traditional media sources and in contexts largely unrelated to travel. Our study’s first contribution is to help address this gap in the literature by testing source credibility in the context of UGC utilization for travel planning. The dimensions of source credibility stress the distinction between UGC contributors’ <italic>potential of truth</italic> (“know the truth,” i.e., expertise) and <italic>inclination toward truth</italic> (“will tell the truth,” i.e., trustworthiness) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512475217">Eisend 2006</xref>, p. 23). The results from the PCA, and the PLS discriminant validity analysis as well as the structural model offer strong support for the distinctiveness of these factors.</p>
<p>Attitude toward using UGC had the strongest impact on behavioral intention. Our results are not unique in this regard. Other studies that have examined the relationship between attitude and intention in various contexts have generally found attitude to be a strong predictor of behavioral intention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287512475217">Ajzen and Fishbein 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287512475217">Wang and Ritchie 2012</xref>). What is most crucial here, however, is recognizing the factors that determine travelers’ attitudes in the study’s context. In this regard, our study contributes to the existing theory by verifying the role of perceptual homophily and credibility factors in predicting travelers’ attitudes toward the use of UGC for trip planning.</p>
<p>Also, this study has implications for the antecedents of source credibility online. While the emerging literature on source credibility has often focused on source credibility as a predictor, relatively less attention has been given to its antecedents. This study finds support for perceptual homophily as a critical determinant of source credibility in online contexts. Nonetheless, further efforts are needed to identify the other determinants of credibility in the online travel domain.</p>
<p>Lastly, our study differs from previous research in terms of design. Prior studies largely examined credibility with controlled experiments and/or student samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287512475217">Lafferty and Goldsmith 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287512475217">Eisend 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0047287512475217">Yoo and Gretzel 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512475217">Xie et al. 2011</xref>). For instance, a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512475217">Xie et al. (2011)</xref> used a controlled experiment to test perceived credibility with a convenience sample of 274 undergraduate students. In addition, some prior research measured perceived credibility with only one or two items (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512475217">Xie et al. 2011</xref>). While these approaches still offer valuable insights into credibility perceptions, they raise questions about sample representativeness, generalizability, and measurement reliability. Our study contributes to existing research by examining credibility in UGC context with a sample of real online travel consumers from diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, our study ensures measurement reliability by using several multiple items to measure each of the two distinct dimensions of credibility. Thus, a major contribution of this study is the validation of a revised instrument that facilitates the measurement of source credibility and perceptual homophily in the particular context of travel-related UGC.</p>
<p>Another important aspect that distinguishes this study from previous research on credibility is the use of an alternative approach—structural equation modeling technique of partial least squares—to examine the hypothesized theoretical relationships. Also, in the hospitality and tourism field, researchers applying structural equation modeling have generally relied on covariance-based techniques such as maximum likelihood. Yet the more recent component-based technique of partial least squares offers several advantages that could address the misuse and abuse of covariance-based alternatives by researchers. PLS–SEM is a promising method of data analysis that offers enormous potential for SEM researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287512475217">Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Some managerial implications can be drawn from this study. By understanding online travelers’ credibility perceptions in this study’s context, we can design platforms that support effective UGC utilization for travel planning. The strong influence of attitude on behavioral intention, for instance, suggests that UGC platform managers and hospitality and tourism practitioners cannot ignore factors such as credibility and perceptual homophily that determine individuals’ attitude toward UGC.</p>
<p>The study results demonstrate that a notion of homophily among online travel consumers can improve credibility perceptions, which in turn would encourage UGC usage in the travel planning context. It is therefore imperative for user-generated websites’ management to highlight cues that give online travelers a sense of similarity with those who contribute reviews, comments, and other travel-related UGC on their platforms.</p>
<p>The influential role of perceptual homophily has further implications for market segmentation. Segmenting the market is critical for ensuring the alignment of user expectations in addition to increasing perceptions of credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475217">Deloitte 2011</xref>). As UGC sites increasingly focus on specific market segments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475217">Deloitte (2011)</xref> purports that “the key strategy is to bring like-minded people together” (p. 2). For example, Couch Surfing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">www.couchsurfing.org</ext-link>) caters to travelers who shun conventional tourist accommodation, whereas WAYN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wayn.com">www.wayn.com</ext-link>) focuses on younger travelers and Silver Travel Advisor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.silvertraveladvisor.com">www.silvertraveladvisor.com</ext-link>) targets mature travelers.</p>
<p>The management of travel-related user-generated websites may also need to give attention to other credibility cues such as personal identifying information. Prior research suggests that the provision of such information could improve perceptions of credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512475217">Xie et al. 2011</xref>). UGC contributors with profiles tend to post legitimate reviews as they write under an identifiable name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475217">Deloitte 2011</xref>). Some user-generated websites have recognized the value of this and are therefore employing general social networking sites to authenticate postings by requiring contributors to log in using for example their Facebook profile.</p>
<p>In addition, it behooves on UGC website managers to institute effective mechanisms in order to ensure a more secure reviewing platform where the best is done to guarantee credible UGC. One approach will be to review and verify every posting, as practiced by Silver Travel Advisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475217">Deloitte 2011</xref>). However, such an approach may not be feasible with widely used UGC sites like TripAdvisor. Other approaches have been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287512475217">Tnooz (2011)</xref>, including linking each review with a GPS-assigned location that is traceable to the location of the travel product under review, tracking IP addresses and frequency of postings, using mobile apps to permit reviews to be submitted only if they are within range, among others. The implementation of such strategies in the travel domain may have their own challenges, given that most travel reviews are written after return from the trip. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287512475217">Deloitte (2011)</xref> also suggests other sophisticated methods that can be implemented to validate and risk-assess UGC such as algorithms, data-mining tools, and rules-based analysis. Approaches being employed by TripAdvisor to address credibility concerns include the application of sophisticated fraud detection filters to scan and flag suspicious reviews for inspection. Disclaimers are posted to warn potential guests of hotels writing fake reviews to improve their popularity rankings or hurt competitors. Other user-generated review sites go a step further to ensure that consumers stay in the hotels they review (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://agoda.com">agoda.com</ext-link>). In essence, it is paramount to emphasize credibility cues and communicate to users the mechanisms being implemented to ensure this so as to enhance credibility perceptions.</p>
<p>From hospitality and tourism managers’ perspective, the findings suggest that UGC has the potential to influence consumers’ travel planning and decision-making process. For instance, online consumers are likely to employ user-generated reviews for their travel planning so long as they perceive the source to be credible—regardless of whether the review reflects the actual truth or not. In this regard, researchers in the Field of Communication Studies describe credibility not as a characteristic inherent in the source per se but as a judgment made by the information receiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287512475217">Flanagin and Metzger 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287512475217">Johnson and Kaye 2009</xref>). This implies that negative reviews and comments about services posted by consumers could have far-reaching implications for a travel brand’s reputation as well as sales and profitability.</p>
<p>There are several possible ways to lessen any such undesirable effect. First, hospitality and tourism businesses may need to set in place mechanisms for monitoring ongoing discussions about their service offerings on various social media platforms. This can be quite scary to practitioners considering the multiplicity of such social media platforms recently. However, recent automated tools like Social Mention (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.socialmention.com">www.socialmention.com</ext-link>) make this task easier. This approach can help managers to easily identify negative user-generated reviews about their offerings and respond accordingly (particularly when such UGC is dishonest or exaggerated). Second, organizations could consider creative ways to mitigate the adverse implications of negative UGC on their businesses. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287512475217">Ayeh et al. (2012)</xref>, for instance, identified some strategies that hospitality and tourism practitioners are using to address negative reviews. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287512475217">Xie et al. (2011)</xref> suggest that hotel managers could minimize the negative impact of their past service failures by drawing consumers’ attention to the most recent online reviews, assuming such failures have been rectified. Essentially, it is important for managers to respond professionally to negative reviews.</p>

<title>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>This study is only a first step toward understanding credibility in the context of UGC. Though the predictive power of the model presented here is deemed sufficient, the percentage of explained variance of 58% for behavioral intention highlights the fact that there are possibly other potential variables that may be important in determining online travelers’ use of UGC for travel planning. This study only tested the theories of homophily and source credibility to understand UGC use for travel planning. It is hoped that future studies might explore additional factors to better explain the complex relationships among variables in our pursuit to understand online credibility and the use of UGC in the travel planning context.</p>
<p>Second, our study examined credibility in one particular type of UGC site that also happens to be the largest and most used UGC site for travel planning. This, in itself, may affect credibility perceptions. Nonetheless, since our study’s interest is in the relationships among latent constructs and not credibility ratings per se, this is not problematic to the realization of the study’s objective. However, future studies might examine alternative UGC platforms, including other travel-specific online communities (e.g., VirtualTourist, and IgoUgo), and general social networking sites (e.g., Facebook and MySpace) as well as UGC that are accessible from the websites of service providers and destination marketers. It is plausible for the effects of the credibility dimensions to vary across UGC platforms probably because of visual effects or other related factors.</p>
<p>Another important avenue for future research relates to the different forms of credibility; there are other forms of credibility such as corporate credibility, message credibility, and channel credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287512475217">Metzger et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287512475217">Pornpitakpan 2004</xref>). It is hoped that future research will explore these aspects as well as potential interactions among these varied forms of credibility.</p>
<p>A final limitation relates to the sample drawn for this study. The results reported here are limited to responses from online travel consumers in Singapore. Though findings may generally apply to similar cultural contexts, particularly in Asia, the extent to which the results can be generalized to non-Asian contexts remains to be investigated. An earlier study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0047287512475217">Yoon, Kim, and Kim (1998)</xref>, for instance, found the dimensionality of source credibility to be extremely similar across cultures but the effect of the dimensions varied by the dependent variables. Thus, caution must be exercised in any attempt to generalize the results to other populations and settings. Future research may replicate this study in other cultural contexts to further validate these findings.</p>
