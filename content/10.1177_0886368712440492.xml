<abstract>
<p>In response to Securities and Exchange Commission requirements, most companies have eliminated the more obvious types of corporate exposure to imprudent risk taking linked to pay, such as megagrants of stock options, performance incentives based entirely on top-line growth or significant “guaranteed” severance packages. Risk assessments can dive deeper, though, to uncover risks or opportunities from pay plans that are not obvious on the surface. The risks include financial burdens placed on the company from the incentive plan, operational processes that fail to surface and mitigate errors in judgment or calculation of payments, plans that damage the company’s reputation and plans that have the potential to cause a loss of critical talent. In uncovering risks, opportunities to improve plan design and effectiveness are often revealed, as well.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>If you have had occasion to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of a proxy statement recently, you likely came across a statement quite similar to this one:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our Compensation Committee, with assistance from internal risk management staff and the Committee’s compensation consultant, has assessed our compensation programs and has concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This all-too-common statement reflects a potential opportunity lost. Compensation committees can go far beyond merely demonstrating a lack of material risk by using an effective risk assessment process in the management of their incentive programs.</p>
<p>In this article, we present a set of standards for conducting an effective risk assessment. The information gathered in such assessments should enable compliance with required compensation-risk disclosure, enhance the potential for incentive plans to produce desired business results and reward management appropriately relative to performance.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0886368712440492">
<p><italic>Risk</italic>, with respect to compensation programs, is exposing the Company and its shareholders to potential material losses by inappropriately incenting activities, decisions or behaviors of management that contribute to these losses. Risk is a necessary part of the process through which a Company can create value for shareholders. The challenge of assessing risk and compensation is to gauge whether management is appropriately incented to balance the size and frequency of potential losses with the potential gains.</p>

<sec id="section2-0886368712440492" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An appropriate level of risk is essential for any business to survive and produce acceptable risk-adjusted returns for stakeholders. Eradicating all risk in compensation programs is not desirable or feasible. However, actively managing risks undertaken—and understanding their relationship with executive compensation structure and design—is feasible.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s guidance on incentive- compensation risk assessment is consistent with this view. This principles-based guidance recognizes that no single incentive design is appropriate for all organizations. In the Fed’s view, incentive arrangements should be as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712440492" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Balanced regarding financial rewards so as not to encourage employees to imprudently expose their organizations to risk</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Compatible with effective controls and risk management</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Supported by strong corporate governance</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>From our recent experiences, most companies have stepped up and eliminated the more obvious types of corporate exposure to imprudent risk taking linked to pay, such as <italic>megagrants of stock options</italic>, <italic>performance incentives based entirely on top-line growth or significant “guaranteed” severance packages.</italic> Yet, in the areas of controls and corporate governance practices focused on managing pay risk over time, there is substantial room for improvement.</p>
<p>Four specific types of risk are associated with compensation programs: financial, operational, reputational and talent related. Sharp focus on each of these areas will go a long way toward meeting the Federal Reserve standards and achieving objectives for managing risk.</p>
<list id="list2-0886368712440492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. <italic>Financial</italic>: A company’s incentive plans could place an undue financial burden on the company or fail to motivate behavior critical to financial success.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These assessments often balance financial impact and potential for risk generation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886368712440492">Figure 1</xref> shows how different incentive plans within an organization might fall along the spectrum of the combined dimensions of materiality and risk.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0886368712440492" position="float">

</fig>
<p>In this example, the organization has a number of incentive plans in which the size of individual payments to participants and the overall cost to the company are deemed material. In this context, materiality involves a company-specific definition of the relationship of incentive plan costs to company profitability and/or cash flow. (This is not a legal definition.)</p>
<p>Also, none of the plans shown in the example represented more than a moderate risk regarding types of executive behavior and performance scenarios. The risk that these plans might pay out significant amounts for undesirable behaviors or performance outcomes is limited.</p>
<p>An example of an executive incentive plan that did, in fact, create significant potential for material risk to the business and for payments for undesirable performance outcomes occurred at a publicly traded consumer durable goods company. The company, a manufacturer/wholesaler, had seen its revenues decline and was facing significant cash payments over the ensuing 3 years to meet debt covenants with its bankers. The Board’s Compensation Committee decided to implement a new 3-year long-term cash incentive plan that would pay solely for meeting a targeted level of cumulative free cash flow. The plan would represent approximately two thirds of the executive team’s target long-term incentive value, replacing value previously split between stock options and time-based restricted stock.</p>
<p>Using the risk/materiality matrix shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886368712440492">Figure 1</xref>, this plan would likely have been placed in the box corresponding with high potential for risk and high material impact on the company (the upper right-hand box). This risk lay in in the variety of ways available to achieve free cash flow, unencumbered by any requirement in the long-term incentive plan for profitability or returns. Revenues in the business did not recover during the incentive plan performance period, nor did profitability. To meet cash requirements, management sold off much of its inventory below cost, creating significant charges against income and eventually leading to related declines in stock price. However, the free cash flow generated by the unprofitable sales of inventory resulted in a maximum payment from the long-term incentive plan. The materiality of the plan proved to be present in cash payouts that were a burden on an already cash-strapped business. These payments led to numerous shareholder-initiated lawsuits that attempted to recoup the long-term incentive payments.</p>
<p>There is no universal definition of risk potential when applied to compensation. Company-specific risk factors, many of which are used in assessing other business risks, should all be considered when assessing compensation-related risk. These include stock beta, debt-to-equity ratios and the potential for efficient incremental profits.</p>
<list id="list3-0886368712440492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. <italic>Operational:</italic> Processes in place concerning the governance and administration of compensation programs are not sufficient to mitigate errors in judgment or calculated payments.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Operational risk assessments are fundamentally a process review with a focus on pay governance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0886368712440492">Figure 2</xref> is a sample operational review of pay risk and its assessment.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0886368712440492" position="float">

</fig>
<p>The company reflected in this sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0886368712440492">Figure 2</xref>) appears to have the right organizational units involved in the audit and approval of the pay determination process. Also, the process is not controlled or overly influenced by a single segment of the organization, and those who determine pay draw on appropriate internal resources for legal, financial and human resources expertise.</p>
<p>A common source of operational risk lies in the rote use of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financials in determining incentive plan performance without adequate processes our guidelines in place for the Compensation Committee to exercise discretion in determining the incentives earned for financial performance.</p>
<p>A health care supply company, with performance incentives that paid substantially for net operating profits after tax (NOPAT), acquired a business that was immediately accretive to earnings. At the end of the incentive plan performance period that included the acquisition, GAAP numbers for NOPAT indicated an incentive payment at a targeted level. In fact, but for the acquisition, the payment based on NOPAT would have been zero, indicating the company had fallen far short of expectations set at the beginning of the performance period for its existing ongoing businesses. Though the authority existed for the Committee to withhold incentive payments, absent any existing guidelines for adjusting GAAP performance and any history in similar circumstances, the Committee chose to make payments based on unadjusted GAAP results.</p>
<p>This capacity to be informed by guidelines and to exercise discretion in determining amounts to be paid under formula-based incentives can be an important part of executive incentive plan governance. This practice can not only minimize the kinds of operational risk described in this example but can also be an important tool for maintaining desired performance accountability and fairness in incentive plans.</p>
<list id="list4-0886368712440492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. <italic>Reputation:</italic> The design of certain pay programs, although not in violation of any regulatory or legal requirements, could draw negative attention from the company’s constituents, including investors.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Reputational risk assessments will most often be based on evaluation of incentive pay in relation to a checklist of items judged externally to be poor pay practices. In 2011, for example, the presence or absence of a defined policy on clawbacks was on most checklists, as were items such as severance payments for nonrenewal of executive employment agreements.</p>
<p>Reputational risk should be balanced against the intended business purpose of pertinent pay practices. Continuing to provide executives with excise tax protection may, in itself, pose a serious reputational risk for companies, but an alternative may be needed to help ensure that executives are not discouraged from objectively evaluating prospective transactions that might trigger this tax.</p>
<p>During 2010 and 2011, following the inception of say-on-pay advisory votes by shareholders, many publicly traded companies faced the important business decision of whether to maintain existing change in control excise tax protection features in their executive pay programs. Shareholders were focused on new or newly amended employment contracts or severance plans with these features. Companies choosing to maintain excise tax protection in these new or amended programs could expect a decrease in favorable say-on-pay votes of upward of 20 percentage points. For many of these companies, a relatively low favorable vote from shareholders, less than 70%, was damaging to their reputations as well-governed businesses.</p>
<p>The reputational risk seemed most difficult for those companies with existing excise tax protection plans that were not yet the focus of shareholders but still certain to be subject to eventual scrutiny as plans or contracts expired and were subject to potential renewal. The question was when to take action. The answer revolved around how to balance the reputational risk of maintaining a program clearly unpopular with shareholders, but not yet “required” to be changed, with the loss of the original business purpose for the excise tax protection and the probable strong negative reaction from executives if changes were made unnecessarily.</p>
<p>For many companies facing this question, the answer chosen was to “sunset” the provision. This meant that a company would, in its Compensation Discussion and Analysis disclosure in the proxy, commit to ending the excise tax benefit at a specific date in the future. They chose to take a proactive step to maintain their reputation as well governed and responsive to shareholders, while at the same time delaying the actual elimination of the benefit until at or close to the time shareholders would require its removal.</p>
<list id="list5-0886368712440492" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. <italic>Talent:</italic> The design or absence of some types of compensation plans could result in a loss of critical talent.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Risk of losing talent may stem from simply not paying competitively. But more often, it is caused by a weak pay–performance relationship, typically resulting from any or all of the following:</p>
<list id="list6-0886368712440492" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Overly aggressive performance expectations</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Insufficient leverage in rewards for exceeding expectations</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Excessively harsh penalties for failing to meet expectations</p></list-item></list>
<p>A digital advertising company with healthy profit margins, sustained growth in profitability and a strong revenue-to-market capitalization ratio budgeted very aggressively for continued above market year over year growth. The annual incentive plan required operating profit performance of at least 90% of budget before any bonuses could be paid. At 90% performance, the incentive plan paid out at 50% of the target incentive opportunity. Below this level, it paid nothing.</p>
<p>In a year in which the company budgeted for growth in profits at twice the expected market rate, two large advertising accounts were lost in the first quarter, making threshold profit performance extremely difficult to attain, if not unattainable, even though the expected profits for the year would still be more than 85% of plan and would grow faster that those of the company’s peers.</p>
<p>Fearing the risk of loss of key sales executives, and the potential loss of further business, the company made two changes to its annual incentive plan. First, it chose to extend the payouts in the current year for performance below 90% of plan, allowing for payments between zero and 50% of target for performance between 80% and 90% of plan. In the next year, the company changed its annual incentive plan to set the threshold performance at 80% of budget and pay 50% of target at that level of performance and payouts scaling up pro rata to 100% of target at plan performance. Only performance below 80% resulted in a zero payout.</p>
<p>These changes allowed the company to continue to budget aggressively without risking loss of talent from nonpayment for otherwise strong profit performance.</p>
<p>Regulations expected from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on implementation of the Dodd-Frank requirement for annual pay and performance disclosures will make pay and performance assessment part of annual pay program management for most organizations and mitigate the potential for problems similar to the ones described in this example. In addition, it will become part of many companies’ talent-risk assessments.</p>
<p>In the context of our recommended principles-based approach to risk assessment and the Federal Reserve guidelines, below is a set of standards from which to evaluate the effectiveness of your company’s pay-risk assessment. Does it</p>
<list id="list7-0886368712440492" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Set oversight priorities</italic> that identify pay plans relating to the highest risk businesses and positions and ensure that both management and the compensation committee monitor them closely?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Incorporate risk assessment into plan-design philosophy</italic> by avoiding extremes and by maintaining a balanced mix of fixed and variable pay, short- and long-term incentives and corporate and business unit performance goals?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Assure that plans are well designed</italic> by addressing any red flags raised by features that may encourage excessive risk taking, such as steep incentive curves, uncapped payouts, completely formulaic awards and misaligned timing of payments—or, if such features are used, assuring that their effectiveness has been carefully vetted?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Get performance metrics right</italic> by carefully evaluating whether an incentive plan’s measures are comprehensive and support the efficient use of capital, sustainability of profits and linkage with shareholder value creation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Define pay-plan governance processes</italic> by clearly defining oversight roles, ensuring that plans are consistent with both business goals and risk tolerances and stress testing results under a range of scenarios characterized by realistic assumptions about conditions?</p></list-item></list>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The SEC continues to issue comment letters to domestic publicly traded companies asking that they not only disclose their conclusions about the existence of material pay risks but also describe their assessment processes. (For an example of a process disclosure, see Brown-Forman Corporation, DEF 14A, June 25, 2010, p. 36.) This particular disclosure, and the company’s identification of criteria used in its evaluation, is extremely instructive, as it reflects many of the standards by which the implementation of pay philosophy is being judged.</p>
<p>As pay-risk disclosures evolve, either by company initiative or with a push from the SEC, let us hope that we see a change to something more like the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our compensation programs are part of our performance culture. They provide balanced reward opportunities tied to a variety of performance outcomes that drive shareholder value. The Compensation Committee subjects the programs to continual review with assistance from management and the committee’s independent consultant, and has concluded that these plans are designed to contribute to our success and reasonably unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our company.</p>
