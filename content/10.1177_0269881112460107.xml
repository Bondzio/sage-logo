<abstract>
<p>Early life exposure to antidepressants frequently occurs when pregnant mothers take the medication during late pregnancy. Previous studies in animal models have shown that early exposure to certain antidepressants can alter some behaviors in adulthood. We examined whether the administration of clomipramine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, to neonatal mice could result in depression-related behavioral alterations in adult mice. In addition, in an attempt to uncover the mechanism underlying these behavioral changes, we examined the expression of candidate genes in different areas of the brain. Here we show that mice chronically injected with clomipramine specifically during early postnatal development demonstrated depression-like behavior as well as altered stress responses in adulthood. An analysis of the expression of serotonergic genes after exposure to social defeat stress revealed small but significant changes in the expression of 5-HT1A receptor gene (<italic>Htr1a</italic>) and 5-HTT gene (<italic>Slc6a4</italic>) in the mice treated with clomipramine compared with the mice injected with saline. We concluded that antidepressant exposure in early days of life could alter stress-related behavior in adulthood and that the behavioral alterations are accompanied by altered serotonergic gene expressions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The postnatal brain undergoes dramatic changes that are essential for refining functional brain circuits. Sensory systems, for example, have been extensively studied for their plastic changes early in life; a time that is often called a ‘critical period’. Experiences guide the refining events during this period, and neural networks optimize themselves to produce the most efficient outputs in response to the inputs received. Although there is no evidence suggesting that similar events or mechanisms exist in the brain networks that control mood and emotion, a number of studies have made links between early life experiences and the propensity for depressive episodes in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112460107">Gilmer and McKinney, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112460107">Heim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112460107">Holmes et al., 2005</xref>). Two prominent models of depression, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive, are the monoamine hypothesis and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) dysregulation hypothesis. Early life experiences may modify these systems such that the susceptibility to depression in later life is changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112460107">Ansorge et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Many antidepressants act by modulating serotonin or norepinephrine transmission, leading to an increase in extracellular serotonin or norepinephrine levels. Perturbations in mood during pregnancy frequently result in exposing the fetus to antidepressants perinatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112460107">Oberlander et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112460107">2009</xref>). Furthermore, significant numbers of young children are being exposed to antidepressants during sensitive periods of brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112460107">Zito et al., 2000</xref>). Although the use of antidepressants by pregnant women or by young children is considered to be safe because no imminent gross defects have been reported, the sustained neurobehavioral effects of perinatal antidepressant exposure in human remain largely unknown. However, genetic or pharmacological interventions of the serotonergic system in animal models have been shown to affect depression-related behaviors in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112460107">Ansorge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112460107">Gingrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112460107">Lira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112460107">Maciag et al., 2006</xref>). Neonatal administration of clomipramine, a drug that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, causes behavioral changes in adult rats that resemble some of the symptoms observed in human depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112460107">Vogel et al., 1990</xref>). The behavioral abnormalities include decreased sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112460107">Maciag et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112460107">Neill et al., 1990</xref>), perturbed rapid eye movement (REM)/non-REM sleep cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112460107">Mirmiran et al., 1981</xref>), and increased immobility in the forced swim test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112460107">Velazquez-Moctezuma and Diaz Ruiz, 1992</xref>). Postnatal days 7–20 in rodents, during which clomipramine was administered, roughly correspond to the late stages of fetal development and the first 2–3 years of human postnatal life based on brain mass growth as well as the maturation of the monoaminergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112460107">Hansson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112460107">Maciag et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore rodents treated with antidepressants in the early postnatal days closely mirror children exposed to antidepressants. This experimental model could be helpful in elucidating the molecular changes that are induced by exposure to antidepressants, which may predispose human patients to depressive episodes later.</p>
<p>In this study, we determined whether neonatal administration of clomipramine to mice results in persistent behavioral changes in adulthood, particularly in the context of stress responses. We used mice because they will be useful in elucidating the underlying mechanism for the behavioral change, if clomipramine has similar effects in mice as in rats. For example, knockout or transgenic mice can be used for molecular dissections of the effects produced by antidepressants administration in early life. The social defeat stress paradigm allows for the examination of a biological basis for emotional responses to chronic stress. This paradigm is useful for studying the interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental influences because it seems to be inherently sensitive to individual predisposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112460107">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>). We also tested if there were accompanying changes in the expression of genes that have been implicated in the etiology of major depression. Here we show that administration of clomipramine to neonatal mice can induce behavioral abnormalities that resemble some of the symptoms found in human major depression. These abnormal behaviors were accompanied by the altered expression of genes that participate in serotonin transmission in the brain.</p>

<title>Animals and drug treatment</title>
<p>Pregnant C57BL/6N mice were purchased from the Orient bio (Seoul, Korea). The pups received daily subcutaneous injections of clomipramine (CLI-mice) (clomipramine hydrochloride, Sigma, 10 or 20 mg/kg) at 2 pm from postnatal day 7 to 20 (p7 to p20). Littermate control groups were similarly treated with an equal volume of saline (SAL-mice). Only male mice were weaned and caged in groups at 3–4 weeks of age and were used throughout this study. For juvenile administration, male mice received daily subcutaneous injections of clomipramine (clomipramine hydrochloride, Sigma, 20 mg/kg) or saline at 2 pm from p28 to p41. For acute antidepressant treatment, fluoxetine (Sigma, 20 mg/kg) or saline was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections to a subset of the SAL-mice and the CLI-mice at 2 months of age. The SAL-mice and the CLI-mice received three injections of either fluoxetine or saline in a constant volume of 0.1 mL between the first forced swim test (pre-test) and the second forced swim test. Injections were made at 0.5 h, 6 h and 23.5 h after the pre-test.</p>
<p>Animals were housed in a Korea University animal facility and raised under standard conditions (23°C, 55 ± 5% humidity, 12 h:12 h light-dark cycles). Food and water were provided ad libitum. The experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of Korea University.</p>

<title>Behavioral tests</title>
<p>Behavioral testing began at around 2 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112460107">Figure 1</xref>). All the tests were performed in a sound-proof testing room under dim-light conditions (about 10 lux).</p>

<sec id="section5-0269881112460107">
<title>Open field test</title>
<p>The open field test (OFT) was performed to measure basal-level anxiety in the experimental animals at 2 months of age. The tests were performed at the same time of the day (around 10 am) for all the animals used. The locomotor activity of mice was measured either by the number of laser beam breaks in an activity chamber (Med Associated) or by video recording and subsequent analysis by video tracking software (Ethovision XT, Noldus). The locomotor activity within the chamber (30 cm × 30 cm) was recorded under dim light for an hour. The central area that occupied 16% of the whole area was designated as the ‘center zone’ and the locomotion of the animal in this area was analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881112460107">
<title>Forced swim test</title>
<p>The forced swim test (FST) procedure consisted of two sessions as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112460107">David et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112460107">Richardson-Jones et al., 2011</xref>). The first FST (pre-test) was carried out 24 h after the OFT in an acrylic cylinder (44.5 cm height, 20 cm diameter) filled with 6 L of distilled water at 23°C. Mice were placed into the cylinder and were subjected to forced swim for 15 min as a pre-test. Mice were returned to their home cages after they were gently dried using paper towels. After 24 h, during which a subset of animals received antidepressant injections, the mice were returned to the same cylinder and subjected to forced swim for 6 min while being video recorded (the second FST). Fresh water was used for each trial. The proportion of time the mice remained immobile was determined and measured using Ethovision XT software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881112460107">
<title>Sucrose preference test</title>
<p>For the sucrose preference test (SPT), animals were placed in individual cages 24 h prior to the test for habituation to single housing. Animals were trained to drink from two identical bottles, one containing 100 mL of 10% (w/v) sucrose solution and the other containing 100 mL of water. Bottle positions were switched every 12 h to avoid preference developing for a specific bottle location. After 2 days of habituation and training, sucrose and water consumption was measured by weighing bottles at the end of testing period of 24 h. Sucrose preference was calculated as follows: Preference (%) = sucrose consumption (g) / (sucrose + water consumption (g)) * 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881112460107">
<title>Social interactions</title>
<p>Interactive social behavior (social interactions (SI)) was measured 24 h after the second FST. Animals were habituated in a chamber (30 cm × 30 cm) for 30 min prior to the test. The test consisted of two consecutive 5-min sessions. The first (‘no target’) session was recorded in the chamber with a small empty cage located at one end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112460107">Berton et al., 2006</xref>). The second (‘target’) session was performed with a social target animal (an unfamiliar CD1 male mouse). The small cage holding the target animal was made of wire mesh for social contacts (10 cm × 6.5 cm). The two corner areas (6 cm × 6 cm each) on the opposite end of the target cage were designated ‘the corner zone’ (CZ), and the strip area (6 cm wide) surrounding the target cage was designated ‘the interaction zone’ (IZ). The time spent and distance moved by the experimental animals in each zone were analyzed. Tests were conducted under dark condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881112460107">
<title>Social defeat stress</title>
<p>A subset of animals that were tested for basal SI received chronic social defeat stress for 10 consecutive days following the basal SI test. The aggressors were male CD1 mice (&gt; 12 weeks old) that were selected by a screening test. For screening aggressors, a naïve C57BL/6 intruder mouse (younger than 12 weeks old) was placed into a home cage of male CD1 mice (5–6 CD1 mice were housed together but all the animals except a mouse being tested were temporarily removed while testing). The latency before the resident mouse attacked the intruder mouse was measured. We conducted the screening test for 3 consecutive days with different intruders and only the mice that consistently showed the latency shorter than 1 min were used as aggressors. Each of the selected aggressors was isolated in a single cage until used. For defeat stress, the subjects were introduced into the home cage of an unfamiliar aggressor mouse for 5 min. After 5 min of physical interaction, the resident aggressor and the experimental subject (intruder) were allowed to have sensory contacts through a perforated plexiglass partition that divided the resident home cage into two halves for 24 h. The defeat episode consisting of 5 min of physical interaction and 24 h of sensory contacts was repeated with a new aggressor each day for 10 consecutive days. The social interactions behavior was then measured again, 1 day after the last defeat episode. Subject animals that showed any signs of wounds that were incurred by the aggressors were excluded from analysis.</p>

<sec id="section10-0269881112460107">
<title>Corticosterone assay</title>
<p>Blood samples for corticosterone measurement were collected 1 week before the behavioral tests (basal level) and within 24 h after the final SI test following chronic social defeat stress (defeated level). Sample collections were conducted between 2 pm and 3 pm prior to tissue harvesting for gene expression analysis. Mice were anesthetized immediately after removal from their home cages and 1–10 µL of blood was rapidly collected from the tail vein. Blood samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm and 4°C, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -20°C until analysis. A corticosterone enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Enzo Life Sciences) was used to measure the level of corticosterone, as recommended by the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881112460107">
<title>Gene expression analysis</title>
<p>After all the behavioral tests were completed, the mice were sacrificed to collect brain tissues within 24 h. The brain was dissected, and slices were prepared using a vibratome. We microdissected the midbrain, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, ventral striatum, and hippocampus from the CLI- and SAL-mice that were or were not subjected to the social defeat stress in order to investigate the gene expression changes after exposure to stress in the CLI-mice. Tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. To minimize the adverse effects of RNase on the samples, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and the RNase Away (Molecular BioProducts) were used in all the procedures.</p>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from the frozen tissue samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). All sample preparation procedures for RNA extraction were carried out following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Approximately 300 ng of total RNA from each tissue was used to make cDNA using the amfiRivert cDNA synthesis master mix (GenDEPOT).</p>
<p>Quantitative gene expression analysis was carried out using the LC 480 (Roche) real-time PCR thermocycler. The primers used in our study are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112460107">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Administration of clomipramine to neonatal mice results in increased immobility in the FST during adulthood</title>
<p>In the FST, the immobile phase reflects the tendency of an animal to exhibit despair in a helpless condition. To test whether the administration of clomipramine in the neonatal mice affect depression-related behavior in later life, mice that were neonatally treated with clomipramine (CLI-mice) were subjected to the FST. We tested two doses of clomipramine, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, to find an effective dose for mice. The higher dose of clomipramine (20 mg/kg) was more effective for inducing long-lasting depressive behaviors in mice than the lower dose. The administration of 20 mg/kg clomipramine resulted in a significant increase in the immobility at 2 months of age compared with the saline-treated control mice (SAL-mice), while the 10 mg/kg dose failed to change the immobility in a statistically significant manner (10 mg/kg: F<sub>1, 32</sub> = 3.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.078, SAL, <italic>n</italic> = 17, CLI, <italic>n</italic> = 17; 20mg/kg: F<sub>1, 38</sub> = 4.20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.047, SAL, <italic>n</italic> = 20, CLI, <italic>n</italic> = 20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.036, post hoc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112460107">Figure 2(a)</xref>). We examined if the increased immobility could be reduced to the control level when an antidepressant is administered to the CLI-mice. The FST is widely used to test the efficacy of antidepressants. If the CLI-mice represent a useful model for major depression, antidepressants should reverse the increased immobility. Indeed, acute administration of fluoxetine decreased immobility time in the CLI-mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112460107">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The administration of antidepressants such as clomipramine or fluoxetine to neonatal or juvenile animals has recently been shown to increase anxiety-related behavior in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112460107">Andersen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112460107">Oh et al., 2009</xref>). However, the CLI-mice did not behave differently from the SAL-mice in the OFT, which evaluates anxiety-related behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112460107">Figure 2(c)</xref>). We also tested sucrose preference of these animals to examine the hedonic response of these animals. However, there was no significant difference in sucrose preference between the SAL-mice and the CLI-mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112460107">Figure 2(c)</xref>). In order to examine whether the effects of chronic clomipramine administration is age-dependent, we administered clomipramine (20 mg/kg) to 4-week-old mice and tested behavior at 2 months of age. Unlike the mice that were administered with clomipramine during early postnatal development, mice that received clomipramine during juvenile period did not show any difference in the FST performed when animals were 2 months old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269881112460107">Figure 2(d)</xref>). These results indicate that an antidepressant can have prolonged effect on behavior when it is administered during the early critical periods of brain development. The increased concentration of serotonin or norepinephrine in the brain during early life, when critical neural network formation for stress or mood regulations occurs, may change some properties of the networks. These changes, in turn, may lead to alterations of stress or depression-related behaviors during adult life.</p>

<title>Neonatal administration of clomipramine alters social interaction behavior and the stress responses to chronic social defeat stress</title>
<p>Social interaction is a fundamental animal behavior that is crucial for both recognizing hierarchical relationships and for choosing a mating partner. Decreased interest in, or even avoidance of, social interaction is one of the symptoms often observed in patients with mood disorders such as major depression. We examined if the neonatal administration of clomipramine could affect social interaction behavior in the adult stage. The CLI-mice were not significantly different from the SAL-mice in their zone preference without a target (stranger) animal. However, when a target animal was present, the SAL-mice demonstrated avoidance behavior, spending significantly less time in the interaction zone (IZ) and showing a trend of increased time spent in the corner zone (CZ) (SAL<sub>Basal, IZ, no target</sub> vs. SAL<sub>Basal, IZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; SAL<sub>Basal, CZ, no target</sub> vs. SAL<sub>Basal, CZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). The CLI-mice, however, were largely indifferent to the presence of the target animal, spending approximately equal time in each zone in the presence or absence of a target animal (CLI<sub>Basal, IZ, no target</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Basal, IZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5; CLI<sub>Basal, CZ, no target</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Basal, CZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.4, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). This resulted in a significant difference between the SAL-mice and the CLI-mice in the time spent in the IZ with a target (SAL<sub>Basal, IZ, target</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Basal, IZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881112460107">Figure 3(a)</xref>). This result suggests that the CLI-mice may have an altered stress-related response, as being in a closed space with an intimidating stranger can be a stressful experience. To examine the stress-coping behavior of the CLI-animals, we subjected the animals to chronic social defeat stress. The social defeat stress paradigm has been used in many animal studies and has been shown to cause lasting effects on animal behavior and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112460107">Berton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112460107">Fuchs and Flugge, 2002</xref>). After 10 days of chronic social defeat stress, animals were again tested for social interaction. Unlike the first social interaction test, CLI-animals responded to the presence of a target animal after exposure to chronic defeat stress. The CLI-mice spent significantly more time in the corner zone with a target animal present than with the cage empty (CLI<sub>Defeated, CZ, no target</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Defeated, CZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). The SAL-mice showed similar responses, with a significant increase in the time spent in the corner zone when a target was present (SAL<sub>Defeated, CZ, no target</sub> vs. SAL<sub>Defeated, CZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). The time spent in the corner zone, however, remained greater with the SAL-animals than with the CLI-animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881112460107">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p>

When a target was present, however, the SAL-mice spent significantly less time in the interaction zone than the CLI-mice. The SAL-mice spent more time in CZ than the CLI-mice did when a target was present, although this difference was not statistically significant (SAL<sub>Basal, CZ, no target</sub> vs. SAL<sub>Basal, CZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05; CLI<sub>Basal, CZ, no target</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Basal, CZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.4, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). Comparisons between the ‘no target’ session and the ‘target’ session revealed a statistically significant difference in IZ duration of the SAL-mice but not of the CLI-mice (SAL<sub>Basal, IZ, no target</sub> vs. SAL<sub>Basal, IZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; CLI<sub>Basal, IZ, no target</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Basal, IZ, target</sub>, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5, paired <italic>t</italic>-test).

<p>We examined the stress response of these animals by measuring corticosterone levels before and after chronic stress. The two groups did not show any difference in the level of corticosterone before chronic stress. After chronic stress, however, the SAL-mice showed significantly higher blood corticosterone level than the CLI-mice did. In contrast, the corticosterone level in the CLI-mice did not change significantly after exposure to chronic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0269881112460107">Figure 4</xref>). A two-way ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between clomipramine and defeat stress (F<sub>1, 85</sub> = 8.185, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005); however, drug treatment alone or defeat stress alone had no effect. The data in addition to the results from the social interaction test indicate that the clomipramine administration early in life could alter the responses to stressors in later life, although it is not clear whether these apparently resilient responses to chronic stress are beneficial or detrimental to mental health in the long run.</p>

<title>Neonatal administration of clomipramine alters the expression of genes that are involved in the serotonin system</title>
<p>Inducing changes in gene expression that can be maintained over the long term is one way to generate long-lasting biological effects. Numerous studies have examined genome-wide gene expression with regard to psychiatric disorders using unbiased approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112460107">Mehta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112460107">Sequeira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112460107">Sibille et al., 2009</xref>). Many studies used human samples that were derived either from postmortem brain tissue or from peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112460107">Iga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112460107">Kang et al., 2007</xref>). Although advances in microarray technology have made it possible to detect global gene expression changes across the entire genome, these data are often difficult to interpret, primarily because many seemingly unrelated genes change expression together. Therefore, we used a candidate-based approach in this study. Previous studies have shown that the serotonin system is involved in the pathophysiology of major depression. One of the most effective treatments for major depression is to use serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which strongly implicates functional changes in the serotonin system in major depression. Therefore, we examined the expression of genes that are involved in serotonin transmission (<italic>Htr1a, Htr1b, Htr1d, Htr2a, Slc6a4, Tph2</italic>) in adult mice that were neonatally treated with clomipramine. <italic>Htr1a</italic> was of particular interest because the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor is known to be expressed in midbrain serotonergic neurons as an autoreceptor, and is known to control the neuronal activity of the neurons as a part of a negative feedback loop. In the samples of midbrain tissue that contained serotonergic neurons, <italic>Htr1a</italic> expression was slightly reduced in the CLI-mice compared with the SAL-mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269881112460107">Figure 5(a)</xref>). What was more intriguing was that the reduced <italic>Htr1a</italic> expression in the CLI-mice returned to levels comparable with the SAL-mice following chronic social defeat stress, while the SAL-mice did not show changes in <italic>Htr1a</italic> expression after exposure to social defeat stress (Midbrain: F<sub>3, 27</sub> = 3.00, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048, post hoc test, CLI<sub>Basal</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Defeated</sub>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.021; SAL<sub>Basal</sub>, <italic>n</italic> = 7, CLI<sub>Basal</sub>, <italic>n</italic> = 7, SAL<sub>Defeated</sub>, <italic>n</italic> = 9, CLI<sub>Defeated</sub>, <italic>n</italic> = 8). Although we did not examine the expression of <italic>Htr1a</italic> exclusively within the raphe nuclei, this result may reflect a change in the expression of autoreceptors in serotonergic neurons because changes in the opposite direction were observed in other brain areas that should express heteroreceptors. The CLI-mice showed a trend of decrease in <italic>Htr1a</italic> expression in the hypothalamus following stress exposure. The frontal cortex showed the largest reduction in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor gene expression after stress (F<sub>3, 24</sub> = 2.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.055), although there was no difference between the SAL-mice and the CLI-mice. The serotonin transporter gene (<italic>Slc6a4</italic>) showed a similar pattern of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0269881112460107">Figure 5(b)</xref>). A trend of increase in the expression of <italic>Slc6a4</italic> was observed in response to chronic defeat stress in the midbrain of the CLI-mice (F<sub>3, 28</sub> = 2.69, <italic>p</italic> = 0.065). In contrast, there were significant decreases in the <italic>Slc6a4</italic> level in the CLI-mice after social defeat stress in the hypothalamus and the hippocampus (hypothalamus, F<sub>3, 35</sub> = 3.00, <italic>p</italic> = 0.044, post hoc test, CLI<sub>Basal</sub> vs. CLI<sub>Defeated</sub>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.022.

The expression of <italic>Slc6a4</italic> in the frontal cortex also showed a trend of decrease after defeat stress in both the SAL- and CLI-mice (F<sub>3, 23</sub> = 2.52, <italic>p</italic> = 0.083). In contrast, the expression level of other genes that were tested (<italic>Htr1b, Htr1d, Htr2a, and Tph2</italic>) did not show difference between different groups and across the stress conditions (data not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SSRIs are effective in treating major depression and anxiety disorders. The effectiveness of SSRIs strongly implicates the involvement of the serotonin system in the etiology of major depression. In fact, several human genetic association studies have suggested that polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene play critical roles in the manifestation of anxiety-related personality or major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112460107">Caspi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112460107">Lesch et al., 1996</xref>), although there have been controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112460107">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the altered expression or association of polymorphisms in serotonin receptor genes in depressed brains have both been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112460107">Christiansen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112460107">Murrough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112460107">Sargent et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112460107">Yates et al., 1990</xref>). Many studies examining the functional roles of serotonin transmission have corroborated the monoamine hypothesis of depression. For example, mice lacking 5-HTT, the primary target of many antidepressants, showed increased depression- and anxiety-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112460107">Holmes et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112460107">Lira et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor deficiencies lead to increased anxiety and stress responses in mice, indicating that the receptors are involved in anxiety control. Because the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors are expressed in the somatodendritic region of serotonergic neurons (autoreceptors) and in target neurons such as those in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus (heteroreceptors), the receptors may play distinct roles in the control of anxiety and mood. In fact, a recent study using mice that had increased levels of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors (1A-High) but showed normal expression of the heteroreceptors has demonstrated that the level of the autoreceptor is important for the physiological response to acute stress, the firing rate of serotonergic neurons, and for responding to antidepressant treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112460107">Richardson-Jones et al., 2010</xref>). Our mice that received clomipramine as neonates showed a behavioral response similar to the 1A-High mice. The mice showed increased despair in the FST and blunted avoidance behavior in the social interaction test. The SAL-mice showed avoidance behavior toward the target animals, possibly because they were intimidated by the target mice that were older and larger. The CLI-mice, however, showed a blunted response, with no difference in the time spent in the interaction zone. Like the 1A-High mice, the CLI-mice were no different than the SAL-mice in the OFT examining basal anxiety level. Our gene expression analysis data were also consistent with the hypothesis that the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> is an important regulator of the CLI-mice phenotype. Chronic stress increased <italic>Htr1a</italic> expression in the midbrain of the CLI-mice but not in the SAL-mice. The increase of the autoreceptors in the midbrain may have contributed to the depression-related behaviors by enhancing the negative feedback on the activity of the serotonergic neurons and by reducing the neurotransmission of serotonin.</p>
<p>The corticosterone analysis revealed that the difference in the level of corticosterone emerges only when the CLI-mice are subjected to stress. Chronic administration of certain antidepressants has been reported to affect corticosterone response. For example, antidepressants (clomipramine, imipramine, or desipramine) administration to adult rats increased the corticosterone level 30 min after the last injection of 12 consecutive daily administrations. However, the resting level of corticosterone in the antidepressant-treated animals measured during the following 24 h was in fact lower than in control animals at certain time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112460107">Gomez et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112460107">Bonilla-Jaime et al. (2003)</xref> reported that neonatal clomipramine administration in rats did not change basal level but lowered the corticosterone level when the animals were stressed, which is consistent with our results. Although these results appear to be conflicting with the fact that many depressive patients show elevated cortisol levels, a recent finding with which our data are consistent showed that there are sex differences in corticosterone responses to a social stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112460107">Chopra et al., 2009</xref>). While female depression patients had greater cortisol levels in response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) than did controls, male patients exhibited a significantly decreased peak percentage change in cortisol in response to the stress test than did male controls. Many animal behavioral studies, including ours, use only males for practical reasons. It therefore remains an important question whether there is a difference in stress response in female mice that are administered with clomipramine in early life.</p>
<p>The CLI-mice exhibited depression-like behaviors and changes in the expression of serotonergic genes. Although the extent of the changes in expression for most of the examined genes was fairly small, the results were consistent over multiple animal samples. In addition to <italic>Htr1a, Slc6a4</italic> showed significant changes in expression. This result is also consistent with the monoamine hypothesis that serotonin in particular plays an important role in the etiology of major depression. Serotonin, and other diffusive modulatory neurotransmitters, could affect the expression of multiple genes, including the genes involved in their own transmission in multiple brain areas, as observed in microarray analyses after treatment with SSRIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112460107">Sillaber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112460107">Wilkinson et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, fluctuations in serotonin transmission, particularly early in life when neuronal circuits are maturating and optimizing, could affect the expression of multiple genes, and the altered levels of expression or the altered thresholds for the induction of expression in response to various environmental challenges may lead to the onset of anxiety disorders or major depression. One interesting finding from our results is that the CLI-mice did not show a significant difference in gene expression from the SAL-mice at the basal state. Rather, the differences occurred more prominently when the animals were exposed to chronic social stress. Only the CLI-mice showed significant increases in the expression of <italic>Htr1a</italic> and <italic>Slc6a4</italic> in the midbrain after exposure to chronic defeat stress. This result suggests that the neonatal administration of clomipramine and, therefore, the resulting increase of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synapses, may relieve some genes that are important for stress responses of the molecular constraints that are placed during brain maturation. It is feasible that certain molecular constraints do not change the basal expression level of genes, but rather limit the induction of genes responding to external stimuli such as stress, and neonatal clomipramine administration lifts these constraints. The influence of monoamines on the expression of multiple genes may underlie the seemingly conflicting results from the 5-HTT knockout mice on different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112460107">Holmes et al., 2003a</xref>). If the activity of multiple genes, of which expressions are influenced by monoamines, are critical in determining susceptibility to stress, depression- or anxiety-related behaviors may turn out differently on different genetic backgrounds because the lack of 5-HTT may have variable effects on the basal level or induced level of expression for those genes on different genetic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Fluoxetine, a widely prescribed SSRI, has been shown to restore plasticity in the visual cortex of the rat, and it has been suggested that the accompanying transient gene expression changes contributed to the restoration of plasticity in the adult visual cortex through epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112460107">Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112460107">Vetencourt et al., 2011</xref>). It may be that the CLI-mice have acquired certain epigenetic modifications so that some genes show altered expression patterns.</p>
<p>Here we have shown that early life exposure to an antidepressant, clomipramine, in mice can alter stress-coping behavior in the adult stage. The changes in behavior were accompanied by modified gene expression responses to chronic social stress challenges as well as by blunted stress hormone response. The significance of our study lies on the fact that early life antidepressant exposure can alter stress response in later life with accompanying gene expression changes. Whether antidepressant exposure in human early life can affect brain function in later life is still an unanswered question. How it exerts such a long-lasting effect will be another important question, if it actually does. Our results imply that exposure to antidepressants during the sensitive period of brain development can alter the expression pattern of certain genes that are critical for behavioral response to stress and for depressive episodes.</p>
