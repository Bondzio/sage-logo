<abstract>
<p>Loss of lean body develops from an imbalance in protein synthesis and catabolism and is associated with a variety of different disease and nondisease states, including severe malnutrition, cachexia, and physiologic age-related loss (sarcopenia). Loss of lean body mass is prevalent among a significant proportion of the elderly population and has been associated with increased adverse clinical outcomes. Recognition of individuals at risk for low lean body mass may be difficult due to unequal distribution of losses across muscle and adipose compartments, and individuals who are both obese and sarcopenic demonstrate the highest risk for adverse events. Cross-sectional imaging modalities provide an accessible and easily interpretable means of quantifying lean muscle content and are routine diagnostic tests for cancer patients. As a result, a growing body of literature has developed characterizing the importance of low lean body mass as a poor prognostic factor among cancer patients, regardless of age. Cancer patients, especially those with sarcopenic obesity, are at increased risk for treatment-related toxicities from chemotherapy and increased overall mortality. Further investigations into the pathogenesis of muscle wasting among cancer patients are critical, as therapeutic oncologic interventions may inadvertently accelerate muscle catabolism. This review provides an overview of the definitions of low lean body mass, etiologic causes, clinical significance among cancer patients, and potential therapeutic interventions.</p>

<body>
<p>Severe loss of lean body mass has been recognized as a harbinger of poor outcomes among susceptible populations and occurs when protein breakdown exceeds protein synthesis. Lean body mass, in the form of skeletal muscle, is the predominant source of protein in the body. Proteins are essential to virtually every process within cells, including the synthesis of contractile elements, antibodies, enzymes, cell signaling, and, of course, the development of muscle mass. Therefore, loss of protein results in global declines in immunologic function and physiologic homeostasis, ultimately resulting in global dysfunction. Proteins are also an important source of nitrogen, which is mobilized from muscles to deliver amino acids to the immune system, liver, and other organs. Excessive protein catabolism diminishes the body’s physiologic reserve, and ability to withstand an acute insult is compromised and eventually a threshold is reached at which the body ceases to function. Therefore, if skeletal muscles are the major source of protein during illness, declines in skeletal muscle mass reflect total body’s protein depletion and, consequently, diminished reserves to mobilize during illness. The purpose of this review is to further define the mechanisms that cause loss of lean body mass and evaluate the significance of lean body mass loss on therapeutic toxicity and survival among cancer patients.</p>

<title>Classification of Declines in Lean Body Mass</title>
<p>Age-dependent declines in muscle mass have been observed for many years. The term <italic>sarcopenia</italic> was first coined by Irwin Rosenberg in 1989<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612457949">1</xref></sup> to describe a decline skeletal muscle mass related to aging, from the Greek words <italic>sarx</italic> (flesh) and <italic>penia</italic> (loss). Decreases in muscle content have been quantified by both biochemical and radiographic methods. Early metabolic studies demonstrated that urinary creatinine excretion, a surrogate measure of tissue creatine content and total muscle mass, declines between ages 20 and 50 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457949">2</xref></sup> This physiologic age-related loss of muscle mass has been observed in both sedentary and active older adults. The initial classification of sarcopenia was defined as an appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by height in meters of more than 2 standard deviations less than the normal mean in younger persons. Historically, these measurements were obtained by dual-emission X-ray spectrometry or bioelectrical impedance analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457949">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612457949">4</xref></sup> Based on this definition, the prevalence of sarcopenia was observed to be related to age and sex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612457949">Table 1</xref>), with older women being at greatest risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457949">5</xref></sup> The rate of muscle loss has been suggested to be approximately 6% per decade after midlife.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612457949">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the typical octogenarian would have approximately 75% of the muscle mass he or she had at age 40. Although this age-related muscle is observed in all older adults regardless of activity or health, considerable differences among individuals have been observed in the age of onset of muscle loss and the rate of muscle loss.</p>

<p>Causes of lean muscle mass loss are multifactorial and can result from both physiologic and pathologic causes, including age-related loss (sarcopenia), cachexia, malnutrition, or a combination of these processes. The definition of sarcopenia has historically been limited to changes in muscle mass that develop during the normal process of aging in the absence of other stressors. A characteristic of sarcopenia that distinguishes it from loss of lean body mass from wasting syndromes is that sarcopenia can be observed without concurrent loss of adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457949">7</xref></sup> Although a decrease in muscle mass is the hallmark of sarcopenia, not all sarcopenic individuals have low body mass index. Unlike other causes of lean muscle mass loss, sarcopenia can be associated with normal or even an obese body weight.</p>
<p>Cachexia is a cytokine-driven wasting syndrome due to an underlying pathology, such as cancer, end-organ disease, or infection, which results in nearly equivalent losses of adipose tissue and muscle loss. In addition to the imbalance in protein homeostasis, cachexia is also associated with a dysregulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis, with enhanced lipolysis driven by neuroendocrine activation and tumor-related lipolytic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457949">8</xref></sup> In contrast to cachexia, severe malnutrition results in preferential loss of adipose and subsequent loss of muscle mass due to inadequate intake of protein and calories. The importance of distinguishing between sarcopenia, cachexia, and malnutrition is of value to implement the most effect therapeutic intervention. Although malnutrition can easily be corrected by refeeding, cachexia and sarcopenia may be less responsive to nutrition interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612457949">9</xref></sup> In addition, the related pathophysiology of these conditions is unclear, and whether these conditions represent distinct entities or represent an interdependent continuum is unknown. Further research to distinguish between different etiologies of muscle wasting may be important to identify key signaling pathways and develop novel therapeutic interventions.</p>

<title>Sarcopenic Obesity</title>
<p>In 2000, Baumgartner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457949">10</xref></sup> introduced the concept of sarcopenic obesity, a condition in which older adults experience both a low muscle mass and a high adipose mass that is prevalent in approximately 18% of sarcopenic individuals. A number of studies have identified sarcopenic obesity as a risk factor for functional impairment and physical disability. Although both sarcopenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457949">11</xref></sup> and obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612457949">12</xref></sup> have individually been associated with physical disability and functional impairment, the combination of sarcopenia and obesity has been associated with additive adverse effects related to physical disability in several epidemiologic studies. In the New Mexico Aging Process Study cohort, the odds ratios for disability among sarcopenic, obese, and sarcopenic-obese groups were 2.07, 2.33, and 4.12, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457949">10</xref></sup> Individuals with sarcopenic obesity were 2.5-fold more likely to develop functional decline in the future than individuals with only sarcopenia or obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612457949">13</xref></sup> Identification of this cohort of individuals may be particularly clinically challenging as the sarcopenia may be masked by normal or even obese body mass index.</p>

<title>Physiologic Changes With Loss of Lean Body Mass</title>
<p>Proposed mechanisms for loss of lean body mass are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612457949">Table 2</xref>. Physiologic loss associated with sarcopenia is characterized on a cellular level by type II muscle fiber atrophy and fiber necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457949">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612457949">15</xref></sup> Declines in skeletal muscle may be due to a multifactorial process that involves physical activity, nutrition intake, oxidative stress, and hormonal changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612457949">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457949">5</xref></sup> Muscle atrophy occurs when protein breakdown exceeds protein synthesis and results in a net negative muscle protein balance. Historically, age-associated declines in muscle protein synthesis were thought to be related to insufficient muscle protein synthesis, with studies demonstrating a 35% decrease in the in vivo rates of mixed muscle and myosin heavy chain protein synthesis in men and women older than 60 years as compared with 20- to 30-year-old adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612457949">16</xref></sup> However, additional studies have demonstrated that basal protein synthesis is equivalent or slightly higher among older individuals, suggesting that mechanisms to generate muscle are intact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612457949">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612457949">18</xref></sup> Loss of protein homeostasis may be attributed to (a) a blunted response to anabolic stimuli or (b) upregulation of proteolysis. Several positive anabolic regulators of muscle hypertrophy (Akt and serum response factor) may be important to targets that may inhibit muscle wasting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612457949">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612457949">20</xref></sup> At least 4 major mechanisms are involved in skeletal muscle proteolysis, including lysosomal, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, caspase-dependent, and ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathways. The lysosomal and proteosomal systems lead to relatively nonselective degradation of cell proteins into amino acids or peptides, whereas the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and caspase systems are associated with only limited proteolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612457949">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612457949"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612457949"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612457949">24</xref></sup> The role of positive and negative regulators of protein metabolism and key pathways involved in sarcopenia and cachexia remains to be fully characterized, and further basic and translational research in these areas is ongoing.</p>

<title>Clinical Impact of Low Lean Body Mass</title>
<p>Age-related muscle loss has been observed to be a significant predictor of functional decline and disability in nondiseased elderly populations. Clinical manifestations of sarcopenia include diminished strength and exercise capacity as well as decreased endurance. In a large Italian cohort study, male and female participants from a representative sample of the general population were tested for putative indicators of sarcopenia, including knee extension, handgrip, lower extremity muscle power, and calf muscle area. The study observed an almost linear relationship with decreasing calf muscle cross-sectional area and diminished knee extension, handgrip strength, and lower extremity muscle power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457949">7</xref></sup> Significance of loss of muscle strength translated into increased risk of clinical disability. This finding was also observed in the early work from the New Mexico Elder Health Survey, where sarcopenia was associated with a 4-fold increase in the risk of having an impairment of at least 3 of the instrumental activities of daily living.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457949">11</xref></sup> Similarly, in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the likelihood of functional impairment and physical disability was 2- to 3-fold higher in older adults with sarcopenia than in older adults with normal muscle mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612457949">25</xref></sup> Sarcopenia has further been associated with functional impairment and disability, increased risk of fractures and falls, increased length of hospital stay, and decreased survival in general populations of elderly individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457949">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612457949">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612457949"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612457949">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>Radiographic Characterization of Lean Body Mass</title>
<p>Although dual-energy X-ray (DEXA) has historically been used to evaluate lean body mass, several other methods are now commonly used to measure muscle mass. Increasingly, imaged-based approaches, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been adapted, in part due to the accessibility and ubiquitous nature of these studies. Losses in skeletal muscle, especially sarcopenia, may be masked by disproportionate losses in adiposity and may not be immediately evident on physical examination. Cross-sectional imaging provides intuitive and highly differentiated analysis of human body composition with discrimination of specific organs and tissue types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612457949">Figure 1</xref>). Cross-sectional imaging also provides a mechanism for reproducible and objective measurements of muscle mass. This specificity and precision of CT- and MRI-based methods for body composition research have been extensively developed and validated and are one of the preferred methods to quantify muscle mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612457949">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612457949">29</xref></sup></p>

<p>Although no universal standard anatomic landmark has been established by which body composition analysis is performed, one commonly used landmark is the lower abdomen. In particular, the lumbar vertebral bodies have been referenced in a majority of studies in nonmalignant disease, and the vertebral bodies serve as an easily identifiable landmark, which is consistent across many individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612457949">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612457949">31</xref></sup> Captured within the lumbar field are various body components, including visceral, subcutaneous, intramuscular adipose tissue; psoas and paraspinal muscles; and transversus abdominis, external and internal oblique abdominals, and rectus abdominis. Data capture involves selecting a landmark (usually L3–4 vertebral body), and specific tissues are identified based on their anatomical features and then demarcated and quantified based on preestablished thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) using commercially available imaging analysis software. Cross-sectional areas are computed automatically by the program once the desired tissues have been demarcated with automatic subtraction of areas outside the HU thresholds. Digital subtraction is particularly useful for the evaluation of muscle groups that have had progressive fatty infiltration, allowing for more precise measurements of lean body mass. The cross-sectional areas of tissue in a single image in the lumbar area appear to be strongly correlated to whole-body adipose tissue, muscle, and lean tissue mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612457949">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612457949">33</xref></sup> Measurements can be taken of the entire abdominal muscle within 1 image or even be limited to a specific muscle group (psoas).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612457949">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612457949">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Lean Body Mass as a Predictor of Oncologic Outcome</title>
<p>Although considered the gold-standard imaging technique for body composition analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612457949">29</xref></sup> routine use of CT imaging in the general population has been limited by cost and the necessary exposure to high-dose radiation. Some specialties, such as oncology, rely heavily on diagnostic imaging for the care of their patients. In such cases, cancer patients routinely undergo scheduled CT imaging at 3- to 4-month intervals. Furthermore, the cancer population is often elderly (sarcopenic) and cachexic, providing an at-risk population that may be reproducibly studied through the use of existing imaging.</p>
<p>The presence of sarcopenia has been predictive of cancer mortality in several studies of patients with metastatic disease. In a study of 325 obese Canadian patients with solid tumors of the lung or gastrointestinal tract, the prevalence of sarcopenia was 15%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612457949">34</xref></sup> Functional status was assessed by a validated questionnaire, and lean body mass was captured from existing imagining studies. As compared with obese patients with normal lean body mass, patients with sarcopenic obesity had poorer functional status (<italic>P</italic> = .009) and a significantly decreased median survival (10 months vs 21 months, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). A multivariate analysis, including functional status, cancer diagnosis, and stage, indicated that sarcopenic obesity was the greatest negative predictor of survival (hazard ratio [HR], 4.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.4–7.2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Although functional status is commonly used in clinical practice and clinical trial designs to risk-stratify patients, in this study, absolute lean body mass was observed to be the greatest prognostic indicator. In another study, patients with metastatic cancer enrolled in phase I clinical trials were asked to complete a symptom questionnaire, and anthropomorphic data were captured from CT imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612457949">36</xref></sup> A nonsignificant trend toward improved survival was observed among nonsarcopenic patients as compared with sarcopenic patients (474 days [range, 346–601] vs 304 days [201–406], <italic>P</italic> = .15). Patients younger than 65 years with sarcopenia had significantly shorter survival than similar-age patients without sarcopenia (301 days vs 487 days, <italic>P</italic> = .04). In this study, symptom burden was equivalent across all groups and was not predictive of survival.</p>
<p>The presence of sarcopenia may also predict treatment toxicity. Dosing of chemotherapeutic agents is often based on body surface area. However, body composition—specifically, relative amounts of lean vs adipose tissue compartments—may vary significantly for persons with a similar body surface area. Growing evidence suggests that lean body mass may be superior to body surface area for normalizing drug doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612457949">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612457949">38</xref></sup> In a prospective study of patients with stage II/III colon cancer treated with 5-FU and leucovorin, the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities was assessed with respect to both body surface area and CT-based calculations of lean body mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612457949">39</xref></sup> The study observed that lean body mass was extremely variable across the cancer population and, unlike body surface area, was a significant predictor of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity (0.011). Similarly, among patients with breast cancer receiving anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapies, chemotoxicity was assessed after 1 cycle of treatment. Toxicities were observed in 50% of sarcopenic patients as compared with only 20% of nonsarcopenic patients (<italic>P</italic> = .03), and time to tumor progression was shorter in sarcopenic patients than in nonsarcopenic patients (101.4 vs 173.3 days, <italic>P</italic> = .005). In a study of 118 patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer, the presence of low lean body mass on baseline CT imaging at the time of diagnosis was associated with a 2.57-fold increased risk of not receiving surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612457949">40</xref></sup> In addition, oncologic agents have been identified that appear to accelerate lean body mass wasting. In a study of 98 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, those receiving sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of angiogenesis with effects on PI3K, AKT, and mTOR pathways, had a statistically significant decrease in skeletal muscle loss at 6 months (4.9%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and 12 months (8.0%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) as compared with patients receiving placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612457949">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Interventions for Lean Body Muscle Wasting</title>
<p>Primary interventions to reverse lean body mass involve increased resistance training and hormonal and nutrition interventions. Progressive resistance training increases muscle protein mass and strength and is attributed to an acute and chronic increase in muscle protein turnover, resulting in the rate of muscle protein synthesis that exceeds that of muscle proteolysis. Progressive resistance training 2–3 times a week has been associated with improved motor function, including balance, gait speed, timed walking, and chair rises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612457949">42</xref></sup> Hormonal intervention with testosterone has been associated with modest increases in lean body mass and decreased adipose mass as compared with placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612457949">43</xref></sup> A dose-dependent effect has been observed with improvement in muscle mass and grip strength; however, routine administration has been limited due to concern for increased risk of prostate malignancy in men and virilization in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612457949">44</xref></sup> Alternatively, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the selective androgen receptor modulator, enobosarm, was associated with a dose-dependent increase in total lean body mass (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and physical function (<italic>P</italic> = .013).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612457949">45</xref></sup> This agent is remarkable for limited effects on other androgen-responsive tissue, including the prostate and seminal vesicles, and has no androgenic side effects among elderly men and postmenopausal women. Finally, nutrition supplementation has had a variable impact on reversing lean body mass. Diets high in essential amino acids have been associated with an increased rate of muscle synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533612457949">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533612457949">47</xref></sup> However, other studies have suggested that resistance training rather than nutrition supplementation drives muscle synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612457949">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533612457949">49</xref></sup> Although there is lack of consensus regarding the benefit of nutrition and hormonal intervention to reverse muscle wasting, there is evidence that muscle wasting can be abrogated by resistance training, and it should be as an adjunct to therapy in individuals with low lean body mass.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Low lean body mass is a predictor of adverse events among the elderly and patients with cancer. The evaluation of lean body mass may be a useful adjunct in managing patients with cancer and may improve patient selection for therapies through the identification of high-risk individuals and appropriate initiation of early supportive care. Lean body mass can be evaluated in an objective, reproducible, and noninvasive manner from existing diagnostic studies and can potentially be integrated into initial risk assessments. Some evidence suggests that lean body mass catabolism may be reversible, and sarcopenic and sarcopenic obese patients may benefit from progressive resistance training to augment their lean body mass. Further studies to define the relationship between age-related muscle catabolism and cachexia are needed to improve therapeutic interventions and avoid acceleration of existing declines.</p>
