<p>[i]t is progressive urbanists who need to do the toughest thinking of all. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132510367541">Merrifield, 2000</xref>: 485)</p>

</p>
<p>I have just returned from giving a talk to the BDA in Hamburg where I was faced with the task of telling German architects and public officials that gentrification is <italic>not</italic> a socially just process. Hamburg is currently in the throes of the largest urban redevelopment project in Europe – HafenCity – aimed at attracting ‘the creative classes' back to the centre of Hamburg, and gentrification is affecting many core neighbourhoods. In the face of this an alliance of activists called ‘Right to the City’ have emerged, made up of about 20 citizens' groups with very divergent goals. They are united in their fight against gentrification. In my talk I emphasized that neoliberal policy-makers have led us to believe that ‘there is no alternative’ to gentrification.</p>
<p>So what are the alternatives? And can they be found in Marcuse et al.’s <italic>Searching for the Just City</italic>? – a book which takes as its starting point the concept of the ‘just city’ developed by Susan Fainstein over the past decade or so.</p>
<p>This excellent book has the laudable objective of pushing the ‘just city’ concept beyond ideology and rhetoric into something more substantive and useful with respect to urban reform. No mean task! The editors and respective authors explore the concept of the ‘just city’ theoretically and in practice, drawing on case studies from a number of different cities. And at last we have a critique of Fainstein’s somewhat dated and uncritical assertion of Amsterdam as the best available model of a city with a strong commitment to urban social justice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132510367541">Fainstein, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132510367541">2009</xref>). In Chapter 6, Johannes Novy and Margit Mayer reveal the neoliberal urban forces that are gentrifying large swathes of Amsterdam and in the process demolishing and gentrifying public housing (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132510367541">Uitermark et al., 2007</xref>, on Rotterdam). They point us in the direction of Latin America instead – where radical local governance experiments have successfully stood against neoliberalism and brought some improvements for the urban poor.</p>
<p>The book is in three parts. Part I investigates the theoretical foundations of the just city debate, Part II looks at the limitations, and Part III tries to bridge debate and action. All three parts raise pertinent questions about the geography of our urban political responsibilities by both highlighting injustices in cities and examining equitable alternatives. This book provides the best review that I have read to date on the different debates and theories that have emerged over time with respect to the ‘just city’. The editors (and the authors) weigh up these often quite divergent ideas sensitively, and in so doing they highlight the similarities and differences between the ‘just city’, the ‘good city’, and the ‘right to the city’ perspectives. These perspectives floated around in my book <italic>The Emancipatory City</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132510367541">Lees, 2004</xref>), but I now realize that they should have been grounded much more; for as the editors of <italic>Searching for the Just City</italic> argue both the points of intersection and departure between these perspectives are important for urban politics.</p>
<p>The editors of <italic>Searching for the Just City</italic> are very taken with Mustafa Dikec’s writings on the role of emancipatory politics in mobilizing the marginalized, writings grounded in Lefebvre’s ‘right to the city’ concept. As Dikec argues in Chapter 4 of the book:<disp-quote>
<p>Right to the city implies not only a formulation of certain rights and the cultivation of the political among city inhabitants, but also a reconsideration of the spatial dynamics that make the city. It, therefore, should not be conceived merely as a practice of claiming and asserting rights, but should also be conceptualized in a way so that it puts on the agenda the <italic>dynamics</italic> (e.g. property markets) and <italic>principles</italic> (e.g. urban policy, land-use policy, planning laws) of the ways in which social relations are spatialized in the city. (p. 83)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This quotation encapsulates the emphasis of the book as a whole on urban space, urban politics, and social practice.</p>
<p>Overall the chapters in this book underline for me the fact that there is still some way to go in the search for the ‘just city’. So what have I learnt from this book?</p>
<p>First, the inclusion of case studies from beyond the United States and Anglo-American cities, eg, Latin America and the Middle East, has underlined for me the importance of widening our lens; after all, neoliberalism has run amok in Indian cities, and Chinese cities have seen the large-scale displacement of millions of low-income central city residents in the name of market transition and urban reform. Second, there are significant traces of the contextuality of ideas about the ‘just city’ in this book; this underlines the need for extended discussion on this, especially given the globalization of urban policy transfer and neoliberalism. Third, the book facilitates engagement between the academy and outside the academy, and underlines that in searching for the just city we need to bridge these two worlds more effectively. Linking this to the recent literature on the role of academics, activism, and public science, etc, should be informative.</p>
<p>To get back to my question at the beginning of this review, there are alternatives (to the neoliberal city) encapsulated in this book, but we have a way to go before they can be properly utilized. This book constitutes a commendable and important first step in that direction, it is a really excellent addition to the literature on the ‘just city’, and it will provide me with a superb core text for my graduate students and indeed for my own research, writing and political engagement. This book will no doubt lead the way on future debates and actions with respect to the ‘just city’.</p>
