<body>
<p>This is an interesting study that concludes that ultrasound guided injections are more effective than non-ultrasound guided for patients with a separate EPB compartment. This may be true but the paper does not describe the technique used for non-ultrasound injections and this may explain their results. It cannot be assumed that “a steroid injection” is simply insertion of a needle in the general area of the pathology and injection of steroid. It is a skill that can be performed in a variety of ways very probably with a range of outcomes.</p>
<p>The technique used for performing an ultrasound guided injection may be different to that used for a non-ultrasound injection. Non-ultrasound techniques will probably give better results when performed by practitioners who understand the anatomy, are used to palpating around the area of pathology and use the best available techniques (where they are established). A practitioner who regularly uses ultrasound for all injections may become deskilled in non-ultrasound injections. In this paper, the practitioner who performed the ultrasound guided injection also performed the non-ultrasound injection.</p>
<p>Many practitioners who do not have access to ultrasound will inject into a single area for all de Quervain’s patients with good outcomes. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412446272">Peters-Veluthamingal et al. (2009)</xref> found that single area injections administered by trained GPs were successful in 78% of patients.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412446272">Mirzanli et al. (2012)</xref> conducted a cadaveric study of non-ultrasound guided injections. They found that 28% of cadavers had a separate compartment for APL and EPB. In these bodies single injections failed to inject contrast into both compartments. This paper recommended that two individual injections should be performed around the APL and EPB tendons from different points to take account of a possible septum for EPB. An instructional DVD of upper limb injections describes a non-ultrasound technique which injects multiple sites in the first dorsal compartment whilst asking the patient to move their thumb to try to ensure that all compartments are injected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412446272">Giddins and Turner 2009</xref>). This is much more likely to deliver steroid to the site of the pathology.</p>
<p>Although ultrasound is readily available in our department we do not routinely use it for de Quervain’s injections and have a very low conversion rate for surgery. At the moment the evidence that ultrasound guided techniques are better is not proven. All future studies should describe clearly the technique for the non-ultrasound as well as the ultrasound guided technique if a valid comparison is to be made.</p>
