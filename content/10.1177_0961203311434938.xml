<abstract>
<p>To what extent different autoantibodies accumulate in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) immune complexes (ICs), and whether such accumulation is associated with disease activity has been investigated. ICs were isolated from SLE sera by both polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and C1q-binding. Autoantibody specificities were determined using a lineblot assay quantified by densitometry. To compare the relative levels of autoantibodies, levels were normalized to the total levels of IgG measured by ELISA in sera and parallel ICs. Samples were investigated both in a cross-sectional design as well as in a paired design with samples obtained during both active and inactive SLE. All investigated autoantibody specificities except anti-dsDNA were enriched in circulating ICs as compared with parallel sera. The group of antibodies against RNA-associated antigens (anti-RNP/Sm, anti-Sm, anti-SSA/Ro60, anti-SSA/Ro52, anti-SSB/La) all exhibited higher median enrichment than the DNA-associated (anti-dsDNA, anti-histones, anti-nucleosomes) or cytoplasmic (anti-ribosomal P) antigens. In particular autoantibodies against RNP/Sm and SSA/Ro52 had the highest degree of enrichment in SLE PEG precipitates. These findings were corroborated by analysis of autoantibody content in C1q-bound ICs. There was no difference in degree of IC accumulation of the investigated autoantibodies during active and inactive SLE. Our findings demonstrate a difference in enrichment between autoantibodies against RNA- and DNA-associated autoantigens in isolated SLE IC, suggesting that the RNA-associated autoantibodies are more prone to form circulating ICs in SLE, in contrast to antibodies against DNA-associated autoantigens such as dsDNA. These finding have implications in understanding mechanisms of differential autoantibody accumulation in target organs in SLE.</p>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disorder that is considered a prototype immune complex (IC)-mediated disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311434938">1</xref></sup> It is virtually always accompanied by autoantibodies against nuclear constituents, e.g. against double-stranded (ds) DNA, Sjögren's syndrome A (SSA) and B (SSB), U1-snRNP and Sm antigens. Whereas levels of antibodies against dsDNA co-vary with SLE disease activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203311434938">2</xref></sup> this is not obvious for anti-SSA and anti-SSB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311434938">3</xref></sup> Anti-SSA is traditionally not considered a disease activity marker but instead a laboratory marker for primary Sjögren's syndrome and SLE, in the latter case associated with photosensitivity, interstitial lung disease and homozygous deficiency of C2 or C4. Anti-SSA is also regarded as a marker of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311434938">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have previously reported that polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated circulating IC from SLE patients induced the cytokines interleukin (IL) -6 and IL-10 in vitro,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311434938">5</xref></sup> and that levels of both circulating C1q-binding IC and IC-induced cytokine levels in vitro were associated with both SLE disease activity and the occurrence of anti-SSA antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311434938">6</xref></sup> Using ANOVA investigation of circulating IC levels there was a strong interaction between the occurrence of active disease and of anti-SSA, implicating that anti-SSA might preferentially accumulate in circulating IC during active disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311434938">6</xref></sup> We could not detect such associations for anti-dsDNA although we had comparable numbers of anti-dsDNA positive patients. The numbers of anti-U1snRNP and anti-Sm positive patients were low, and other SLE-associated autoantibodies were not detected using the double immune diffusion (DID) technique employed. Furthermore, even if the traditional DID technique detects autoantibodies against the traditional extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs), it does not work for the later defined SLE-associated autoantibodies against DNA-associated antigens (histones and nucleosomes) and cytoplasmic structures such as the ribosomal P antigen. The use of the DID technique for definition of autoantibodies in studies of IC autoantibody content is also influenced by the fact that the technique in itself measures IC formation, and that the thymocyte lysate used as antigenic source does not contain cytoplasmic proteins and is not validated for DNA-associated antigens.</p>
<p>The findings in our previous paper indirectly implicated anti-SSA in IC formation, but did not formally prove that anti-SSA antibodies participate in the formation of SLE IC to a greater degree than other ANA-associated autoantibodies such as anti-dsDNA. One earlier study utilizing ELISA for autoantibody measurements reported enrichment of anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-U-RNP/Sm and anti-ssDNA in PEG-precipitated IC. Enrichment levels were low and did not differ between the studied antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311434938">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Herein we have isolated and analyzed circulating ICs from SLE patients for the presence of a panel of autoantibodies, including RNP/Sm, Sm, SSA/Ro60, SSA/Ro52, SSB, PCNA, dsDNA, nucleosomes, histones and ribosomal P antigen. We report that all investigated autoantibody specificities except anti-dsDNA are enriched in circulating IC as compared with parallel SLE sera. The RNA-associated autoantibodies, in particularly autoantibodies against RNP/Sm and SSA/Ro52, were more enriched in SLE PEG precipitates than were anti-dsDNA. Together with anti-dsDNA, antibodies directed against DNA-associated histones and nucleosomes exhibited the lowest degree of enrichment, whereas anti-ribosomal P antigen showed intermediate enrichment. The implication of this discrepancy for the deposition of circulating IC and autoantibodies in SLE is discussed.</p></sec>

<p>Sera were collected from 17 SLE patients chosen to represent divergent autoantibody profiles for a cross-sectional analysis. Nine of these patients were sampled during both inactive and active disease for a paired investigation. Five of the serum sample pairs were obtained from patients with SLE who had been investigated concerning autoantibodies and classical complement function, C3 and C3d as measures of disease activity, on serum (complement function) and EDTA plasma (C3 and C3d) frozen at −70°C within four hours of sampling. According to our experience, lowered measures of classical complement function, or increased C3d/C3 ratios, are the most sensitive complement markers of increased SLE disease activity. The less active disease samples were defined as having at least 50% decrease in the C3d/C3 ratio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311434938">8</xref></sup> and 50% increased classical complement function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311434938">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311434938">9</xref></sup> or 100% amelioration of any of the two as compared with the sample representing the most active disease state. Four pairs were obtained from patients with SLE nephritis among whom the inactive sample were defined by a 50% reduction in disease activity as determined by SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311434938">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203311434938">11</xref></sup> These patients were also investigated concerning complement component C1q by rocket electrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203311434938">12</xref></sup> and C3 and C4 levels by nephelometry with levels expressed as the percentage of the levels in normal blood donors.

<sec id="sec15-0961203311434938" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have determined the levels and degree of enrichment of specific autoantibodies incorporated in circulating ICs isolated from SLE sera. We analyzed samples for a large panel of ANA-associated autoantibodies and demonstrated that in particular autoantibodies specific for RNA-associated autoantigens were enriched in PEG precipitates from SLE sera. All investigated autoantibody specificities, except anti-dsDNA, were enriched in PEG precipitates compared with in parallel sera.</p>
<p>Whereas the enrichment of antibodies against the DNA-associated antigens histones and nucleosomes as well as against the cytoplasmic ribosomal P antigen were not significantly different from anti-dsDNA, this was the case for the RNA-associated autoantibody specificities RNP/Sm and SSA/Ro52; the other RNA-associated specificities exhibited similar trends. These findings, which were corroborated by analysis of autoantibody content in C1q-bound IC using a technique developed to dissociate IC-bound antibodies with preserved reactivity, were in agreement with our hypothesis based on earlier in vitro functional studies of SLE IC. We had also hypothesized that anti-SSA autoantibodies would show a more pronounced enrichment in IC during times of SLE flares, but an investigation of paired samples could not confirm this hypothesis, and no difference in IC enrichment between active and inactive SLE was recorded for any of the investigated autoantibody specificities.</p>
<p>In our study the enrichment ratios determined for anti-RNP/Sm, anti-SSA and anti-SSB (median 29 to 54) were much higher than the ratios described by Skinner and Maddison, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311434938">7</xref></sup> who presented median enrichment levels varying between 1 and 3 for the investigated autoantibody specificities using the same method of calculating enrichment as in our studies. The enrichment of anti-single stranded DNA (ssDNA) in that study was at the same magnitude as described for anti-dsDNA in our report. However, in the preceding study the same low degree of enrichment was recorded for all the investigated autoantibodies, without any difference between autoantibodies directed against RNA- and DNA-associated autoantigens. Conversely, the authors demonstrated a significantly enhanced enrichment of anti-SSA during active disease, supporting our initial hypothesis, but determined no disease activity association for antibodies against SSB and ssDNA. For antibodies against the RNP/Sm complex they reported a significantly decreased degree of autoantibody enrichment during active disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311434938">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Besides showing a difference in IC enrichment between autoantibodies against RNA- and DNA-associated autoantigens not hitherto reported, our present study has also studied antibodies against dsDNA and Sm, the two ANA-associated autoantibodies included in the current SLE critiera.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203311434938">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203311434938">20</xref></sup> It also presents enrichment data for autoantibodies against the DNA-associated autoantigens histones and nucleosomes, the cytoplasmic ribosomal P antigen and anti-SSA/Ro52. An intriguing finding in our study is the high degree of enrichment of anti-SSA/Ro52 autoantibodies in SLE IC. Early immunoprecipitation techniques could detect only anti-SSA/Ro60 and anti-SSB autoantibodies, and isolated anti-SSA/Ro52 are precipitin-negative in conventional autoantibody testing using DID.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203311434938">21</xref></sup> Our results therefore indicate a potential role for anti-SSA/Ro52 in IC-mediated pathology in SLE.</p>
<p>In initial experiments we failed to detect PEG-precipitated autoantibodies by using an anti-SSA ELISA but were successful in defining IC autoantibody specificities with two separate lineblot assays (besides the one employed in this paper, also with InnoLia [Innogenetics, Zwijnaarde, BEL]). For this and for practical reasons, the linearity between the densitometrically defined autoantibody content was not evaluated against quantitative enzyme immunoassays for each single antigen. When comparing the corresponding lineblot assay for vasculitis-associated autoantibodies in sera with enzyme immunoassays, there were strong correlations for anti-PR3 and anti-GBM levels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.81–0.82, unpublished results). The choice of lineblot assay was based on the availability of the non-subjective densitometrical evaluation of autoantibody levels using the Euroimmun assay.</p>
<p>In our previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311434938">6</xref></sup> DID was used for autoantibody detection. DID is known to have a low sensitivity but to be highly specific for the detection of precipitable SLE-associated autoantibodies as compared with ELISA-based assays. The Euroimmune lineblot has been validated against DID and ELISA in our laboratory for autoantibodies against the precipitable antigens RNP, Sm, SSA and SSB, and was demonstrated to have a sensitivity between these techniques, and closer to DID than to ELISA. Antibodies against SSA/Ro52 do not precipitate and are therefore not detected by DID.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203311434938">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>PEG-precipitation removes most free antibodies and antigens, but there is a risk of carrying over single antibodies or larger non-immune molecules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203311434938">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203311434938">23</xref></sup> possibly influencing the results in the lineblot assay. We therefore also analyzed the autoantibody specificities in IC bound to solid phase C1q. C1q-bound IC contained only autoantibodies directed to RNP/Sm, Sm, SSA 60kD, Ro52, SSB and nucleosomes; the same antibodies that had the highest levels of enrichment in PEG-precipitated IC. There was no occurrence of anti-dsDNA, anti-histones and anti-ribosomal P autoantibodies. These three autoantibodies were also the ones having the lowest degree of IC enrichment in our PEG-precipitation study. The results were thus in agreement between the two methods concerning which autoantibodies accumulate in ICs. Although we have used two different approaches to investigate which autoantibody specificities are enriched in SLE ICs, we cannot rule out that differences in avidity between the investigated autoantibody specificities might have influenced re-association of ICs, and thus have affected the amount of measured autoantibody and enrichment levels in ICs.</p>
<p>IC-mediated inflammation is typical for flares and ongoing organ damage, particularly with kidney involvement in SLE, and many studies support the view that anti-dsDNA antibodies are involved in SLE nephritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203311434938">24</xref></sup> Three main hypotheses exist concerning the deposition of anti-dsDNA in kidneys: as preformed circulating IC; or as monomeric antibodies either reacting with planted nuclear antigens; or cross reacting with kidney autoantigens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203311434938">25</xref></sup> In general, the two latter hypotheses concerning deposition of non-complexed autoantibodies are discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203311434938">26</xref></sup> No such theories have been published concerning other SLE-associated autoantibodies.</p>
<p>The presence of autoantibodies with other specificities in addition to anti-dsDNA, including antibodies to Sm, SSA, SSB, the collagen-like region of C1q and chromatin have been demonstrated in glomeruli from SLE patients with kidney involvement, with known autoantibodies comprising up to 10% but mostly below 1% of the total amount of deposited IgG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203311434938">27</xref></sup> The same study also reported that enrichment of antibodies against the RNA associated autoantigens Sm, SSA, and SSB in kidney extracts exceeded that of antibodies to dsDNA. In our present study of circulating ICs the RNA-associated specificities were significantly more enriched than the anti-dsDNA antibodies, possibly reflecting that different mechanisms are involved in the localization of autoantibodies with different specificities in the kidney. Levels of anti-dsDNA in ICs have also been shown to be decreased very early during SLE flares, possibly due to tissue deposition of anti-dsDNA antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203311434938">28</xref></sup> In addition, positively charged antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203311434938">29</xref></sup> and especially anti-dsDNA antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203311434938">30</xref></sup> bind more strongly to glomerular basement membrane compared with non-cationic antibodies in SLE. As a consequence, anti-dsDNA antibodies possibly form IC more easily in situ rather than in the circulation. Tron et al. have reported that the presence of specifically detected DNA-anti-DNA complexes only constitutes a minor part of circulating ICs detected by PEG-assay,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203311434938">31</xref></sup> suggesting either that the assay itself does not detect all DNA-anti-DNA complexes or that other antigen-antibody systems constitute the major IC components in SLE sera. These data are in agreement with our finding of low enrichment of anti-dsDNA and other autoantibodies against DNA-associated autoantigens, as compared with autoantibodies against RNA-associated intracellular proteins.</p>
<p>Although not significant at group level, a number of patients indeed displayed enrichment of anti-dsDNA in PEG-precipitates. Whether these patients represent a subgroup of SLE patients could not be determined in our study and thus warrants further investigation in a larger cohort of SLE patients.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to characterize the relative enrichment in IC of various SLE-associated autoantibodies. Patient selection was thus in the first place based on the diversified presence of autoantibodies. The second priority was to investigate paired sera from active and inactive SLE, respectively, and to assess various autoantibodies’ content therein. Definition of more or less active disease was based on SLEDAI or markedly different degree of complement activation. The two groups also differed significantly concerning levels of circulating C1q-binding IC. However, no difference was noted in anti-dsDNA levels between the two groups. This might partly explain the fact that we determined no differences in autoantibody enrichment between active and inactive SLE.</p>
<p>Our findings in this study are in agreement with what we have previously reported in our in vitro cellular studies of IC function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311434938">6</xref></sup> wherein increased levels of IC-induced cytokines were associated with both increased classical complement activation and the occurrence of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, but not with anti-dsDNA, in SLE sera. We have also previously demonstrated that IFN-α is induced from plasmacytoid dendritic cells by apoptotic cells combined with SLE IgG containing anti-RNP, but is not clearly associated with anti-dsDNA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203311434938">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203311434938">33</xref></sup> Our findings are further supported by our previous studies on Sjögren’s syndrome patients in whom anti-SSA/SSB-positive sera, together with either apoptotic or necrotic cells, induced IFN-α production from plasmacytoid dendritic cells or PBMC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203311434938">34</xref></sup> While our earlier studies have either indirectly implicated autoantibodies against RNA-associated autoantigens in the formation of circulating ICs and their cytokine-stimulating effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311434938">6</xref></sup> or used in vitro formed ICs containing such autoantibodies,<sup>32-34</sup> we have now used two independent techniques to demonstrate that those autoantibodies also preferentially contribute to the formation of circulating ICs in SLE in vivo. Our study supports the concept that autoantibodies against RNA-associated antigens are prone to form circulating ICs in SLE, in contrast to antibodies against DNA-associated autoantigens which do not form circulating ICs to the same extent but which may act by direct binding in the target tissues to form immune deposits in situ. At present we do not know whether these circulating ICs containing anti-U1RNP, anti-Sm, anti-SSA and anti-SSB autoantibodies are the source of autoantibodies detected in SLE kidneys or whether they deposit as individual antibodies, as is the currently favoured theory for anti-dsDNA. This issue, as well as whether the mechanisms for IC-induced cytokine induction that we have studied in experimental systems in solution also apply to tissue-bound SLE IC, will be subject to further studies.</p></sec>
