<p>With the Euro crisis reaching ever deeper depths and with the 2008 financial crisis still fresh in the memory, it is tempting to look for parallels in history. Many people cannot resist this temptation, most often by comparing the present crisis to that of the 1930s. However, history does not repeat itself, and specific periods of time should be studied in their own particular context. When it comes to the study of the gloomy 1930s, one should turn to Zara Steiner’s <italic>The Triumph of the Dark: European International History 1933–1939</italic>, the author’s follow-up to <italic>The Lights that Failed: European International History 1919–1933</italic>. In a dazzling, fact-packed 1200 pages, Steiner gives a dramatic account of the coming catastrophe, without falling into a deterministic trap.</p>
<p>Steiner argues that Hitler’s rise to power was founded on ideologies which democratic perceptions could neither penetrate nor arrest. Hitler plays a central role in her book, and justifiably so, as it can be argued that he was the most important politician of the 1930s. It was the <italic>Führer</italic> who set Germany and eventually Europe and the rest of the world on the path to war.</p>
<p>The author has some tough nuts to crack with certain individuals, for example the French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier, who, despite repeated warnings of Germany’s long-term intentions and the recognition of the Nazi threat by the French military establishment, took no decisive action. As Steiner writes, less that a week after the advent of the Nazis, 638 million francs were slashed from the national defence budget. Between 1931 and 1934, ‘military spending was cut by more than 25% overall. The military’s warnings were dismissed by their political masters’ (25–6). This, however, is judging with hindsight. Could the French, and the British as well, really have known Hitler’s and Germany’s intentions by 1931 or even 1934, when the Nazis had been in power for only one year?</p>
<p>Steiner correctly gives much attention to the Munich Conference of 1938, the epitome of British and French appeasement, for which they have been blamed ever since by historians as well as politicians; again, this is mostly judging with hindsight, as it only later became clear that Hitler could not be appeased. The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his French counterpart were not prepared to go to war over the Sudeten question. In a speech to the British nation of 27 September 1938, Chamberlain stated:<disp-quote>
<p>How horrible, fantastic, incredible is it that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing. It seems still more impossible that a quarrel which has already been settled in principle should be the subject of war. (631)</p></disp-quote>Munich represented, in Steiner’s words,<disp-quote>
<p>the apex (or nadir point) of the Anglo-French attempts to reach an accommodation with Hitler in order to avoid war and save their countries from destruction … Munich was decisive for Hitler; he was determined never again to be deterred by others from his decision to fight. (646)</p></disp-quote>Hitler felt the Munich Conference was a major defeat. He had wanted to settle the alignment of the Sudeten Germans by war, but saw this desire frustrated by France and Great Britain. As Ian Kershaw has written in his <italic>Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis</italic>, ‘he felt cheated of the greater triumph which he was certain would have come from the limited war with the Czechs which had been his aim all summer. Even military action for the more restricted goal of attaining the Sudetenland by force had been denied him’. Steiner follows the same argument in the chapter ‘The fog of peace’. For a man driven ‘by his own sense of mortality and belief in his own unlimited power the set-back, however temporary, was intolerable’ (672). After Munich, Hitler was determined not to be restrained from war when the next opportunity – Poland – came. By then, German rearmament had been in progress for some years. The <italic>Wehrmacht</italic> would achieve impressive results in the first years of World War II, but was, as Steiner correctly states, by no means the mechanized juggernaut that has often been portrayed. Just like soldiers from all ages, ‘the vast majority of German soldiers would go to war on foot’ (834). In that sense, they differed little from the Roman legions or Napoleon’s <italic>Grande Armée</italic>.</p>
<p>According to Steiner, the demise of the Weimar Republic and the triumph of Hitler proved the motor force of destructive systemic change. It was Hitler’s decision to go to war. His response to Germany’s difficult situation was to launch his war, ‘in spite of, or perhaps because of, the long-term impossibility of matching the combined production of the western industrial powers’ (1043). History would prove him right. That Germany could once again make a bid for European domination as it had done in 1914, was brought about, according to Steiner, by the fact that some of the causes of World War I were not resolved by the peacemakers, who, most importantly, left Germany’s power base fundamentally intact. That would be different after World War II.</p>
<p>It was not only <italic>realpolitik</italic> which determined the outcome of the 1930s. In Steiner’s convincing view, ideological assumptions affected the way statesmen and their advisers saw the world about them. For example, it mattered that Chamberlain hated war and believed that wasteful arms races led to conflict, or that Hitler believed in Social Darwinism, <italic>Lebensraum</italic> and the Aryan race. Although these views may have been the highest and most despicable nonsense, they at least partly determined Hitler’s policy, especially with regard to the Jews. In 1939, when Steiner ends her book, the Holocaust was as yet unimaginable. In the conclusion, the author apologizes for the great number of pages she has used. She should not have: her thorough analysis, skilful handling of the sources and convincing argumentation, has made <italic>The Triumph of the Dark</italic> a stimulating and rewarding affair.</p>
