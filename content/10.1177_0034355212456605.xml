<abstract>
<p>Student attitudes toward having a relationship with a wheelchair user were explored. Participants initially selected one of six opposite gender head shots and subsequently viewed their selection’s whole body photograph in a wheelchair along with reading a short biography. Primarily undergraduate Hispanic and Caucasian students (<italic>N</italic> = 810) were surveyed regarding their interest in potentially being friends, dating, or marrying a wheelchair user, with 66% indicating they would have no problem dating or marrying a wheelchair user. Chi-square tests of pairwise association, logistical regression, and test of proportional odds revealed significant differences, <italic>p</italic> = .001, between ethnicity, gender, type of relationship, and having had a prior disability relationship. Personal traits of intelligence, humor, kindness, and physical appearance were rated most highly. Those unwilling to date or marry their selection perceived the partner would require too much caregiving, social interaction awkwardness, inability to sexually perform, and the partner being sick often. Counselors can benefit from informing clients about intimacy misconceptions by role-playing and providing clients with insights regarding societal beliefs.</p>

<body>
<p>For Americans and most of Western society, the desire to look young and physically appealing has become, in many cases, almost an obsession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355212456605">Seligman, 1994</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355212456605">Seligman (1994)</xref> indicated that Americans spend billions of dollars each year on products promising to help lose weight, stay fit, look younger, and improve physical appearance. Sex appeal and sexuality are at the forefront of the billion-dollar, mass-marketing industry that floods our senses daily with television, magazine, the Internet, and essentially all other forms of mass media ads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0034355212456605">Reichert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355212456605">Reichert &amp; McRee Walker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355212456605">Seligman, 1994</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355212456605">Reichert and McRee Walker (2005)</xref> conclude from their study and literature review, “sex sells” (p. 131).</p>
<p>Virtually absent, however, from most forms of the media are people with disabilities advertising clothing, enjoying beverages, dining at restaurants, ordering pizza, and otherwise engaging in other social activities. Aside from the general absence of persons with disabilities (PWDs) seemingly enjoying life are the all too typical media portrayals of PWDs on television and the movies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355212456605">Byrd &amp; Elliott, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034355212456605">Zola, 1991</xref>). Most depictions generally portray PWDs as hospital patients, helpless victims, sociopaths, role-less, jobless, asexual, unattractive, in turmoil, and generally not enjoying a happy story ending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355212456605">Byrd &amp; Elliott, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212456605">Smart, 2009</xref>). The overall message conveyed directly and indirectly is that PWDs are simply not a part of the American mainstream culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0034355212456605">Zola, 1991</xref>). Therefore, to think of PWDs as sexual beings, worthy of dating or marrying, likely becomes an image that many persons without a disability might not otherwise entertain.</p>
<p>Empirical literature in this specific area is marginal, especially with regard to Hispanics and Caucasians. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355212456605">Greenwell and Hough (2008)</xref> conducted a content review of existing sexuality and disability studies, specifically those that examined cultural similarities and differences. They found that ethnic and racial minorities (all but Caucasian) were underrepresented in the studies, and suggested that racial minorities might be underrecruited in studies about disability and sexuality.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to explore the attitudes of primarily nondisabled undergraduate Hispanic and Caucasian students with regard to being friends, dating, or marrying someone with a physical disability. We further investigated students who were not interested in a more intimate relationship, by comparing reasons for their opinions in relation to common misconceptions about disability in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini, Chen, Feist, Flores-Torres, &amp; Del Castillo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212456605">Smart, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of romantic relationships for people with disabilities has been gaining increased attention recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212456605">Chen, Brodwin, Cardoso, &amp; Chan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212456605">Man, Rojahn, Chrosniak, &amp; Sanford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller, Chen, Glover-Graf, &amp; Kranz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355212456605">Rojahn, Komelasky, &amp; Man, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034355212456605">Taleporos &amp; McCabe, 2003</xref>). Individuals with physical disabilities encounter challenges related to dating and marriage such as caregiving issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355212456605">Marini, 2012</xref>), acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355212456605">Kreuter, 2000</xref>), sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355212456605">Singh &amp; Sharma, 2005</xref>), and negative societal expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355212456605">Howland &amp; Rintala, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals without disabilities have historically reported being more willing to engage in casual or work relationships with people with disabilities, but less likely to pursue more meaningful relationships such as dating or marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212456605">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). The Miller and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">2009</xref>) study, for example, surveyed 360 predominately Hispanic students and found that students were more willing to pursue acquaintance or friendship relations than dating or marriage relations with PWDs. These differences were smaller for females, however, who were more often willing or very willing to date or marry a PWD than were male students. Willingness to date or marry a PWD, however, became less desirable if the presumed disability was more severe. In addition, participants were asked what personal characteristics might increase their willingness to engage in a more intimate relationship with someone with a disability, noting the highest ranking traits to be an individual’s intelligence, humor, and kindness. Finally, Miller et al. did not find participant social desirability responses to be a significant factor as measured by the <italic>Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale Short Form-C</italic> (M-C Form C Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355212456605">Reynolds, 1982</xref>), therefore, anonymity of responses may have been enough for respondents to feel free answering truthfully.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034355212456605">Hergenrather and Rhodes (2007)</xref> used the <italic>Disability Social Relations Generalized Disability Scale</italic> (DSRGD) to explore attitudes toward PWDs across social contexts such as dating, marriage, and work. Undergraduate students rated their attitudes on three subscales (Dating, Marriage, and Work). Participants reported more positive attitudes toward PWDs in the workplace, followed by a willingness to marry and date. The authors found results consistent with existing literature in regard to females having significantly more positive attitudes than males toward interacting with PWDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212456605">Chen et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355212456605">Findler, Vilchinsky, &amp; Werner 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0034355212456605">Yuker, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of previous attitude studies, however, have been criticized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355212456605">Wright (1988)</xref> regarding their research methodology as having a fundamental negative bias due to what she refers to as the stranger effect. Wright argued that such paper and pencil surveys make the disability the only salient feature of the individual, essentially asking survey takers whether they would consider dating or marrying someone with a disability who they know nothing about, let alone what they look like. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al. (2011)</xref> agreed, arguing such attitude surveys are methodologically flawed simply because in real life situations, individuals choose potential partners from at least having seen them as well as knowing something about them. Numerous online dating websites are based on this premise as well, including photographs, interests, and background information.</p>
<p>The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212456605">Man et al. (2006)</xref> represents one of the few studies where photographs and brief vignettes of PWDs and those without a disability were used. The authors surveyed 123 students to identify romantic attraction, as determined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355212456605">Campbell’s (1999)</xref> <italic>Romantic Attraction Scale</italic> (RAS). Two ethnic groups were mainly represented in this study, namely, Caucasians and Asians. The authors also included several disability categories including persons with amputations, visual impairments, hearing impairments, wheelchair users, limb deformities, use of braces, and invisible disabilities, which were inconsequentially mentioned in each individual’s short biography. Student respondents were equally attracted to individuals of the opposite sex whether a physical disability was present or not; however, ethnicity played a significant role when rating attractiveness. Caucasians and Asians rated people from their own ethnic group as more attractive than people from other ethnic groups. In addition, motivational characteristics such as curiosity, honor, and family, as well as the degree of comfort in interacting with people with and without disabilities were found to have an influence on the expressed romantic attraction of the participants. No efforts were made to control for social desirability, which the authors hypothesized could have explained some of their results.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355212456605">Rojahn et al. (2008)</xref>, however, replicated and extended the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212456605">Man et al. (2006)</xref> to consider social desirability. They measured the romantic attractiveness of individuals with and without disabilities as measured in the previous study, but used the RAS and the <italic>Implicit Association Test</italic> (IAT). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355212456605">Rojahn et al. (2008)</xref> added the IAT as a measure of implicit attitudes toward groups of individuals to determine consistency between reported attitudes and implicit measures of physical well-being versus disability. Gender differences regarding willingness to date and marry PWDs using photographs were again paired with short vignettes or biographies. The photographs represented male and female students who were African American, Asian, Hispanic, or Caucasian. The vignettes described these students either with or without disabilities in terms of work, school, athletics, and community achievements. If a student was described in the vignette as having a disability, it was presented in terms of functional implications and was balanced in regard to gender and ethnic groups. The results were similar to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212456605">Man et al. (2006)</xref> study in that participants overtly expressed potential romantic attraction to people with disabilities; however, the measurement of implicit attitudes reflected prejudice against disability. The authors hypothesized that the discrepancies between their previous findings versus their 2008 findings were likely due to detecting a social desirability bias in participant responses on the RAS.</p>
<p>Other than the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212456605">Man et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355212456605">Rojahn et al. (2008)</xref> relationship studies using photographs and a bio of persons with and without disabilities, all other attitude and intimate relationship studies have been basically paper and pencil, therefore making disability the only salient identifying feature of the individual. Respondents are essentially asked to give their opinion regarding intimacy with a stranger with a disability the respondent knows nothing else about. The methodological flaws and negative bias of such studies would seem to be self-evident. The present study explored a more realistic depiction of how individuals otherwise make initial decisions about potential partners by being able to see a picture and learn a little information about the individual. Not to focus solely on the disability, respondents were asked to rate what characteristics most attracted them to someone, and conversely reasons why they may not be interested in having a more intimate relationship with a wheelchair user. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al. (2011)</xref> study was replicated here to consider ethnic differences between primarily Caucasian and Hispanic students. As such, the following research questions were posed:</p>

<sec id="section2-0034355212456605">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 810 students from two public universities in the mid- and southwest region of the United States took part in this study. For inferential statistical analysis, only 708 (398 Hispanics and 310 Caucasians representing 87.4% of the total sample) participants were considered due to the lack of power resulting from small cell sizes for Asians, African Americans, Native Americans, and Other (<italic>n</italic> = 91). In addition, 11 respondents were not included due to missing data. Demographically, all 810 participants were used for rank frequencies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0034355212456605">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0034355212456605">6</xref>) and demographics indicating that 63% (<italic>n</italic> = 513) were female, and 91% were undergraduate students (<italic>n</italic> = 739). Student major included 57% (<italic>n</italic> = 466) other, psychology 15.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 127), rehabilitation services 14.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 120), 9.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 80) from business, and 1.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 15) from engineering. The average age of participants was 22.3 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.18). Finally, 33% (<italic>n</italic> = 267) of participants reported knowing someone with a disability (e.g., relative, friend, or child), and 4.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 33) reported having a disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0034355212456605">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>We received permission to use photographs of the 12 wheelchair models found in the magazine <italic>New Mobility</italic> as well as public domain photographs found on the Internet. Trained research assistants and a faculty member solicited participants primarily from undergraduate classes from several disciplines at the two respective universities. The research assistants would arrive at each class at least 10 min early to lay out the survey packets. Class sizes generally ranged from 30 to 80 students; therefore, at least 55 packets of each model and survey were available in case a majority of any class selected the same model (therefore 55 × 12 = 660 packets). To safeguard against running out of any one model, class demographics (e.g., males to females) were obtained in advance. Once students had assembled in a classroom, one of the researchers would deceptively describe this voluntary study as “how people choose relationships.”</p>
<p>Following this component, one research assistant initially handed out just the six female head shots all on a single page to all the males, and another handed out just the six male head shots all on a separate page to all the females. Participants were then asked to select the relevant head shot they deemed to be most physically attractive, then return the sheet to the front of the room and select the packet number (1–6 for males) or letter (A–F) for females that matched the photo they had selected. On returning to their seats with the packet, participants found a full body shot of their selected individual seated in a wheelchair, along with a one paragraph biographical sketch noting his or her education, interests, living status, and employment. Following this page was the survey. After completing the survey, respondents would return all paperwork in the enclosed packet to the front, where the research assistant gathered the information. Survey administration took approximately 20 min, after which the research assistant debriefed the class regarding the true nature of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0034355212456605">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The survey packet contained four parts, as it was in the initial survey development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al., 2011</xref>). The first elicited demographic information about participant’s age, race, sex, academic major, level of education, marital status, disability status, and close personal relationship with a PWD (e.g., spouse, child, or relative). The second part consisted of three statements assessing the level of willingness of participants to befriend, date, or marry the person they selected or hypothetically someone like the individual who uses a wheelchair. Willingness was measured using a 6-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>very unwilling</italic>, 2 = <italic>somewhat unwilling</italic>, 3 = <italic>a little unwilling</italic>, 4 = <italic>a little willing</italic>, 5 = <italic>somewhat willing</italic>, 6 = <italic>very willing</italic>). Respondents answered each of these three questions separately using the scale, and Cronbach’s alpha was .81. The third part of the survey asked participants to select from a list of 14 personal characteristics they felt were important to them in making decisions about any type of potential partner (not the one specifically pictured). Examples of personal characteristics included humor, kindness, intelligence, appearance, confidence, wealth, and sexy in appearance. The final part of the survey asked participants to rate the reasons why they might not consider establishing an intimate relationship with a wheelchair user. Examples were drawn from the literature regarding popular attitudes and misconceptions including sexuality and disability, awkwardness, caregiver burden, inability for the disabled partner to have sexual relations, and the partner with a disability often being sick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355212456605">Miller &amp; Marini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355212456605">Olkin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212456605">Smart, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The photographs used were the same six male and six female models in wheelchairs selected in the initial study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al., 2011</xref>). We rated and chose who we believed to be the most attractive models by narrowing down the list by consensus vote. Of the male photographs, four were Caucasian, one African American, and one Hispanic model. Of the female photographs, all six appeared to be Caucasian. The photos were intentionally cropped so participants could only see a head shot of all six males <italic>or</italic> all six females (males were handed the six female head shots, and females were handed the six male head shots). As previously noted, individual (single) full body photos of each model were placed in identified individualized packets with a one-paragraph descriptive biography and a copy of the survey.</p>

<sec id="section5-0034355212456605">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The dependent variables were willingness to be friends, date, or marry a wheelchair user as measured using a 6-point Likert-type scale. Due to the sparseness of responses in three categories for unwillingness, we combined them into one category of “unwilling.” Therefore, there were four categories of willingness. The four categories of willingness to be friends with a wheelchair user were further collapsed into two: “less than very willing” and “very willing.” The independent variables measured were ethnicity, age, past/present relationship to someone with a disability, gender, marital status, and school major. Chi-square test was used to test pairwise associations. For the binary dependent variable, willingness to be friends with a wheelchair user, logistic regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212456605">Agresi, 2002</xref>) was used to study the effects of the independent variables. Because of the ordinal multicategory nature of the two dependent variables, we used cumulative logit model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355212456605">Agresi, 2002</xref>) and partial proportional odds model effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355212456605">Peterson &amp; Harrell, 1990</xref>) of dependent variables on willingness to date or marry relationships. Test of proportional odds was used to evaluate the feasibility of either partial proportional odds model or the cumulative logit model. Finally, frequencies were calculated regarding the most desirable personal characteristics people look for in a potential partner as well as potential reasons why persons without a disability may not be interested in having a more intimate relationship with someone who uses a wheelchair.</p>

<p>The distributions of willingness to be friends with a wheelchair user among different independent variable levels are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0034355212456605">Table 2</xref>. In addition, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0034355212456605">Table 2</xref> contains the results of the chi-square test pairwise association between the binary dependent variable willingness of being a friend with each independent variable. Race, gender, and past/present relationship with someone with a disability were significantly associated with respondents’ willingness to be friends with a wheelchair user. Logistic regression fit the data well, LR χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 55.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The model explained 11.5% of variation in the binary dependent variable. Compared with Caucasians, Hispanic young people (younger than 20 years) are less likely (odds ratio [OR] = 0.51) to be very willing to be friends with a wheelchair user, given all other variables held constant. Compared with males, female respondents are more likely (OR = 3.17) to be very willing to have a friend relationship with a wheelchair user. Similarly, those participants who had a past experience or a relationship with someone with a disability were also more likely (OR = 1.53) to be very willing to be friends with a wheelchair user when holding other variables constant. Results further showed marital status and age are not significantly correlated with willingness to be friends with a wheelchair user.</p>

<p>Both the distributions of willingness to date a wheelchair user among different independent variable levels and the results of pairwise chi-square test of association are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0034355212456605">Table 3</xref>. All five independent variables are significantly associated with respondents’ willingness to date a wheelchair user. Test of proportional odds (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) indicated feasibility of partial proportional odds model, instead of a cumulative logit model. Partial proportional odds model yielded results that Hispanic respondents were less likely to be somewhat or more willing to date a wheelchair user when compared with Caucasian respondents. As with being friends, female respondents had an increased probability of being willing to date a wheelchair user than did male participants, when other variables were held constant. Also, older respondents over age 25 were more willing to date someone who used a wheelchair than students 20 or younger. The remaining results are found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0034355212456605">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>The third research question exploring gender and race/ethnicity differences in considering dating or marrying someone who used a wheelchair generated frequency percentages. As with the previous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al. (2011)</xref> study showing 66% of primarily Hispanics indicating they would essentially have no problem dating or marrying a wheelchair user, the present study combining Caucasians with Hispanics again showed an overall 66% of respondents reporting no problems dating or marrying a wheelchair user. In comparing frequency differences, 313 of 316 (99%) Caucasians compared with 379 of 402 (94.3%) Hispanics were a little willing to very willing. Gender differences in the present study revealed that 434 of 513 females (84.6%) were a little willing to very willing to consider dating or marrying a wheelchair user compared with 207 of 293 (70.6%) of males.</p>
<p>Finally, Research Question 4 regarding reasons why participants would not consider dating or marrying a wheelchair user was analyzed for the remaining 33% of participants. The most frequently cited reason was the perception that dating a wheelchair user would involve “too much work” or caregiving (22.7%). The second most frequently cited reason was the partner would “feel awkward” being around the wheelchair user (22.2%). Rounding out the top five reasons were perceptions of inability to perform sexually (21%), wheelchair user would be sick too often (20.2%), and the respondent was not attracted to the wheelchair user (18.1%). Remaining responses and frequencies can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0034355212456605">Table 6</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When study participants were provided with a photograph and short biography about a wheelchair user who they perceive to be physically appealing, 66% of participants indicated that they would have no problems dating or marrying someone if he or she was a wheelchair user. These results are somewhat similar to more recent findings regardless of photograph or biography, most notably females expressing a greater willingness to be friends, date, and marry a wheelchair user as well as persons who have had or presently have some type of contact or relationship with someone with a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212456605">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355212456605">Man et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). Particularly in this expanded replication study exploring ethnic differences between Hispanics and Caucasian students, it appears that although primarily female Hispanic students overall are more willing to be friends, date, and marry someone with a disability, female Caucasian students expressed somewhat more positive attitudes along the same relationship variables. These findings may suggest that women are more comfortable, and perhaps it is more so socially expected of them in our society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212456605">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355212456605">Findler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355212456605">Milligan &amp; Neufeldt, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al. (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller et al. (2009)</xref> studies, students rated intelligence, kindness, sense of humor, and physical attractiveness, respectively, as the top rated qualities. Although physical appearance has historically not been cited in previous studies, the reasons for this are likely twofold. First, the majority of past studies have not used photos but rather paper and pencil surveys only making the disability salient. Second, our study not only used photos of potential partners, but arguably physically attractive photos as well, thus making appearance salient first before the disability. Presenting a short biography of an individual’s interests, education, employment, and living status also more closely resembled real life partner selection decisions.</p>
<p>For the remaining 33% of students in the study who indicated not being interested in pursuing a more intimate dating or marriage relationship with a wheelchair user, reasons given were that participants perceived their partners would be too much work in terms of caregiving. The concept of perceived burden has been empirically supported previously as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller et al. (2009)</xref> found that Hispanic students were less willing to be friends, date, or marry someone with a physical disability, mental disability, and sensory impairment if the disability was described as more severe in functioning. Similar findings were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034355212456605">Taleporos and McCabe (2003)</xref> as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355212456605">Milligan and Neufeldt (1998)</xref> found that females without a disability possessed more positive attitudes toward dating males with spinal cord injury (SCI) if the male was independent and self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Perceived caregiver burden was argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355212456605">Olkin (1999)</xref> who claimed researcher bias with preconceived assumptions that living or caring for a loved one with a disability would indeed be a burden. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355212456605">Marini’s (2012)</xref> extensive literature review regarding caregivers found that caregiving has both costs and rewards in terms of altruism and purposeful meaning versus caregiver stress and perceived burden. He cited media portrayals of PWDs as a possible cause of such presumptions; however, he also noted in situations where the severity of disability, isolation from others, and extensive number of hours of direct care do indeed lead to higher rates of caregiver stress. That notwithstanding, is the reality that in the present and previous studies, persons with experience or a past relationship with someone with a disability generally rate more willing to be friends, date, or marry someone with a disability. As such, individuals with previous contact and a lived experience with someone with a disability would appear to be less concerned of caregiving as too much work having learned otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355212456605">Brockelman, Olney, &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355212456605">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Perceived awkwardness being around a wheelchair-using partner was cited as the second most common reason why some participants would not want a more intimate relationship with someone who uses a wheelchair. Social anxiety in interacting with someone with a disability has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355212456605">Grand, Bernier, &amp; Strohmer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034355212456605">Kleck, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355212456605">Leary, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355212456605">Marinelli &amp; Kelz, 1973</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355212456605">Grand et al. (1982)</xref> found social interactions between PWDs and those without a disability contained less eye contact, physical contact, and less meaningful and shorter conversations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0034355212456605">Yuker’s (1988)</xref> exhaustive literature review regarding attitudes toward disability noted overall that increased contact with PWDs generated more positive attitudes and likely minimizes the awkwardness and social anxiety once individuals become more comfortable.</p>
<p>The third-ranked reason why some participants were unwilling to date or marry a wheelchair user was due to the perception that he or she would be unable to perform sexually. This common misperception stems from the belief that individual’s who are paralyzed are likely to have no function whatsoever below their level of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355212456605">Miller &amp; Marini, 2004</xref>). Although there are numerous physical disabilities that require individuals to use a wheelchair, anatomically, the majority of the population can sexually perform. In terms of paralysis such as spinal cord injury, depending on the level of injury, most males can experience erection through stimulation, whereas females often require assistance lubricating through the use of gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355212456605">Miller &amp; Marini, 2004</xref>). The social stigma of PWDs being asexual as well as inaccurate and negative media portrayals regarding sexuality further contributes to societal misperceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355212456605">Mackelprang &amp; Salsgiver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355212456605">Olkin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212456605">Smart, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth-rated reason students reported as reluctant to date or marry a wheelchair user was the perception that the individual would be sick or ill often. This perception is also common again due to media portrayals, televised charity drives such as the muscular dystrophy telethon, and the medical model of disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355212456605">Byrd &amp; Elliott, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355212456605">Olkin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355212456605">Smart, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355212456605">Mackelprang and Salsgiver (2009)</xref> described the common societal belief that PWDs are sick and incapable of caring for themselves.</p>
<sec id="section8-0034355212456605">
<title>Implications for Counselors</title>
<p>Sexuality and disability or discussing sexuality in general is not a topic many counselors feel comfortable exploring. For counselors who are called on by their clients in assisting them with sexuality issues, several findings from the present study may be helpful. First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355212456605">Seligman (1994)</xref> and numerous others have noted for decades, billions of dollars are spent annually marketing ways to enhance physical appearance, and billions more are spent by consumers purchasing such products. Physical appearance is unquestionably an important attribute in Western society. For those clients seeking feedback regarding appearance, counselors can tactfully comply by discussing clothing, hygiene, and assistive aids if relevant.</p>
<p>Second, role-playing potential dating situations may be very helpful for clients who have little or no experience dating, especially because social awkwardness ranks highly as a reason to not consider intimacy with PWDs. Providing clients with constructive feedback regarding ways to place others at ease around them may be beneficial. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355212456605">Evans (1976)</xref> cited the anxiety persons without disabilities can experience interacting with PWDs, with conflicting cognitions of not staring, saying the wrong thing, or otherwise offending the PWD. Evans indicated that it is up to the person with the disability to place others at ease in social interactions, and using appropriate humor to do so can be effective as well as a desirable quality some persons look for in a potential partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355212456605">Marini et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, to combat all the misperceptions regarding PWDs, clients can be taught what some of these more common societal beliefs are so they may be able to discuss or refute them. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034355212456605">Sagatun (1985)</xref> found that persons without disabilities generally prefer those with disabilities to acknowledge their situation and functional status but that PWDs often prefer not to mention their disability unless it is relevant to the conversation. However, in view of the many common misconceptions regarding disability, it would behoove clients with disabilities who are interested in dating to understand and know how to deal with potential partner beliefs that they may be too much work, may be sick often, or may not be able to perform sexually. Clients can then make the decision as to if, or when, to dispel any misconceptions when relevant to conversations.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations, the first of which is the generalizability of results because this was a convenience sample of undergraduate students and does not represent the views of the community at large. Second, although our survey was anonymous, it is unknown as to what effect social desirability responding may have occurred among some participants as it was not measured. Literature suggests that in some studies such responding has an impact, whereas in others measuring it, the effect seems negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355212456605">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). Third, the study does not account for persons who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT), and likely incorrectly assumes all participants were heterosexual. Although their inclusion was discussed in our preliminary planning meetings, we were unable to think of a procedure that would confidentially allow those not comfortable with self-identifying to participate. Finally, although there were some Asian Americans, African Americans, and Native Americans who self-identified taking part in the study, the small sample sizes did not allow for adequate power to consider them for some analyses. As such, future research in this area could explore intimacy attitudes of these other minority groups as well as using photographs of persons with other visible disabilities such as blindness, facial disfigurement, or amputations. Another fruitful area study regarding relationships attitudes and disability involves face-to-face interactions such as speed dating.</p>
