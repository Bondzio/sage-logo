<abstract>
<sec><title>Aims and background:</title>
<p>Erlotinib approval was supported by the positive results of a large multicentric phase III trial (BR.21 study) that included 10% Asiatic patients and the remaining were North-American Caucasian. It is well-known that the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is strongly influenced by ethnicity and other genetic factors. It is, therefore, relevant to establish whether the same profile of efficacy is seen in an unselected population and whether the results of BR.21 can be generalized to other patient populations, such as that described here.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Methods:</title>
<p>In this retrospective, observational, multicentric study, we assessed effectiveness and potentially response predictive factors in 222 unselected Italian patients, with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer, with performance status from 0 to 3, who had received at least one line of chemotherapy, treated with the standard dose of erlotinib (150 mg once daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Results:</title>
<p>The disease control rate was 60.9% (135 patients). Median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 3.1 months and 7.97 months, respectively. The characteristics of non-smoker, female gender, performance status 0 or 1 were associated with a significantly better prognosis in terms of disease control rate and were also predictive of longer overall survival and progression-free survival. The 1-year survival rate was 38.79%. Even though Italian patients baseline characteristics were strongly different to those reported in pivotal BR.21 trial in terms of age, performance status, line treatment and ethnic group, our study confirms the favorable effectiveness profile in real clinical practice of erlotinib according to results from the pivotal study BR.21.</p>
</sec>
<sec><title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Today, we know that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status assessment is mandatory before starting first-line therapy and that the presence of only certain clinical characteristics initially associated with sensitivity to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as reported in this study, is not sufficient in selecting patients candidates to such treatments.</p>

<p>Lung cancer is not only the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, but it is still the leading cause for cancer-related death. The 5-year survival for lung cancer in Europe and in the USA is totally 16%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212465994">1</xref></sup> Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of all lung cancers and is generally diagnosed at advanced stage. Its treatment, whether in second or subsequent line settings, is now highly standardized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212465994">3</xref></sup> Several drugs are active as second-line treatment, including docetaxel, erlotinib and pemetrexed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212465994">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212465994"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212465994">6</xref></sup> Erlotinib has been widely used since its initial approval in 2005, but few data are available on its use in routine settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212465994">7</xref></sup> Targeted therapies have been gradually introduced in the clinical management of NSCLC as a new generation of cytostatic drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212465994">7</xref></sup> These molecules inhibit the cascade of events induced by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, including apoptosis, metastasis development, proliferation. In pivotal trials, the population were selected mainly on the basis of clinical characteristics (sex, race, smoking status) and in some cases did not reflect the real population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212465994">4</xref></sup> The efficacy and safety of erlotinib were demonstrated in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (BR.21),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212465994">8</xref></sup> that included 10% Asiatic patients and the remaining were North-American Caucasian. It is well known that the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is strongly influenced by ethnicity and other genetic factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212465994">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212465994">8</xref></sup> Therefore, a question arises as to whether the results of BR.21 trial can be generalized to other patient populations, such as Europeans. In this context, observational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212465994">3</xref></sup> were designed to evaluate the conditions of use of a new drug, for defining the target population, and for determining effectiveness, tolerability and the public health benefit in real-life use.</p>
<p>The aim of this retrospective, observational, multicentric study, carried out at the lung cancer treatment Centers of the Hospital of Macerata and the SS Annunziata Hospital of Chieti, was to examine the real clinical practice and particularly effectiveness and factors potentially predictive of the response to erlotinib in an Italian unselected population with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, after failure of at least one previous chemotherapy regime.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1078155212465994"><title>Design of the study and population</title>
<p>This observational, multicenter, retrospective epidemiological study was an inter-regional clinical research study conducted in two centres of Oncology. The patients treated with erlotinib were retrospectively enrolled between August 2006 (date of the drug registration in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212465994">9</xref></sup>) and March 2011.</p>
<p>Patients affected by NSCLC were enrolled in the erlotinib treatment according to eligibility criteria established by AIFA: age &gt;18 years; stage IIIb/IV unresectable carcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0–3; failure of at least one previous chemotherapy treatment for the same pathology; adequate hepatic and renal function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212465994">9</xref></sup> The patients were treated with a oral dose of 150 mg/die until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The following data were collected from the medical files: the characteristics of the patients at the time of erlotinib prescription, previous treatments, the line of erlotinib therapy, the response rate (complete response [CR], partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity.</p>
<p>Clinical and laboratory assessments were conducted at baseline, then every 4 weeks throughout the study. Tumor response was assessed using RECIST,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212465994">10</xref></sup> at least every 3 months (by computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or x-ray). For tumors classed as responding, a confirmatory evaluation was carried out 4 weeks after the initial determination of response. For safety and tolerability evaluations, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of any cause were assessed and graded using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 3.0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212465994"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>A patient was assigned SD if he had a response assessment of CR, PR or SD at = /&gt;1 visit but were not confirmed as CR or PR (SD criteria must be met at least for 4 weeks). The disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the sum of CR, PR and SD. PFS was determined from the date of erlotinib initiation until the date of first documented progression according to RECIST objective tumor assessment or until the date of death for any reason in the absence of disease progression. OS was determined from the date of start of treatment until date of death (irrespective of cause).</p>
<p>The DCR according to patients’ baseline characteristics was reported as frequency and compared with Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. OS was calculated from the date of the start of treatment to the date of death for any cause or last follow-up, PFS was calculated from the date of the start of treatment to the date of progression or death for any cause or last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the survival rate, median survival rate and confidence intervals (95%, CI). Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent characteristics associated with OS, PFS and DCR, using Cox proportional hazards model for PFS and OS and logistic regression model for DCR with stepwise variable selection. The following covariates were tested in all the analyses, with the first category of each considered as reference: gender (females, males), age (&lt;70 yrs, ≥70 yrs), ECOG PS (0–1, ≥2), smoking status (non-smoker [smoked &lt; = 100 cigarettes in their lifetime],current or former smoker [smoked &gt; 100 cigarettes in their lifetime]), stage (stage IV IIIB), line of therapy with erlotinib (2nd, 3th and subsequent), tumor histology (adenocarcinoma or bronchoalveolar carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma or other).</p>
<p>All statistical tests were two-sided and <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Statistical Package Release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p>

<p>Between August 2006 and March 2011, a total of 222 patients were monitored. The study population comprised all patients who had received at least one dose of erlotinib. Baseline patient and disease characteristics for the study population are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212465994">Table 1</xref>. Most patients were elderly (48.2% with age &gt; 70): the overall median age was 69 (61–75 interquartile range). Sixty-seven percent of the patients were men. Seventy-eight percent of patients were PS 0 to 1, and the majority (69%) were current/former smokers. Most patients had non-squamous tumor histology (71%), and 85% of patients had stage IV disease. Thirty-six percent of patients received erlotinib as third-line therapy, 63% as second-line therapy.

This drug was approved based on the results of BR.21 trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212465994">8</xref></sup> where it was superior to placebo for OS, PFS and objective tumour response. It is, therefore, relevant to establish whether the same profile of efficacy is seen in an unselected population and whether the results of BR.21 can be generalized to other patient populations, such as that described here.</p>
<p>Subsequent to BR.21, Erlotinib-expanded access programmes were designed to allow access to erlotinib therapy for suitable patients in countries where the drug was not yet licensed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref></sup> Almost 7000 patients have been enrolled into the TRUST study in 52 countries worldwide. This large, global, open-label, phase IV trial confirmed the favorable efficacy and safety profile of erlotinib in a large heterogeneous NSCLC population.</p>
<p>The Italian unselected population of this observational multicenter study shows the following difference baseline characteristics versus the BR.21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212465994">8</xref></sup> study and TRUST study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref></sup> respectively:
<list id="list1-1078155212465994" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A higher median age (69 vs 62; 63);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A better performance status if we consider subgroup with PS 0–1 (78,8 vs 67,6; 75);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A higher percentage in second-line treatment (63,2 vs 50,6; 49);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No patient belonging to the Asian ethnic group, which instead formed 12.9% of the arm with erlotinib in the BR.21 Trial and 20% of the TRUST study;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A higher percentage of non-smoker patients (30.6 vs 21.3; 30).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The median PFS was 3.1 months (95% CI: 2.57–3.8), slightly higher than the value obtained in the BR.21 study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212465994">8</xref></sup> which was, 2.2 months (95% CI: 1.96 – 2.89), but nearly the same assessed in the TRUST study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref></sup> which was 3.25 (95% CI: 2.33–7.19). The median OS for all the patients was 7.97 months (95% CI: 6.59–11.06), similar to the value obtained in BR.21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212465994">8</xref></sup> study and TRUST study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref></sup> which was 6.7 and 7.9, respectively. The 1-year survival rate was nearly the same that was obtained to TRUST study (38.8 vs 37.7), better than the value assessed in the BR 21 study (31.2). The DCR was slightly lower than the value obtained in 5394 patients of the TRUST study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref></sup> (60.9 vs 69). Our analyses also confirm that erlotinib is an effective option for eligible patients with advanced NSCLC in Italian real clinical practice.</p>
<p>In BR.21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212465994">8</xref></sup> study, exploratory multivariate analyses showed that only Asian origin, adenocarcinoma on histologic examination and a history of not smoking status were significant independent predictors of survival after adjustment for treatment and other potential predictors, but only the interaction between smoking status and treatment was significantly predictive of a differential effect on survival. In TRUST study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref></sup> the Cox regression analysis showed that poor ECOG PS (2 or 3), smoking, non-Asian ethnicity, squamous cell histology, stage IV disease and age &lt;65 years were all predictive of early disease progression. With the exception of age, the same characteristics along with male gender were also predictive of shorter OS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212465994">2</xref></sup> In this study, only the conditions of non-smoker, female gender and Performance status 0 or 1 were reported to be more likely to have a response with statistical significance, showed a lower risk of progression and a statistically significant survival benefit from erlotinib compared to patients without those characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212465994">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212465994"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212465994">13</xref></sup> By contrast, there was no difference in OS, PFS and DCR according to patient age, histology and treatment line. The conclusions from this study must be tempered by the limitations of a retrospective observational study design, one consequence of which is that no distinction can be made between prognostic and predictive factors.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1078155212465994"><title>Correlation of EGFR mutation with clinical response to erlotinib therapy</title>
<p>In 2009, Rossel and colleagues published the results of a prospective trial designed with the aim to evaluate the feasibility of a large-scale screening for EGRF mutations in Spanish patients with metastatic NSCLC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212465994">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to trial design patients with proven activating EGR mutations were considered for erlotinib, as first or subsequent line of treatment. Overall, 2.105 patients with advanced NSCLC from 129 centers were prospectively tested. Subgroup of 350 patients (16%) with EGFR mutation, mostly women, never smokers and with adenocarcinoma showed a longer median PFS. Two order important issues derived from this work: first, EGRF screening was feasible with laboratory results available in a reasonable time of 7 days; second, testing EGFR mutations before starting therapy guided choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212465994">14</xref></sup> In a recent issue of <italic>Lancet Oncology</italic>, the same authors reported the final results of EURTAC trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212465994">15</xref></sup> the first phase III study comparing erlotinib versus standard platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in European patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations. The study, enrolling 173 patients, met its primary end point of PFS. Patients treated with erlotinib had a 63% relative reduction in risk of progression compared with those receiving standard chemotherapy (9.7 versus 5.2 months, HR 0.37). Treatment with erlotinib was also associated with higher response rate (58% versus 15%, ITT population) and better toxicity profile. Notably, the subset analyses confirmed a significant PFS benefit in favor of erlotinib arm independently of age, gender, performance status and histology. Subgroup analyses according to smoking status showed that the impact of treatment was minimal in former smokers compared to current or never smokers in terms of PFS. These finding was not expected and not in agreement with previous studies. In OPTIMAL trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212465994">16</xref></sup> as well as in WJTOG3405<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212465994">17</xref></sup> and NEJ002 studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212465994">18</xref></sup> both current and former smokers – even if evaluated as a single subgroup – had longer PFS when treated with TKIs. Similarly in IPASS trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212465994">19</xref></sup> in which eligible patients had to be never or light former smokers, no difference in PFS was seen between the two groups. It is possible to exclude that the higher PFS benefit observed in the EURTAC trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212465994">16</xref></sup> in smokers versus former smokers was obtained by chance because of the very small number of patients in these subgroups. It is important to highlight that in none of the above-mentioned trials, the improved PFS translated in a significant advantage in OS in favor of gefitinib or erlotinib therapy for patients harboring EGFR mutations. In such trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212465994">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212465994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212465994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212465994"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212465994">18</xref></sup> in fact, the vast majority of patients assigned to the chemotherapy arm received an EGFR-TKI as second or third-line therapy, with an inevitable confounding effect on survival results. Despite this, in all trials a “clinically significant” trend in the hazard ratio for OS was slightly in favor of EGF TKIs, reinforcing the conviction that if we consider EGFR mutant patients, they gain the greater benefit when an EGFR-TKI is administered early during the course of their disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212465994">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The SATURN trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212465994">21</xref></sup> in fact, an International randomized multicenter phase III trial, demonstrates that initiating erlotinib immediately following first-line chemotherapy results in improved survival compared with routine second-line therapy at the time of progression. One subgroup population in this study deserves special consideration: patients with tumors harboring EGRF-activating mutations, predominantly exon 19 deletions or the L858R point mutation, are exquisitely sensitive to EGFR-TKI treatment, as demonstrated most conclusively in a recent randomized trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212465994">19</xref></sup> of first-line gefitinib compared with chemotherapy. An important cost-effectiveness analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212465994">22</xref></sup> developed using PFS and OS from SATURN study and conducted from the perspective of national health care payers in France, Germany and Italy, suggests that erlotinib is a cost-effective treatment option versus best supportive care when used as first-line maintenance treatment for advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients with SD.</p>
<p>A serious limit of our observational study is that it was not possible to delineate the complete EGFR status profile because, from August 2006 (date of the Erlotinib registration in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212465994">9</xref></sup>) to March 2010 (date of the Gefitinib registration in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212465994">9</xref></sup>), patients treated with erlotinib were not recruited in function of the expression (or amplification/polysomy) of EGFR nor in the presence of tumoral site with activating mutations. So when the study was designed and then started, EGRF mutations were not assessed by oncologists or only sporadically.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1078155212465994" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Today we know that EGFR status assessment is mandatory before starting first-line therapy and that the only presence of certain clinical characteristics initially associated with sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs – i.e. female gender, never smoked, Asian race and adenocarcinoma histology – is not sufficient in selecting patients candidate to such treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212465994">20</xref></sup> All available data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212465994">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212465994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212465994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212465994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212465994"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212465994"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212465994">20</xref></sup> strongly support the usefulness of testing EGFR status in all patients newly diagnosed of NSCLC in order to guide treatment selection and finally improve outcomes. In presence of EGFR activating mutations, front-line therapy with ERFR TKIs is the best therapeutic choice we can offer today to our patients, irrespective of their ethnicity. Conversely, for patients with EGFR wild type tumors or with unknown EGFR status, last generation platinum-based chemotherapy still remains the standard of care.</p>
