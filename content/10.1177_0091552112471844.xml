<abstract>
<p>This study explored whether community college websites are a useful medium for providing knowledge relevant to degree completion. Ten community students used one of three community college websites to answer 10 questions about occupational degree programs. A facilitator asked participants to think aloud while using the website to answer these questions; their responses were video-recorded and coded in terms of correctness of answers and types of usability problems encountered. The findings suggest that participants frequently encountered problems with finding and understanding information needed to understand degree selection and completion. The content analysis of these problems yields several suggestions for improving the usability of community college websites for answering common questions about degree completion.</p>

<p>Community college students complete their degrees at very low rates and take substantially longer to do so than they are led to expect. A major impediment to degree completion is the low levels of college and career knowledge among minority and disadvantaged students. This study explored whether community college websites are a useful medium for answering common questions relevant to the selection and completion of occupational degree programs. We employed a usability approach in which real students used actual websites to accomplish authentic tasks relevant to degree completion. The findings suggest that this information is available on community college websites but not readily usable by typical students.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section2-0091552112471844">
<title>College Knowledge and Degree Attainment</title>
<p>Compared to a generation ago, enrollments in community colleges are surging. Thirty-five percent of all postsecondary students are now enrolled in a community college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112471844">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2012</xref>, Table 199). The surge of enrollments reflects the role these colleges can play as an escalator to the middle class. An occupational degree from a community college can prepare students for well-paying, in-demand careers—for a relatively small investment in tuition and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112471844">Arum &amp; Shavit, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552112471844">Grubb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091552112471844">Jacobson &amp; Mokher, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091552112471844">Kane &amp; Rouse, 1999</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that community colleges, compared to public and private 4-year institutions, have a higher proportion of students from minority, immigrant, or economically disadvantaged backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112471844">Adelman, Daniel, Berkovits, &amp; Owings, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the students who aspire to this purported escalator, degree attainment rates at public 2-year colleges are low. Only 20% of full-time, first-time degree seekers manage to earn their certificate or associate’s degrees within 150% of the expected time, and the rates are even lower for racial and ethnic minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112471844">Snyder &amp; Dillow, 2012</xref>, Table 345). The low rates of degree completion undoubtedly reflect the lower academic preparation of community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112471844">Adelman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552112471844">Duke &amp; Strawn, 2008</xref>) and the fact that part-time students—who have much lower degree attainment and persistence rates—are concentrated in public 2-year institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552112471844">Chen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Because minority and economically disadvantaged students are highly represented in community colleges, their lower social capital may play a role. The population of community college students may have fewer social relationships with individuals knowledgeable about postsecondary institutions, thereby depriving them of a source for college knowledge (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112471844">Bourdieu, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091552112471844">Coleman, 1988</xref>). Parents of students with low socioeconomic status (SES) lack the experience to impart specific knowledge about college selection, application, and enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552112471844">González, Stoner, &amp; Jovel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112471844">Lareau &amp; Weininger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112471844">McDonough, 1997</xref>). This college knowledge is considered a crucial aspect of college readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552112471844">Conley, 2007</xref>). Indeed, several studies have shown that minority and disadvantaged students have less knowledge than middle-class students about college costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552112471844">Grodsky &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552112471844">Kirst &amp; Venezia, 2004</xref>), college requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552112471844">Kirst &amp; Venezia, 2004</xref>), admissions examinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091552112471844">Walpole et al., 2005</xref>), and differences in institutional types and degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091552112471844">Stephan, Goble, &amp; Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112471844">Stephan &amp; Rosenbaum, 2009</xref>). In turn, differences in college-related cultural capital contribute to SES-based disparities in college attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552112471844">González et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112471844">Lareau &amp; Weininger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091552112471844">Lee &amp; Ekstrom, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091552112471844">Perna, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552112471844">Plank &amp; Jordan, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>College knowledge is all the more critical in light of research characterizing community colleges as having low levels of <italic>completion transparency</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112471844">Stephan &amp; Rosenbaum, 2009</xref>). In other words, the path to degree completion is not made clear. As a consequence, students often take courses that don’t count toward the degree, because they have difficulties figuring out which courses apply to their majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112471844">Rosenbaum, Deil-Amen, &amp; Person, 2006</xref>). In addition, they often encounter difficulties understanding the details and implications of placement tests and remedial courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552112471844">Kirst &amp; Venezia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091552112471844">Rosenbaum, 2001</xref>), a problem detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112471844">Rosenbaum et al. (2006)</xref>, who found that in a local sample of 2-year college students, nearly three quarters did not realize that these courses would not count toward their degree. The lack of completion transparency also makes it difficult for students to understand the labor market value of different types of degrees as well as timetables for attaining degrees. Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112471844">Goble, Rosenbaum, and Person (2007)</xref> found that students don’t realize that the typical student takes 3 years to complete a “2-year” degree.</p>
<p>Although colleges are able to provide some counseling to guide students through their college experience, limited funds for this resource means that the average student-to-guidance counselor ratio is now 457:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091552112471844">National Center for Education Statistics, 2009</xref>). With such a high caseload, there is not enough time in the day for a counselor to provide the one-on-one attention many community college students need. Moreover, counselors often lack department-specific knowledge regarding course requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552112471844">Deil-Amen &amp; Rosenbaum, 2003</xref>). Without access to the information they need to understand the requirements of college and select and complete the best program for their individual needs and goals, community college students may be more apt to drop out. For example, if a student selects a program that does not match his or her interests, is too expensive to complete, or does not fit into his or her schedule, he or she may be unable or unwilling to complete the program.</p>

<sec id="section3-0091552112471844">
<title>Website as a Source of College Knowledge</title>
<p>There are several promising approaches to increasing the social capital of community college students by enhancing their relationships with peers and experts (as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091552112471844">Brock &amp; Leblanc, 2005</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091552112471844">Stephan, in press</xref>). However, as the role of community colleges as a gateway to economic opportunity continues to expand, it is clear that colleges will need to improve the transparency of degree completion. College websites present a low-cost opportunity to provide thousands of students with essential information about colleges and programs both effectively and efficiently. Moreover, community college students want and expect the website to provide such information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091552112471844">Poock &amp; Bishop, 2006</xref>). By using the website to provide information fully, clearly, and consistently for students, community colleges may be able to fill the gaps in students’ college knowledge and improve their chances of completing a degree.</p>
<p>The critical question is, “To what extent can students use community college websites to find information relevant to the completion of their degrees?” Previous research on this topic has determined that such information is accessible in a small number of mouse clicks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552112471844">Meyer, 2008</xref>) and in a brief amount of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091552112471844">Poock &amp; Bishop, 2006</xref>). One limitation of these studies is that they measured only the accessibility of this information (i.e., whether students could locate it), not whether college students were able to use the information to address an authentic problem. For this reason, it is not clear from these studies how useful college websites are for actual students as they address authentic questions relevant to degree completion.</p>
<p>The current study employs a usability testing approach, a method for identifying design problems that decrease the usability of a product. Usability is defined as the ability of people to easily and quickly use a product to accomplish their own tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552112471844">Dumas &amp; Redish, 1999</xref>). On the basis of this definition, we selected participants who represent real users (i.e., community college students), and we asked them to perform real tasks with typical community college websites. We recorded what the participants did and what they said, and we analyzed these data to determine common design problems and areas for improvement.</p>

<title>Recruitment of Participants</title>
<p>We recruited 10 participants for the study, a number that is sufficient to identify most of a product’s usability problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552112471844">Virzi, 1992</xref>). We sought participants who were high school graduates, who were 17 to 21 years of age, who planned to attend a 2-year college during the coming fall, and who had completed no more than two semesters of college. They were recruited via notices posted during the summer of 2011 to Craigslist and on community college bulletin boards. Below is a summary of participant characteristics:</p>
<list id="list1-0091552112471844" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Gender: The study included four males and six females.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Age: The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 20. The majority of the participants (seven) were 18 years of age, two were 19, and one was 20.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ethnicity: The study included participants from various ethnicities. The participants self-identified as follows: four Asian, two White, one Hispanic, one African American, one “other” (Filipino American), and one “mixed” (African American and Hispanic).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Grade point average (GPA): Seven of 10 participants reported a high school GPA between 3.0 and 4.0, and 3 participants reported a GPA between 2.0 and 3.0.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Parental educational attainment: When reporting the highest educational attainment of their parents, five participants reported that one or both parents had “some college” experience, three reported a bachelor’s degree, and one each reported a master’s and an occupational degree.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>College experience: All of the students attended local community colleges in the San Francisco Bay Area. Five respondents were attending college for the first time during the fall 2011 semester. Three students had previously enrolled in college for two semesters prior to the fall 2011 semester, and two students had previously enrolled in college for one semester prior to the 2011 fall semester.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Type of degree anticipated: Six participants mentioned that they were planning to pursue a 2-year associate’s degree and then transfer to a 4-year university. Three participants mentioned that they were interested in completing a 2-year associate’s degree and then enter the work force. One participant mentioned that she was interested in pursuing a certificate program.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Amount of time spent looking at college websites: Prior to beginning the website tasks, participants were asked whether they had visited other college websites. All of the 10 participants mentioned that they visited college websites to obtain more information about specific college programs, classes, or financial assistance. Most of the participants (7 out of 10) mentioned that they had searched websites for 1 to 2 hours (4 participants) or for more than 2 hours (3 participants) prior to enrolling in college.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0091552112471844">
<title>Test Procedures</title>
<p>Participants examined the website of one of three community colleges located in a single state in the Midwest. These websites were selected on the basis of several criteria. First, all had been reviewed by researchers to determine that each provided the information that participants would need for their tasks. Second, the colleges varied in enrollment categories and represented small, medium, and large student enrollments. Third, they were located in a different state from where the study was taking place, making it unlikely that students had previously used them. These colleges will be referred to with the pseudonyms of Hickory State, Sycamore, and Mulberry College.</p>
<p>The usability testing interviews were conducted in a laboratory in San Mateo, CA. Each interview lasted approximately 90 minutes. Participants were assigned to use a single website during their session. To ensure a roughly equal number of participants per website, the websites were assigned on a rotation basis (i.e., the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th participant used the Hickory State website; the 2nd, 5th, and 8th participant used the Sycamore website, etc.). Four participants used Hickory State College’s website, and three participants each used the websites of Sycamore and Mulberry College. In the first part of the session, participants practiced thinking out loud as they used an unrelated website. Next, participants engaged in free exploration of their assigned college website for approximately 10 minutes. During this time, the interviewer directed them to highlight any interesting or confusing areas they encountered. In the main part of the session, the interviewer asked each participant to complete a series of 10 tasks:</p>
<list id="list2-0091552112471844" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Find program list: Participants were asked to navigate through the website and find a complete list of the college’s occupational programs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Select an occupational program: Participants were asked to explore the different occupational programs and decide which program they would most like to pursue.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine job prospects: Participants were asked to determine how easy or hard it would be for graduates of their chosen program to find a job in their field.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine starting salary: Participants were asked to find the projected starting salary for graduates of their chosen program. (Although this topic is somewhat peripheral to the domain of college knowledge, information about job and salary prospects is routinely included on webpages of occupational programs. As such, it is important to test the usability of this information.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify required courses: Participants were asked to find the courses they would need to complete the degree program they selected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Calculate program duration: Participants were asked to determine the month and year they would complete the program (assuming a specific start date and full-time attendance).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Schedule around a job: Participants were asked to consider a scenario in which they had a part-time job from 2:00 to 6:00 p.m. Their task was to determine whether they would be able to keep this work schedule in light of the program requirements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Schedule online courses: Participants were asked to identify which, if any, of their required courses were offered online.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Find placement test information: Participants were asked to locate and review the website’s information about placement tests and, based on this information, to explain the consequence of a low score on this test.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Calculate annual cost: Participants were asked to determine the approximate annual cost of college.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The interviewer directed participants to think out loud as they were reviewing the websites and completing the tasks. The interviewer probed the participant’s understanding of technical terms (e.g., <italic>shift differential, co-op</italic>, etc.). If participants were unable to find certain pages that were essential for the completion of the task, the interviewer would guide them to the page after a set amount of time. The inability to find this information would be noted as a usability problem.</p>
<p>Each interview was video-recorded using two video cameras to record the participant and the computer screen, respectively. During the session, one interviewer sat next to the participant to read the task instructions and answer questions. Another researcher sat in a control room watching the session on video and taking notes. Following the interview, the participants received a US$50 gift card to a national retailing company as an incentive for participating in the study.</p>

<title>Ratings and Codes</title>
<sec id="section8-0091552112471844">
<title>Ratings of website clarity</title>
<p>Following most of these tasks, respondents were asked to rate the website as <italic>unclear, clear</italic>, or <italic>very clear</italic> in communicating the information relevant to the tasks. This question was not asked for Task 2 (selecting an occupational program). Also, participants were asked to provide a single rating of clarity for the information about careers (relevant to Tasks 3 and 4) and a single rating of clarity for information about scheduling (addressing Tasks 7 and 8). Therefore, participants provided a total of seven clarity ratings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0091552112471844">
<title>Coding procedures</title>
<p>Members of the research team coded the notes and video-recordings for each task. There were two coding schemes, corresponding to task completion and usability problems. The completion status of each task was coded using the following mutually exclusive categories: 0 = not completed (was unable to provide any answer); 1 = completed (found correct answer); 2 = information not available; 3 = found the information needed to arrive at the answer, but did not perform calculations or synthesis to obtain answer; 4 = incorrect answer, based on misinterpretation of information found.</p>
<p>A different coding scheme was used to describe the usability problems encountered with the tasks. The coding scheme comprised a total of 17 codes (listed in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0091552112471844">Appendix</xref>), which were grouped into the following 3 broad categories:</p>
<list id="list3-0091552112471844" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Technical problems: These codes reflected problems with the functionality of a website, such as a broken link or poor text readability.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Problems with finding information: These codes reflected different problems with finding information on the website. Each code corresponded to a different reason for not finding information, such as poor arrangement on a page, confusing or nonintuitive menu structure, and the omission of necessary information.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Understanding: These codes reflected different problems the participants had understanding information that was found on the website. These problems could entail an incorrect understanding of a specific term or a broader miscomprehension of the website. For the latter, we coded the apparent reason for the miscomprehension. These reasons included the overload of detail on the website or the participant’s lack of necessary background knowledge.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The lead investigator trained a researcher to code the data from each session and provided feedback on the coding. The primary data source used in the coding was the notes from each session. The coder checked the video-recording as necessary to clarify the notes.</p>

<p>Across all tasks, participants encountered 77 usability problems. The typical usability problems related either to finding information (41% of problems) or understanding information (52%). Technical problems were relatively rare, comprising 11% of the problems coded. These findings also indicate that the participants were able to complete two tasks with little difficulty (i.e., with few usability problems): finding the list of programs offered by the college and finding the required courses for the selected program. For the remaining 8 tasks, the participants exhibited 7 to 13 usability problems. The specific problems reported for each scenario are described in the following sections.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section15-0091552112471844">
<title>Task-Specific Findings</title>
<p>The following sections describe the usability problems associated with each of the topics and their corresponding tasks.</p>
<sec id="section16-0091552112471844">
<title>Finding the program list</title>
<p>Most participants (9 of 10) were able to find the program list, and most (9 of 10) rated the website as <italic>clear</italic> or <italic>very clear</italic> in providing this information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0091552112471844">
<title>Selecting an occupational program</title>
<p>Nine participants selected a 2-year occupational program as directed. One participant, however, selected a certificate program instead, which was counted as <italic>incorrect</italic>. Participants encountered 13 usability problems, the most for any task. Most participants (9 of 10) had problems understanding information about degree programs, particularly related to the definition of <italic>associate’s degree</italic> and <italic>certificate</italic>. For example, one participant thought the term <italic>degrees</italic> referred to 4-year programs. Participants encountered four problems finding information about occupational programs due to the organization and layout of the website. For example, one participant didn’t see information about a particular associate of applied science program, presumably because it appeared within a list of five different programs on one departmental page. This participant selected a certificate program instead. Finally, participants encountered three technical problems. The most serious problem was a misdirected link; the participant clicked on nursing and was misdirected to the culinary program.</p>
<p>The facilitator asked each participant to explain the reason for his or her choice. Their responses to these questions provide insight into the types of information that potential students perceive as useful for program selection.</p>
<list id="list4-0091552112471844" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Five participants cited job prospects as the reason for their selection. One participant stated, “I would like the culinary one because there are different career options like pastry or dietician. You can be in the food industry without having to be the cook.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Three participants cited the availability of detailed program information. For example, one participant said about nursing, “I liked the program of study [page]. You know which classes you need to take so you don’t waste time.” Two of these participants indicated the level of information as the reason for selecting one program over another.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Three participants mentioned the number of credits or types of courses in their answer. For example, the two who chose the emergency medical technician program cited the relatively few courses required for the degree.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These findings suggest that students are strongly interested in learning about the career for which the program prepares them and that they avoid programs for which websites provide insufficient detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0091552112471844">
<title>Job prospects and starting salary</title>
<p>Overall, students had difficulty using the websites to determine their job prospects and starting salary. A majority of participants (6 of 10) rated the career information offered on the website as <italic>unclear</italic>. Eight of 10 participants were unable to find information about job prospects (for six students, the website provided no information relevant to their selected program). Six of 10 participants were unable to find information about starting salary; in each of these 6 cases, there was no such information to be found for their selected program. Participants also had difficulty understanding information that was present. Three participants had difficulty understanding the relevance of information about job prospects. For example, programs at one college included an “employment outlook” section that described the growth of the profession, but two participants did not interpret this as relevant to their job prospects. Two participants viewing the Hickory State website misconstrued the hourly salary for co-op students as a salary projection for program graduates; because the co-op salary was usually significantly lower than the expected starting salary, this was a significant error.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0091552112471844">
<title>Finding required courses</title>
<p>Most participants (8 of 10) successfully identified the required courses for their selected degree, and most (9 of 10) of them rated the websites as <italic>clear</italic> or <italic>very clear</italic> regarding required courses. Moreover, there were few usability problems with this task. Typically, participants found a link to the list of required courses from the program page. However, two usability problems were related to finding these links about required courses. On the Hickory State website, the color of these links blended in to the rest of the text on the page. Also, the text of the link did not refer to courses but, rather, to “curriculum” (e.g., culinary arts technology curriculum). It is possible that participants did not understand what the term <italic>curriculum</italic> meant and what they would find there.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0091552112471844">
<title>Determining program duration</title>
<p>Only one participant correctly identified the month of program completion, and a majority of participants rated the website as <italic>unclear</italic> in regard to this question. It should be noted that six participants were able to determine the duration of their program in quarters or semesters but were unable to translate this information into the month of program completion. Determining the specific month of completion would have required comparing the number of semesters or quarters with the academic calendar. Further complicating matters, the program page on one website described time in quarters and the academic calendar described time in terms (full term, A term, and B term). Thus, it was not possible to determine how the quarters would fall out in the academic calendar. Two other participants had problems finding information about program duration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0091552112471844">
<title>Scheduling around a job or scheduling online courses</title>
<p>Few participants could complete either of the two scheduling tasks. Four of 10 participants correctly determined whether their selected program could fit into a hypothetical job schedule. Seven participants had problems understanding the course schedules. For example, the Hickory State site used alphanumeric codes to describe course section scheduling information. Some participants did not successfully cross-reference these codes against a table of definitions. Two websites presented course schedules in a highly dense manner that made it easy to miss information about the date and time of a course.</p>
<p>Participants encountered similar difficulties when attempting to identify online options. Three participants did not understand the code used to designate that a course was available online. For example, Hickory State used the code <italic>WEB</italic> to designate online courses, and Mulberry used the code <italic>www</italic>. Students who noticed these codes did not necessarily know what they meant. Two using the Mulberry online scheduler didn’t notice there was a search filter on the scheduling page that could be used to identify online options.</p>
<p>In contrast to the low task completion rates, 7 of 10 participants rated the website as <italic>clear</italic> or <italic>very clear</italic> with regard to scheduling. One explanation for these incongruent findings is that the participants who provided incorrect or partial answers were unaware of their errors and therefore perceived the website as being clear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0091552112471844">
<title>Understanding placement tests</title>
<p>Most participants (8 of 10) found information about the placement tests and demonstrated their understanding of the consequences of a low score. Nevertheless, most rated the website as <italic>unclear</italic> about the consequences of a low score. In fact, none of these websites explained that a low score would require remedial placements that could increase program duration.</p>
<p>In addition to the lack of clarity of information, three participants using the Sycamore website were unable to find that site’s placement test page. The link to this page was located on the “High School Options” page and required the user to scroll down over two screens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0091552112471844">
<title>Determining annual cost</title>
<p>Only one of 10 participants stated the approximate cost per year to attend college full-time. Of the nine participants who did not complete the task, eight identified the cost per credit but did not perform the calculations necessary to arrive at an approximate amount. The interviewer did not press these students to attempt to provide the cost per year, so it is not known whether their failure to do so reflected a lack of effort. However, in only one of the three schools was this additional effort unnecessary; Hickory State’s tuition and fees page included a statement that the annual cost was “around $5,000 plus fees for a [state] resident.” Nevertheless, the other three participants who used this website did not notice this statement. Despite the low number of successful completions, five of nine participants rated information about annual cost as <italic>clear</italic> or <italic>very clear</italic>. It seems likely that these participants believed they had actually answered the question or that it would be simple to do so with the information provided.</p>

<sec id="section24-0091552112471844" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was motivated by the low levels of college knowledge among community college students and by the low levels of transparency regarding degree completion at community colleges. As a result of these two factors, many community college students have insufficient knowledge of occupational degrees, programs of study, college cost, and other topics, making their completion of a degree or certificate less likely. We observed whether community college students could use community college websites to find information and make decisions relevant to degree completion. We found that such information is often available on community college websites, but students could not typically use it to complete realistic tasks. Although students could find standard information about tuition, programs offered, and courses required to complete a degree, they often were unable to use this information to answer questions about program duration, whether they would need to change their job schedule, and how much college would actually cost.</p>
<p>The consequences of these usability problems could be severe. For example, miscalculations about the duration and cost of college may lead a student to make inappropriate financial plans or erroneously decide that being a full-time student is not feasible. The consequences of misunderstanding the consequence of placement tests may be that students do not prepare for them or make proper arrangements for the day of the test (as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112471844">Rosenbaum et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, students who misunderstand scheduling information may be disappointed to find that their actual schedule conflicts with other commitments. Exacerbating these problems is the fact that many students did not perceive that they misunderstood information about cost, scheduling, and program duration.</p>
<p>Because these findings reflect user experiences with three college websites, it is not possible to generalize to community college websites overall. However, it should be noted that these 3 websites were among a pool of 22 websites that were evaluated by the research team during pilot testing. They were selected in part because they were relatively more informative than many of the other websites that the team reviewed. Moreover, the participants in the study came from backgrounds with relatively high levels of social capital with respect to college; all participants reported that their parents had at least some prior college experience, and half of the participants had at least one semester of college experience. It is safe to say that the sample of websites and participants represents favorable conditions for a test of website usability. Therefore, there is good reason to suspect that the usability problems found in this study are widespread.</p>
<sec id="section25-0091552112471844">
<title>Lessons From Usability Problems</title>
<p>The types of usability problems that students encountered and their ratings of website clarity provide feedback to colleges about improving college websites. In short, colleges should make information explicit (rather than requiring students to synthesize information in different places), explain career payoffs, and improve website organization. The following sections elaborate on these recommendations.</p>
<sec id="section26-0091552112471844">
<title>Make information explicit</title>
<p>More than half of all usability problems related to a lack of understanding of information that students found, as opposed to problems with finding information or technical difficulties. One major problem was that, for several tasks, deriving the correct answer required integrating information from different parts of the website. This extra mental calculation is one more hurdle students need to clear to get the answers they need. Thus, few students correctly stated the annual cost of college or the date by which they could complete their program. The unclear and sometimes interchangeable use of <italic>semester, term</italic>, and <italic>Term A/B</italic>, compounded the problem. Websites also were not explicit about placement tests and did not spell out the implications of remedial courses. The following are practical applications:</p>
<list id="list5-0091552112471844" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provide a table listing total cost per program. Do not require students to find number of credit hours in one place and translate this into cost of tuition in another place.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clearly state the program duration in terms of both semesters and months (e.g., based on a fall start date). Don’t require students to determine the number of semesters in one place and then cross-reference the academic calendar to discover the duration in terms of months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For each program, provide a table indicating which courses are available online, where each course is offered (if there is more than one campus) and what time of day each is offered (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening). This table would provide a rough understanding of scheduling options that students could then refine through the detailed course timetable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Explain that students receiving a low score must complete remedial courses that do not count toward degree completion. Spell out the options available to students who do not pass—such as retaking the test or selecting a program that will not require them to take remedial courses.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0091552112471844">
<title>Describe career payoffs</title>
<p>Students are strongly interested in learning about the career for which the program prepares them, and they avoid programs for which websites provide insufficient detail. This finding suggests that websites should provide recent and clear information explaining the career payoffs of different credentials. However, websites frequently lacked any information relevant to career outcomes (salary and job prospects). Students often did not understand the relevance of information, such as statistics about projected career growth, or lists of companies where past students found work. Finally, students often misinterpreted terms such as <italic>co-op salary</italic> and <italic>shift differential</italic>. Taken together, this suggests the importance of clear communication about careers. For each program, it is recommended that the webpage clearly answer the following questions:</p>
<list id="list6-0091552112471844" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“What is this job like, and is it right for me?” Describe the typical settings, working conditions, and responsibilities of the career, including information about the expected competencies of workers. It may be helpful to include pictures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“How likely am I to find a job in this field?” Provide accurate, recent statistics about placement of recent program graduates, distinguishing between in-field and out-of-field placements. Also provide accurate local projections for the growth in number of jobs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“What is my expected salary?” Describe average starting salary for students earning this type of degree as well as expected salary growth.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“Which degree is right for me?” Most students were confused about the different degree types and didn’t understand the difference between certificates and degrees. Clearly explain the job market value of each option. It may be best to summarize this information in a table.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0091552112471844">
<title>Improve website organization and layout</title>
<p>Several of the usability problems suggest the importance of effective website organization. First, colleges should limit the amount of text per webpage. One example of text overload was the inclusion of five different degree programs on a single page; it was easy to miss information, as illustrated by the student who selected the “wrong” program. Similarly, colleges should be mindful of the density of information; the dense lists of abbreviations and codes frequently confounded students who were attempting to find class schedules. It is also important to ensure that information is located where students are likely to look. On one website, students were unlikely to find information about placement testing that was located on the “High School Options” page. Finally, websites should use strong colors to indicate hyperlinks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0091552112471844">
<title>Eliminate jargon</title>
<p>Cutting across the above recommendations is the need to avoid jargon. Our participants encountered several terms with which they were not familiar, including <italic>curriculum, arts and sciences, associate of the arts</italic>, and <italic>hospitality management.</italic> Websites should communicate using terms that are familiar to high school graduates rather than using the jargon of higher education.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0091552112471844">
<title>Recent Efforts to Improve Transparency of College Information</title>
<p>During the preparation of this article, the White House announced plans for a <italic>College Scorecard</italic> that would summarize several key measures of college affordability and value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552112471844">White House, n.d</xref>.). These include net cost, graduate rates, job prospects, and earnings potential (although the information necessary to compile the latter two measures is not yet available). In 2012, the U.S. Department of Education expanded its online College Affordability and Transparency Center to support comparisons of costs among similar institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091552112471844">U.S. Department of Education, 2012</xref>). This site also allows users to compare career and vocational programs by cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112471844">U.S. Department of Education, n.d</xref>.). These government-sponsored efforts to improve the transparency of information about colleges address several of the tasks included in this study. As such, these efforts may, in the long run, relieve colleges of some of the burden of communicating this information on their own websites. This would, of course, require colleges to provide links to these external resources.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0091552112471844" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions and Future Directions</title>
<p>The findings of this study yielded practical suggestions for college websites. These suggestions differ in the extent of effort they would require to implement. There is no doubt that community colleges would have to expend resources, for example, to calculate the cost and duration of degrees. However, the cost of inaction is also high, both for students who make mistakes that could derail their degree completion and for colleges who lose revenue from students who drop out. Future research is needed to understand students’ problems with using websites and to demonstrate the benefits of improving the usability of websites. Regarding the former, it would be useful to observe college students in situ as they attempt to use websites. Many colleges have computer terminals located on campus near the registrar and counseling offices. It may be fruitful to observe and interview students who are on campus for registration or academic counseling as they attempt to use the website to accomplish actual tasks. It would be useful to conduct interviews or focus groups with students to determine how they use websites in conjunction with other sources of information (e.g., peers, guidance counselors, print material).</p>
<p>It is possible to study the benefits of improving website design. A college that implements the changes recommended herein could ask users to rate website clarity before and after the changes are made. The most persuasive evidence, though, would be to demonstrate that improvements to websites are associated with decreases in errors in course taking (of the sort described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112471844">Rosenbaum et al., 2006</xref>) and improvement in progress toward degree completion.</p>
<p>The findings are also relevant to our recent efforts to design a rubric for evaluating the quality of college websites. In general, the present findings indicate that experienced researchers can easily overlook the problems that actual students will have with websites, especially with terminology. As such, this study demonstrates the importance of usability testing as a technique that individual colleges could employ whenever they seek to improve their websites.</p>
