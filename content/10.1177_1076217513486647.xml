<p>The wasteland that has been middle schools in this country for gifted learners for many years is finally experiencing an important turnaround in the largest county in Florida. Three years ago, Pinellas County approved a plan to develop and implement three middle school self-contained programs for gifted learners within three existing school sites. This plan was met with enthusiasm at all levels from the superintendent’s office to the parents, the gifted advisory group, and the teachers.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to share the major aspects of the development work that were crucial to the success of all three schools and to suggest a blueprint for other districts that want to offer more intensive services to the population of gifted students so in need of them at this level of schooling. The stages of development included preparatory planning, teacher recruitment and hiring, curriculum development work, professional development for staff, and an ongoing monitoring system. At the end of the 3rd year, an outside evaluation was done to benchmark progress and suggest directions for the next stage of school implementation.</p>
<sec id="section1-1076217513486647">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Pinellas County Schools have approximately 100,000 students, with 24,000 of those students at the middle school levels of Grades 6 to 8. Approximately one third of the 3,000 middle school students identified as gifted are currently enrolled in the Centers for Gifted Studies. Students not attending the Centers receive gifted services at their local middle school site. However, those services are not as comprehensive as what is provided in the center-based programs, usually consisting of a few advanced classes in selected subject areas.</p>
<p>Because Florida has a centralized system of identification of gifted learners, the district could focus its resources on the actual programs and services that might be offered to the prospective population rather than spend time debating who might qualify for such services. The schools each serve about 300 students, with three sections of classes offered at each of the three levels of operation and at each site. Class size ranges from 20 to 30, depending on the subject and level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1076217513486647">
<title>Rationale for the Program</title>
<p>Pinellas County, like many public school districts, was facing a budget problem in 2008-2009. Moreover, it had schools in the district that were underenrolled, based on location and sometimes the school choice model they had selected. As school choice was ending and the district was returning to zoned schools, there was an opportunity for the development of gifted magnets that would be a positive way to encourage voluntary enrollment in underpopulated schools at the middle school level.</p>
<p>The need for a middle school magnet for gifted students had been an expressed need by parents in the district for some time. The proposal for a full-time gifted middle school was in response to parental demand for a more rigorous learning environment for their gifted middle school students. Many parents at the elementary Center for Gifted Studies magnet had asked for this option, based on the success their students experienced in the full-time elementary gifted program. A full-time gifted middle school would be a natural extension of the education they desired for their children. Parents of pullout program students had also made the same request. For many gifted students, selected advanced classes in the district’s traditional middle schools had not presented an adequate academic challenge. Thus, district situational constraints merged with gifted program needs that were vocally expressed by advocates to bring about a major gifted program development initiative that would benefit many gifted students, trapped in middle schools with limited services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1076217513486647">
<title>The Curriculum Framework: A Plan for Differentiated Delivery</title>
<p>One of the critical guiding tools in the establishment of the Centers for Gifted Studies was a clearly designed curriculum framework that demonstrated the direction of the program across the three school sites. This framework needed to convey the philosophy of the district, it needed to demonstrate through choice of goals the extent of differentiation that the schools would provide, and it needed to convey a solid cohesive basis for having schools that were similar although they operated in three parts of the county at different sites. The curriculum framework then became the glue that held the program together in its 1st year of operation.</p>
<p>The purpose of the curriculum framework was to provide coherence and consonance to the implementation of a new magnet school model for gifted learners at middle school levels. It acknowledged the advanced level of the learner and also the advanced curriculum opportunities that these learners have had in earlier grades and schools from which they have articulated. The framework also captured emphases essential to continued success of these students in the specialized high schools and special programs like IB and AP offered throughout the county high schools.</p>
<p>The audiences for the curriculum framework included all major stakeholders in ensuring the success of the schools—administrators, teachers, parents, and students themselves, all groups who needed to understand the goals and outcomes on which the schools’ curriculum was predicated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1076217513486647">
<title>The School Context for Implementing the Framework</title>
<p>The context for implementing a curriculum plan is as essential as the elements of the plan in bringing about successful learning. Stakeholders for the new magnet schools in Pinellas County believed in the importance of establishing an environment that values diversity and divergent thinking that encourages inquiry and self-directed learning. The long-term development of habits of mind that mirror successful learning was to be instilled through the interplay of curriculum, instruction, and other classroom and school interactions. These habits of mind included the fostering of free and open inquiry; the development of a work ethic in conjunction with developing talents; intellectual honesty, integrity, and humility; a sense of curiosity; and a commitment to challenging learning experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217513486647">
<title>Curriculum Philosophy</title>
<p>The curriculum philosophy of the new magnet schools at the middle school level is grounded in the belief that gifted students require comprehensive and ongoing differentiated curriculum and instruction to develop their abilities appropriately. It also acknowledges that gifted learners differ from each other in important ways and may exhibit uneven developmental patterns in learning. Thus, curriculum and instruction must be delivered by highly qualified teachers who are sensitive to the cognitive, affective, social, and aesthetic needs of gifted learners at these early stages of adolescence.</p>
<p>Moreover, gifted students need to work together in flexibly grouped settings to maximize all aspects of their talent development process. Just as gifted students have special needs, they also have special responsibilities to each other and their world. Thus, the program will stress the importance of developing leadership skills, and moral and ethical behaviors used in the service of others. Because our 21st-century world requires students who are collaborative, connected, and creative, the curriculum stresses group and individualized depth of learning, provides interdisciplinary experiences, and emphasizes real-world connections.</p>
<p>Innovative products and performances are highly valued as assessments of creative endeavors, while performance and portfolio assessment reveal authentic depth of learning in core domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1076217513486647">
<title>Goal Structures</title>
<p>For a planning effort of this scope to be successful, it requires the focused attention and consensus of key players in the district to agree on parameters and then make it happen. Initial plans were developed with an outside consultant who emphasized the need for cohesion in the development of program documents as well as a system of review that would allow greater involvement in the final product than just the planning group. Thus, once consensus was reached within the planning team, the draft plan was disseminated to teachers in the program, parents, and advisory committee members for comment and discussion. Meetings were held with these groups to ensure agreement on the key aspects of curriculum philosophy and goals.</p>
<p>A district planning team was initiated that worked to arrive at consensus on the philosophy of the program stated above and the following goal statements. This planning team comprised the Director of Advanced Programs for the district, the coordinator of gifted studies, and the three principals at whose site the school was to be located. The goal statements were then discussed in executive planning sessions with the superintendent to ensure that all decision-making arms of the district had input into the core document that would guide the evolution of these schools.</p>
<p>The six goals of the curriculum framework were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217513486647" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Goal 1: To develop critical and creative (divergent) thinking skills</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Goal 2: To develop independent learning skills and attitudes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Goal 3: To develop higher-level oral, written, viewing, and technological communication skills</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Goal 4: To develop aesthetic appreciation and artistic/creative expression in various domains and media</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Goal 5: To develop self-understanding, identity, and healthy coping mechanisms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Goal 6: To develop the social skills and dynamics of leadership</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Once these goals became accepted as the direction for the program, work was then done to create underlying curriculum outcomes, strategies for meeting the outcomes, and assessment approaches to be used in the program. This structure also allowed the program administrators to select materials for use in the program that addressed the stated goals and advanced the curriculum philosophy. There was a concerted effort to select materials that were research-based in their effectiveness with gifted learners, focused on the goals of the program, and that were developmentally appropriate for use at middle school levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1076217513486647">
<title>Consultation With Curriculum Supervisors in Core Areas</title>
<p>Consultation with curriculum supervisors in each subject area was held to ensure acceptance of the goal structure and the ways that it would be operationalized in the district. The biggest changes, of course, came in the following areas:</p>
<list id="list2-1076217513486647" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the use of curriculum materials that were not used throughout the district,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the use of core and supplementary texts for each subject rather than a basal,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the recognition that these students would meet the standards in each subject area yet would exceed those standards in key dimensions of their learning, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the fact that the Florida state test would not be the basis for judging the success of the program, as the ceiling is too low to authenticate real learning for this population.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The supervisors were most cooperative and supportive of the direction of the curriculum and even reviewed proposed materials for use to ensure alignment with the regular education curriculum in science, social studies, mathematics, and language arts. They were pleased to see that the direction of the program would be differentiated yet connected to the expectations for all learners in the district.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1076217513486647">
<title>Selection of Staff</title>
<p>Knowing that the best curriculum plans would fall flat without effective teachers, the selection of staff was critical. Because gifted education is mandated in Florida, it has been considered a critical shortage area. Teachers are required to earn the gifted endorsement through university coursework or district add-on certification programs. The gifted endorsement requires completion of five courses or 300 hr: Nature and Needs of Gifted, Guidance and Counseling for Gifted, Special Populations of Gifted, Curriculum and Instructional Strategies for Gifted, and Theory and Development of Creativity. Teachers are required to hold appropriate middle school subject area certification and the gifted endorsement or a signed commitment to make annual progress toward completion within 2 years.</p>
<p>Each school needed to hire five to six new teachers per grade level. After a review of current gifted literature to develop a list of expectations for highly effective teachers for the new schools, district personnel developed the following set of criteria to guide teacher selection:</p>
<list id="list3-1076217513486647" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>— Teachers in the <italic>Middle School Centers for Gifted Studies</italic> will demonstrate the competencies/skills needed to develop and provide students with optimal educational experiences, based on the Teacher education Standards, adopted by National Association for Gifted Children and Council for Exceptional Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217513486647">Johnsen, VanTassel-Baska, &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>— Teachers should demonstrate evidence of the following competencies/skills through a portfolio, resume, or interview:
<list id="list4-1076217513486647" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>understanding of the cognitive and social/emotional characteristics of gifted learners;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>development of challenging and rigorous interdisciplinary curriculum appropriate for gifted learners;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>development of curriculum that promotes creative, critical, and complex thinking;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>delivery of instruction through a variety of methods appropriate for gifted learners;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>differentiation of instruction determined by the use of assessment data to meet the academic needs, interests, and learning styles of gifted students;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ability to address a relevant, real-world problem through authentic tasks such as service learning;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>development of multiple assessments to monitor students’ growth;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>capacity to communicate with students, school staff, families, and community members, and collaborate with them in support of students;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>evidence of teacher leadership and participation on school reform, improvement, curriculum teams, or other related duties; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>passion for lifelong learning.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Specific job descriptions were also crafted for the teachers at these school sites that focused on the need for collaboration among the entire school staff, involvement in coaching and advising extracurricular offerings, and working with parents in a variety of ways. Because Florida is an individualized education program (IEP) state, these teachers also worked on the educational plans for their students and attended relevant professional development sessions and staffings on those students.</p>
<p>The results of planning carefully for the teacher selection resulted in the hiring of a majority of teachers who had previous experience working with gifted learners, had strong content expertise, and possessed the certification in gifted. For those not possessing the gifted credential, certification classes were available in the district for them to take in a timely fashion. Moreover, other professional development opportunities were provided to all the new middle school staff on the curriculum framework, the use of materials, and the strategies that supported their implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1076217513486647">
<title>Key Features of the Curriculum Base</title>
<p>The Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217513486647">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Stambaugh, 2006</xref>) was selected as the guiding model for ensuring differentiation in respect to advanced work, emphasis on higher-level processes and products, and the use of a macro-concept to guide instruction. It also provided the basis for work on real-world issues and problems and a thematic orientation to work within subject areas as well. Because the model is based on research on what works with gifted learners in classrooms and has been translated into exemplary units of study that are also research-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217513486647">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>), it was perceived to be the best approach to provide a differentiated curriculum base for the program.</p>
<p>Materials designed on this model were made available in relevant subject areas for teachers to implement in classrooms. Training on these materials was also provided. Many teachers created posters, bulletin boards, and laminated materials to support curriculum implementation through the use of teaching and learning scaffolds on which they had been trained. The emphasis on each dimension of the ICM is noted in the following paragraphs.</p>
<sec id="section10-1076217513486647">
<title>Dimension A: Advanced/Accelerated Curriculum</title>
<p>The use of accelerated and advanced study was incorporated into the program from the beginning in selected subjects. Language arts was advanced through sixth graders beginning the seventh-grade advanced language arts course. Teachers also taught a William and Mary Language arts unit, calibrated to be two grade levels advanced in reading material. Social studies offered an ancient civilization course, which would be implemented districtwide in 2012 for older middle school students. Document-based questioning was included as a core strategy in social studies instruction to provide advanced development in preparing students for AP and IB programs at the high school level. Math differentiation also was accomplished to some extent through acceleration. Students had the opportunity to earn a high school credit for Algebra I Honors and Geometry Honors by the time they left the Middle school gifted Centers program. Acceleration in science was not addressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1076217513486647">
<title>Dimension C: Concept-Based Curriculum</title>
<p>Each grade level curriculum focused on a broad concept to add depth and complexity. A concept was selected for each grade level to connect courses: sixth grade—Change, seventh grade—Systems, and eighth grade—Models. Teachers were asked to plan for a cross-disciplinary lesson at least once a month connecting their subject to the broad concept. One example was the cross-disciplinary emphasis on studying erosion in science and applying the concept to preservation of antiquities, a topic covered in the social studies course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1076217513486647">
<title>Dimension B (Processes): The Use of Higher Level Thinking and Problem-Solving</title>
<p>Each grade level incorporated the teaching of the Paul model of reasoning to ensure a common emphasis on critical thinking in the program. Because this model is already embedded in the William and Mary units of study, it became easier for teachers to use it systematically across the grade levels and subject areas. Professional development was also provided on the model with different examples of use—from discussion of current events where the model may be used as the question frame to written discussion of text-based elements of reasoning to debate and oral argument where students use the elements of reasoning to analyze others’ arguments and construct their own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1076217513486647">
<title>Dimension B (Products): Product Development via Competitions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217513486647">Bloom (1985)</xref> noted the importance of competitions as early as age 10 to develop students’ capacity for understanding how to develop excellence in a talent area. An academic competition was selected for each grade level and embedded in the independent study course with the expectation that all students would participate. The competitions served as a supplemental catalyst for the development of higher-level thinking and problem-solving skills and provided much opportunity for team building through social interaction. They also served to develop leadership skills within each opportunity. The competitions selected were as follows:</p>
<list id="list5-1076217513486647" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>6th—National History Day to enhance research skills;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>7th—Future City to develop creative thinking, cooperative teamwork, and STEM skills (science, technology, engineering, and math); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>8th—Future Problem Solving to enhance critical and creative thinking in a problem-solving format.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This organizational structure for independent study also allowed the development of a systematic research project each year in the program, crafted around student interest and talent areas in the curriculum.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1076217513486647">
<title>Monitoring Curriculum Implementation</title>
<p>New programs in any area are vulnerable to early fragmentation, curriculum drift, and teacher idiosyncratic interpretations of intent. To preserve the philosophy and goal structure so carefully crafted by stakeholders in the district, it was essential to have oversight of the implementation in each building. While principals worked with teachers in more general ways, the gifted differentiation component had to be addressed by the gifted staff. An instructional coach for differentiation was hired in the 1st year for several purposes:</p>
<list id="list6-1076217513486647" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Working with teachers on curriculum planning of differentiated lessons, appropriate for gifted learners</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Several lesson plans were not sufficiently differentiated, given the level of the students in those areas where differentiated materials were not available for use. One-to-one consultation was used as a strategy to assist with this program element.</p>
<list id="list7-1076217513486647" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Monitoring the implementation of the intended curriculum for fidelity</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>There was a lack of understanding about how to use the materials that had been purchased for the program in an efficacious way and to plan out the scope and sequence of instruction for using them efficiently and effectively. Moreover, the strategies practiced in professional development sessions needed to be in evidence in classrooms on a regular basis.</p>
<list id="list8-1076217513486647" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Providing in situ professional development, as teachers require additional instruction in key areas of implementation of differentiation such as the use of flexible grouping, use of question asking, and project work</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Across the first 3 years of the program, the instructional coach scripted classroom lessons for periods of 30 min and used the William and Mary Classroom Observation Scale to judge teacher efficacy in the use of differentiation and fidelity of curriculum implementation. The observations were not evaluative in nature but rather to provide data to guide subsequent professional development sessions, in buildings and across the three sites. Summative data were shared with the gifted supervisor and principals to inform them of program implementation issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1076217513486647">
<title>Evaluation Summary</title>
<p>The evaluation conducted after the first 3 years of operation suggested that the program had made great strides in its journey to create middle schools of excellence for gifted learners. The veteran teachers and principals in the program, and the gifted staff were all commended by students and parents for their dedication and commitment to making the program work. One student remarked on the benefits of the program in summation: “nice and rigorous/good teachers/keeps me busy with work/challenging but not too hard/enjoyable.” The use of ability grouping came in for special praise by all stakeholders. One student said, “We have come to be like one big family—all cousins, teachers are in-laws. Everyone doesn’t think the same but good to be around people like you.” The differentiated curriculum and instructional approaches were found to be working much more effectively in veteran teachers’ classrooms than in the first 2 years of the program. One student observed, “I feel like the curriculum was designed to provide us with a challenge, and the teaching styles of the teachers are wide and diverse. Teachers seem to realize that we, as mature students, can learn deeper things.”</p>
<p>Student performance in competitions was laudatory as was the student acceptance rate into advanced high school programs. Recommendations for the next 3 years centered on the importance of continuing professional development with new teachers, a need to align the curriculum to the new common core and show how it is still a differentiated model, continuing to monitor for teacher fidelity of implementation, and to assess learner outcomes more systematically, using appropriate performance-based and portfolio approaches.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>The journey of Pinellas County’s development of gifted middle school centers is one that many more districts could take if they were committed to the ideal of addressing gifted student needs as the basis for program planning and development. The lessons learned from this journey include the importance of involving all stakeholders in the planning process, developing a philosophy and set of goals that are embraced by all these stakeholders, using research-based curriculum to drive the process, providing both solid coursework and ongoing professional development to prepare teachers for the challenge of working with whole groups of gifted learners, and providing support structures in the form of an instructional coach to address issues of fidelity of implementation. The journey for Pinellas will now continue as it embarks on its next 3 years of progress toward the program vision of exploring the past, envisioning the future, and embracing your passion.</p>
