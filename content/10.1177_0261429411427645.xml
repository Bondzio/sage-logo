<abstract>
<p>All children are born with the gifts of curiosity and creativity – and an insatiable appetite for asking questions to find out about the world in which they live. Fostering these questions and developing inquisitive and investigating minds is one of the essential roles of parent and teacher, and the processes of enquiry are the necessary routes for nurturing and developing all children’s potential for thoughtful discovery. The ethos of this paper is that ‘every child matters’, and the underlying message is one of ‘inclusion with differentiation’. The theme flowing throughout is that teachers and learners need to work interactively to construct knowledge; and, together, through this interaction, deep and sustained learning is promoted. When learners are truly involved in constructing knowledge for themselves, their motivation is high and both individual and group effort is sustained. Importantly, children in many communities are born into a rapidly changing technological world: they grow up using technological tools naturally, with ease and without fear, and they are often more proficient than their teachers! Learners are communicating globally, but all too often their technical skills and powers of communicating are not utilized in schools. In this paper Belle Wallace explains the Thinking Actively in a Social Context (TASC) Framework for thinking and problem-solving; Alessio Bernadelli recommends a wide range of software tools that he uses to develop TASC at secondary level; and Clare Molyneux and Clare Farrell describe a very successful primary project using TASC and Studywiz.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of Life Poised and Open in Expectancy</p>
<p>
<italic>The eyes of a newly born child focus gradually on an awareness of a world of colours, shapes and shadows. The dawning and recognition of faces that smile and welcome, and the scent and warmth of supporting arms in the close intimacy of nurturing and caring – the first knowing of the self. The self – parted from the time of preconscious thought yet still linked to it for a brief all-knowing time. A gift to adults – these newly opened eyes – a glimpse into eternity – a glimpse of life poised and open in expectancy.</italic>

<title>Part 1: The TASC Problem-solving Framework</title>
<p>Belle Wallace</p>

<sec id="section2-0261429411427645">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intelligence is essentially the capacity to solve problems – seen most dynamically through problem-solving activities involving creative and analytical thinking embedded within real-life topics. And all children (and adults) can improve their skills of thinking and problem-solving – ‘intelligence’ is not fixed in any individual – we all have the capacity to improve and to grow throughout the whole of our lifetime. Hence, the identification of learners with high potential needs to be focused on both their existing capacity for problem-solving <italic>and their potential for growth</italic>.</p>
<p>Government education policy documents (UK) are stating that schools need to increase their use of websites and educational software to create learning platforms. In addition, all learners need opportunities to negotiate the topics of their investigative work; they then have ownership of their learning, which leads to increased motivation and attention. This is <italic>personalizing learning </italic>– encouraging learners to find out possible answers to questions that they have raised as interesting and worth exploring. This, in turn, leads to increased confidence in questioning, a sense of self-esteem and self-worth, and the promotion of a life lived with the posing of questions and the search for possible answers to those questions. Such research opportunities are boundless via suitable educational websites. In addition, recording and communicating techniques are equally boundless through a vast range of software programmes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261429411427645">
<title>Differentiated learning</title>
<p>As the TASC problem-solving framework provides a structure for learners to work independently or in small groups, the learners can take the topic, investigation or research project into as much depth and breadth as they choose, making full use of suitable website information. The TASC framework replicates, albeit very simply, how an expert thinker thinks, and as the world is a ‘mixed abilities’ world, individual learners will need different levels of support. Some learners will use the TASC framework to fly independently, whereas others will require varying degrees of teacher support. Some learners will need quite strong scaffolding, but working through the stages of the TASC Wheel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261429411427645">1</xref>) gives them the overall structure for the processes of their thinking and problem-solving. The TASC process allows the teacher great flexibility in responding to the different levels of learners’ development; and when information and communication technology (ICT) facilities are fully utilized, the interactions between teacher and learner, and learner and learner, and teacher, learner and parent are maximized. The major obstacle that teachers need to overcome is often a personal one – they need to relinquish tight control over the tasks the learners undertake – allowing the children to set their own breadth and depth of learning.</p>

<sec id="section4-0261429411427645">
<title>Why <italic>TASC</italic>?</title>
<p>Together with Harvey Adams, throughout the 1980s, I searched the world for a well-founded and sustainable rationale that could underpin a whole curriculum that developed problem-solving and thinking skills. We visited countries that were beginning to dabble in ‘thinking skills’; worked with researchers delving into the concept of ‘intelligence’; worked alongside ‘expert thinkers’, asking them to externalize their thinking processes. Then, most importantly, we trialled and constantly revised strategies and thinking tools until both learners and teachers identified that they were, indeed, thinking and solving problems efficiently and successfully.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261429411427645">1</xref>
</sup> Since then, the emerging field of neuroscience has increasingly confirmed that when the brain is fully and actively engaged in learning, then pupils are both motivated and persevering when they have relevant problems to solve.</p>
<sec id="section5-0261429411427645">
<title>
<bold>TASC</bold> means ‘<bold>T</bold>hinking <bold>A</bold>ctively in a <bold>S</bold>ocial <bold>C</bold>ontext’</title>
<sec id="section6-0261429411427645">
<title>All children can think</title>
<p>but thinking can be enhanced and developed through appropriate practice, in the same way as a gymnast trains and perfects complex movements so that he or she becomes automatic and controlled but also highly flexible and creative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411427645">
<title><italic>Every child needs to be an active thinker</italic>! We can’t ‘<italic>do</italic> thinking to a child’!</title>
<p>We need to engage children in activities that involve them in their own thinking and problem-solving, letting them see that these thinking activities are qualitatively different from rote learning and practice, important though these activities might be.</p>
<p>Children are so good at teaching each other! <italic>We are social beings</italic> and when we are communicating, we are crystallizing ideas. Children can and do teach each other, often explaining and making meaning amongst themselves in a far more comprehensible way than when the teacher explains.</p>
<p>When learning is in <italic>the context of real life experience</italic>, then learners can identify with the topic and develop ownership, and also relate to the learning in a personal way because it has relevance.</p>

<title>Using and recording the TASC process</title>
<sec id="section9-0261429411427645">
<title>How to use TASC</title>
<p>All the stages of the TASC problem-solving framework can be conducted with the whole class, or with small groups, or with individual learners. The recording of the stages of thinking needs to be efficient and minimal. These recording skills need to be taught, and this is where exciting and colourful ICT software can play a major role. Obviously, all learners’ work and teachers’ interactions can be stored electronically. The TASC problem-solving Wheel is also highly coloured so that the processes of thinking can be colour coded, all re-thinks can be noted, and final mindmaps in the ‘learn from experience’ stage can be compared with the ‘gather and organize’ stage.</p>
<p>While it is important to colour code <italic>all </italic>stages of the TASC process to highlight and celebrate the thinking, it is also important to differentiate the ‘thinking stages’ and the ‘final product’. This differentiation through additional symbols enables learners to realize that their <italic>thinking</italic> can be flexible, and changes can always be made.</p>
<p>Teachers are reassured when they realize that the TASC framework itself provides the ‘control’ of the lesson(s). However, when children are working within the TASC framework, teachers universally report that learners are ‘on task’ with increased attention and concentration. Many ‘behaviour problems’ disappear, as learners become more engaged in taking more responsibility for their thinking and decision-making. Moreover, in any TASC-based activity, learning objectives can be easily ‘slotted in’, and selected appropriately from across the curriculum. (See Wallace (2009) for detail of the evaluation of the TASC framework in UK schools.)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261429411427645">
<title>Stages of the TASC problem-solving framework</title>
<p>The processes encapsulated within the TASC framework correspond with the latest theories of neuroscience that confirm how children best <italic>learn</italic> and, consequently, how teachers best <italic>teach</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261429411427645">
<title>Gather and organize: What do I know already?</title>
<p>This stage encourages learners to pull the fragments of their learning into the working memory. There are no mistakes in this activity: all children are successful, although some of the remembering may be fragmented. The important element in the stage of ‘organizing’ is to visually construct the connecting lines between ideas.</p>
<p>Mindmaps or concept maps are vitally important because they replicate through both simple and complex formats and how the brain actually functions; the more often children use mindmaps, flowcharts diagrams of all sorts, the better they can make the links in their learning. This activity also helps memory and recall as the very making of a mindmap activates, reinforces and links the neurons, strengthening the connections in the brain. Many software programmes are very useful for first gathering and then organizing and grouping ideas because the ideas can easily be rearranged – but, again, the links must be shown to emphasize how the ideas are connected.</p>
<p>With young learners, this stage can be developed and practised through gathering and organizing a collection of tangible objects around a broad theme, for example model vehicles, small toys, collections of various pictures or collections of artefacts. The items are stored in a large box ready for sorting into groups in as many ways as is possible. In these activities, the items on the floor need to be sorted and then coloured ribbons used to represent the connecting lines – a tangible, hands-on, changeable, visible mindmap. Or, as many early years practitioners can demonstrate, large hoops arranged in a Venn diagram showing similarities and differences is an ideal strategy for gathering and then organizing in a variety of ways. The concepts of weight, volume, shape, size, colour, usefulness, interest, old and new can all be taught and easily learned through practical gathering and organizing.</p>
<p>If we know that learners have little prior experience to ‘gather’ from, then it is important to flood the experiential learning <italic>before</italic> doing a ‘gather and organize’. For example, if children are going to be doing an investigation of ‘habitats’, it is important to visit a nature park, a forest, a seaside, or a riverbank, for example. Then, children have a rich store of experiences from which to gather and organize what they already know. It is helpful to let the children take a series of digital photographs of the exploration or the visit. These photographs can easily and quickly be transferred onto a whiteboard, or fed into a computer, and they enable immediate recall and can be used for a range of different activities. An emphasis on first-hand experience is essential for learners of all ages as they build a bank of rich learning activities that prompt recall and establish reference points. The ‘gather and organize’ stage of the TASC Wheel helps to develop confidence in ‘playing with ideas’, and also in the development of the skill of ‘reflecting back’ at a later stage of the TASC cycle.</p>
<p>In this early stage of the TASC cycle, it is also important to look for cross-curricular links through stories, drama, dance, music, numeracy, literacy, art, craft and design, and so on.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261429411427645">
<title>Identify: What am I going to do?</title>
<p>The brain needs to focus on the direction and purpose of the learning. Often, it is necessary for the teacher to identify <italic>for</italic> the children the broad question or topic they are going to explore; and then to discuss with them the specific skills they will need to learn in order to pursue their investigation. But, as often as possible, children need to identify the area of their exploration for themselves; this personalizes their learning and gives them a sense of ownership.</p>
<p>Important questions include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What would you like to know about this topic?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What questions could you ask?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What do you want to achieve?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How can you find more information?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What do you need to do this?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>For example, after the rich experiential learning prior to the investigation of ‘habitats’, children could be asked to identify particular questions that they would like to explore further.</p>
<p>Helping children to identify their own avenues of interest and exploration is a powerful motivator for learning: it focuses the direction of exploration, and generates the emotional involvement needed for attention and concentration. It is also the critical point for differentiation: some children can tackle simpler tasks, while others work in greater depth and breadth.</p>
<p>Alongside the identification of the task, pupils need to begin to discuss questions such as: How will I know that my work is good or excellent? What should it look like when I have finished? This kind of questioning links the purpose of the task with the end goal. The brain understands where the learning is leading – the direction, both logical and creative, of the learning journey.</p>
<sec id="section13-0261429411427645">
<title>Generate: How many ways can I do it?</title>
<p>This is the highly creative stage of generating possibilities, and the brain is very actively making numerous cross-connecting links. Children enjoy ‘generating’ because there are no ‘wrong ideas’ and they become very enthusiastic and highly motivated. Again, this stage of thinking engenders a sense of ownership and personalization. The children are suggesting possible avenues for the development of their activities and making their own decisions, rather than the teacher directing the activity. There are a number of key questions such as:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>How many ideas can I think of?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Where can I find out?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Who can I ask?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What do other people think?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How shall I present/communicate my work?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>If children are reticent to suggest possibilities, or lack the confidence to do so, then the role of the teacher is to enter into the excitement of generating ideas, modelling a range of possible avenues for exploration. By doing this, the teacher can ‘manoeuvre’ the discussion and very subtly influence the range of activities to be developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0261429411427645">
<title>Decide: Which are the best ideas?</title>
<p>After a very creative exploration of possibilities, the brain needs to think more logically and decide which ideas are feasible and possible. This stage still allows for creative decision-making, but the decision is more focused towards the end goal. Important questions include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What is the plan of action?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Which ideas are important?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How am I going to record my findings?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What materials do I need?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How much time have I got?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0261429411427645">
<title>Implement: Let’s do it!</title>
<p>This is the time to think about ways of putting the decision to action! Learners should already have some ideas of how they want to pursue their enquiry, and also how they will plan, record and communicate to others. Much of this discussion will have occurred at the ‘generate’ and ‘decide’ stages. But their thinking is crystallized at this point.</p>
<p>The brain is capable of functioning across and within <italic>all </italic>the human abilities and we combine several abilities in everything we do, but we also have different profiles of strengths that are partly genetically endowed and partly environmentally fostered. Hence, all children should have opportunities, over half a term or a term, to present their work using their strong abilities. By working across the full range of human abilities – social, emotional, spiritual, mechanical/technical, scientific, auditory/musical, visual/spatial, movement, linguistic (oral and written), mathematical – all children have a chance to shine and celebrate what they can do well.</p>
<p>Often, learners who need support in literacy and numeracy flourish when they are engaged in using their other abilities; it is essential that they have opportunities to show their strengths if their interest and motivation is to be maintained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0261429411427645">
<title>Evaluate: How well did I do?</title>
<p>Of course, teacher observation, assessment and evaluation are necessary, but if we are to develop pupil ownership, decision-making and personalized learning, then pupils need to learn how to evaluate both their own, and also each others’ work. Being able to evaluate one’s effort is a major key to autonomy in learning. The brain needs to acknowledge success, which is a powerful factor in building self-confidence, whilst simultaneously accommodating the need for improvement and further learning. This process not only demands critical thinking, but also deep emotional strength and self-esteem. In a classroom that celebrates success across all human abilities, it is easier for learners to acknowledge that they need to improve and strengthen certain abilities.</p>
<p>Learners praising each other’s efforts, while offering an idea for improvement, begins the process of self-evaluation. But it is also necessary that learners know what ‘competence’ and ‘excellence’ look like, and providing learners with concrete examples that they can discuss is an essential route for developing this evaluative capacity across all subjects within the curriculum and outside it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0261429411427645">
<title>Communicate: Let’s share what we have learned!</title>
<p>In sharing ideas, learners are crystallizing what they know, and what they have learned. In explaining to other children, learners are ordering and manipulating their ideas so that others can understand. In addition, it is wonderful fun to share using a variety of methods and skills, and, importantly, children are learning new ideas from each other.</p>
<p>We are social beings, and reaching out to interact with others develops our social, emotional and spiritual strengths as well as our cognitive abilities. When we communicate, we have the opportunity to use the whole brain – both creatively and logically – across all dimensions of human abilities.</p>
<p>Importantly, children are ‘doing something exciting’ with their learning rather than just always ‘writing it down’. Moreover, when learners communicate across the full range of human abilities, their skills of literacy also improve. As what they are communicating is the product of <italic>their own thinking</italic>, they can more easily talk about it and, as a result, more easily write about it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0261429411427645">
<title>Learn from experience: What have we learned?</title>
<p>This is the metacognitive stage – the thinking about thinking, feeling and learning. The brain has the wonderful capacity for ‘looking down on itself’ in order to reflect on its own functioning. All learners need to realize that they are making progress: it is not only the children who receive learning support who need to realize this, but also the more able learners, who need to realize that they are extending their learning and not just marking time.</p>
<p>At the end of a topic or piece of work, important discussion should take place, centred on questions such as:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>What do I know now that I didn’t know before?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What new skills have I learned?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>

<p>It is essential to return to the original mindmap of the ‘gather and organize’ stage and add in any new ideas or knowledge. This extends the original brain map of where the learner started and helps with training memory and with later recall of what has been learned.</p>
<p>When we can articulate what we have learned, then we can understand the learning that has taken place.</p>

<title>The Extended TASC Framework</title>
<p>It is not possible to list all the components that comprise the TASC problem-solving processes, but the comprehensive diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261429411427645">Figure 2</xref>) provides an example of how the elements within the TASC framework are blended into a coherent and whole set of educational experiences. Many teachers are overwhelmed by the constant range of new initiatives from the government and other outside agencies, and say that they ‘find difficulty in fitting the pieces of the jigsaw together’. Hence, the purpose of the diagram is to show how these ‘pieces of the jigsaw’ fit together within the TASC framework.</p>

<title>Basic thinking skills</title>
<p>The full range of the TASC <italic>basic</italic> thinking skills are mainly developed during early years’ educational experiences: many of these are ‘discovered’, verbalized, and clarified through experiential learning, whereas others need to be <italic>directly taught</italic> <italic>and practised</italic>. Learners cannot learn without having mastered a wide range of basic thinking skills so that they have a repertoire of ‘tools’ for action and problem-solving. For example, in science, learners need to learn how to measure and weigh accurately and how to manipulate simple language and number concepts, and they also need to learn scientific routines and styles of recording.</p>
<p>These basic thinking skills evolve into advanced thinking skills as learners gain mastery and confidence: the language, skills and learning tools become deeper and more complex.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0261429411427645">
<title>Advanced thinking skills</title>
<p>All children can use <italic>advanced </italic>thinking skills if the language and context are relevant to their level of development. For example, early years children are quite capable of analysing the sequence of events in the fairy story of Cinderella, creating a different ending and discussing the fairness of Cinderella’s role as the family servant!</p>
<p>In contrast, older learners can analyse the sequence of events in Romeo and Juliet, create a different ending and discuss the consequences of the feud between the Capulet and Montague families.</p>
<p>It is the <italic>context</italic> of learning that changes and becomes increasingly more complex; the brain’s actual thinking processes function in the same way. For example, young children will gather and organize their thinking around a visit to the fairground, whereas older children will gather and organize their thinking around the problem of global warming.</p>

<title>Useful tools and strategies for learning and thinking: Useful e-learning tools</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261429411427645">Figure 2</xref> also outlines a wide range of research and recording skills, both conventional and e-learning tools, that learners can use across the curriculum. The emphasis needs to be on ‘maximum’ thinking and ‘minimum but efficient’ research and recording skills.</p>
<sec id="section23-0261429411427645">
<title>Concluding statement</title>
<p>Undoubtedly, as technology advances even more rapidly, learners and their teachers need to become more familiar with e-learning facilities, although it is likely that, initially, the children will be more confident than most of their teachers! But if teachers develop the role of co-enquirer, and learn alongside the pupils using the TASC problem-solving approach, then the essential message of the TASC framework becomes clear: ‘We are learning <italic>how</italic> to learn <italic>together.</italic>’</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is important to conclude by saying that e-learning tools must never replace learning through first-hand experiences, and learning from life. Nor should the tools of e-learning replace the dynamic interactions that occur between excellent teachers and their pupils. Real-life experiences and exciting dialogues that fuel the teaching–learning processes will always be inspiring! The e-learning facilities are just modern tools to assist the essentially human interactions of learning and teaching.</p>

<title>Part 2: Useful software for use in conjunction with the TASC Problem-solving Framework</title>
<p>Alessio Bernardelli</p>
<p>I have a passion for the effective and pedagogically sound use of technology in education, and marrying TASC with some great free software and Web 2.0 tools has brought great advantages to my classroom. I have included a list of useful free software and Web 2.0 tools below with a short description of their uses and how they can apply to the TASC framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0261429411427645">
<title>Software</title>
<sec id="section26-0261429411427645">
<title>Photo Story 3 (Communicate Stage of TASC)</title>
<p>This is free Microsoft software that can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=92755126-a008-49b3-b3f4-6f33852af9c1&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=92755126-a008-49b3-b3f4-6f33852af9c1&amp;displaylang=en</ext-link></p>
<p>It allows you to turn a photo slideshow into a story narrated by the learners. So, the learning experiences they lived through TASC become very personal stories told through images and the imagination and creativity of the learners. You will find that because of the very personal nature of photos taken by learners individually and in groups, and thanks to the ability to add a narration to each photo frame, this tool becomes a natural way for children of all ages to engage in personalized learning through TASC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0261429411427645">
<title>Photosynth (Communicate stage of TASC)</title>
<p>This is a fantastic free online tool by Microsoft which takes a series of two-dimensional images (photos taken by learners) of, for example, an environment or an artefact, and merges them to build a three-dimensional experience. You can then view the area that has been photographed from different angles, zoom into details, look at objects from the top, and so on. This tool is great for communication, especially if learners are presenting their TASC project to a large audience. So, if your pupils’ work is an interactive display of an electric circuit (such as at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=44af9d22-7caf-4972-b621-aaff83389e6a">http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=44af9d22-7caf-4972-b621-aaff83389e6a</ext-link>), and you want everyone to see small parts and labels from afar, this is the right tool for your students.</p>
<p>Although this is a tool for the communicate stage of TASC, other projects, for example art and Design Technology (DT), can easily use Photosynth for planning and gathering information too, as pupils can capture the different stages of their creations and show the development in progress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0261429411427645">
<title>Deep Zoom Composer (Generate, Implement, and Communicate stages of TASC)</title>
<p>This free Microsoft software is a personal favourite of mine. It can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=457B17B7-52BF-4BDA-87A3-FA8A4673F8BF&amp;displaylang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=457B17B7-52BF-4BDA-87A3-FA8A4673F8BF&amp;displaylang=en</ext-link></p>
<p>Deep Zoom allows the user to build compositions of images that can be overlapped at incredible depths of zoom to create really interesting effects. For example, my Year 7 class (age 11+ years) used Deep Zoom in a TASC project on reproduction to create an interactive diagram of the male and female reproductive system, so the group that was teaching fertilization to their peers could hide an image of a fertilized egg near the wall of the uterus, etc. As Deep Zoom allows users to zoom in and out of compositions with very little loss in resolution, each group could use the composition created with the effort of the whole class to present their research on the reproductive system. Other uses of Deep Zoom could be for creative storytelling, creating mysteries, and so on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0261429411427645">
<title>OneNote 2007 or 2010</title>
<p>Whole TASC projects can be developed using this and the whole class can collaborate, especially when used with Office Web Apps. I consider OneNote to be one of the best note-taking software programs ever designed. It is not free, but it comes in the Office 2007 or 2010 suite, and its features are really useful. Shared notebooks can be created, which can be edited by multiple users simultaneously from school networks, or online with Office Web Apps. This is very handy because notebooks can be created for each group and shared with the pupils of a particular group. In this way, the learners can collaborate beyond the classroom and you have a track record of the contributions of each member of the group. In fact, whatever a learner writes is tagged with the name of the author of that sentence, making it very easy to monitor individual contributions within the work produced by a group!</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0261429411427645">
<title>iMindmap (Generate, Identify, Decide, Evaluate and Communicate stages of TASC)</title>
<p>This is a great application for PC, iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad for mind-mapping, and it is the only one endorsed by Tony Buzan. This application is not free for iPhone and iPad. It can be used by pupils in groups to make quick-fire mindmaps and then to share them with the teacher and other pupils by sending them via email, so that contributions from different groups can form the parts of a larger mindmap made by the whole class from the teacher’s computer.</p>
<p>ThinkBuzan has just launched the new version of iMindMap (iMindMap 5) and the basic version is free to download and keep. This software can be accessed via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/iaZM2V">http://bit.ly/iaZM2V</ext-link></p>

<sec id="section31-0261429411427645">
<title>Web 2.0 tools</title>
<p>Wallwisher.com is another fantastic collaborative online tool that allows multiple users to place sticky notes on a virtual wall. It is very suitable for planning, developing and reflecting. This is an invaluable tool for TASC because it allows pupils in different groups to share ideas with the whole class remotely and simultaneously. The teacher who creates the wall can set it so that each comment has to be moderated before it becomes visible to others, and one of the best things about it is that the learners do not need to register and login. All they need is the URL of the wall, which cuts down the time they need to get used to the system.</p>
<p>Voicethread.com is another incredible collaborative tool that turns a photo slideshow into an amazing sharing experience where everyone can contribute with voice, written, drawn, or video comments. I have seen teachers use this to plan, implement and communicate, but i have used it to communicate and then to evaluate and learn from experience. It is available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://voicethread.com/?#u754232.b904296.i4814164">https://voicethread.com/?#u754232.b904296.i4814164</ext-link></p>
<p>Glogster.com allows you to make online posters to share. I am using it with NGfL Cymru (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asober.edu.glogster.com/ngfl-cymru-glogging-about-gases/">http://asober.edu.glogster.com/ngfl-cymru-glogging-about-gases/</ext-link>) to encourage KS4 students (age 14+ years) to communicate their findings and the models they construct in a creative and fun way. The power of this tool is not just in the attractive layouts and highly visual effects that pupils can produce with little effort, but it lies mainly in the ability to share the pupils’ work with the rest of the world. This allows the students’ parents to see their children’s work and to post comments, giving them the opportunity to become more involved with their children’s learning.</p>
<p>Prezi.com is a great presentation tool for the ‘communicate’ stage, but I have used it as a mind-mapping tool with NGfL Cymru (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prezi.com/88wv5es9moqa/kinetic-theory-mind-map/">http://prezi.com/88wv5es9moqa/kinetic-theory-mind-map/</ext-link> and, for the video, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TENwsD0h9Rw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TENwsD0h9Rw</ext-link>). I use it as a mind-mapping tool because it allows you not only to create content at different depths of zoom (and it goes impressively deep), but also to create a path for your presentation. So, you can assign a guided tour through the mindmap you have created and lead the audience through your thinking, whilst having the option to zoom in and out to show details and the bigger picture at any point in the presentation. It also allows videos to be embedded in presentations, and I think this could be an interesting feature in a mindmap. Once a Prezi account has been created for yourself and your students, you can create a mindmap template with just a few branches to start off the groups, and maybe add some empty branches to encourage them to fill in the missing words. Then, the learners can find your template, copy it in their Prezi accounts and complete it. At the end of the activity you can have the original template projected on the board and allow different groups to add their contributions, thus you will have, together, created a very large whole-class mindmap.</p>

<p>Using a learning platform to support a six-week, cross-curricular project using the TASC Wheel with Year 6.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0261429411427645">
<title>Overview of project</title>
<p>The project was a half-term unit of work for year 6 during the spring term this year. Our curriculum, which has been developed over the past five years, is very cross-curricular and underpinned by rigorous use of skills progressions to ensure that all pupils make good progress in each subject. We have done a lot of work on thinking skills, independent and collaborative learning, and all classes regularly use the TASC Wheel for problem-solving lessons and projects in a range of subjects.</p>
<p>The focus for the project was a geographical enquiry about The Courtyard Shop, which is a community-run shop situated in the heart of Ropley village. The committee of the shop wrote to year 6 asking if they could find any ways to promote the shop, which has been open for only two years, and encourage more people to shop there and support it as a community venture, thus ensuring it remains a profitable business venture in the future.</p>
<p>The project was driven by the children’s ideas, and by using the TASC Wheel, our skills progressions for each subject and Studywiz it was possible to ensure that the level of work was both accessible yet challenging for children of all abilities within the class. The written planning documents evolved and changed as the children generated ideas that fitted with each area of the curriculum. Working in this way does require flexibility on the part of the class teacher and other adults in the classroom as you have to be willing to think on your feet, adapt ideas and lessons from day to day and also have the necessary support up your sleeve when a group needs it – but it did result in a lot of excitement about learning from the children!</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0261429411427645">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Ropley is village primary school in a rural location and we currently have 170 children on roll. There are six classes in the school and, owing to the nature of the mixed age group classes, we have to ensure that individual children are very carefully tracked and that the skills progressions are used in planning to ensure that all children make good progress.</p>
<p>This project was with a class of 25 year 6 children of very mixed ability (2A–5A in maths; 2B–5B in English). Eleven of the 25 children are on our vulnerable child register; five are on the special education needs (SEN) register and five are on the gifted and talented register for different aspects of the curriculum. They are a class who can be difficult to motivate and in the past have had a tendency to underperform in class and in test situations. They produce their best work when they are stimulated and enthusiastic and respond well to practical activities that have a strong ‘real life’ focus.</p>

<p>Children were motivated and excited by using Studywiz in this way.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The project provided lots of opportunities for the children to reflect on their learning and to evaluate their work in a wide range of ways both as individuals and as groups.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The class now instinctively uses the language of the TASC Wheel even when it is not explicitly being used.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The children have gained in confidence with using Studywiz for a wide range of purposes – it is no longer just a fun way to communicate with friends!</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Through careful structuring and regular opportunities to reflect both individually and as a group about the success criteria set by the children at the start of the project, the children were able to sustain motivation and interest for six weeks on this project.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The children became much better at using the language of evaluation because of the regular planned opportunities to do this and the use of key questions linked to each section of the TASC Wheel.</p>

<p>I learned that watercress has more calcium than milk, more vitamin C than orange, more iron than spinach and no fat!</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I learned how to adapt a recipe to add certain ingredients.</p>

<p>In English we have been doing a selection of different writing. We have been doing persuasive writing for The Courtyard Shop and watercress leaflets, explanatory texts for writing our ‘How watercress is grown?’, and as well as this we wrote instructions for our recipes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In maths we have also been doing a selection of different skills such as problem solving for costing the recipes; calculator skills for checking our working out and calculating the quantity of ingredients and also rounding to two decimal places.</p>

<title>What have I enjoyed from doing this project?</title>

<list-item>
<p>I enjoyed the cooking because it was a nice change and we were working in groups.</p>

<list-item>
<p>I enjoyed visiting the Courtyard Shop to buy all the ingredients for our pizzas.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I enjoyed the cooking because it was a rare opportunity to learn different skills. It was also a chance to find out where our food comes from.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I enjoyed the price comparison work in maths and ICT.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I have enjoyed all the things the class did but the cooking was by far the best because we were doing something all the time (even if it is taking the skin off a sausage!)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>This has been a really fun term! I really enjoyed cooking and tasting food.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I enjoyed doing the ‘How is watercress grown?’ text because when I finished it I was really proud of it.</p>
</list-item>

<title>What could I have improved?</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The DT where we had to try and include watercress in our recipes was hard.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>There is only one thing we could improve which is to use all the spare ingredients so that nothing goes to waste.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The only thing we could have done differently was to make the sausage rolls first so we’d know the amount of ingredients we used on the day.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I think it would have been interesting to have gone and seen a watercress bed.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It could have been better if we could choose our groups, instead of being the tables we sit on.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I think that we could have done our ICT better because we could have put a lot more information if we didn’t have a limit of four pages.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In the assembly we could have shown the parents a video clip of us making the food in DT.</p>

<p>Our group worked really well together and did our work quickly and properly.</p>

<title>How did the TASC Wheel help me?</title>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>It helped in the way that we had to generate ideas for what recipes we could do inspired by the visit from Mrs Laing. Then we had to decide which one was the best and actually make it!</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>We did not realize that we were using the TASC Wheel but when we looked at it we could see that we were following the TASC Wheel.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I didn’t think that the TASC Wheel helped me but now that you look back at it you see what you have done … gather and organize: first mindmap about watercress; identify: we are going to cook food with watercress; generate: how many recipe ideas can we think of?; decide: decide what recipe we would do; implement: let’s cook!; evaluate: writing this evaluation!</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I think the TASC Wheel has helped because it has given us a basic structure of what to do and when to do it.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The TASC Wheel has helped me work through this term in a systematic way and order.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The TASC Wheel has helped me generate by thinking of ideas for our watercress work and it has helped me communicate with other people on my table.</p>

<title>Why use Studywiz?</title>
<p>At the time I did this project with year 6 (spring term 2009), the head and myself had attended three of the six Studywiz training sessions and were looking for a inspiration for how to launch it with the rest of the staff at our school. We have invested a lot of time over the past five years in developing a curriculum that is stimulating and exciting and engages all pupils fully in their learning. We wanted to find creative and innovative ways to use Studywiz to enhance the curriculum at Ropley.</p>
<p>I used this project as a way of trialling Studywiz with year 6 before introducing it to the rest of the teaching staff at an INSET day. This approach meant that the head and I had time to reflect and consider what we wanted to achieve via Studywiz and ensure that this was clearly articulated to the teaching staff before they started to use it. Having done this project it was decided that we would introduce the staff to a limited number of activities and tools on Studywiz that we felt fitted best within our curriculum and had worked well when I tried them in the context of this project. These were e-mail, e-locker, gallery, discussion, chat room, voting, file upload, website lists, embedded video clips, e-bulletins and RSS feeds.</p>
<p>The teachers are now at the stage of becoming familiar with Studywiz themselves and identifying ways that they think they could use it within their class in September when we launch it with the whole school.</p>

<title>TASC Image Bank</title>
<p>This is a collection of high-quality JPEG images for use with an electronic white board. The image bank allows teachers to use the TASC framework flexibly with a whole class, or groups and individuals can use the white board for their particular projects. For example, it is easy to show each segment of the Wheel in isolation, so that children can focus on the exact type of thinking required, for example, a ‘generate’ activity. In addition, teachers can show the TASC Wheel being built up a segment at a time over the course of a TASC activity, so that pupils can better appreciate the process as a whole and the way different types of thinking combine to form a complete problem-solving strategy.</p>
<p>Teachers can also use image bank images to create unique and specific scaffolding aids and web pages to support the TASC process in their school. Image bank comes with a site licence, so schools can freely copy and create their own workbooks, planners, homework diaries, etc.</p>
