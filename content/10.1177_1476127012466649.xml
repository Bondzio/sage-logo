<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although acquisitions serve as an important strategy to expand firms’ geographic operations, we have limited knowledge about how firms’ often complex geography influences firm acquisition choices. The existing literature has largely overlooked the empirical reality that many acquisitions involve multi-location targets, which can complicate how geography factors into acquisition choices. This has led for calls to better understand how firms’ geographic complexity affects location choice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012466649">McCann and Folta (2008)</xref>, for instance, note that ‘the extant literature envisions firms as unitary actors with one location, when in reality firms often have multiple establishments in varied locations’ (p. 552). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012466649">Ramos and Shaver (2009)</xref> similarly argue for the ‘need to incorporate a more nuanced geographic perspective of firms by recognizing that many firms are multi-location entities’ (p. 395).</p>
<p>In response to these calls, we examine the role of inter-firm and intra-firm agglomeration effects through the use of acquisitions of multi-location targets in knowledge-intensive industries – looking in particular at the role of knowledge transfer. Thus, we hypothesize how some <italic>specific locations</italic> of multi-location targets affect the likelihood of acquisition rather than hypothesize that an aggregate representation of their geographic profile affects the likelihood of acquisition. We favour this approach, which begins to incorporate geographic complexity, for two reasons (although we empirically control for aggregate location characteristics). First, our theory development points to two systematic motivations in acquisitions in knowledge-intensive settings: access to localized knowledge spillovers from other firms and ease of within-firm knowledge transfer. Therefore, we focus on firms’ geographic traits related to these concerns. Second, aggregating characteristics of multi-location firms implicitly assumes that firms are limited in restructuring assets that they acquire (e.g. selling or closing subsets of the assets).</p>
<p>For example, firms in knowledge-intensive industries, such as electronic communications equipment, often rely on specialized pools of inputs. In such a setting, a potential acquisition target with operations in San Jose, California, might be especially valued for its access to technology-based infrastructure in Silicon Valley – regardless of where its other operations reside. Thus, invoking variation in industry knowledge intensity, a key driver of firms’ geographic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012466649">Cantwell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012466649">Chung and Alcácer, 2002</xref>), we predict how specific locations of multi-location targets influence target choice in knowledge-intensive industries. First, we predict that in knowledge-intensive industries, multi-location targets are more likely to be selected the higher the knowledge intensity in a single location. We also hypothesize that in such industries, an acquirer is more likely to select a multi-location target the more locations their operations overlap because it facilitates internal knowledge transfer in the combined firm.</p>
<p>We test these predictions with a sample of acquisitions of multi-location firms between 2002 and 2004 in US manufacturing industries using a discrete choice methodology. We find robust support for both predictions.</p>
<p>Our predictions and findings highlight the importance that inter-firm and intra-firm agglomeration effects play in the choice of multi-location acquisition targets. By highlighting the importance of firms’ specific geographic attributes as resources valued in acquisitions, we provide further evidence of how geography plays a role in the market for corporate control. Moreover, we demonstrate how factors found in studies of de novo location choice or the acquisitions of single-establishment firms should be incorporated when assessing the acquisition of multi-location targets. In doing so, we show that nuanced theorizing and measurement are central to understanding the role that location plays in the acquisition of multi-location targets.</p>
<p>This article proceeds as follows. The section ‘The role of geography in acquisition activity’ derives two hypotheses. Descriptions of the data and methods follow. The final sections present the empirical results and conclusion.</p>

<title>The role of geography in acquisition activity</title>
<p>Previous research identifies three factors that affect the geographic location of acquired firms: access to localized inputs, access to localized markets and proximity of acquirer to target. For the first two dimensions, the research on acquisitions largely examines if characteristics shown to influence the location of new manufacturing plants also influence the location of acquisitions. With respect to accessing localized inputs, existing work demonstrates the importance of infrastructure, labour costs, research and development (R&amp;D) activity and broader agglomeration benefits in determining acquisition targets (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012466649">Friedman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012466649">Roberto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012466649">Ruckman, 2005</xref>). With respect to accessing localized markets, empirical evidence shows that acquirers tend to buy targets with presence in large regional markets – which can bestow scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012466649">Roberto, 2004</xref>) and market power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012466649">Friedman et al., 1996</xref>) advantages. This body of work has two limitations. First, because of data limitations, entry is modelled into one location only and overlooks potential acquisitions of multi-location targets. Second, with the exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012466649">Ruckman (2005)</xref>, the articles do not model a ‘target selection’ process where geographic attributes influence target choice (i.e. who gets acquired from a pool of potential targets). Rather, they model location choice (i.e. where firms choose to enter from a pool of potential locations) for samples of acquisitions.</p>
<p>There also exists a growing body of research demonstrating that greater distance between an acquirer and a potential target decreases the likelihood of acquisition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012466649">Baum et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012466649">Chakrabarti and Mitchell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012466649">Green, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012466649">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012466649">Green and Meyer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476127012466649">Mariotti and Piscitello, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012466649">Ragozzino and Reuer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012466649">Schildt and Laamanen, 2006</xref>). Three mechanisms have been argued to drive this relationship. The first mechanism is localized search. Localized geographic search occurs because experience at particular locations facilitates further information gathering around them by decision-makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012466649">Baum et al., 2000</xref>). Likewise, the impact of social interaction in search is significant, as individuals are more likely to form a personal or professional relationship leading to economic information exchange when living or working geographically close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476127012466649">Sorenson and Stuart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476127012466649">Stuart and Sorenson, 2003</xref>). The second mechanism, building on information economics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476127012466649">Akerlof, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012466649">Arrow, 1974</xref>), argues that geographic distance increases information asymmetry for acquirers looking where to buy or between acquirers and potential targets, leading to a potential ‘lemons’ problem (Ragozzino and Reuer, 2001). The third mechanism is that proximity facilitates post-acquisition coordination, knowledge transfer and activity sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012466649">Baum et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012466649">Green and Cromley, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012466649">Phene et al., 2010</xref>). By largely focusing on headquarter locations of firms,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1476127012466649">1</xref></sup> this research abstracts from the often complex geographic footprints, which is central to our investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1476127012466649">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>As we noted, although existing research reveals patterns of location choice in acquisitions, it has largely overlooked the geographic complexity of firms involved – examining single-location targets or the headquarters locations of multi-location firms. In acquisitions of multi-location firms, we expect that location attributes of all locations can play an important role in target selection because many of the identified mechanisms that affect target selection are not solely related to headquarter activities.</p>
<p>Our approach to advancing understanding of multi-location target firms does not lie with simply devising measures of firms’ aggregate geographic footprint. Rather, we argue that in knowledge-intensive industries, acquirers are likely to value particular locations of multi-location targets due to their potential inter-firm and intra-firm knowledge-based agglomeration benefits. We take this approach for two reasons. First, there can be heterogeneity in location attributes within a multi-location firm. Therefore, aggregate descriptions of firm attributes can conceal how geographic knowledge spillovers and internal knowledge transfer can be manifest with multi-location acquisition targets. Second, the possibility for corporate restructuring can make it valuable for acquirers to purchase target firms even if they value only particular operations. Aggregate descriptions of firm attributes imply that the entire set of operations is what an acquirer values and precludes the possibility that an acquirer can unlock value by operating a subset of the acquired assets and shedding the others.</p>
<p>Although the previous arguments make a compelling case not to theorize how aggregate target characteristics affect the choice of multi-location targets, we believe that this should be assessed in the data. Therefore, although we do not hypothesize how aggregate characteristics affect the likelihood of acquisitions, we control for such characteristics in our empirical tests. We now turn to developing hypotheses of when specific locations of potential multi-location targets affect the likelihood that a potential target is acquired.</p>
<p>An important determinant of location choice is access to localized inputs such as knowledge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012466649">Cantwell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012466649">Chung and Alcácer, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1476127012466649">2</xref></sup> Moreover, industries differ in their degree of knowledge intensity (Science and Engineering Indicators, various years).For example, companies in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing invest significant funds in R&amp;D relative to their sales – approximately 12% in 2007. In contrast, R&amp;D investments in other manufacturing industries are significantly lower. Food manufacturers invested on average approximately 0.7% the same year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012466649">Science and Engineering Indicators, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In knowledge-intensive industries, we expect that target presence in a knowledge-intensive location will be valued and will influence selection because access to localized knowledge can affect firms’ competitive positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012466649">Murtha et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012466649">Porter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012466649">Saxenian, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476127012466649">Tallman et al., 2004</xref>). Emerging technological developments are likely to occur in knowledge-intensive locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012466649">Audretsch and Feldman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012466649">Porter, 1998</xref>). Firm presence is required to take advantage of that knowledge because knowledge spillovers tend to be geographically bound. For instance, citations to domestic patents in the United States are more likely to come from the same state and metropolitan area as the cited patents, in particular from the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012466649">Jaffe et al., 1993</xref>). Innovative activity, in the form of commercial innovations, also tends to be more agglomerated or ‘clustered’ in industries where knowledge spillovers are more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012466649">Audretsch and Feldman, 1996</xref>). Similarly, knowledge flows among multinationals in the US semiconductor industry, measured through patent citations and field research, tend to occur within regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012466649">Almeida, 1996</xref>). Tapping into knowledge-rich regions becomes critical as the value of knowledge being generated in them may quickly depreciate over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012466649">Lorenzen and Mahnke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012466649">Mansfield, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Several mechanisms facilitate localized knowledge diffusion. First, geographic proximity facilitates informal socializing among employees that can lead to knowledge dissemination. For instance, inter-firm knowledge spillovers in Silicon Valley and Route 128 US regions are facilitated by the social interaction of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012466649">Saxenian, 1994</xref>). Second, regional inter-firm employee mobility can lead to spillovers. For instance, in the US semiconductor industry, firms’ reliance on local social networks leads them to hire engineers locally, creating regional inter-firm knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012466649">Almeida and Kogut, 1999</xref>). Third, proximity eases the ability to collaborate with colleagues at nearby firms leading to eventual diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1476127012466649">Zucker and Darby, 1996</xref>). Underlying these mechanisms is localized social capital, the idiosyncratic norms and networks that characterize regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012466649">Kalnins and Chung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012466649">Laursen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012466649">Saxenian, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476127012466649">Storper, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476127012466649">Uzzi, 1997</xref>), enabling a ‘culture of intraregional communication and interfirm mobility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012466649">Almeida, 1996</xref>: 157). This geographically bounded social capital is the key transmitter of localized knowledge spillovers, as it facilitates collective learning for innovation and reduces the search and transaction costs of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012466649">Laursen et al., 2012</xref>). Acquisitions, therefore, allow buyers to tap into targets’ geographically bounded social capital. Consistent with this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012466649">Lorenzen and Mahnke (2002)</xref> provide case-based evidence of acquirers seeking target in knowledge-rich regions as a way of both ‘utilizing a local firm’s codebook for interpretation’ and ‘acquiring the social relations’ of the target (pp. 7–9). Such linkages can be valuable even for acquirers already present in such regions because they can broaden or deepen their linkages within these regions.</p>
<p>The localized nature of knowledge spillovers makes specific locations rather than aggregate locations attractive. For example, the geographic concentration of developers of advanced microprocessors in Silicon Valley makes it an attractive location. However, in aggregate, there is substantial activity in this industry across the United States outside of Silicon Valley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012466649">Curry and Kenney, 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, it is very different for a firm to locate in Silicon Valley versus multiple locations outside of Silicon Valley with similar aggregate – yet diffuse – activity. Thus, we hypothesize:</p>
<list id="list1-1476127012466649" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H1: In knowledge-intensive industries, multi-location targets are more likely to be selected the greater the knowledge intensity in a single location</italic>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We should note that although the literature on de novo entry has demonstrated a similar effect, it is not an obvious prediction in light of our focus on multi-location targets. The reason is that there are other seemingly more direct means for a firm to gain access to a specific location such as creating a de novo operation, seeking an alliance partner, acquiring a single-unit firm or purchasing localized operations of a multi-location firm.</p>
<p>Location is not only important for access to knowledge spillovers but also for transferring knowledge within the combined entity. Therefore, we expect acquirers to value geographic overlap of their operations with those of the target in knowledge-intensive industries. Geographic overlap of operations decreases coordination costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012466649">Barlow, 1953</xref>). More importantly, in knowledge-intensive industries, it makes the transfer and recombination of tacit knowledge less costly and difficult. Tacit knowledge has been described as skills and expertise that are personal, context specific and difficult to codify for transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012466649">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012466649">Polanyi, 1962</xref>). In an organizational context, knowledge transferred between organizational units is often largely tacit, embedded in individual and organizational routines, and therefore, difficult to transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012466649">Kogut and Zander, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012466649">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>) or ‘sticky’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1476127012466649">Szulanski, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476127012466649">Von Hippel, 1994</xref>). The degree of tacitness is higher in knowledge-intensive industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012466649">Feldman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012466649">Martin and Salomon, 2003</xref>). Geographic overlap facilitates personal interaction through intra-firm mobility of personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476127012466649">Yoffie, 1993</xref>). Personal interaction facilitates knowledge transfer by providing an efficient communication mechanism and promoting the development of personal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012466649">Storper and Venables, 2004</xref>). Personal interaction is an efficient communication technology when the information to be transmitted is not easily codified, because it permits a depth and speed of feedback that is impossible in other forms of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012466649">Nohria and Eccles, 1992</xref>). Personal communication occurs on many levels simultaneously (e.g. verbal, physical, contextual). Such multi-dimensional communication is necessary for the transmission of tacit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012466649">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012466649">Polanyi, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012466649">Storper and Venables, 2004</xref>). Being close allows visual contact and emotional closeness, which are the basis for building relationships that enable knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012466649">Storper and Venables, 2004</xref>). Such relationships create social communities that enable routines of cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012466649">Kogut and Zander, 1992</xref>). In line with this logic, evidence shows that geographic proximity facilitates intra-firm exchanges of technical knowledge between operations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012466649">Adams and Jaffe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012466649">Galbraith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012466649">Martin and Salomon, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, by having presence in the same locations, an acquirer and target are more likely to have common ‘norms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012466649">Laursen et al., 2012</xref>), ‘codebooks’ or ‘particular ways of formulating, contextualizing, sharing, and using technology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012466649">Lorenzen and Mahnke, 2002</xref>: 7). This is likely to facilitate post-acquisition integration (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476127012466649">Datta, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012466649">Jemison and Sitkin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012466649">Larsson and Finkelstein, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012466649">Pablo, 1994</xref>), by increasing the likelihood of similarity in administrative and cultural practices within regions in knowledge-intensive industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012466649">Saxenian, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we expect acquirers in knowledge-intensive industries to value greater overlap in locations with potential targets. Thus, we hypothesize:</p>
<list id="list2-1476127012466649" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>H2: In knowledge-intensive industries, multi-location targets are more likely to be selected the greater their geographic overlap with acquirers.</italic></p></list-item>

<p>The extant literature highlights that distance affects target selection through localized search and decrease in information asymmetry. Measures of overlap might correlate with distance, and support for our hypothesis might be inferred as support for these other mechanisms. However, the mechanism central to our argument should be more salient in industries with high knowledge intensity than in those with low knowledge intensity – whereas, we expect these alternative mechanisms to impact acquisitions in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1476127012466649">3</xref></sup> Moreover, we control for distance between headquarters in our empirical analyses.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses with acquisitions in the US manufacturing sector. This setting has many research design advantages. First, numerous studies of location choice have noted the significant variation in regional characteristics within the United States (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012466649">Coughlin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012466649">Head et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012466649">Shaver, 1998</xref>). Second, manufacturing industries in the United States have meaningful variation in knowledge intensity (Science and Engineering Indicators, various years). Third, the United States is an active market for corporate control and has been used in previous studies of target selection (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012466649">Hall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012466649">Hannan and Rhoades, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012466649">Ruckman, 2005</xref>). Fourth, relevant firm and industry level data are available.</p>
<p>We employ a discrete choice methodology to test the hypotheses. This method requires that we gather data on actual acquisition targets and potential acquisition targets. Prior research examining how firm characteristics influence acquisition target selection has used this approach (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012466649">Hall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012466649">Hannan and Rhoades, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012466649">Ruckman, 2005</xref>). The dependent variable is therefore target choice. The explanatory variables are characteristics of potential targets that can affect their value for an acquirer and consequently influence the probability of being acquired. The model thus measures the effect of the hypothesized target characteristics while controlling other related factors that can influence target choice.</p>
<p>The estimator that we use is the conditional logit (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012466649">Chamberlain, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476127012466649">McFadden, 1974</xref>). This estimator assumes that agents maximize expected profits in making target choices. However, the estimator assumes that expected profit is a random variable. This feature allows for errors in firm maximization resulting from imperfect profit expectations of the acquiring firm and the inability to measure all relevant variables driving expected profits.</p>
<p>To gather the data required for this approach, we use LexisNexis Corporate Affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476127012466649">various years</xref>) as the base data source for firms’ information. It covers all public companies listed on NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), NASDAQ and AMEX (American Stock Exchange), and significant companies traded on smaller US exchanges. It also covers private companies that have at least US$10 million revenue, 300 employees or substantial assets.</p>
<p>To form the sample, we first identify all firms in this directory with their main Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code in manufacturing (codes 20–39),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1476127012466649">4</xref></sup> presence in at least two US metropolitan areas and no operations outside the United States. Restricting our sample to acquisitions of firms within the United States allows the use of consistent geographic units of analysis, which would not be possible if we included non-US operations. The location of a firm’s operation within the United States can be defined very broadly (e.g. regions such as Northwest or Southeast) or very narrowly (e.g. zip codes). We believe that metropolitan areas are the most appropriate geographic units to capture the mechanisms underlying our hypotheses. US metropolitan areas are large, densely populated areas where central and adjacent counties have a high degree of economic and social integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476127012466649">US Census Bureau Geographic Areas Reference Manual, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1476127012466649">Appendix 1</xref> describes the precise definition of metropolitan areas that we employ. Once all such firms are identified, we identify acquisitions by tracking changes in ownership across the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 in <italic>Corporate Affiliations</italic>. We confirm all acquisitions by reviewing acquisition announcements in <italic>Lexis-Nexis-Academic</italic> and <italic>Lexis-Nexis-MergerTrak</italic> databases. This approach leads to a sample of 79 acquisitions of multi-location targets and 781 potential targets that were not acquired.</p>
<p>For each acquisition we construct a choice set of potential targets in the following manner: we identify the set of potential targets as firms with presence in at least two metropolitan areas and having the same main four-digit SIC code as the acquired firm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1476127012466649">5</xref></sup> We use the four-digit level to select potential targets with the highest degree of industrial similarity that our data allow. This definition assumes that acquirers select among firms within a particular industry when buying multi-location targets. The alternative to this approach would be to define the potential targets for each choice set based on coarser industry definitions. However, this would introduce much larger choice sets of less similar firms, creating validity concerns. This definition also allows us to construct more precise industry-based control variables. By defining the choice set in this manner, the estimation controls for target industry characteristics because all firms within a choice set come from the same industry. The size of choice sets varies across the acquisitions within our sample from 2 to 43 firms, with an average of 10.9 firms.</p>
<p>Constructing the choice set in this manner also conditions the choice on firms deciding to acquire a multi-location target. We favour this approach because our hypotheses are centred on characteristics of individual locations that make a multi-location target more attractive to an acquirer. As we previously noted, if firms choose other ways to access a location when such characteristics are important, then our tests will fail to support our hypotheses.</p>
<p>The nature of our question favours defining the choice set in the aforementioned manner versus other ways found in related literatures. For example, studies of new plant location choice model firms choosing to enter a fixed set of locations, such as states within the United States (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012466649">Coughlin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012466649">Head et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476127012466649">Shaver and Flyer, 2000</xref>). This formulation does not map well to our setting because acquirers choose targets, which in turn have a location footprint. Likewise, studies of new ventures match with venture capital providers, or corporate venture capital providers define the potential choice set of all investors potentially investing in all new ventures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012466649">Dushnitsky and Shaver, 2009</xref>). This formulation does not map well to our study because those settings have a well-defined investor and target for investment. In the market for acquisitions, many firms are both potential targets and acquirers. Therefore, implementing this approach would suggest we model every firm potentially acquiring every other firm. This strikes us as unrealistic; moreover, it is empirically intractable. For these reasons, we favour the approach we undertake.</p>

<title>Data description</title>
<p>Before turning to the conditional logit results, we want to describe the location characteristics of firms within our sample. The 79 acquisitions with our sample were made by 76 unique firms (i.e. three acquisitions were made by firms that made another acquisition in the sample). Of the 79 acquisitions, 33 (32 unique firms) were in industries with high knowledge intensity and 46 (44 unique firms) in industries with low knowledge intensity. To split the sample, we measure industry knowledge intensity using industry R&amp;D expenditures divided by net sales in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012466649">National Science Foundation, 2006</xref>). We classify industries with values equal to or above the all-industry average as high knowledge intensity and those below it as low knowledge intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1476127012466649">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476127012466649">Table 1</xref> presents the average geographic footprint of these firms. The 32 acquirers in high-knowledge-intensive industries had on average operations in 6.44 metropolitan areas within the United States with a range from 0 to 35. Zero indicates that the all of the acquirer’s operations were outside of the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1476127012466649">7</xref></sup> These mapped to 102 unique metropolitan areas (out of 331) as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012466649">Table 2</xref>. In turn, the 46 acquirers in low-knowledge-intensive industries had on average operations in 12.93 metropolitan areas within the United States with a range from 0 to 80. These mapped to 187 unique metropolitan areas. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012466649">Table 3</xref> shows that acquirers in the high knowledge-intensive set of acquisitions are located in metropolitan areas with greater knowledge intensity than those in the low knowledge-intensive set (average of 1.5 vs 0.95 thousand patents’ inventors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1476127012466649">8</xref></sup>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1476127012466649">Table 1</xref> also describes the geographic characteristics of the acquired firms and potential targets within our choice sets. The average number of locations for potential targets in industries with high knowledge intensity is slightly lower than its equivalent in industries with low knowledge intensity (2.88 vs 3.08). Within knowledge-intensive industries, selected targets show a slightly smaller footprint than potential targets (2.73 vs 2.88). Thus, acquirers are characterized by much larger footprints than both potential and selected targets.</p>
<p>With respect to geographic dispersion, potential targets in industries with high knowledge intensity map into a total of 148 distinct metropolitan areas while those in industries with low knowledge intensity map into 196. Selected targets in industries with high knowledge intensity map into a total of 56 distinct metropolitan areas, while those in industries with low knowledge intensity map into 82.</p>
<p>Potential targets’ locations in industries with high knowledge intensity show an average of 1.11 thousand patents’ inventors, while potential target’s locations in industries with low knowledge intensity show an average of about 0.79. Furthermore, selected targets exhibit a footprint with higher patent intensity than potential targets in both sets of industries. Among them, selected targets in knowledge-intensive industries have the most knowledge-intensive footprint with an average of approximately 1.73 thousand patents’ inventors in their locations. In comparison, selected targets in industries with low knowledge intensity are present in locations with an average of about 1.3 thousand.</p>
<p>These descriptive statistics point to a number of patterns in the data. First, we see that firms choose to locate in many metropolitan areas within the country. Moreover, the choice sets demonstrate great variation in the metropolitan areas that firms could locate in. As expected, firms in high-knowledge-intensive industries tend to be in metropolitan areas with higher patent generation than those in low-knowledge-intensive industries. Finally, there is evidence that acquirers prefer knowledge-intensive operations of firms in the choice set – but in the simple descriptive statistics that preference appears across high- and low-knowledge-intensive industries. We now turn to the conditional logit analyses to better assess if target location characteristics influence location choice by assessing how variance in location characteristics – within each choice set – affects the likelihood that an acquirer chooses a particular target.</p>

<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Regarding knowledge spillovers, the focus of Hypothesis 1, we expect that valuable knowledge spillovers are more likely to be available in a target’s location with the greatest knowledge intensity. We define <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> for potential target <italic>i</italic> as the maximum number of inventors of granted patents in any metropolitan area <italic>l</italic> where it is located. We control for the aggregate geographic knowledge intensity of potential targets by including the total number of patent inventors across all metropolitan areas <italic>l</italic> in which a potential target is present <italic>(Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>The focus of Hypothesis 2 is the overlap between acquirer and potential targets. We code the variable <italic>Common metro areas<sub>ijl</sub></italic> as the number of metropolitan areas <italic>l</italic> where a potential target <italic>i</italic> and acquirer <italic>j</italic> have common presence.</p>
<p>Previous research identifies three factors that affect the geographic location of acquired firms: access to localized inputs, access to localized markets and proximity of acquirer to target. We include controls for each.</p>
<p>With respect to other localized inputs, existing work demonstrates the importance of agglomeration economies and labour costs in determining acquisition targets (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012466649">Friedman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012466649">Roberto, 2004</xref>). We include controls for agglomeration benefits beyond knowledge spillovers by including the total establishments in potential target <italic>i</italic>’s industry <italic>k</italic> across all metropolitan areas <italic>l</italic> where it is located (<italic>Total establishments<sub>ikl</sub></italic>). We also measure the maximum number of establishments in any of the metropolitan areas where a potential target is present (<italic>Max establishments<sub>ikl</sub></italic>) to control for an important metropolitan agglomeration effect. We also include a control for production costs by measuring, for potential target <italic>i</italic>, the average weekly wages of all metropolitan areas <italic>l</italic> where it operates (<italic>Average wages<sub>il</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>With respect to accessing localized markets, empirical evidence shows that acquirers tend to buy targets with presence in large regional markets – which can bestow scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012466649">Hannan and Rhoades, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012466649">Roberto, 2004</xref>). We include controls measuring access to both consumer and industrial demand to control for product output markets. To measure the consumer market of a potential target <italic>i</italic>, we first employ the sum of population in all metropolitan areas <italic>l</italic> where it operates <italic>(Total population<sub>il</sub>)</italic>. To assess whether an acquirer values a potential target <italic>i</italic>’s largest population associated with individual metropolitan areas <italic>l</italic>, we calculate the variable <italic>Max population<sub>il</sub></italic>. Although population-based measures have been traditionally used in location choice research to measure consumer demand (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012466649">Bartik, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012466649">Chung and Alcácer, 2002</xref>), they may not measure industrial markets adequately. Therefore, we construct two parallel measures of industrial markets based on potential target <italic>i</italic>’s demand from its industry <italic>k</italic> in metropolitan areas <italic>l</italic> where it is located: <italic>Total industrial demand<sub>ikl</sub></italic> and <italic>Max industrial demand<sub>ikl</sub></italic>. In addition, we include the count of operations for each potential target <italic>i</italic> to control for the possibility that acquirers favour or disfavour larger multi-unit firms in general (<italic># Operations<sub>i</sub></italic>).</p>
<p>Prior research shows that greater distance between an acquirer and a potential target’s headquarters decreases the likelihood of acquisition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012466649">Chakrabarti and Mitchell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012466649">Green, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012466649">Ragozzino and Reuer, 2011</xref>). We control for geographic distance between acquirers’ and potential targets’ headquarters in robustness tests.</p>

<p>Our hypotheses predict contingent effects of industry knowledge intensity. To test these effects, we estimate models where we split the sample by the degree of industry knowledge intensity. We follow this approach because of the difficulties of interpreting and testing interaction effects in non-linear models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012466649">Ai and Norton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012466649">Greene, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012466649">Shaver, 2007</xref>). Moreover, to match the nature of our sample and theory to the method, our specification allows for changes in the choice set across acquisitions (i.e. acquisitions in different industries have different pools of potential targets). Due to how marginal effects are calculated in the conditional logit formulation, variable choice sets preclude calculating marginal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012466649">Hensher et al., 2005</xref>) and graphically assessing interaction terms. Therefore, to test our predictions, we compare the statistical significance of potential targets’ attributes on the likelihood of their selection after splitting the sample into the targets’ industries with high and low knowledge intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1476127012466649">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Having initially examined key characteristics of the locations in our setting, we now turn our attention to our variables across industries for both potential and selected targets. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012466649">Table 5</xref> shows statistics for all potential targets in knowledge-intensive settings. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1476127012466649">Table 6</xref> displays statistics for selected targets in the same industries. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1476127012466649">Tables 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1476127012466649">8</xref> present similar statistics for low-knowledge-intensity industries. Some patterns are evident. In knowledge-intensive settings, relative to all potential targets, selected targets show higher knowledge intensity in both their entire geographic configuration and the individual location with the highest intensity. That is, <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> and <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> are higher for selected targets than for potential targets. This is not the case in low-knowledge-intensive industries, where selected targets and potential targets exhibit roughly similar knowledge intensity in both measures. This would offer some preliminary support for our first prediction. In addition, in knowledge-intensive industries, selected targets exhibit a higher degree of overlap with acquirers than potential targets do. This also appears to be the case for low-knowledge-intensive industries but to a lesser degree. This would also provide some initial support of our second prediction.</p>

<p>Within splits, the footprint based on population appears similar for both sets of firms. Regarding our controls for other agglomeration benefits, in knowledge-intensive industries, the data show that while selected targets are present in locations with higher aggregate potential for agglomeration externalities than potential targets (as measured by <italic>Total establishments<sub>ikl</sub></italic>), the former do not tend to be located in individual locations offering the highest degree of potential externalities compared to the latter (as measured by <italic>Max establishments<sub>ikl</sub></italic>). This points to the role of knowledge in single locations beyond other agglomeration effects. In low-knowledge-intensity industries, such a pattern does not arise. Selected targets exhibit roughly similar average levels of knowledge intensity to potential targets in both <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> and <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>Finally, the high correlation among some of the independent variables is evident. We address this issue in our empirical analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We find strong and robust support for both the hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 predicts that when acquiring in knowledge-intensive industries, acquirers will positively value the location with the highest knowledge intensity in multi-location targets. Therefore, we expect <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> to show a positive significant effect in acquisitions in knowledge intensives, and the lack of such effect in acquisitions in industries with low knowledge intensity.</p>
<p>Models 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1476127012466649">Table 9</xref> present the assessment for industries with high and low knowledge intensity, respectively, with the most comprehensive specification. In Model 1, <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> exhibits a significant and positive impact in industries with high knowledge intensity (two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.003). In contrast, <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> does not exhibit a significant effect in industries with low knowledge intensity (two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.847). Moreover, in knowledge-intensive industries, we find a significant but negative effect of the total knowledge intensity across locations of a target, suggesting that acquirers avoid targets with high total geographic knowledge intensity. <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> is not statistically significant in the sub-sample of industries with low knowledge intensity. These effects are consistent with our arguments about the importance of knowledge intensity in specific locations versus the entire target geographic footprint in knowledge-intensive settings.</p>

<p>The high correlation of some independent variables deserves attention. For instance, <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> is highly correlated with <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.76), and <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> is highly correlated with <italic>Total population<sub>il</sub></italic> (<italic>r</italic> = 0.7). Estimated coefficients can be sensitive to changes in collinear variables included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012466649">Kennedy, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we verify the stability of the results by estimating multiple model specifications where we sequentially drop collinear variables.</p>
<p>Following this logic, we first exclude market access variables as measured by population, those with null impact (two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.687 and 0.545), to focus on the behaviour of the knowledge intensity variables. The strong positive effect of <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> in industries with high knowledge intensity is robust to this exclusion. Its <italic>p</italic>-value is 0.001 in Model 3 (high knowledge intensity) and 0.841 in Model 4 (low knowledge intensity), respectively. The impact of a potential target’s location with the highest knowledge intensity on the likelihood of being selected is therefore distinct to that of its market size configuration as measured by aggregate and maximum populations.</p>
<p>The high correlation between <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> and <italic>Maximum patents inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> also demands that we assess whether the collinearity of these variables is driving the results we present. That is, we wish to assess whether the significance of <italic>Maximum patents inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> is caused by the inclusion of the highly collinear <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic>. Models 5 and 6 include <italic>Max patent inventors</italic><sub>il</sub> and exclude <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic>. The effect of <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> is stable in both splits, showing a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.026 in knowledge-intensive industries while 0.808 in other industries. Finally, Models 7 and 8 explore whether <italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> has an impact on target selection when excluding <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub>.</italic> With this last specification, we verify the lack of impact of the aggregate knowledge intensity of potential targets’ locations when the most knowledge-intensive location is absent. <italic>Total patent inventor<sub>il</sub></italic> remains statistically insignificant in both splits (<italic>p</italic>-values equal to 0.848 and 0.602 in Models 7 and 8, respectively). Overall, the support for Hypothesis 1, which predicts the valuation of the ‘part’ with the highest knowledge intensity, is strong and consistent across all specifications.</p>
<p>We examine additional specifications to assess the robustness of support for Hypothesis 1 to a slight change in variable definitions. The results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1476127012466649">Table 9</xref> use knowledge intensity measures (<italic>Total patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> and <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic>) by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1476127012466649">10</xref></sup> We also estimated models using knowledge intensity variables based on MSAs or larger geographic units defined as consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSA). The impact of <italic>Max patent inventors<sub>il</sub></italic> loses significance, suggesting that acquirers value knowledge intensity in single locations only when it is available in high proximity. This notion is consistent with the empirical evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012466649">Jaffe et al. (1993)</xref>, which shows that knowledge spillovers are more significant at the metropolitan area level than at the state level.</p>
<p>We now turn to test of Hypothesis 2, which predicts that acquirers will value geographic overlap in knowledge-intensive industries. We also find robust support for our second hypothesis. The effect of geographic overlap (<italic>Common metro areas<sub>ijl</sub></italic>) is positive and significant in all specifications of knowledge-intensive industries (two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.017, 0.015, 0.085 and 0.062 in Models 1, 3, 5 and 7, respectively). Conversely, its impact in acquisitions in industries with low knowledge intensity is lacking. None of these coefficients test different from zero (two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-values of 0.766, 0.682, 0.795 and 0.69 in parallel specifications). Unlike the focal variable for Hypothesis 1, our measure of overlap does not show high correlations with other independent variables; therefore, we do not address the stability of this result in additional specifications.</p>
<p>As with Hypothesis 1, we examine the sensitivity of results supporting Hypothesis 2 to a slight change in the geographic units of analysis behind the measurement of overlap, using MSAs and CMSAs instead of MSAs and PMSAs. The results are robust to this definitional change. Combined with the robustness test for Hypothesis 1, our results suggest that acquirers seek closer geographic proximity to more easily access inter-firm than intra-firm knowledge sources.</p>
<p>Turning to the control variables, only one set of variables is consistently significant across specifications – the industry agglomeration measures. For acquisitions in knowledge-intensive industries, acquirers positively value <italic>Total establishments<sub>ikl</sub></italic> and negatively value <italic>Max establishments<sub>ikl</sub></italic>. This suggests the preference for multi-location targets that benefit from aggregate agglomeration across all their locations, and aversion towards targets offering agglomeration benefits in only one location beyond those stemming from knowledge spillovers.</p>

<title>Additional analyses</title>
<p>First, we estimate additional models where we expanded the choice sets to include single-location potential targets. Simply adding all single-location firms within the relevant industries would add 3220 firms to the data set or, on average, 41 potential targets to each choice set. We found it difficult to justify adding all such firms to the choice sets. Rather, we decided to add the subset of these firms that were acquired over the sampled time period. We did so because that signified that these firms were of a sufficient quality to attract interest of acquiring firms and were potentially willing to be sold, which might not be the case for many small single-location firms. This resulted in 43 single-location acquisitions. Because many acquisitions in our data set come from the same industry, including these 43 acquired companies increased the original choice sets across all acquisition by 70 potential targets, or about one potential target per original choice set. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1476127012466649">Table 10</xref> shows the results for model specifications similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1476127012466649">Table 9</xref> that use this expanded choice set. Support for both hypotheses is robust to this change in choice set specification.</p>

<p>Second, the single-location acquisitions that we added to the choice set in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1476127012466649">Table 10</xref> allow us to assess if local knowledge intensity and overlap affect target choice of single-location acquisitions in the industries that we study. To perform this analysis, we first identified whether these acquisitions were in high- or low-knowledge-intensity industries (28 and 15, respectively). Then, we constructed choice sets where the choices were all other single-location firms in these industries. This resulted in choice sets ranging from 25 to 182 targets within high-knowledge-intensive industries and from 9 to 373 targets within low-knowledge-intensive industries. We estimated conditional logit specifications similar to those in the first four columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1476127012466649">Table 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1476127012466649">Table 11</xref> presents the results. As expected, in knowledge-intensive industries, firms are more likely to acquire target firms in locations with greater knowledge intensity and in locations that overlap with the acquiring firm’s operations. This is exhibited by the positive and significant coefficient estimates of <italic>Patent inventors<sub>i</sub></italic> and <italic>Common metro areas<sub>ij</sub></italic> in Models 1 and 3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1476127012466649">11</xref></sup> In industries with low knowledge intensity, <italic>Common metro areas<sub>ij</sub></italic> is not significant in both specifications. The coefficient estimate of <italic>Patent inventors<sub>i</sub></italic> is negative in both specifications. It is marginally significant in Model 2, but non-significant in Model 4 and in specifications that we do not report; therefore, we do not find evidence of a consistently significant affect. In combination, these analyses confirm that the geographic attributes that we hypothesize and demonstrate affect multi-location target choice are the same attributes that affect single-location target choice. As a result, these analyses provide further evidence of the importance in considering the geographic attributes of individual locations within multi-location targets.</p>

<p>Third, we assessed the support for Hypothesis 2 to an alternative explanation based on acquirers seeking market power. The results show that the geographic overlap of potential targets increases the likelihood of selection in knowledge-intensive industries. The arguments leading to this prediction are based on the need for geographic proximity to transfer knowledge among operations. However, the need for proximity could be caused by acquirers pursuing horizontal acquisitions. That is, acquirers could be purchasing competitors in overlapping locations attempting to increase market power in them. To rule out this possibility, we verify that the group of acquisitions in industries with high knowledge intensity does not contain a higher proportion of horizontal acquisitions relative to the group of acquisitions in industries with low knowledge intensity. Classifying horizontal acquisitions as those in which the acquirer and target main 3-digit SIC code match, we observe that in knowledge-intensive industries only 4 out of 33 acquisitions are horizontal, while in non-knowledge-intensive industries 11 out of 46 are horizontal. We conduct a test of proportions with these data. The null hypothesis is that the proportion of horizontal acquisitions in knowledge-intensive industries is lower than the proportion of horizontal acquisitions in non-knowledge-intensive industries. The alternative hypothesis is that the former proportion is higher than the latter. We fail to reject the null hypothesis (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.906). Therefore, the alternative explanation of horizontal relatedness between targets and acquirers driving the need for geographically overlapping targets in knowledge-intensive settings is not supported.</p>
<p>Fourth, we conduct additional tests to explore whether the (a) location with the maximum knowledge intensity valued by acquirers tends to be that of the target’s headquarters and (b) overlapping locations valued by acquirers tend to be those including the location with the highest knowledge intensity. We undertake these analyses because we were concerned that knowledge-intensive regions might disproportionately represent headquarters regions, and our first hypothesis focuses on the draw towards knowledge-intensive regions in general. Likewise, our second hypothesis focuses on the benefits of overlap in general, not just the benefit of overlap in knowledge-intensive regions.</p>

<p>Fifth, another potential concern is that geographic clustering of firms within knowledge-intensive industries could drive the findings. If all potential targets are geographically concentrated, acquirers would inevitably select those in knowledge-intensive locations. Similarly, if firms are geographically concentrated within knowledge-intensive industries, acquirers and potential targets would tend to geographically overlap. We believe this concern does not drive the results for the following reasons. The way in which we construct the choice set for each acquisition controls for target industry characteristics. Moreover, the conditional logit estimator assesses variation within each choice set. If all choices were geographically concentrated, then the coefficient would not test different from zero. In other words, there appears to be sufficient geographic variation within knowledge-intensive industries to generate the results we present – as we saw in the descriptive statistics. In addition, we directly control agglomeration with our control variables.</p>
<p>Sixth, we test whether observations in our data suffer from lack of independence. This could be caused by acquirers having multiple acquisitions in the sample. There are only six acquisitions by acquirers appearing more than once in the sample. We excluded these acquisitions from specifications presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1476127012466649">Table 9</xref> obtaining robust results.</p>
<p>Finally, although our notion of overlap offers a refined way to capture the role of distance in target selection accounting for geographically complex firms, we estimated additional models including the traditional measure of dyadic distance between firms’ headquarters (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012466649">Chakrabarti and Mitchell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012466649">Green, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012466649">Ragozzino and Reuer, 2011</xref>). Such a measure of geographic distance shows no impact in target selection in any of the splits (e.g. <italic>p</italic>-values equal to 0.877 and 0.713 when added to the full specifications shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1476127012466649">Table 9</xref>). Overall, these additional analyses lend support to the results we previously presented and lend additional support that the arguments underlying our hypotheses drive the empirical findings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1476127012466649">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although existing research finds that geographic location impacts acquisition target selection, theory development and empirical analyses have not adequately incorporated the fact that many firms operate in more than one location. Acknowledging this reality allows us to reach more informed conclusions about the role of geography in acquisitions and the mechanisms that drive them.</p>
<p>We find that attributes of specific locations or ‘parts’ of a potential multi-location target firm affects acquirers’ target choice. In particular, we find that in knowledge-intensive industries, targets with (a) greater knowledge intensity in single locations and (b) greater geographic overlap with acquirers offer inter-firm and intra-firm knowledge transfer benefits for acquirers. We do not find these effects in industries with low knowledge intensity.</p>
<p>Within the strategy field, this work provides additional evidence of the role that location plays in the market for firms. It highlights the importance of geographic attributes of firms as resources that can be valued in acquisitions, acknowledging firms’ often complex geographic configurations. It identifies conditions under which specific locations of multi-location firms are more valuable for acquirers, explaining activity in the market for corporate control in knowledge-intensive settings.</p>
<p>The evidence of the valuation of geographic attributes of targets’ parts enhances our understanding of the use of acquisitions by firms pursuing resource reconfiguration. The examination of the reconfiguration process is necessary for a better understanding of firm evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012466649">Karim and Mitchell, 2000</xref>). Our findings suggest that firms use acquisitions to reconfigure their geographic resources over time, purchasing multi-locations firms in knowledge-intensive industries to tap into location-specific technological resources of some of their operations. In addition, as acquirers seek reconfiguration, the ability to transfer knowledge to the targets’ overlapping operations or from them influences target selection.</p>
<p>Our results also provide additional evidence of the market for firms being an important mechanism to transfer individual resources across firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012466649">Capron et al., 1998</xref>). Localized knowledge spillovers are difficult resources to disentangle from the larger firms that provide them, thus making acquisition of entire firms a means to access them. With respect to managerial practice, this means that firms often value and seek such geographic resources via the market for corporate control in knowledge-intensive settings.</p>
<p>Overall, this work responds to the call for more research at the intersection of geography and strategy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476127012466649">Sorenson and Baum, 2003</xref>). Our theoretical development and findings imply the need to incorporate a more nuanced geographic conceptualization of firms in future research. This richer view of firms has several important implications. First, when multi-location firms are part of the examined settings, future research should recognize and deal with a more fine-grained geographic treatment of firms. Moreover, our results suggest that simply aggregating their location attributes appears not to be an appropriate way to approach this in some settings. Second, our work should provide initial guidance on salient geographic traits of multi-location firms that future research may need to consider. Although we examine important features of geographically complex firms in a specific setting, assessing additional facets of firm geographic heterogeneity in the market for corporate control in different settings seems warranted.</p>
<p>Finally, in light of our findings of the important role that specific locations have on the choice of multi-location acquisition targets, additional future contributions may come from examining the conditions driving the choice between single-location and multi-location targets. For instance, having demonstrated the importance of location characteristics for parts of multi-location targets, it begs the question of when a firm would prefer to acquire a multi-location target present in a given location versus a single-location target in it.</p>

<title>Appendix 1</title>
<p>US metropolitan areas are large densely populated areas where central and adjacent counties have a high degree of economic and social integration. ‘Metropolitan Area’ is an umbrella term for three specific definitions of urban areas: MSAs, PMSAs and CMSAs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.census.gov/geo/www/GARM/Ch13GARM.pdf">http://www.census.gov/geo/www/GARM/Ch13GARM.pdf</ext-link>). Below we provide the definitional logic for these different units. Additional details on classification criteria are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/mastand.html">http://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/mastand.html</ext-link></p>
<sec id="section12-1476127012466649">
<title>Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs)</title>
<p>According to the revised 1990s standards, an MSA consists of one or more counties (or county equivalents) that contain a city of 50,000 or more inhabitants; or a Census Bureau–defined urbanized area of at least 50,000 population, provided that the component county or counties of the metropolitan statistical area have a total population of at least 100,000. Counties containing the principal concentration of population are components of the MSA. Additional counties qualify to be included by meeting a specified level of commuting to the counties containing the population concentration and by meeting other requirements of metropolitan character, such as a specified minimum population density or percentage of the population that is urban. MSAs in New England are defined in terms of cities and towns, following rules concerning commuting and population density. The Columbus MSA in Ohio, for instance, comprises six counties: Delaware, Fairfield, Franklin, Licking, Madison and Pickaway. In the year 2003, part of our sample period, this MSA had a population of 1,596,255 according to US census data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1476127012466649">
<title>Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs)</title>
<p>PMSAs are adjacent metropolitan areas part of larger CMSAs. They consist of a large urbanized county or a cluster of counties (or county equivalents) that demonstrate strong internal economic and social links in addition to ties with the larger area. A CMSA is an area that meets the requirements to qualify as an MSA, has a population of at least 1 million, and its component parts are recognized as PMSAs. For instance, the ‘Chicago–Gary–Kenosha’ CMSA is formed by four PMSAs totalling 13 counties in three states: Chicago, in Illinois; Gary, in Indiana; Kankakee, in Illinois and Kenosha, in Wisconsin. Its population in 2003 was 9,392,014 according to US census data.</p>
<p>We use the 1999 metropolitan area definitions because our sample period required the construction of variables based on geographic characteristics from 2001 and 2002. Their detailed definitions are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/lists/historical/99mfips.txt">http://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/lists/historical/99mfips.txt</ext-link></p>

To capture the local geographic space where knowledge spillovers are more likely to occur we rely on MSAs and PMSAs because we consider the CMSAs to be geographically too large for this purpose. We first calculate number of granted patents’ inventors by MSA or PMSA. We then bridge potential targets’ zip codes to counties, and counties to these metropolitan areas.

<p>Sum of population (millions) of all MSAs or CMSAs where a potential target is located. When an operation is located in an MSA that is part of a larger CMSA, our measure uses the population of the entire CMSA. We prefer this aggregation because it reflects the metropolitan market that a facility would service in industries with localized outputs. To calculate this variable, we first calculate population by metropolitan area aggregating county population data from the US Census Bureau County Annual Population Estimates. We then map potential targets’ zip codes to counties, and counties to metropolitan areas. Finally, we sum across the different metropolitan areas in which a potential target operates.</p>

<p>Sum of industrial market (billions) in potential targets’ MSAs or CMSAs by industries that buy from the potential target’s industry. It is based on an estimated industry-to-industry-direct-requirement matrix (IIDR) transformed to account for regional demand. The IIDR matrix provides a breakdown of an industry’s output (rows) by the industries that consume it (columns) (dollars consumed of output <italic>i</italic> to produce a dollar of output <italic>j</italic>). We construct it using the 2002 detailed input–output (I-O) tables after redefinitions provided by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. We use the 2002 benchmark tables, available every five years, because they have more detailed information than annual tables. Using the nomenclature of I-O tables, the IIDR matrix is calculated as where <italic>V</italic> refers to the ‘Make’ matrix (industry by commodity), <italic>Q</italic> refers to the total output by commodity vector, <italic>U</italic> refers to the ‘Use’ matrix (commodity by industry) and <italic>X</italic> refers to the total output by industry vector (see chapter 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476127012466649">Miller and Blair, 1985</xref>). We multiply the IIDR by the total production in dollars of the buying industries (<italic>X</italic>) to obtain the total demand of industry <italic>i</italic> output by each industry <italic>j</italic>. This total demand by each industry <italic>j</italic> is in turn multiplied by the proportion of establishments in such industries located in all MSAs and CMSAs where a potential target is located. This transformation of the IIDR provides a measure of the size of the local demand for potential targets’ industry outputs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1476127012466649">13</xref></sup> County level establishment data are available from US Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns. We bridge industry I-O codes to 1997 NAICS codes used in County Business Patterns using the concordance between I-O and 2002 NAICS codes available at Appendix A of 2002 I-O tables and the U.S. Census Bureau NAICS 1997-2002 concordance.</p>

<p>The article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012466649">Baum et al. (2000)</xref> is an exception, examining acquisitions of units of nursing home chains.</p>

<p>Localized knowledge spillovers are part of a broader set of production externalities derived from industry agglomeration as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012466649">Marshall (1920)</xref>. They also include local pools of labour with industry-specific knowledge and local pools of specialized input providers.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1476127012466649">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Indeed, the empirical evidence supporting these mechanisms is based on a wide array of industries. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476127012466649">Baum et al. (2000)</xref> have shown that the role of localized search in target selection is based on nursing some chains. Similarly, evidence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012466649">Ragozzino and Reuer (2011)</xref> on the role of distance on target selection is broadly based on acquisitions of US public firms.</p>

<p>We exclude SIC 3999 from the sample (‘Manufacturing Industries, Not Elsewhere Classified’) because of the importance of industry factors in our hypotheses.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1476127012466649">
<label>5.</label>
<p>We do not assume that acquirers search for target firms that operate in the same industry as the acquirer. We assume that acquirers choose among firms that operate within the industry of the target firm that they ultimately choose.</p>

<p>We bridge R&amp;D intensity by industry at the three-digit level under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) listed in this report to the four-digit SIC codes of the targets’ industries. The median value of this measure is not available across all manufacturing industries. We did additional analyses using our sample median with consistent results with those presented.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1476127012466649">
<label>7.</label>
<p>Eight acquirers have no presence in US metro areas, two for the set of industries with high knowledge intensity and six for the set of industries in low knowledge intensity. Our results are materially unchanged if we remove these acquisitions from the sample.</p>

<p>We rely on inventors’ location because the location of a patent assignee (company) can differ from the location of the patent inventor(s).</p>

<p>The aforementioned related approaches to defining choice sets that do not work well in our setting result in constant choice sets. It is for this reason that we cannot assess marginal effects whereas articles in these other settings can.</p>
