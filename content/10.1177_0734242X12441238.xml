<abstract>
<p>The estimate of future obsolete streams is one of the crucial issues for the establishment of an efficient waste collection and recycling system in China. Due to low availability of reliable data, information on discarded household appliances (HAs) is deficient in China. This study adopts a stocks-based prediction model based on material flow analysis. The model firstly models the lifetime distribution of HAs, and then the future stocks of HAs are extrapolated. By determining the initial year of calculation, the model makes a prediction of future obsolete HAs in China in the time period from 2010–2030. The results show that the discarded amount of the five major kinds of HAs will increase from 130 million units in 2010 to 216 to 221 million units by 2020, and 259 to 282 million units by 2030. A total of 4370 to 4528 million units (149 to 155 million tonnes) of obsolete HAs will be generated in China over the next 20 years. Urban households will generate significantly more obsolete HAs (about 2619 to 2723 million units) than rural households, mainly due to the difference in their HAs possession levels. Thus recycling capacity must increase if the rising quantity of domestic obsolete HAs is to be handled properly. The results of this study can help to develop the collection and recycling systems and facilities needed for the obsolete HAs generated in the future. From a methodological perspective, the stock-based model provides a suitable tool to predict the generation of discarded HAs in the future</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The estimate of future obsolete streams is one of the crucial issues for the establishment of an efficient waste collection and recycling system in China. Public data show that annual generated obsolete household appliances (HAs) amounts to 50 million units, with an annual growth rate amounting to 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734242X12441238">Zhu, 2010</xref>). However, large amounts of the obsolete HAs flow into informal recycling channels, such as secondhand markets and manual recycling workshops; a formal governance system and an official statistics collection system do not yet exist. For the Chinese government, a formal and effective handling of waste HAs is becoming an emerging issue. Its significance is driven by the rapidly increasing quantities, the hazards involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12441238">Leung et al., 2006</xref>) and the valuable materials in it. In response to this growing concern, the Chinese government is continuously strengthening the legislative framework for waste HAs recycling and disposal; regulations issued include Administrative Measures on Pollution Control of Electronic Information Products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12441238">MIIT, 2009</xref>), Administrative Regulations on the Recycling and treatment of Waste and Used household Electronic Products and Electronic Products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12441238">The State Council of PRC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A crucial issue for efficient recycling is the estimate of future obsolete streams. Quite a few studies have aimed at quantifying future generation of obsolete HAs. At the global level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12441238">Mueller et al. (2009)</xref> quantified waste personal computers for 2005 based on world information and communications technology (ICT) and development indicators; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734242X12441238">Yu et al. (2010)</xref> forecasted global generation of obsolete personal computers from 1995 to 2030. At a country level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12441238">Dwivedy and Mittal (2010)</xref> have estimated future outflows of e-waste in India during 2007–2011 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12441238">Steubing et al. (2010)</xref> assessed computer waste generation in Chile up to 2020. Below the country level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12441238">Kang and Schoenung (2006)</xref> have estimated future outflows of personal computers in California from 2002–2013 and discussed the corresponding infrastructure needed to recycle this waste. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12441238">Walk (2009)</xref> forecasted future quantities of disused household CRT appliances in Baden-Wurttemberg from 2000 to 2015. On the whole, these studies generally estimate the obsolete amount based on past domestic sales data combined with the assumed average life of electronic appliances, or, they established prediction models based on material flow analysis (MFA) and assessed obsolete HAs flows in future using a probabilistic approach. In China, many of the contributions to waste HAs research in China focus on the basic structure and state of the art of the current e-waste (e-waste here has the same meaning as obsolete HAs in the present study) recycling system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12441238">He et al., 2006</xref>), and conclusions are based on limited observations. Several studies have discussed the generation of discarded HAs at the country level in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12441238">Liu et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12441238">Yang et al., 2008</xref>), and at city level in Beijing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12441238">Liu et al., 2006b</xref>). However, there are several issues indicating that further work is needed to provide a more reliable assessment of obsolete HAs in China: (1) these estimates are based on information before and around 2000, whereas the situation has changed rapidly in the last few years, such as household’s consumption patterns on HAs; (2) all of these studies perform forecasting analyses before 2015, while the longer trend cannot be determined; and (3) these estimations are relatively crude, for example, urban households (UHs) and rural households (RHs) are treated as a whole and not distinguished in the forecasts.</p>
<p>The principal difficulty of quantifying obsolete flows of HAs is a lack of relevant data and information for prediction; namely the lifetime distribution of HAs, and regional sale data of HAs. In Chinese statistical systems, most available information is annual in-use stocks of HAs in households. Therefore, this study aimed to adopt an in-use stocks-based prediction model (which is referred to herein as a stocks-based model), and then use the model to analyse future quantities of obsolete HAs in UHs and RHs in China for the period 2010–2030. Currently, the obsolete HAs covered by related regulations in China include five categories: air conditioners, computers, refrigerators, televisions and washing machines and so these five categories were chosen in the study to illustrate generation of obsolete HAs. In the following sections, first the stocks-based prediction method is described and then pictures of possible generation of future HAs in China for the period 2010–2030 are presented. A discussion focuses on the results of the model, and finally, conclusions concerning the results of the case study, as well as the methodology itself, are presented.</p>

<title>Development of stocks-based model</title>
<p>Material flow analysis (MFA) is used in this study to develop a prediction model. MFA is a method used to describe, investigate and evaluate the metabolism of anthropogenic systems. It is based on the principle of mass conservation and can be used to quantify the flow of materials in a system defined by spatial and temporal boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12441238">Baccini and Bader, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In MFA models, flows and stocks interact with each other; stocks grow when the inflows exceed the outflows of a system, whereas stocks decrease if the outflows exceed the inflows. Therefore, the in-use stock change at a given time <italic>t</italic> is the difference in value between product inflow and obsolete outflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12441238">Figure 1</xref>). On the other hand, the obsolete outflow at time <italic>t</italic> can be expressed as a function of product inflows before time <italic>t</italic> and a characteristic obsolescence behaviour of the product.</p>

<p>From the above <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X12441238">Equation (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X12441238">(2)</xref>, the prediction of future discarded HAs depends on the lifetime distribution modelling of HAs and the extrapolation of future stocks of HAs. To make the model calculable, a series of product inflow data or at least data of one year is needed. Time series for input and output flows can be iterated by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X12441238">Equation (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0734242X12441238">(2)</xref>. Thus, forecasting can be done based on stock information by: (1) modelling the product lifetime distribution; (2) extrapolating the stocks based on past information; and (3) determining the initial year.</p>

<title>Lifetime modelling of HAs</title>
<p>It is important to firstly define lifetimes of HAs before modelling them. In this research lifetime is chosen as the interval from the time of purchasing the HA until it leaves the active HA stock, meaning it has been disposed of or is in storage until final disposal.</p>
<p>Based on previous study, the lifetime of a product can be assumed as a constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12441238">Liu et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734242X12441238">Yang et al., 2008</xref>) or it can be expressed with the aid of a cumulative distribution function (CDF). In the latter case, the obsolescence behaviour of the product is correspondingly represented as a probability density function (p.d.f.). The Weibull distribution, which has been applied to many studies for obsolete calculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12441238">Elshkaki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12441238">Melo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12441238">Spatari et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12441238">Walk, 2009</xref>), is the statistical distribution used in this study.</p>

<p>where the mode (<italic>m</italic>) corresponds to the maximum value of the p.d.f. and can be interpreted as the value that is most likely to be observed. Given estimations of <italic>a, b</italic> and <italic>m</italic>, the parameters <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> can be calculated by solving <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0734242X12441238">Equation (4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0734242X12441238">(5)</xref>.</p>
<p>In most cases, <italic>a, b</italic> and <italic>m</italic>, can be determined by using the maximum-likelihood method, provided a data sample set of lifetime is available. In this case, the major data source for modelling the lifetime distribution of HAs is an estimation from industrial experts on management and recycling of waste HAs (personal communication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734242X12441238">Zhang XZ, Beijing Zhongse Recycling Metal Research Institute, Beijing, China, October 2009</xref>), crosschecked from a related standard, <italic>Rules for Safe Service Life of Household Electrical Appliance in China</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12441238">SAC, 2009</xref>), as well as a survey report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X12441238">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>). Considering that Chinese UHs and RHs have significant differences on HAs possession, usage, and discard, future generation of obsolete HAs in UHs and RHs are predicted separately in this study. It must be explained that when UHs and RHs are treated separately, HAs flows between UHs and RHs should be taken into consideration in the form of reselling of second-hand HAs from UHs to RHs. However, up to the present time in China, this resale flow mainly happens between different stratums of urban households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734242X12441238">Yuan et al., 2010</xref>) and transfer of second-hand HAs from UHs to RHs is less frequent; thus, such transfers are omitted in this study. For the purpose of this study, UHs are considered as a whole and resale flows within UHs have not been stressed. However, this kind of flow can be embodied in the model to some extent, by means of describing lifetime distributions of HAs in UHs.</p>
<p>Rapid and sustained technological development in the industry, as well as change of consumption patterns, has led to rapid obsolescence and decreasing lifetimes of HAs. It is thus assumed that during the period 2021–2030, the <italic>m</italic> of lifetime will be shortened by 1 year compared to the period 2010–2020. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12441238">Table 1</xref> shows the estimated values of <italic>a, b</italic> and <italic>m</italic> in UHs and RHs during the period 2010–2030 in China.</p>

<title>Extrapolation of in-use stocks of HAs</title>
<p>The phrase ‘in-use stocks’ in this study denotes the number of HAs which the households possessed. In-use stocks of HAs can be expressed further by multiplying the HA per household (HAPH) by the number of households. Therefore, to estimate future stocks of HAs, the HAPH and the number of households will be extrapolated.</p>

<p>where <italic>t</italic> is the time in calendar years, <italic>A</italic> is the saturation value of that kind of HA per household, <italic>k</italic> is a parameter that indicates the growing speed of the HA possession, and <italic>B</italic> is determined by the saturation value <italic>A</italic> and initial value <italic>HAPH</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p>The historical possession of HAs in UHs and RHs of China can be obtained from the Chinese Statistical System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12441238">NBSC, 1981–2010</xref>). Several kinds of HAs have been reported beginning in the 1980s, including refrigerators in UHs and RHs, washing machines in UHs and RHs, and colour televisions in UHs and RHs. Personal computers and air conditioners in UHs have been reported since the 1990s, whereas these two kinds of HAs have not been reported in RHs until 2000. On the whole, all five kinds of HAs have experienced rapid growth in the past several decades.</p>
<p>Utilizing these data, the values of the constants <italic>A, k</italic> and <italic>B</italic> for the logistic equation could be empirically determined (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12441238">Table 2</xref>). Several exceptions are noted here. Based on historical data, HAPH of washing machines, refrigerators and TV sets in UHs have remained stable in recent years, indicating they have possibly achieved a saturation point by 2009. However, fitted values of <italic>A</italic> are found to be a little lower than the actual values of for 2009 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12441238">Table 2</xref>. Utilizing these data, the values of the constants A, k and B for the logistic equation could be empirically determined. Therefore, the HAPHs of washing machines, refrigerators and TV sets in UHs for the period 2010–2030 are estimated to be equivalent to the values for 2009. On the other hand, the penetration of personal computers and air conditioners in RHs continues to increase and has not yet passed through an inflection point. This indicates that diffusion is still in an early stage and statistical fits may not give reasonably accurate results. To address this problem, the parameters <italic>A</italic> and <italic>k</italic> for RHs are set according to their values in UHs. Parameter <italic>A</italic> for personal computers and air conditioners in RHs is assumed to be 85 and 70% of that for UHs, respectively.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12441238">Figure 2</xref> shows the units of major HAs per 100 UHs/RHs from 2000 to 2030, in which data for the time span 2000–2009 is historical data from statistics, whereas data for the period 2010–2030 is predicted. The predicted results indicate that UHs and RHs show different possession patterns for different categories of HAs. Specifically, HAs such as refrigerators, televisions and washing machines have saturated in UHs; whereas, relatively new kinds of HAs, such as air conditioners and personal computers are still increasing gradually. By contrast, all of these categories of HAs in RHs will not reach saturation during the period 2010–2030, except for personal computers. Extrapolation of personal computers in UHs and RHs may possibly be underestimated. A possible reason is that what is considered a ‘computer’ has increasingly become smaller and more versatile; thus, such low ownership seems conservative. However, as it is now hard to extrapolate future consumption of newly emerging computers (such as tablet computers) in China, extrapolation of personal computers (here mainly referring to traditional personal computers) is still adopted in this study.</p>

<title>Extrapolation of households</title>
<p>Changes in the number of households can be affected by many factors, such as population growth, average household size, and urbanization ratio. For population growth, several scenarios from the United Nations Population Statistics Division are employed to project the population from 2010 to 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12441238">United Nations Population Division, 2010</xref>), i.e. Low variant, Medium variant, and High variant scenarios. For average household size of UHs and RHs, future estimations are made based on observed historical trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12441238">NBSC, 1981–2010</xref>), by assuming average decreasing rates for the periods 2010–2020 and 2010–2030, respectively. For the urbanization ratio, the increasing rate is assumed as 1% annually, a figure which is also deduced from historical trends and related research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12441238">Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 2010</xref>). Prediction results of households from 2010–2030 are thus shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12441238">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12441238">4</xref>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, if statistical data on the sale amounts of HAs in a region is available, then it can be used for the calculation of annual obsolete outflows. Nevertheless, the historical data on the sale of HAs is deficient in China. In this case, the initial year is determined according to the logistic curves of HAPH obtained in the section ‘Extrapolation of in-use stocks of HAs’. Annual data of HAPH for the five kinds of HAs before 1980 was calculated and when the value of HAPH in certain year <italic>T</italic> was smaller than 2, the year <italic>T</italic> - 1 was set as the initial year.</p>

<p>The potential discarded HA flows during the period 2010–2030, calculated according to the procedures described above, are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12441238">Figures 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12441238">7</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12441238">Figure 4</xref> shows that the number of discarded HAs will continue to increase in the 20 years following 2010. The total discarded amounts of the five kinds of HAs in 2010 were 130 million units. It is estimated that this number will be somewhere in the range of 216 to 221 million units by 2020, and approximately 259 to 282 million units by 2030. The cumulative generation of obsolete HAs will range from 4370 to 4528 million units over the next 20 years, depending on different scenarios for population growth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12441238">Figure 5</xref> indicates that discarded air conditioners, colour TV sets, and personal computers will be the major contributors, while washing machines and refrigerators constitute a relatively smaller share. On the whole, discarded HAs include 925 to 963 million units of air conditioners, 706 to 731 million units of refrigerators, 687 to 708 million units of washing machines, 1064 to 1095 million units of colour TV sets, and 986 to 1029 million units of personal computers. Among the five categories, the number of scrapped units of personal computers increased by 153 to 177%, the largest of all the HAs.

The gap of discarded HAs between UHs and RHs will be widening with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X12441238">Figure 8</xref>).

<p>From a recycler’s perspective, mass flows are more relevant than the number of HA units. The estimated units were converted to weight (tonnes) by using average weights for the HAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12441238">Liu et al., 2006b</xref>). The result shows that in 2010, China generated 4.5 million tonnes of obsolete HAs. This number will increase to a total of 7.4 to 7.5 million tonnes by 2020, and 8.9 to 9.7 million tonnes by 2030. The cumulative weight of obsolete HAs will be in the range of 149 to 155 million tonnes over the next 40 years, among which 85% is from UHs. However, considering that future technological improvements will likely result in lighter HAs, the mass flows of obsolete HAs during the period 2010–2030 will probably be lower than these estimates.</p>
<p>Sensitivity analysis is an important topic for research projects of this kind. The sensitivity of the model’s results depends on changed conditions and assumptions that can be analysed by varying the parameters. From the principle of the model, the predicted results of future discarded HAs depend on the lifetime distribution modelling of HAs and the extrapolation of the future number of households (modelling of the HAPH is relatively fixed in the model). The following issues were investigated:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12441238" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>As noted earlier, the parameter <italic>m</italic> is important for modelling of the lifetime of HAs.

<p>As there have been several studies predicting the future generation of obsolete HAs in China, comparisons can be made to show the confidence intervals. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12441238">Table 3</xref> shows that as a result of different prediction methods, different data sources, and different assumptions, the predicted results vary a great deal.

<p>According to the results of the present study, a total of 130 million units of obsolete HAs were generated in 2010. However, although there is no available data on the amounts of waste HAs collected in that year, evidence indicates that it is much less than the generated quantity. In 2009 three ministries released documents to regulate trade-in of household appliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12441238">Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PRC, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12441238">The Central People’s Government of the PRC, 2009</xref>). Trade-in policies help to build collection systems which are much needed in China. It has been reported that in this year, 30 million units of waste HAs were collected and traded in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12441238">Cui, 2010</xref>). Although it is deemed as a major progress, these data also mean that among 130 million units of expected obsolete HAs, less than one-fourth were effectively collected. Besides, official data show that a large part of trade-in waste cannot be effectively dismounted because of a limited processing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12441238">China Environment News, 2010</xref>). Several large enterprises, such as TCL Aobo Corporation Group and Qingdao New World Venous Industry Park can now treat several million units of obsolete HAs annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12441238">Cheaa.com, 2011</xref>). However, formal enterprises of such large-scale are rare in China. Most of the other generated amounts have gone into informal channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12441238">Chi et al., 2011</xref>). Most of the recycling sectors were small firms operating outside government regulations, located mainly in Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei Provinces and Beijing City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12441238">BCRC, 2005</xref>). One of the largest recycling centres for waste HAs in China, Guiyu now treats 1.55 million tonnes of waste HAs annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12441238">Chai and Peng, 2011</xref>). Extensive manual dismantling and crude recycling methods are the usual practice in the informal sector; this differs from the highly automated processes in well-developed formal sectors for recycling.</p>
<p>As the generation of obsolete HAs will increase annually in the following 20 years, existing collection and recycling systems cannot meet the growing need unless greatly improved. It is necessary to undertake strategic planning and construction of the recycling system on the basis of future generation of waste HAs in UHs and RHs. In addition, efficiency of collection and recycling can be enhanced by several possible approaches based on the current state of China. Firstly, formal collection and recycling systems should be further enhanced with an economic incentive to households to use this formal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734242X12441238">Yu et al., 2010</xref>); an example is the issued trade-in policy. Secondly, because the informal collection and recycling system for waste HAs in China has developed spontaneously through market forces, creating a waste HAs channel which mixes informal and formal sectors may make sense; for instance, collection and reuse could be handled informally but equipment could then be passed to the formal sector for proper recycling and final disposal.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the present paper, a stocks-based prediction model aimed at forecasting future obsolete HAs by using data available from the Chinese statistical system has been defined. Then, the model was applied to predict future quantities of the five categories of HAs generated in the period 2010–2030. Several major results have been obtained from the model application.</p>
<p>In the following 20 years, a total of 4370 to 4528 million units of discarded HAs (149 to 155 million tonnes by weight) will be generated in China, which means that the existing collection and recycling systems cannot meet the growing need unless it is greatly improved. Specifically, discarded HAs include 925 to 963 million air conditioner units, 706 to 731 million refrigerator units, 687 to 708 million washing machine units, 1064 to 1095 million colour TV set units, and 986 to 1029 million personal computer units. Among the five categories, the scrapping volume of personal computers increases at the largest rate. It is necessary for the Chinese government to undertake strategic planning and construction of the recycling on the basis of future amount of waste HAs generated.</p>
<p>In addition, UHs and RHs showed distinct features in the generation of obsolete HAs in the near future. For RHs, the peak number of discarded HAs will be reached around the year 2025, while the annual amount of discarded HAs in UHs will increase continuously from 2010 to 2030. The gap in the amount of discarded HAs between UHs and RHs will be widening with time. By and large, 2619 to 2723 million more units of discarded HAs will be generated by UHs than by RHs during this period. For the government, different strategies and schemes for collection/recycling systems should be implemented in urban and rural areas in order to provide adequate solutions for the generation of obsolete HAs.</p>
<p>From a methodological perspective, the stocks-based model provides a suitable tool to predict the generation of discarded HAs. A sensitivity analysis showed that the predicted results of future discarded HAs are affected by lifetime distribution modelling of HAs and the extrapolation of the future number of households. In order to improve prediction accuracy of the model, further effort can focus on providing more specific modelling of key parameters. Furthermore, the present study only emphasizes the theoretical amounts of obsolete HAs to be generated in UHs and RHs. Several aspects including where these obsolete HAs will go after they have been discarded by households, what factors influence the HA possession and discarding patterns have not been considered. Future research incorporating these aspects would be valuable.</p>
