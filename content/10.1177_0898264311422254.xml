<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical activity guidelines for both the general adult population and older people recommend undertaking at least 30 min of moderate-intensity physical activity on most days of the week, with each session lasting a minimum of 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311422254">Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264311422254">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008</xref>). Specifically, this should involve “muscle-strengthening activities” at least two times per week.</p>
<p>Even though it is widely recognized in the literature that exercise participation in both younger and older adults should be encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898264311422254">Chodzko-Zajko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264311422254">Warburton, Nicol, &amp; Bredin, 2006</xref>), a 2004-2005 report indicated that 70% of Australians aged 15 years and above were classified as sedentary or having low exercise levels and this was most common in those aged 75 years and above (83%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311422254">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006</xref>). The consequences of this are significant not only to the individual but also to the community. An inverse relationship between total physical activity and risk of mortality has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264311422254">Lee &amp; Paffenbarger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264311422254">Leitzmann et al., 2007</xref>), and in those 70 years and older, not only continuing but also initiating physical activity is associated with better survival and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264311422254">Stessman, Hammerman-Rozenberg, Cohen, Ein-Mor, &amp; Jacobs, 2009</xref>). Physical inactivity has been estimated to cause up to 2 million deaths per year worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264311422254">WHO, 2003</xref>), while in Australia alone, this results in an annual direct health care cost of around AUD377 million per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264311422254">Stephenson, Bauman, Armstrong, Smith, &amp; Bellow, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The benefits of physical activity are even more important for older people as, for each decade after the age of 50, muscle mass decreases by more than 6% and muscle strength by more than 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264311422254">DiPietro, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264311422254">Lynch et al., 1999</xref>). The maintenance or improvement in physical function through regular physical activity can prolong independent living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898264311422254">DiPietro, 1996</xref>), reduce mobility impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311422254">Fiatarone et al., 1990</xref>), reduce the risk of injury such as falls and fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311422254">Sherrrington et al., 2008</xref>), and improve quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311422254">Bize, Johnson, &amp; Plotnikoff, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the growing evidence supporting the benefits of physical activity throughout life, it is important to understand what factors, including perceived barriers, influence physical activity engagement. Despite the Australian Bureau of Statistics identifying that a high percentage of Australians are sedentary in their 2006 report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311422254">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006</xref>), they did not seek to identify associations between physical activity involvement and individual factors. It has previously been shown that a relationship between sociodemographic status and physical activity participation exists, with a sedentary lifestyle being strongly associated with lower levels of education, high body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264311422254">Anderson, Anderson, &amp; Hurst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264311422254">Varo et al., 2003</xref>), low social class, and poor social network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264311422254">Sundquist, 1995</xref>). It is important to further understand this concept in the context of achieving maximum adherence rates in research trials targeting exercise interventions and for health promotion campaigns in the wider community. The findings of this study may also assist therapists to gain some insight into how to increase adherence to exercise programs. Consequently, the research questions for this study were as follows: in a representative sample of community-dwelling South Australians, what are the self-reported physical activity behaviors and beliefs about exercise and what barriers to physical activity engagement are perceived? Are there associations between behaviors, beliefs, or barriers and sociodemographic factors?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0898264311422254" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The data used in this study were collected through the 2008 South Australian Spring Health Omnibus Survey, a large representative population survey that has occurred in South Australia each year since 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264311422254">Wilson, Wakefield, &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>). Face-to-face interviews were conducted between September and December 2008, using a random stratified sampling technique. From the collectors’ districts used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in the 2006 Census, 413 collectors’ districts were selected with their probability of selection proportional to their size. Within each collectors’ district, a starting point was randomly selected and then 10 dwellings were chosen using a predetermined selection process based on a “skip pattern” of every fourth household. All cities and towns within the state of South Australia with a population of 10,000 or more in the 2006 Census were selected automatically. The country sample was chosen from centers with a population of 1,000 or more in the 2006 Census, with probability proportional to size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264311422254">Wilson et al., 1992</xref>). Age, gender, marital status, education, employment status, area of residence, and country of birth were recorded.</p>
<p>Specific questions relating to exercise and physical activity engagement were developed after a review of the literature, review of questions used in previous surveys, and in consultation with researchers in the field. The terms “exercise” and “physical activity” were both used to gain the most accurate picture of how active the participants were and to encourage them to consider all activity and not just what might be considered more formal exercise. These questions were screened and piloted by Harrison Health Research, the commercial organization who conducts the Health Omnibus surveys. The final questions that were used are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264311422254">Figure 1</xref>. The survey was approved by the South Australian Health Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC).</p>

</fig>
<p>Only one face-to-face interview was conducted per household. When more than one person aged 15 or above resided in the household, the respondent was the person who most recently had his or her birthday. In some cases, up to 6 visits were undertaken to a household to perform an interview with the selected person.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898264311422254">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, exercise barriers were defined as responses obtained from Questions K3 and K7, beliefs by responses from K6, and behaviors by K2, K4, and K5. Descriptive analysis of physical activity behaviors and beliefs about exercise was performed by age group and chi-square analyses used to quantify differences in proportions. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association between barriers, behaviors, and beliefs about exercise, adjusting for potential confounders. Marital status was treated as a three-level categorical variable, according to whether married or de facto; separated, divorced, or widowed; or single. Adjustments were also made for the following dichotomous variables: country of birth (Australia or not), region of residence (metropolitan or not), employment status (work full-time or work part-time/not at all), gender (male or female), education (completed/undertaking tertiary or not), and age (65 years and above or not). Those who refused to answer or did not know were omitted from the analysis. Data were weighted to the nearest available Census data (2006) to provide estimates of the South Australian population. Data were analyzed using SPSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264311422254">SPSS Inc., 2006</xref>) and Intercooled Stata (StataCorp LP) version 11.0. A <italic>p</italic> value less than .05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="section5-0898264311422254">
<title>Response Rate</title>
<p>From the 5,500 households selected, 233 were found to be vacant dwellings. Of the remaining 5,267 dwellings, 2,824 interviews were conducted (53.6% response rate). Nonresponse was due to refusal (<italic>n</italic> = 1,434), contact not being established after six visits (<italic>n</italic> = 650), inability to speak English (<italic>n</italic> = 85), absence for duration of study (<italic>n</italic> = 92), illness/mental incapacity (<italic>n</italic> = 89), lack of access to building (<italic>n</italic> = 84), and ferocious dog (<italic>n</italic> = 9).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898264311422254">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The mean age of participants was 46 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 18.9, range: 15-102), 51% were female, 62.5% were married, and 74.8% were born in Australia. There were 525 (18.6%) participants above 65 years of age and 2,299 (81.4%) participants below 65 years. There was an association between age and self-reported health (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with younger participants (&lt;65 years) more likely to report a good, very good, or excellent state of health when compared with those 65 years and above (81% compared with 71%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264311422254">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Physical Activity Behaviors</title>
<p>Just above a quarter of all participants (753/2,824) reported never undertaking 30 min or more of moderate physical activity per week. When the influence of age on physical activity was examined, group comparison between older and younger participants indicated that those 65 years and older were more likely to report “never” participating in physical activity (234/525) compared with those younger than 65 years (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Only a third of those aged 65 years and older (172/525) reported that they participated in physical activity three or more times per week, compared with half of those less than 65 (1,145/2,299; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264311422254">Table 1</xref>). When a subgroup analysis was run with 10-year age categories, participating in 30 minutes or more of a moderate amount of physical activity in a week steadily declined with advancing age (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). When the influence of health status on self-reported physical activity levels was examined, reporting physical activity greater than three times per week was significantly associated with a self-report of a better state of health (good, very good, or excellent; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Multinomial logistic regression results for preferred exercise environment with exercising at home used as the reference standard are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264311422254">Table 2</xref>. Living in a metropolitan region, aged less than 65, never marrying, and being tertiary educated were all independently associated with a preference for exercising at the gym. Female gender and metropolitan living were independently associated with a preference for exercising at a community health centre, whereas being tertiary educated was independently associated with about a 50% higher odds of participating in physical activity outdoors.</p>

<title>Beliefs About Exercise in Older Age</title>
<p>Multinomial logistic regression results for perceived type of exercise that is important in older age with walking regularly as the reference standard are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0898264311422254">Table 4</xref>. All age groups overwhelmingly agreed that walking regularly was the most important form of exercise for people aged 65 years and older, with 72% and 79% of participants aged less than 65 and older than 65 selecting this response respectively (data not shown). Female gender, tertiary education, and age (younger than 65 years) were all independently associated with a perception that strength training compared with walking regularly is important in older age. Female gender was also independently associated with a perception that hydrotherapy and balance training compared with walking were important in older age.</p>

<p>The majority of all age groups (72%) agreed that it is never too late to improve muscle strength through physical activity, no matter what the age of the individual. However, when a subgroup analyses was run looking at responses by 10-year age categories, an association by age was seen in two older age brackets (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with 15.1% of the 75-to-84-year age bracket and 18.2% of the above-85-year-olds feeling that they fell into the age group where it was too late to improve muscle strength.</p>

<title>Barriers to Exercise Participation</title>
<p>The 753 participants who reported never undertaking 30 min or more of physical activity per week were asked to identify what stops them from exercising. More than one answer was allowed and seven possible options were listed. A similar proportion of both the above-65 (33.4%) and the below-65 age group (27.8%) considered that they were “already active” enough in day-to-day life. Multinomial logistic regression results for perceived barriers to exercise participation are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0898264311422254">Table 5</xref>. Older age, having been married, and not working full-time were independently associated with a perception that injury or illness was a barrier to physical activity engagement. Female gender, aged less than 65, and full-time work were all independently associated with a perception that “lack of time” was a barrier to exercise; while having been married (and now not) or never marrying were independently associated with between approximately 40% and 70% lower odds of finding “lack of time” a barrier to exercise; younger than 65 years of age and never marrying were also independently associated with a perception that “lack of motivation” was a barrier to physical activity participation, and female gender and younger than 65 years were independently associated with cost limiting participation in physical activity. No sociodemographic factors were identified as being independently associated with “difficulty in accessing a gym” as a barrier.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings from this survey provide some useful insights into the exercise and physical activity behaviors and beliefs of a representative sample of South Australians. This study was unique in that it investigated the impact of sociodemographic factors as well as the impact of advancing age on perceived barriers, behaviors, and beliefs about exercise and physical activity participation.</p>
<p>Barriers to levels of physical activity participation appear to be multifaceted, with different sociodemographic factors being associated with different types of barriers. An interesting finding was that education level was not identified as being associated with any type of barrier. It was anticipated that lower levels of education, perhaps indicative of lower socioeconomic status, would lead to an association with cost, injury or illness, or difficulty in accessing a gym as a potential barrier to exercise for this demographic. However, this was not shown in the present study. Participants who were older, single, and not working full-time were more likely to identify injury or illness as a barrier to exercise participation. Although it is more likely those with an injury or chronic illness may not be working full-time, there appears to be a misconception that it is not possible to exercise in the presence of injury or illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264311422254">Victoria Department of Human Services Health Promotion Strategy Unit, 1999</xref>). This is a phenomenon that has been observed in several controlled prospective studies that looked at exercise adherence in older adults. They found that those who had the poorest physiological function at baseline, and therefore those who may have benefited most from the exercise intervention, were the poorest adherers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264311422254">Jette et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264311422254">Williams &amp; Lord, 1995</xref>). It is possible that people are failing to make the connection that what they perceive to be a barrier to participating in physical activity could potentially be improved through regular exercise.</p>
<p>Participants who were married, worked full-time, were younger or female were more likely to consider “lack of time” as a barrier to exercise participation. These factors are all suggestive of individuals who are busy; those who are married are more likely to have children, and those who are younger are more likely to be working full-time which would all contribute to a sense of being time poor. None of the sociodemographic factors tested in this study were associated with difficulty accessing a gym as a barrier. It was thought that there would be an association of this for those participants who resided in regional locations or were older. To maximize uptake and adherence of exercise programs, the heterogeneity of factors that are associated with different barriers needs to be considered through individualized and targeted programs.</p>
<p>Results of previous studies investigating the impact of advancing age on physical activity participation have been conflicting, with one recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264311422254">Haley &amp; Andel, 2010</xref>) suggesting that advancing age was in fact associated with an increased participation in sports and exercise. The findings of the present study suggest that participation in 30 min or more of moderate physical activity three times per week was less likely in those older than 65 and participation levels steadily declined with advancing age. This is supported by several studies that identified younger participants to be more physically active than older participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264311422254">Mouton, Calmbach, Dhanda, Espino, &amp; Hazuda, 2000</xref>) and advancing age to be a predictor of declining physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264311422254">Riebe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422254">Weiss, O’Loughlin, Platt, &amp; Paradis, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite younger people generally being more physically active than older people, this study has again shown that physical activity levels in the general population are still not meeting the recommended guidelines. Several health promotion campaigns have highlighted the need for participation in at least 30 min of moderate physical activity on most days of the week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311422254">Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264311422254">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008</xref>), and there is strong evidence to suggest that regular physical activity can have positive health benefits including a reduction in burden of disease and improvements in quality of life and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264311422254">Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264311422254">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264311422254">Bize et al., 2007</xref>). Yet 26% of all participants in this study reported never meeting this recommendation. Clearly, the message around the importance of regular exercise and the impact this can have on longevity of life is not having a strong-enough impact to promote a change in behavior. This is despite the fact that higher physical activity levels have been associated with better self-reported health, both in this study and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264311422254">Droomers, Schrijvers, &amp; Mackenbach, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264311422254">Weiss et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An interesting finding of this study was the number of sociodemographic factors that influenced preferences for exercise environment and method. This highlights the need for consideration of these factors when prescribing exercise programs in clinical practice or designing exercise interventions for research trials. Age, education, marital status, and area of residence were all independently associated with preferences for different environments to exercise in. In addition, nationality and gender were also associated with preferences for different modes of exercise (group session, one-to-one session, on your own with or without a trained instructor). Although, varying factors were associated with preferences for certain modes of exercise, female gender and being aged 65 years and above were strongly associated with a preference for exercising in a group session when compared with other modes. It is possible that this highlights a potential barrier to achieving high compliance with exercise programs in older women that are prescribed as home exercise programs, with or without review by a trained instructor.</p>
<p>It has been reported that walking is the most popular form of exercise among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264311422254">Haley &amp; Andel, 2010</xref>), in addition, this study has identified that most people consider that walking regularly is the most important form of exercise in older age. Men in particular perceived that walking regularly was more important than hydrotherapy, balance, or strength training. Contrary to this, it is now widely accepted that strength and balance training are both particularly important forms of exercise in older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264311422254">Gillespie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264311422254">Sherrrington et al., 2008</xref>), even among frail nonagenarians, it is possible to increase muscle strength through progressive resistance training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264311422254">Binder et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264311422254">Fiatarone et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264311422254">1994</xref>). The majority of participants (72%) within this study also considered that it was never too late to improve muscle strength through physical activity; yet very few rated strength training as an important form of exercise for older adults. Older adults (65 and above) were also less likely to have a preference for strength training compared with walking regularly. It appears that the message around the importance of strength and balance training is not getting through, possibly contributing to the difficulty that health professionals and research trials targeting exercise interventions have with achieving high levels of compliance with older adults to this type of program. It has been postulated that people with higher levels of education have more knowledge about the benefits of being physically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264311422254">Haley &amp; Andel, 2010</xref>), which is possibly supported by this study, with those who were tertiary educated more likely to perceive strength training as being important in older age. Nationality, area of residence, and marital and employment status, however, were not associated with any perception of what exercise was important in older age, despite their influence on other aspects of physical activity behaviors and beliefs.</p>
<p>This survey of exercise and physical activity behavior and beliefs of South Australians allowed for a large number of South Australians to be targeted. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, given several limitations. There was a relatively high proportion of the population who declined to participate in the survey, with only a 54% consent rate. It is possible that those who declined to participate have health issues or lead a very active lifestyle which was not represented in the results. This may also explain the discrepancy between the findings of the current study, where 52% of the sample were considered to be “sedentary” (exercising once or twice per week), compared with the higher rate of 70% that was reported in a 2004-2005 Australian Bureau of Statistics study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264311422254">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Once the above-65 age group was further broken down into several age groups, the sample sizes of each of the groups became quite small, which may not allow for a true representation of this population. With this type of methodology, the participants were also bound by the fixed-choice questionnaire responses, which may not allow for a full representation of the individuals’ preferences. Using self-report as a measure of exercise behavior may also not be consistent with actual behavior. It was also not possible to truly know how physically active participants were in day-to-day life beyond their self-reported designated exercise time. This is another limitation of the fixed-choice questionnaire, which does not allow for this to be investigated further. Finally, the face-to-face nature of the interview process allowed for more accurate and complete data collection; however, in some cases, the participants may have felt unwilling to disclose information related to their behavior or beliefs without the ability to remain completely anonymous.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The findings of this study suggest that a high proportion of South Australians are still not meeting the national recommendations for physical activity. The message around the overall impact of regular exercise throughout life and the importance of specific exercise training does not appear to be getting through to any age group. Many factors including age, gender, education level, nationality, area of residence, and marital and employment status all appear to influence physical activity behaviors, beliefs, and perceived barriers toward participation. Given this great variability, a better understanding of these factors and the ability to target exercise programs appropriately to different subgroups may improve uptake and adherence.</p>
<p>An understanding of the importance of strength and balance training in older adults has also not yet been established in the general community. It seems that the public health message around the need to reduce cardiovascular risk factors through improving endurance via exercise modes such as walking has made an impact, but more work needs to be done to reinforce the importance of targeted strength and balance exercises. Until this happens, service providers will continue to have difficulty achieving compliance to exercise programs. Future work should focus on public promotion of the significance of specific exercise training throughout the ages and identifying methods of achieving uptake and ongoing compliance. Messages may need to be delivered in a variety of styles in an attempt to capture the attention of different age groups, genders, and levels of socioeconomic status. Given that previous exercise experience and recent involvement in an exercise program have been shown to correlate positively with adherence to a current exercise program, one possible strategy to increase participation in exercise throughout life may be to target education and uptake from a young age to ensure that routines are well established by older age.</p>
