<body>
<p>Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is a nonneoplastic, slowly progressing disorder of unknown etiology. Although it infrequently occurs in the sinonasal tract, involvement of the nasal turbinates is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of inferior turbinate monostotic FD in the medical literature. Only 2 studies of poliostotic FD involving the inferior turbinates have been previously published (including a single case of McCune-Albright syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811431059">1</xref></sup> and a single case of the poliostotic form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811431059">2</xref></sup>).</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 68-year-old woman was referred to our department for evaluation of chronic nasal obstruction, treated previously with topical corticosteroids for 6 months. During the nasal endoscopic evaluation, a hypertrofic and hard-on-palpation left inferior turbinate was noticed obstructing completely the left nasal airway (Suppl. Figure S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://otojournal.org">otojournal.org</ext-link>). A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the osseous hypertrophy of the left inferior turbinate, compatible with a fibro-osseous lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811431059"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). No endocrine disorders or cutaneous hyperpigmentation or other bone lesions were observed. The patient underwent an endoscopic inferior turbinate resection. Histopathological definitive result was positive for FD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811431059"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). The postoperative course was uneventful. At 1 year of follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence. The presentation of this clinical case was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi of Varese.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fibrous dysplasia is characterized by the replacement of normal bony tissue by fibrous tissue and immature woven bone, histologically corresponding to different stages of bone metaplasia. It is more commonly diagnosed within the first 2 decades of life and may present 3 different clinical variations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811431059">3</xref></sup>: monostotic, polyostotic, and disseminnated. The first one, accounting for 70% of cases, is localized to a single bone, and craniofacial skeleton involvement is observed in 30% of patients. The second one, occuring in 30% of cases, affects multiple sites with involvement of the skull’s bones in 50% of patients. In the third form, also known as McCune-Albright syndrome, the polyostotic form is associated with endocrine abnormalities and skin pigmentation.</p>
<p>Whereas monostotic FD occurs with equal frequency in both males and females, the polyostotic form is more common in females, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1. The craniofacial skeleton is involved in 25% of cases of FD, with the maxilla and mandible being the most frequently affected sites, followed by frontal, parietal, and occipital bones. Malignant degeneration to sarcoma is a rare event and occurs in patients who had previously received radiation therapy.</p>
<p>Clinical features of FD are aspecific, with painless facial and skull deformities reported as the first signs. Involvement of the paranasal sinuses, orbits, and foramina of the skull base can produce a variety of symptoms, including headache, visual loss, proptosis, diplopia, epiphora, nasal obstruction, anosmia, epistaxis, mucoceles, and recurrent rhinosinusitis. The disease has a submucosal pattern of growth, and nasal endoscopic examination may reveal normal mucosa covering a space-occupying lesion. Computed tomography scan is strictly related to the degree of mineralization of the tissue, ranging from radiolucent appearence of the lesion in the early stages (due to the high density of fibrous tissue) to subsequent ground-glass or sclerotic appearence as the amount of bony tissue increases. On a magnetic resonance scan, the signal is reported as rather variable on T2-weighted sequences, whereas the T1 signal is more commonly hypointense. After gadolinium administration, nonhomogeneous enhancement may be obtained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811431059">4</xref></sup> Differential diagnosis with ossifying fibroma on imaging may be problematic, and evidence of sarcomatous trasformations should be searched histologically.</p>
<p>The treatment of FD is surgical, but it is not always indicated. Solitary small lesions may remain asymptomatic and static, thus requiring no treatment. Surgery is recommended as soon as the lesion becomes marked with pain, progressive deformity or interference with functions, to relieve symptoms or to correct aesthetic deformities but usually without curative intent. Nowadays, most cases can be managed with endoscopic endonasal surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811431059">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this case, nasal obstruction was a very important symptom to the patient. Endoscopic endonasal surgery was adopted due to the appropriate exposure of the entire nasal cavity, providing light to its posterior and superior parts, without any aesthetic disfigurations. Preservation of the healthy nasal mucosa with minimum scarring and optimum control of eventual nasal bleeding are 2 more positive features of the endoscopic approaches, furthering them in the treatment of endonasal lesions.</p>
