<p>According to a new study, drinking a lot of fizzy drinks can cause violence in teenagers. Researchers found that teenagers who drink more than five cans of non-diet, fizzy soft drinks every week are significantly more likely to behave aggressively. The study involved asking 1,878 teenagers from 22 public schools in Boston about their fizzy drink consumption and violent behaviour. Keep the lid on fizzy drinks.</p>

<p>A study by the Colorado Centre for Reproductive Medicine has found that the quality of sperm decreases with age. The study tested mice, but suggests that after the age of 40 men will find it harder to conceive. So women are not the only ones that should be concerned about their biological clocks!</p>
