<abstract>
<p>In this article we explore the issue of memory transmission by considering it along the two temporal planes on which it occurs: vertically, through time; and horizontally, in time. It is because we regard memory transmission as involving the mutual interaction of these two planes that we introduce the concept of the mnemonic imagination. The value of the concept is that it enables us to see, inter alia, how communities of memory emerge. Our route into this is the sociology of generations and most particularly the evidence of mnemonic transmission provided by second-generation Holocaust narratives. The purpose of the article is to bring together a range of work relevant to the sharing and inheritance of memory across and within time, to explore the application of collective mnemonic frames in processes of personal remembering, and so move us closer to understanding the mechanism by which experience derived from others becomes integrated into our own life-stories.</p>

<title>Generations and the transmission of memory</title>
<p>The concept of generation has been bound up with the question of the transmission of memory since its popularisation as a social category by Mannheim in 1927. This developed as part of a preoccupation with the emergence of new social knowledge. Mannheim weaves together a concern for generation as an empirically observable phenomenon in which people are born into a particular historical moment, and as the interior felt quality of historically specific consciousness among such people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549412457481">Burnett, 2010</xref>: 33). So while generations are made possible by biological patterns of birth, ageing and death, they are not reducible to them. Mannheim develops a concept of generational position which he likens to a class position – a location in the wider social structure which can be conceived as an objective fact, independent of our consciousness of it. He also suggests that although generational consciousness is enabled via a common age-defined location, it is produced by the accumulation and transmission of cultural heritage and its reception in these qualitatively new locations. Social change emerges from new generations coming into ‘contact anew with accumulated cultural heritage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457481">Mannheim, 1959</xref>: 293) and assimilating or using it in new ways. While Mannheim acknowledges that innovation and creativity can emerge from the knowledge accumulated by a particular generation because of changes in social conditions, he reserves the ‘fresh contact’ of successive generations with cultural heritage as generating the most creative and radical changes. He conceives this emergence of new generational consciousness not simply as continuity and change, but as a dialectical process of social remembering and forgetting:<disp-quote>
<p>The continuous emergence of new human beings certainly results in some loss of accumulated cultural possessions; but, on the other hand, it alone makes a fresh selection possible when it becomes necessary; it facilitates evaluation of our inventory and teaches us both to forget that which is no longer useful and to covet that which has yet to be won. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457481">1959</xref>: 294)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mannheim recognises that cultural heritage is accumulated via its incorporation into the present and that this process is both selective and creative, demonstrating that the transmission of cultural knowledge is a precondition for innovation. At this point a clear connection to the Halbwachsian notion of collective memory is in evidence, but whereas early models of collective memory emphasised the reproduction of mnemonic knowledge over how collective memory changes over time, Mannheim foregrounds mechanisms of change and transformation in this process. Conversely, he lacks a clearly developed account of the precise ways in which intergenerationally transmitted experience contributes to a shared sense of being in time. For example, he suggests, somewhat contradictorily, that a distinction must be made between appropriated and personally acquired memories, and that we only truly possess memories that we have acquired ourselves through the process of direct experience in ‘real’ situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549412457481">1959</xref>: 296). These memories alone have binding power. Inherited memories are merely the backdrop against which these new experiences can be interpreted.</p>
<p>Mannheim’s model of generations also incorporates intra-generational relations as the processes by which generational consciousness emerges from a commonality of experience in time. As he argues, a common location in the social structure is not enough to produce generational consciousness. He explicitly rejects the notion that entire generations can be characterised as homogenous groups. Instead, he proposes that although entire generations respond to their specific social and historical circumstances and trends may be observable in these responses, they are made up of more-or-less coherent units that engage in particular ways with prevailing social and historical circumstances. So while generations might share predominant concerns, they may produce radically different responses to them. Along with a shared mnemonic inheritance and a commonality of experience in the present, Mannheim adds the requirement that generations share in and contribute to a ‘common destiny’. Generations are oriented towards the future, and in this sense are constituted through their creative forward-looking action.</p>
<p>Mannheim offers a framework for examining the processes and practices of memory transmission by grasping together the two temporal planes which in subsequent research on generations are, if not hived off from one another, then routinely conflated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367549412457481">1</xref></sup> On the one hand, there is the transmission of memory over time, in which the past in drawn into the present and reworked creatively in the interests of the future. On the other, there is the transmission or sharing of memory in time, through which shared senses of common pasts, presents and futures are actively negotiated and constructed. Generation as a subject position, a consciousness and a domain of social action is doubly relational as it involves a vertical relation through time with what came before us and what may come after, and a horizontal relation in time with others who share our historical location. However, the specific ways in which inheritance and innovation are performed over time, and the ways in which commonality and difference are developed in time, are not explicitly formulated. Mannheim allows for diversity in the creative process of interpreting cultural inheritance in a given historical context, but it is not possible to account for the emergence and articulation of different entelechies by generational units without conceptualising in more detail the practices and processes involved in cultural inheritance itself.</p>
<p>More recent sociological investigations of generation have tended to emphasise commonality and difference <italic>in</italic> time above transmission <italic>over</italic> time. Issues of inheritance are overshadowed by attention to often vast groups of people and their distinctive social identities and contemporary cultural reference points. This has been manifested in a widespread conflation of generation and its attendant features of relations over time with cohorts as large co-eval groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549412457481">Glenn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549412457481">Kertzer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412457481">Pilcher, 1994</xref>). In turn, a number of attempts have been made to separate these two usages of generation. Pilcher argues that ‘the confusion resulting from the misapplication of generation as a term arises out of … the conflation of biological generation with cohort’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549412457481">1994</xref>: 484). Kertzer notes that the consequences of this are the confounding of two independent variables of social relations based on lineage and biological age, but the separation of these two variables has entailed a disconnection between mnemonic transmission in and over time. Following Mannheim’s emphasis on the importance of experientially derived, or firsthand memories, sociological research has tended to focus on the development of generational consciousness around memories of distinctive events or themes that occurred in their cohort’s lifetime. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549412457481">Schuman and Scott (1989)</xref> measured the extent to which age cohorts share distinctive memories that distinguish them from other cohorts. They proceeded on the basis of Mannheim’s claim that inherited memories were unlikely to register as significant. However, they found that while cohorts are likely to share a sense of the most important historical events based on their firsthand experience of it, there was also evidence of events before an individual’s own lived experience being integrated into their own understanding of history. These did not appear to be straightforwardly adopted memories, but a synthesis of their own experience with that which they had inherited, or a reflection on the events’ wider social or political significance (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549412457481">Larson and Lizardo, 2007</xref>). While Schuman and Scott recognise that this is a kind of collective memory, they offer little explanation of the ways in which this transmission of secondhand experience occurs, the extent to which these secondhand memories are shared by any given cohort, or an assessment of their meanings for those who recall them beyond a delineation between autobiographical memories and broader, less personal nostalgia for an unexperienced time.</p>
<p>In the work of Edmunds and Turner, there is a further hardening of the separation between commonality in time and the relations that exist over time. They suggest that traumatic events actively produce generations by cutting off ‘a generation from its past and separat[ing] it from the future. The event becomes the basis of a collective ideology and a set of integrating rituals [that] become the conduit for the commemoration of the traumatic experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549412457481">2002</xref>: 12). This abandons any sense that inherited experience is involved in the development of shared generational consciousness. Although they acknowledge that the successful emergence of a generational identity depends on the effective transmission of a ‘habitus’ or a ‘collection of practices through which generational experiences are manifest’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549412457481">Edmunds and Turner (2002)</xref> claim that intergenerational tension and conflict are general features or conditions of modernity. Cultural transmission is regarded as occuring only on one of Mannheim’s two temporal axes: collective memory is considered to forge commonality in time, but not continuities through it.</p>
<p>This focus on contemporaneity has two consequences. First, it proposes a set of somewhat static and excessively cohesive generational identities based around zeitgeist-defining events such as the Vietnam War or 9/11. While identifying key cultural points of reference, this provides little explanation of the meaning of these events in the lives of the people they are said to characterise, or of the stratification that occurs between them in their specific identities or ‘units’. Second, it sets up an exclusively conflictual model in which generations compete over scarce cultural resources (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549412457481">Phillipson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549412457481">Turner, 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367549412457481">2</xref></sup> Edmunds and Turner claim that generational conflict is an ‘inevitable feature of a society where social change is a rapid, ineluctable and permanent feature of a technological civilisation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549412457481">2002</xref>: 11). The problem is that by focusing only on generational relations in the present, inheritances between generations that occur over time are not accounted for. Generations are not necessarily locked in opposition with one another. This ‘may be the case in particular historical circumstances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367549412457481">Irwin, 1998</xref>: 305–306), but it is certainly not true in every case or under every contextual permutation. As Mannheim implies, generations are mnemonic communities because working through secondhand pasts is crucial to the development of collective senses of being-in-time, or what Reulcke calls ‘generationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549412457481">2010</xref>: 119). In other words, ‘the feeling of belonging to a generation not only comes about through a horizontal process that links a particular moment in history to a shared experience, but also vertically through family lineages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549412457481">Attias-Donfut and Arber, 2000</xref>: 3). Certainly, ‘we need to study how, out of the experience of “having been young together” the attributes of “my generation” or “our time” gain a social validity and become general aspects of identification in discursive practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549412457481">Corsten, 1999</xref>: 269), but not at the expense of assessing how common inheritance and shared futures feature in the emergence of distinctive communities of memory. Instead, how memory is communicated across time needs to be combined with analysis of the transmission of experience in time.</p>

<title>Communities of memory</title>
<p>Memory studies research which is not centrally focused on the concept of generation has emphasised the importance of transmission over time, attending to the vertical axis of temporality. Generations in this context are conceived primarily as ‘communities of memory’ and relations between them are considered as part of the way in which the past is translated ‘into discourse about the present and future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549412457481">Irwin-Zarecka, 2009</xref>: 53–54). There has been particular attention paid to cultural forms as carriers of shared memory. While this work provides ways of thinking about the modes of communication by which experience can be shared over time, further consideration is needed of the way that we take up and synthesise firsthand and secondhand experience in developing self-narratives, how collective ‘frames’ of memory are adopted and applied in everyday remembering processes, and how we make sense of and operationalise institutionalised and objectivised memory. Or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457481">Apfelbaum (2001)</xref> puts it, how stories come to be heard, not just expressed.</p>
<p>Questions relating to the nature of our engagement with inherited memory have been taken up by Marianne Hirsch in her work on postmemory, which<disp-quote>
<p>characterises the experience of those who grow up dominated by narratives that preceded their birth, whose own belated stories are evacuated by the stories of the previous generation, shaped by traumatic events that can neither be fully understood nor re-created. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549412457481">1996</xref>: 659)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Hirsch, distinctive senses of shared time emerge from the struggle to make sense of inherited experience and a common diachronic distance from those inherited pasts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549412457481">Hirsch (2008</xref>: 114) applies this directly to the children of Holocaust survivors who, she suggests, constitute a ‘generation of postmemory’. In this context, shared generational identity in the present hinges on a common structure of vertical temporal relations, or a shared belatedness. Hirsch provides a framework for assessing how secondhand experience is transmitted by distinguishing between familial and affiliative postmemory. She identifies the ‘role of the family as a space of transmission’ which involves ‘the language of family, the language of the body: nonverbal and noncognitive acts of transfer’. It is through our embeddedness in the family that the experience of the previous generation is integrated into our own way of being in the world. In the form of art, narratives and mass-mediated representations, postmemory extends beyond the family into the public symbolic environment, where secondhand experiences circulate and can be drawn on in processes of ‘identification, imagination, and projection’ by those not intimately connected with them. While the formal familial mode relates to ‘an intergenerational vertical identification of child and parent occurring within the family’, the affiliative mode refers to ‘the intra-generational horizontal identification that makes that child’s position more broadly available to other contemporaries’. For Hirsch, these two modes of transmission are interdependent. The family provides a framework that bridges the communicative and cultural modes of mnemonic transmission, as it speaks to the second generation’s belatedness and provides sites of identification for those making sense of the Holocaust’s legacy from a distance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367549412457481">3</xref></sup> A sense of being-together-in-time is produced through the interaction of vertical and horizontal modes of mnemonic transmission.</p>
<p>Rothberg develops this integration of vertical and horizontal modes of transmission in his conceptualisation of multidirectional memory by exploring how vertical mnemonic relations operate in horizontal modalities. He suggests that as mnemonic communities, generations are not involved in a ‘zero-sum struggle over scarce resources’; rather, their mnemonic narratives and identities are ‘subject to ongoing negotiation, cross-referencing, and borrowing’ and are ‘productive, not privative’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457481">2009</xref>: 3). So while Hirsch examines the different modes of borrowing from and creatively engaging with a particular experience that preceded our own, along with the ways we might relate to this across a temporal distance, Rothberg goes further in arguing that vertical temporal inheritances are routinely, and indeed necessarily, brought into a productive horizontal tension with each another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367549412457481">4</xref></sup> Although recognising the particularities of transmitted memories is important, without overcoming claims for the uniqueness of given mnemonic inheritances (as has been particularly the case with the Holocaust), the past cannot be used as a resource for making sense of the shared present, never mind a possible shared future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457481">Rothberg, 2009</xref>: 7–12).</p>
<p>Both vertically and horizontally, Hirsch and Rothberg problematise any straightforward line between memory and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457481">Rothberg, 2009</xref>: 4), emphasising the ambivalences and the provisional (although keenly felt) nature of connections with the pasts of others made in and through time. As Anna Reading suggests in her use of the concept of articulation, processes of transmission through which pasts in their various social and cultural modalities are performed and interlock, constitute and modify identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549412457481">2002</xref>: 147). The question of how inherited pasts become meaningful in both personal and collective domains nevertheless requires further attention if we are to assess precisely what these articulations involve.</p>
<p>A sense of shared time would seem to emerge fluidly from a network of continually performed temporal relationships, all of which involve the transmission of memory and its ongoing negotiation. Hirsch is not concerned with fixed structural relations between generations over time in the way that Turner and Edmunds construct their competitive model; instead, she addresses the mutability and contingency of shifting patterns of cross-generational identification. Similarly, Rothberg is concerned with the relational production of temporal meaning in the interaction of communities of memory over time. Both explore the interpretative work that goes on in processes of communicating and making sense of accumulated secondhand experience, but they leave us with two interrelated questions about the processes of mnemonic transmission. First, by what means or mechanism is it possible for firsthand and secondhand experience to be synthesised on a vertical temporal plane? Hirsch suggests that postmemory involves a reactivation of anterior collective memories and negotiation of the critical and ethical distance from the originating experience. Nevertheless, the ways in which we navigate the gap between firsthand and secondhand experience, or the very domain of ‘post-ness’ itself, remain elusive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549412457481">Hirsch (2001</xref>: 9) identifies the creative nature of this navigation, and with reference to the writings of second-generation Holocaust survivors, McGlothlin demonstrates that operating in the interstitial space between an unexperienced past and an experienced present involves a reimagining of parental pasts in order to ‘effect a measure of rehabilitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549412457481">2006</xref>: 10–11) in the present and for the future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367549412457481">5</xref></sup> McGlothlin and Hirsch hint at the twinned operation of memory and imagination as the mode by which we grasp inherited pasts and fold them into our own experience, developing new narratives and ways of knowing in the process, but the nature of this relationship between memory and imagination and their mutual interaction requires further elaboration.</p>
<p>Second, how is it possible for us to grasp together horizontal and vertical temporal meanings at one and the same time? Rothberg’s notion of multidirectional memory indicates that our inherited pasts are creatively reworked in relation to or conjunction with the pasts of others. The process of mnemonic transmission involves a set of dialogic relations between inheritances and legacies. This synthesis of our intimately inherited pasts with our own experience and the placing of this ‘postmnemonic’ understanding in relation to other narratives of inheritance involve ‘comparison and generalisation while resisting too-easy universalization’, which may provide ‘grounds for new transnational visions of justice and solidarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457481">Rothberg, 2009</xref>: 265). He suggests that imagination is ‘the substance of multidirectional memory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457481">2009</xref>: 18), although he does not elaborate in detail the precise nature of the interaction between memory and imagination and how, through their mutual interaction, they allow other pasts to be synthesised with our own. As Hoffman expresses it, the gap between her inherited and personal experience is<disp-quote>
<p>a chink, a window through which I can observe the diversity of the world. The apertures of perception have widened because they were once pried apart. Just as the number ‘2’ implies all other numbers, so a bivalent consciousness is necessarily a multivalent consciousness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412457481">1998</xref>: 274)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Between her own experience and that which she inherited from her parents opens a critical and reflexive perspective on her own sense of belonging to a family and community over time, but the gap also implicates other alternative pasts and presents which in turn ‘make claims on our imaginations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412457481">1998</xref>: 275). However, what is it that enables us to broach these gaps or temporal lacunae in both everyday mnemonic discourse and cultural texts? How we generate new meaning from acts of bringing into relation different inherited pasts, and use them in orienting ourselves to the future, needs further examination. In the following section we make a modest contribution to exploring the process of interpreting inherited pasts. By identifying what is involved in mnemonic transmission in and through time, the diachronic and synchronic formation of generational identity as a sense of both being-together-in-time and being-different-in-time can be illuminated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1367549412457481">
<title>The mnemonic imagination</title>
<p>We take the creative process of working between inherited pasts as our own starting point. The concept of the mnemonic imagination, which we have elaborated upon elsewhere, can be readily applied to this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549412457481">Keightley and Pickering, 2012</xref>). It refers to the ways in which we continuously qualify, adapt, refine and re-synthesise past experience, our own and that of others, into qualitatively new understandings of ourselves and other people, including those to whom we stand in immediate or proximate relation, and those from whom we are more distant. This occurs both in time and over time.</p>
<p>In our everyday understandings of memory and imagination, we routinely make hard-and-fast distinctions between them as faculties: the former associated with our connection to the past and the space of experience; the latter with the realm of the future and our horizons of expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549412457481">Koselleck, 1998</xref>). This conventional view is far too constrictive because as experience is transmitted in and through time, memory and imagination act on one another and exceed their separate affordances by virtue of their collaboration. In engaging with pasts that we did not experience and bringing them to bear in our own self-narratives and understanding of others, memory and imagination act in productive tension with each other, and in so doing, open up opportunities for the generation of new temporal meanings. Neither faculty are sufficient in themselves if we are to explain the complex interplay of experienced and inherited pasts: the ways in which they are performed and revised continually in a constantly changing present, and the ways in which they extend their reach into the realm of the possible. It is only in their convergence in the process of transmission that it becomes possible to synthesise firsthand and secondhand experience, and so creatively use memory in the interests of times that have yet to unfold.</p>
<p>The role of the imagination is crucial in the transmission of inherited memories, both vertically and horizontally. It enables a move beyond a straightforward bringing of the past into the present. While both memory and imagination are involved in making present that which is absent, imagination exceeds lived experience insofar as it can make something qualitatively new through recombining ideas, objects, practices and experiences. Imagination conjoins our sensory experience and categories of understanding by reproducing experience and synthesising it into meaningful combinations. Kant refers to this as ‘the act of putting different representations together, and of comprehending their manifoldness in one item of knowledge’ (Kant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549412457481">2007[1781]</xref>: 103–104). The idea of the imagination as productive is taken up by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549412457481">Ricoeur (1984)</xref> in his concept of semantic innovation. This occurs, for example, when elements of a plot are imaginatively grasped together in a coherent whole according to our categories of understanding. This is not only a literary phenomenon; it refers directly to the ways in which we construct our own narrative identities, drawing together the constituent fragments of a life into a meaningful, if fluid and provisional whole. The narrative frameworks of meaning which our experience is reconciled around include distinctions of cause and effect, before and after, now and then, making this an irreducibly temporal process. Memory provides the source of those raw materials for imaginative recreation, and for new modes of both individual and collective action.</p>
<p>As Ricoeur suggests, memory is knowledge that has ‘an ambition, a claim – that of being faithful to the past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549412457481">2004</xref>: 21). Where imagination can float free of experience, in combination with memory it is given referential moorings within experience. While it is clear that this is provided straightforwardly by memories derived from our own experience, the ‘sense of living connection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549412457481">Hirsch, 2008</xref>: 104) to a unexperienced past provided by inherited memories can also deeply anchor the imagination, binding it into a process of ‘reckoning with the cargo of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457481">Hoffman, 2005</xref>: 33). In her autobiography, Paula Fass demonstrates the ways in which memory can provide a critical check on imaginative renderings of the past and their future articulation. She uses her own inherited memories to weigh the memorialisation of the Holocaust in Poland and the ways in which the past has been reimagined by others:<disp-quote>
<p>The Jews were hard to live with. It is easier to remember them fondly in festivals, museums and empty synagogues. Today I am afraid they are not being missed at all in either Poland or by Poles. More frightening, their absence is increasingly not felt because other things have been substituted for it, and the Poles have absorbed the substitutions into their own history. Thus tourists will come to believe this to be ‘the history of the Jews in Poland’. My memories may only be memories of memories (second-hand goods like the kind once sold in the market in <italic>Łódź</italic>), but they whisper to me of another life lived in Poland than the one that is being reconstructed in the Poland to which I recently returned.

<p>In this example, Fass belongs to a community of memory in a twofold sense. She belongs to a Jewish community of memory in which solidarities and commonalities are vertical in nature, located in her relations to Jews who suffered before her, including those in intimate familial proximity to her, and those unknown to her who belonged to her religious and cultural group. These memories of memories, transmitted through familial discourses and wider cultural narratives, are drawn into and brought to bear on her own present. In doing so she becomes an active participant in a Jewish community of memory, imaginatively articulating and performing her role within it and contributing to the group’s transfiguration in the present. She also belongs to a community of memory which is shot through with difference and tension, that we might think of as a generational postwar community. In this sense transmission is horizontal, with the pasts of specific groups communicated via memorial and commemorative practices, where the meaning of Jewish pasts in the present is relationally produced with reference to the Polish national past. She brings to bear her own vertically produced mnemonic narratives and mnemonic affiliations into this shared temporal domain of ‘afterwardness’ in which memories of the Holocaust are negotiated continually, and questions about their role and relevance in the present remain a site of struggle. Fass shuttles between her extended space of experience, marked out and populated by her inherited past, and horizons of expectations which promise movement into new experience. The mnemonic imagination facilitates such movement by holding this space and horizon in tension while never allowing them to collapse in on one another.</p>
<p>Imagination allows memory to move beyond a repetition of experience, either firsthand or secondhand. It realigns the temporal tenses and gives rise to qualitatively new meaning in the present. It also allows a second ‘bringing into relation’, horizontally in the present, as the pasts to which we have a ‘living connection’, either literally or via our inheritance, are informed and interrogated by the pasts of others. On the other side of the relation, memory keeps imagination in check. It is impossible, without a commitment to a real past, to devise and maintain moral or ethical criteria for judging action in the present or future. Memory invests imagination with social responsibility, which is observable in calls to ‘never forget’ or indictments of ‘never again’. It prevents us from wandering too far from our obligation to others who preceded us in time, and to those who exist alongside us in time. In this sense it is the dual action of imagination and memory that allows us to transmit experience in vertical and horizontal planes. It enables us to grasp together the temporal tenses and render them into new semantic totalities, while at the same time encouraging us to bring our mnemonic narratives into productive dialogue with those of others. It is via the mnemonic imagination that we are able continually to forge and reshape relations of communality and difference in and over time.</p>

<title>The second generation</title>
<p>It would seem productive now to assess the value of the concept of the mnemonic imagination by placing it up against what might be considered a ‘limit case’ of mnemonic transmission: that experienced by the second generation of Holocaust survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1367549412457481">6</xref></sup> We have chosen to focus specifically on this case study for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is in the context of the Holocaust and the politics of memory with which it is associated that the question of intergenerational transmission has been most keenly felt and comprehensively attended to. The possibility of communicating the incommunicable has been extensively and intensively reflected upon in first, second and now third generation accounts. Secondly, there has been an extensive problematisation of the relationship between memory and imagination and the creative dimensions of transmission in this particular context, dating back to Adorno’s oft- cited claim that ‘to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549412457481">1997</xref>: 34), and it is this that we wish directly to engage with. Thirdly, as Helen Epstein traces in her analysis of second generation accounts, patterns of commonality and difference in the experiences of children of Holocaust survivors, who shared this belated historical position have, over time, allowed the second generation to coalesce into a fluid but nevertheless distinct and recognisable community. It is precisely the emergence of this kind of community of memory that we are concerned with.</p>
<p>The nature of memory transmission on both vertical and horizontal planes has been a primary concern, perhaps <italic>the</italic> concern, of what has come to be known as second-generation literature. Second-generation writers have problematised the transmission of such a heavy mnemonic burden in terms of making sense of their parents’ past as both separate from and as part of their own, and sharing that past with others who relate to it both intimately and from a distance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1367549412457481">7</xref></sup> This is especially problematic because often the experience of the second generation’s inheritance was of profound loss; a vacuum standing in the place of a conventional mnemonic inheritance. The nature of these events seems to ‘defy the imagination of the interlocutor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457481">Apfelbaum, 2001</xref>: 21), potentially rendering those pasts meaningless to those who came afterwards and unable to be shared. For Eva Hoffman, her parents transmitted their experience via<disp-quote>
<p>a chaos of emotion that emerged from their words rather than any coherent narration. Or rather, the emotion, direct and tormented, was enacted through the words, the form of their utterances. The memories – no, not memories but emanations – of wartime experiences kept erupting in flashes of imagery; in abrupt, fragmented phrases; in repetitious, broken refrains. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457481">2005</xref>: 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This has been conceptualised in several ways as ‘absent memory’, ‘phantom pain’ or ‘vicarious witnessing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549412457481">Crownshaw, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549412457481">Fine, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549412457481">Fresco, 1984</xref>). Indeed, many children of Holocaust survivors did not merely come after the Holocaust, but after siblings or half-siblings lost to its ravages. At the core of their very being they can embody both loss and renewal, absence and presence, rupture and continuity.</p>
<p>How then, in the face of such a disjointed and painful inheritance, can these pasts be transmitted, made sense of and brought to bear on wider social memory? How can they become meaningful in both personal and collective domains? In the first instance this requires a vertical synthesis of past pain and present lives. An oscillating relationship between inherited experience and newly-delineated expectation are very much in evidence in second-generation accounts, but the nature of their inheritance makes this a Herculean task. The twinned roles of inheritors and transmitters of Holocaust memory are being continually refashioned and articulated, despite the ‘bumpy and circuitous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549412457481">Karpf, 1997</xref>: 313) nature of the temporal negotiations that they involve. These processes of negotiating and refashioning in second-generation experience are facilitated by the mnemonic imagination. The development of multi-directional postmemories involves a creative (and necessarily provisional) grasping together, or reconciliation, of inherited and experienced pasts, conjoining them into qualitatively new semantic wholes. At the same time the mnemonic imagination also involves a creative holding in relation of different mnemonic narratives in order for Holocaust experiences to be brought to bear on those not intimately connected to them, and similarly for other pasts to aid the interpretation and negotiation of Holocaust memory. What emerges from these twinned processes of creative transmission are networks and patterns of commonality and difference, and sites and positions of identification and critique.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457481">Eva Hoffman (2005)</xref> expresses, both explicitly and obliquely, the partial and sometimes perilous processes involved in the fragmented but intensive transmission of her parents’ past and her navigation of it. We can trace the work of the mnemonic imagination in her narrative reckoning with the memories of suffering in whose shadow she lives. She interweaves inherited and firsthand experience, shuttling back and forth between the two, searching out ways of telling and making that past an understandable part of her own autobiography in the process. This is the mnemonic imagination at work. In an account of her mother’s memory of her younger sister, she attempts to draw in and make knowable that past:<disp-quote>
<p>‘She hadn’t even lived yet’ my mother says – and she died in such a horrible way. The man who saw her go into the gas chamber said that she was among those who had to dig their own graves, and that her hair turned gray the day before her death. That strikes me as a fairy tale more cruel, more magical than anything in the Brothers Grimm. Except that it is real. But is it? It doesn’t have the same palpable reality as the Cracow tramway. Maybe it didn’t happen after all. Maybe it’s only a story, and a story can be told differently, it can be changed … In my head, without telling anyone, I form a resolve that when I grow up, I’ll search the world far and wide for this lost aunt … Maybe I’ll find her and bring her to my mother, whose suffering will be assuaged. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412457481">1998</xref>: 6–7).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The mnemonic imagination operates here in several ways via three temporal moments: the inherited past, the experienced past and the present moment of telling. McGlothlin calls these three temporal positions the past, the present and the super-present.</p>
<p>As Young identifies in Speigelman’s <italic>Maus</italic>, second-generation accounts of their parents’ experiences are new stories ‘unique to their experience together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412457481">1998</xref>: 676). With Hoffman, the mnemonic imagination enables her to draw her mother’s loss into her own autobiographical narrative, using it as a resource in her own orientation to a fantasy future in which she makes good the terrible absence visited on her mother. She imagines her mother’s past and her own future, stitching them together into a new whole in which the meanings of the Holocaust and its legacy are unstable and contingent, but full of possibility. While the work of memory anchors the narrative in a set of referential events, the imagination mobilises that past, makes it malleable and available for her to weave around a conventional fairytale narrative structure – even though, in the telling, it immediately exceeds that framework. There is also the third temporal position, the present moment of telling, in the complex narrative triangulation that Hoffman undertakes. In this super-present, Hoffman reflexively explores the contingent quality of the combinations of the temporal tenses and the experience contained within them, and in imaginatively moving between them while never straying too far from her experiential grounding, she opens up a critical distance from her own inheritance and establishes a position from which she can make sense of her own relationship to it. Hoffman’s inheritance of the Holocaust has not imposed a narrative identity on her: her relations to it are not fixed. Instead, it provides the raw materials for the creative construction of herself in relation to it:<disp-quote>
<p>As every writer knows, it’s only when you come to a certain point in your script that it becomes clear how the beginning should go, and what importance it has within the whole. And it’s usually after revising backward from the middle that one can begin to go on with the rest. To some extent, one has to rewrite the past in order to understand it. I have to see Cracow in the dimensions it has to my adult eye in order to perceive that my story has been only a story. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549412457481">1998</xref>: 241–242)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this sense what Hoffman narrates is a ‘received history – a narrative hybrid that interweaves both events of the Holocaust and the ways they are passed down to us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549412457481">Young, 1998</xref>: 669). This action does not have a definitive end-point. It is an ongoing process of reimagining a past in relation to a constantly shifting present, and conversely, a continual interpolation of that present by a reconceived past. In retelling the narratives of their parents as part of their own, second-generation survivors are performing the kind of repetition that Ricoeur identifies as neither restoring after the fact nor re-actualising: it is ‘realising anew’. It is a matter of recalling, replying to, retorting, even of revoking heritages’, and this ‘creative power of repetition is contained entirely in this power of opening up the past again to the future’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549412457481">2004</xref>: 380).</p>
<p>It is made possible by the mutual interaction of memory and imagination, which holds the inherited and experienced temporal domains in productive tension and allows them to be grasped and re-grasped together in new ways. As Fass notes:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hen I finally took up their history, telling about my parents’ past required something more than my profession as a historian. Their past had to become once again my past, a past I was willing to acknowledge and accept. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549412457481">2011</xref>: 178)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This repetition goes beyond a retelling: it requires an open interaction with secondhand experience which can be performed only in the liminal space of transmission between generations. In this sense, generational consciousness as a sense of difference over time is creatively produced not by making a complete break with inherited pasts, but through the dialectical relationships between continuity and rupture, intimate knowing and irreducible difference that occur vertically through time in genealogical relationships. As Langer notes it is only by restoring coming generations’ imaginative engagement with the history of the Holocaust that the depth and scope of its meaning can be communicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549412457481">1995</xref>: 180).</p>
<p>Second-generation narratives also demonstrate the mnemonic imagination at work in transmission that works on a horizontal plane. In the first instance this involves the process of drawing together, identifying with and speaking in relation to others who share a close inherited connection to the Holocaust. Helen Epstein describes this as the emergence of the second generation as a community:<disp-quote>
<p>The numbness I felt when I heard my own parents’ stories disappeared when I read the accounts of others. I could take those in more readily. For the first time, I saw my parents’ lives in the context of others. I could put them in perspective and measure them against a community. I had never known any family to place them in. Those survivors I had never met, whose lives I read about in transcript after transcript became a substitute for family. It was then I realised that I had to talk to their children. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549412457481">1988[1979]</xref>: 336)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is the radical loss of community wrought by the Holocaust that lays bare the intensive and self-reflexive work of the mnemonic imagination in the process of reconstructing relations of commonality for the second generation. Synchronic affiliations, which in other circumstances would be taken for granted, have to be forged anew. In Epstein’s account, she describes the effort of drawing together disparate narratives, forging connections and generating new meaning. In this respect the mnemonic imagination allows a synthesis of her own experience with that of others. She is able to make imaginative connections that reach beyond her own mnemonic inheritance, enabling her to see her parents, and by extension, herself, in the context of others. She is able to create webs or networks of commonality through which a consciousness of being-together-in-time emerges. Her vertical inheritance can be made sense of properly only when simultaneously drawn into an horizontal mnemonic community.</p>
<p>Eva Hoffman also describes this creative forging of a sense of commonality in time that we might think of as a (second-)generational consciousness:<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps the character of this grouping can best be defined (to use a term borrowed from a certain idea of the nation) as an imagined community – that is, a community based not so much on geography or circumstance as on sets of meanings, symbols and even literary fictions that it has in common and that enable its members to recognise and converse with each other with a sense of mutual belonging … The reference points through which we communicate and recognise each other have to do with our location in the dark topography of the Shoah and with the stages of a long and difficult reckoning – with our parents’ past and its deep impact on us; with our obligations to that past, and the conclusions we can derive from it for the present. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457481">2005</xref>: 28–29)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When applied to remembering, the synthesising work of the imagination creates the possibility of mutual recognition in time, of a common experience which can form the basis of a sense of community. In this sense belatedness, or coming after, is not the only temporal position of the children of Holocaust survivors. Commonality and community in time prevents their over-determination by their vertical inheritance. It is the experience of transmission, encompassing both continuity and change over time rather than the inherited past itself, that becomes the touchstone of second-generational experience. Memory is tempered by imagination as it allows the complex oscillations between connection and rupture with the past to be opened up to an ongoing mutual process of recognition in which the lacunae and aporia inherent in the condition of belatedness can be creatively explored.</p>
<p>As well as commonality and community with those who share a temporal position of post-ness in relation to the Holocaust, horizontal transmission involves a creative engagement between the experience of inheriting the Holocaust and other inherited pasts and mnemonic legacies. As Rothberg notes, reckoning with inherited pasts ‘will frequently, if not always require a multidirectional excavation of intersecting histories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549412457481">2009</xref>: 279). For example, Hoffman gives an extended account of her conversation with a survivor of the Rwandan genocide, in which his past as a survivor and her own position of belatedness as an inheritor of the Holocaust are brought into productive tension. Through the mnemonic imagination, they bring their experiences into confrontation with each other, raising questions about their own relationship with their past. For Hoffman this takes the form of questioning how she should respond to the distant pain of others. While it is ‘too tempting to become a receptacle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457481">2005</xref>: 159) for the pain of others, she recognises the ‘reparative urge’ as something significant in itself. At the same time, the Rwandan man talks of how he has benefited from his studies of the transmission of Holocaust memory. It has helped him to think through the ways in which the Rwandan genocide could be come to terms with, but at the same time he puzzles over critiques of Jewish memorialisation and, in recognising this, opens up his own space of critical reflection on Rwandan collective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549412457481">Hoffman, 2005</xref>). The link here between memory and creativity is, as Hartman notes, unpredictable or contingent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549412457481">1994</xref>: 19). However, in each case, what emerges are new ways of knowing the past, interpreting the present and orienting to the future. We imagine ways of relating to one another in time and through time while never losing sight of that which marks us out as both common and different, whether this is with reference to those previous generations whose pasts we inherit, or those who inherit different pasts in the present. It is these constellations of temporal community that provide the precondition for carrying forward into our futures the meanings that we have made from our firsthand and secondhand pasts. There is much at stake in this move. In a globalising world, the ‘ongoing reality of human exile and uprootedness has made communication across cultural boundaries a major issue of the new millennium’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549412457481">Apfelbaum, 2001</xref>: 20). Moving memory beyond a solely private, vertical mode of transmission is crucial if we are to avoid isolating mnemonic inheritances from one another. This can result in easy universalisations and reductive causal binaries through which only simplistic responses to other present and future crises can be formulated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367549412457481">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The transmission of memory is not a straightforward transfer of experiential cargo from one generation to another or between contemporaries; it is the process through which the pasts of others are heard. In hearing these pasts with sympathy and empathy, we may hope to integrate them into our own mnemonic narratives without compromising the integrity of their experience or our own in the process. This continual action of identification and recognition of difference is a precondition for generational communities of memory to emerge. While the combined action of imagination and memory encourages bringing different pasts into view of each other, this is a contingent and unstable process. The mnemonic imagination enables us to reposition our relations with other pasts in time and across time, but in a process that is continuous and provisional. The meaning of our inherited past as a constituent of our own is never fixed; our relations of connectedness and separateness can never be taken for granted. While this means that we are saddled with an inherent instability in our temporal relations both vertically and horizontally, and so are always at risk of existential fragmentation, it is precisely this contingency that keeps the past a live resource for action in the future, when new relations and meanings can be forged. Past experience derives from our own lives and from those who came before us in previous generations, and what we glean from both sources is reworked and resituated in an ever-changing present by the mnemonic imagination. It is in this manner that memory is actively shared.</p>
