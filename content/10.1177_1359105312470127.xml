<abstract>
<p>This article reports on participatory action and photo elicitation research conducted by community health workers and university-based researchers in post-Katrina New Orleans between August 2007 and 2010. It documents how 11 African American and Latina women community health workers forged ties and developed a model for responding to some of the personal, familial, and community effects of this “unnatural disaster.” We identify and analyze two of the health literacies they developed and deployed: (1) intragroup and intergroup empathy skills and (2) capacity to critically analyze structural causes of health inequities. We argue that the participatory processes and outcomes analyzed herein offer one possible model through which local communities and health workers can creatively respond to health disparities in post-disaster contexts.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article reports on a participatory action and photo elicitation research project developed collaboratively by “outsider” researchers and “insider” community health workers, during a time when the latter were responding to their own post-Katrina realities and rebuilding needs, as well as adapting to a changing population, organizational shifts, and variable resources in New Orleans between August 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>Much has been written about Katrina andthe post-Katrina sequelae, which enhanced rather than mitigated longstanding structural poverty and racism within the city of New Orleans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312470127">Bierria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312470127">Falk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312470127">Fletcher et al., 2007</xref>). The destruction ofmuch of the city affected microsystem, mesosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312470127">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>), challenging service providers—including primary health promoters—in particular ways as they sought their own and their families’ survival as well as to rebuild their communities. Two key sets of changes affecting health care among the many that have been described in the post-Katrina context include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105312470127" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- Dramatic shifts in the demographics of the city, in a context of persistently high levels of poverty, low numbers of insured, and high levels of crime;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- An influx of federal, state, and charitable funds in support of rebuilding efforts, including US$100m in federal grants specifically focused on primary health care in response to the devastation of local hospitals and of much of the health system.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Community health service agencies and organizations were in disarray from the upheaval of the events of late summer 2005, but quickly regrouped to begin to serve the needs of the remaining and returning population. However, organizations had the unique pressure to address the individual needs of their own staff, who were working to navigate services and stabilize their own lives. In this regard, the lines between service provider and service recipient were blurred and fluid; the recovery of the city required a more collective response from all who were there. Additionally, health service systems were overwhelmed by the challenges facing arriving linguistic and ethnic groups who came to the city for rebuilding-related employment. In August 2005, the greater New Orleans area was home to one of the lowest percentages of Latinos in the United States. The 2004 American Community Census report estimated the total population of Orleans Parish (the City of New Orleans) to be 444,515, with 3.2 percent (14,171) of these to be of Latino origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312470127">US Census Bureau, 2012</xref>). These percentages shifted radically in Katrina’s wake. From the 2000 to the 2010, the Latino population in the New Orleans metro area spiked 57 percent, a rate greater than the nation’s 43 percent growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312470127">Plyer, 2011</xref>). In order to respond to these seemingly overwhelming changes and challenges, community health organizations looked for ways to collaborate, sharing cultural knowledge, local expertise, and program resources.</p>
<p>This research was developed as one meso-level response to some of these challenges. Specifically, it sought to deploy a community-based participatory methodology in collaboration with historically rooted but displaced African American women and relatively recently arrived Latinas engaged in similar employment as health outreach workers in post-Katrina New Orleans. It was developed to document and build on individual recovery processes in hopes of strengthening responses to organizational upheaval and population changes. Through participatory and collaborative efforts, the project coresearchers sought to enhance participants’ well-being, visualize the critical but often unseen or undervalued knowledge of women community-based health promoters, and consolidate an emerging model of cross-community women’s leadership as one resource for responding to post-disaster contexts.</p>
<p>The authors draw on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312470127">Nutbeam’s (2008)</xref> broad concept of health literacy, which incorporates the definition from the World Health Organization’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312470127">1998</xref>) report, that is, “cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312470127">Nutbeam, 2008</xref>). Health in the context of a humanitarian disaster is broadly defined—and our focus here is, more specifically, on one dimension of health, that is, psychosocial well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312470127">Nelson and Prilleltensky, 2010</xref>). Thus, within that context, we elaborate our understanding of literacy from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312470127">Nutbeam’s (1999)</xref> “critical health literacy” and seek to clarify how the participants enhanced their abilities to critically analyze information through increased self- and other-awareness, and, based on these capacities and knowledge, participate in actions to address barriers to their own and their communities’ well-being. In the post-Katrina context, community health workers navigated a health system that was constantly adapting to the changes of a rebuilding city whose linguistic, racial, and ethnic composition was in flux. They were challenged to alternate between their own and their families’ restorative needs, their responsibilities to their communities as health workers, and their participation in the city’s overall recovery and transition/transformation.</p>

<title>Methodological resources</title>
<p>Community- and organization-based research activities, through which community residents and university-based researchers seek to analyze injustices and redress social inequalities, have been described variously as action research (AR), participatory research (PR), or participatory action research (PAR). The work described here drew on participatory and AR resources developed in Latin America, Africa, and Asia (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312470127">Fals-Borda, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312470127">Fals-Borda and Rahman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312470127">Freire, 1970</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312470127">Freire’s (1970)</xref> understanding of critical consciousness—that is, <italic>conscientização</italic> [conscientization]—deeply influenced these researchers and social change advocates who sought to create participatory processes that include and engage local knowledge systems in order to affect transformations in inequitable social relations and structures of power. They inform our use of Nutbeam’s critical health literacy and our understanding of PAR. Through PAR, coresearchers with indigenous or local knowledge who have been directly affected by an issue or problem (often called insiders, participants, and community members) <italic>and</italic> others with differing, sometimes technical, skills and formal knowledge and expertise (often called outsiders, researchers, facilitators, and catalysts) collaborate in iterative learning and teaching activities to systematize and construct knowledge, enhance consciousness, and engage in actions for change. The work developed in post-Katrina New Orleans drew on previous <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> work in disaster and post-disaster contexts and on strategies and theories from community psychology (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312470127">Lykes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312470127">Nelson and Prilleltensky, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> project described herein was collaboratively organized by community-based health promoters, organizationally based coordinators of these programs, and university-based researchers who together forged ties that are characteristic of much community-based and organizationally based PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312470127">Minkler and Wallerstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312470127">Reason and Bradbury, 2008</xref>). These relationships were important to and facilitative of engagement with creative techniques, participatory and AR, and photographic strategies through which the project took form.</p>
<sec id="section3-1359105312470127">
<title>Cross-community partnership and collaboration</title>
<p>Two organizations with longstanding roots in the city emerged as leaders in the recovery efforts: Kingsley House and Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans. As the country’s first settlement house and a longstanding site with resources supporting some of New Orleans’ most disenfranchised residents, Kingsley House offers a wide range of programming. Based on the Plain Talk (Hablando Claro) model developed by the Casey Foundation and grounded in the belief that talking clearly about health will improve access and education to health resources, the Kingsley House program recruited and trained community residents as Walkers Talkers, that is, community health workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312470127">Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2008</xref>). These workers walked the streets of their community and provided information to residents and assistance in enrolling them in entitlement programs available to them.</p>
<p>Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans is one of the largest NGOs in southeast Louisiana, both in terms of its revenue and in terms of the numbers of clients served annually. Prior to the storm, they cocreated the Latino Health Access Network, a program with the mission of improving primary medical care to uninsured and underinsured Latinos. Post-storm population shifts combined with increased funding for community health services contributed to this program’s growth from 1 to 4 employees by the summer of 2006. All were migrants, having come to New Orleans from Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador, and Puerto Rico. Thus, they were all bicultural, some were bilingual, and others were English language learners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105312470127">
<title>Separate but equal trajectories</title>
<p>When Latino families with limited English skills joined African Americans returning to Central City, the Walker Talkers recognized the limitations of their language skills that resulted in an inability to adequately respond to Spanish-speaking newcomers. Based on a prior relationship between the coordinators of the Walker Talker and Latino Health Access Network programs, who had met in graduate school, the organizations worked in the wake of the storm to form a partnership of “insiders.” This emerging partnership enabled the Walker Talkers to secure translation and assistance in outreach, education, and enrollment into the programs they coordinated.</p>
<p>The second author, a native of New Orleans and a community–cultural psychologist with experience of working with participatory and AR—and a fluent Spanish speaker—returned to New Orleans in the post-Katrina context to explore possible intersections between her previous work in conflict and post-conflict contexts and the realities confronting her home town. She spent several months networking in the African American and Latino communities, sharing her experiences and listening to the stories of local residents, workers, and activists. She met with the directors of Kingsley House and Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans and was introduced to the Latino Health Access Network supervisor.</p>
<p>In conversation, they explored how PAR and photovoice might enhance the programs’ resources and facilitate some of the program coordinators’ current objectives for exchanging program resources and documenting their work. The first author had an ongoing relationship with Latino Health Access Network as an academic and outreach volunteer and brought to the collaboration a history of working within New Orleans’ Spanish-speaking communities as well as an expertise with photography and cameras. Thus, these actors formed a collaboration that reflects the fluid and changing nature of insider–outsider dynamics in PAR. It took another year to raise the funds and for the collaboration to begin “on the ground.”</p>

<title>Participants, researchers, and developing a partnership</title>
<p>Collaboration in this project was negotiated at the institutional and individual levels (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312470127">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359105312470127">1</xref></sup> The organizations’ executive directors supported the project’s overall goals and delegated the negotiation of its details and funding to the community health promoter program coordinators. This support, “from the top,” was critical in ensuring an infrastructure for meetings, periodic support for meals, and, most importantly, the contribution of some of the participants’ paid work time to engage in the <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> process. Thus, participants’ time in training meetings was supported by their respective organizations, which donated one Friday a month for the participating staff and outside funding that paid US$100 per participant for the Saturday workshops. The time spent in taking pictures and interviewing those whose pictures they had taken (see the following) was “voluntary.” Agencies also provided some food to attendees, meeting space during the week, and weekend space for meetings with payment to a security guard.</p>

<p>PAR: participatory action research.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>After program coordinators—and agency directors—had “approved” the initiative and the project had been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Boston College, the coordinators recruited voluntary participants. These participants were community health workers from their programs who then collaborated as “insiders” with “outsider” university-based researchers in developing the project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105312470127">
<title>PAR and photography: selected strategies</title>
<p>In post-Katrina New Orleans, community health promoters sought to develop responses to everyday problems within the post-disaster context while also seeking to articulate strategies that might contribute to transforming social inequalities laid bare by Katrina, by facilitating and engaging in specific actions that contribute toward psychosocial well-being and a more just and equitable city. This project sought to generate knowledge and practice that is of genuine interest to all involved and, as suggested earlier, required “mutually dependent and cooperative relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312470127">Martin, 1996</xref>: 88). The PAR and photography research strategies emphasized the construction of local knowledge and the prioritizing of local voices. Simultaneously, these problem-posing resources presume that there is a “reality,” that is, a set of social structures and institutions that support and sustain an unequal distribution of resources, and through which power circulates in ways that facilitate and constrain all social relations.</p>
<p>The current project thus combined PAR with a series of photo documentation and elicitation strategies that had been elaborated by the second author in earlier work in contexts of war and post-conflict recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312470127">Lykes, 2001</xref>). The photography-based strategies were developed by Lykes with Maya women in rural Guatemala (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312470127">Lykes, 2001</xref>) through combining creative techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312470127">Lykes, 1994</xref>) and three photo-based research methods: (1) TEMAS, a psychologically robust photo elicitation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312470127">Costantino et al., 2001</xref>); (2) “talking pictures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312470127">Bunster and Chaney, 1989</xref>), a photo elicitation strategyusing a photography-based storyline to develop narratives of Peruvian market women; and (3) photovoice, a participatory photography methodology developed with rural Chinese women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312470127">Wang and Burris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312470127">Wang et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>These photography-based resources were combined with PAR strategies to create <italic>PhotoPAR</italic>, a methodology deployed in this research that integrated community-based PAR principles, participants’ documentary photography, visual elicitation techniques incorporating participants’ photographs and individual and small group analyses, and narrative interview methods. <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> offered a set of resources through which a small group of African American and Latina women documented and responded to a wide range of social inequalities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105312470127">
<title>Workshop composition and methods</title>
<p>Drawing on these methodological resources and the partnerships described, we designeda series of participatory training workshops through which the coresearchers could deepen developing relationships and enhance research skills. The <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> collaboration included individual picture-taking and storytelling as well as periodic workshops during which participants (1) developed skills; (2) selected from among hundreds of individual photographs and stories and developed group analyses; (3) made collective decisions about the organizational aspects of the project; and (4) developed ideas for future actions based on the analyses and local interventions focused on working with communities in post-Katrina reconstruction.</p>
<p>Two-day training workshops were conducted monthly for the first 6 months of the project (March–August). They focused on developing a shared research agenda, building research skills, teaching photographic and research ethics and data collection strategies, and increasing self-efficacy among the participants. Participants in these workshops included the 11 insider and outsider coresearchers, as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312470127">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The group developed and agreed upon shared guidelines for participation. These were posted to the wall, along with other notes taken during the workshops, and were reposted in subsequent sessions to guide reflection when disagreements arose. The guidelines summarized the standards for how we would discuss personal and sensitive matters and articulated our goals of achieving and sustaining inclusivity and respect in a context of recognizing diversities within the group. These guidelines were critical to developing a context in which each could develop literacies despite widely divergent educational levels and life experiences.</p>
<p>Field notes and workshop minutes provided ongoing documentation of our group processes. University-based researchers took responsibility for designing the initial workshop format, serving as scribes for the workshops, and facilitating the ongoing work of the <italic>Promotoras</italic> and Walker Talkers as they entered communities to take pictures, and so on. Field notes and workshop minutes were edited based on member checks with participants and approved at subsequent meetings, thereby constituting a record of the work and serving as “data” for our shared research.</p>
<p>The workshops were a teaching–learning environment consonant with participatory and AR processes. Therefore, we sought to engage in activities through which the seven community health promoters could enhance skills and initiate processes of data collection and analysis (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312470127">Women of PhotoVoice/ADMI and Lykes, 2000</xref>). Early meetings focused on identifying a shared research question/focus, self and group exploration, and rapport building among all coresearchers. Subsequent meetings explored ways of knowing, the construction of knowledge, and the ethics of photography and storytelling. Pedagogical resources included group exercises with collective drawing, storytelling, role-playing, and dramatic play, that is, embodied “picture building.” This dynamic teaching–learning process sought to engage us in participatory activities organized along three axes: corporal expression, including role-playing or dramatic play, theater, and dramatic multiplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312470127">Pavlovsky et al., 1985</xref>); all forms of physical creativity “outside of ourselves,” including drawings, models made with newspapers or other materials, and collages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312470127">Butler-Kisber and Poldma, 2010</xref>); and verbal techniques that involve playing with words in ways that reveal the liberating character oflanguage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312470127">Rodari, 1996</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312470127">Zipes, 1995</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312470127">Goudvis, 1991</xref>, for a discussion of the intersection and application of these techniques), as well as narratives, storytelling, and description and analysis of previously presented work and photographs.</p>
<p>The primary data were generated by the seven Walkers Talkers and <italic>Promotoras</italic> and included “taking pictures” and “telling stories” that were based on interviews with those whose pictures they took as well as their coconstruction of what they had seen and sought to represent, that is, <italic>phototexts</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312470127">Lykes, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312470127">2010</xref>, for details). Each community health promoter was given a basic digital camera. In initial workshops, we practiced using the cameras, role-played ethical dilemmas in “taking pictures,” and discussed the strengths and limitations of formal versus spontaneous photography. Photographs focused on themes that we had identified through participatory exercises during previous workshops. Digital photographs were uploaded to a secure project website and each photographer picked 4–6 pictures that she “liked,” or that she thought “best represented the month’s theme” and recounted an individual story based on her interviews and/or field experiences with those photographed. The health promoters photographed each other in a range of work contexts including door-to-door home visits, community clinic workshops, and church-based food distribution programs. Some took pictures of the material environment including specific storm-related effects and evidence of “unhealthy everyday challenges” including violence, alcohol, junk food, and so on. Many photographers interviewed those whose pictures they took to develop a better understanding of the context being represented. The stories they told each other in subsequent workshops ranged from verbatim accounts of what the pictured person had recounted to the photographer’s story about taking the picture or her memories of “similar” experiences that she had depicted in the photograph. These stories were transcribed and yoked to the relevant picture that was printed out, constituting a <italic>phototext</italic>.</p>
<p>One of the authors facilitated workshops wherein participants selected <italic>phototexts</italic> and divided into small groups who developed a second level of analysis through a photo elicitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312470127">Grady, 2008</xref>). Specifically, an individually developed <italic>phototext</italic> (an individual story yoked to an individual photograph) was presented to a small group of 3–5 African American and Latina health promoters to elicit their ideas. Thematic categories, drawn from the previous <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> experiences and practiced by these participants in analyzing their dramatic play activities, included the identification and coding of the (1) context, (2) people, (3) actions, (4) expressed (or interpreted) feelings and thoughts, and (5) causes or explanations for events reflected in the <italic>phototext</italic> and derived in group discussion. Finally, participants in the small groups shared their hopes or wishes for the future. The original <italic>phototext</italic> and discussions transcribed from these small group photo elicitation and discussion processes were the core of the final collective <italic>photonarratives</italic> from which a subset was selected and organized on larger banners for community exhibits.</p>
<p>Through seeking permission, taking pictures of and then interviewing those photographed—including coparticipants and community members—and then storying these photographs, the participants documented many of their own and their communities’ Katrina and post-Katrina stories in their own words and images, enhancing local understandings of this “unnatural disaster” and its ravages as well as uncovering some of the many creative responses by community-based health promoters to Katrina. Thus, this yearlong process included 6 months of bimonthly “training” workshops, followed by additional workshops for iterative analyses of the <italic>phototexts</italic> generated in the “training” workshops, and the generation of community stories that were later incorporated into acommunity exhibit of <italic>photonarratives</italic>. Project coordinators participated alongside the community health promoters during the workshops but all pictures, <italic>phototexts</italic>, and <italic>photonarratives</italic> were generated by the seven community health promoters.</p>

<title>Additional research and reflection strategies</title>
<p>As indicated earlier, in addition to the photographs and notes from interviews with those photographed (as reported by the photographer), the data included field notes, workshop notes, photographs of and reflections on workshop exercises, collective drawings, and collages. Upon concluding the training and photo collection phases of the project—and after participants had made several public presentations of the exhibit to their colleagues including community peers, supervisors, and friends and family—the first author interviewed all coresearchers. These interviews were designed to better understand individual participants’ experiences in the project and their perceptions of the impact the project had on them personally and professionally. A graduate research assistant transcribed the interviews.</p>
<p>Using thematic coding informed by grounded theory methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312470127">Charmaz, 2006</xref>), the university-based researchers analyzed the text-based data described earlier, identifying core themes including areas of professional growth, capacity building, and health literacies as revealed through the participants’ storytelling and workshop participation as well as through their interviews. These analyses were presented back to a subgroup of participants for member checking and discussion. In the following, we report selected themes andstories that exemplify this <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> process and knowledge constructed through the methodologies described earlier.</p>

<sec id="section9-1359105312470127">
<title><italic>PhotoPAR</italic> findings: developing critical health literacies</title>
<p>The processes described earlier created opportunities for constructing knowledge “from the bottom up,” generating “findings” that have been presented to local communities and informed community-based health promotion in the post-Katrina context. In the following, we present the data and discuss selected “critical health literacies,” that is, skills and resources deployed and developed in responding to participants’ and their communities’ needs. These include (1) cross-cultural awareness and empathy and (2) mastery of skills and capacities that facilitated critical analyses of structural inequalities and selected responses to them.</p>
<sec id="section10-1359105312470127">
<title>Cross-cultural awareness and empathy</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, collaborative working styles, including group analyses of personal photographs, collective drawings, dramatic play, role-playing, and collective storytelling, were engaged as resources to both build trust and familiarity among the participants, and to provide a foundation for critical and reflexive analysis of health needs and challenges post-Katrina. In the practice of these collaborative exercises, participants made a variety of personal discoveries. These occurred organically, as participants identified their fears about participating in a research group (e.g. about using and being responsible for camera equipment, about adequately completing tasks of taking photographs and gathering stories) and then learned to support each other as they gained mastery in those areas.</p>
<p>For example, R.S., a <italic>Promotora</italic>, described her initial reaction to the project:
<disp-quote>
<p>To me [the project] was kind of crazy … [it was crazy] thinking that I could do that. I mean, I had no clue what we were going to get into. It was like something new, that I never, never thought [I could do]. I didn’t even know how to handle a camera myself!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>D.E., a Walker Talker, described similar feelings of anxiety:
<disp-quote>
<p>But I was nervous [about] taking the pictures because I just didn’t really know how to operate a digital camera, [and] I kind of struggle with my writing skills. I think I have gotten better, but at that time [when we began] I was kind of self-conscious about my writing skills, because I don’t always use proper grammar.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To address and overcome these anxieties, initial workshops tapped into the program coordinators’ eagerness to create a process through which the “voices” of community health workers could be heard. S.L., director of the <italic>Promotora</italic> program, explained how community health workers are critically important in New Orleans but that few know of their work or expertise: “Nobody brings out your voice,” she said to her team. L.F., director of the Walker Talker program, shared this view. Furthermore, she explained that this project was, “an opportunity for you [her staff of CHWs] to take,” that is, to develop expertise, in order to show others the importance of their work in the context of post-Katrina New Orleans.</p>
<p>L.K., a Walker Talker, described some uncertainty vis-a-vis the project’s relation to hurricane Katrina. Despite this, she felt compelled to use the opportunity as a resource to explore post-hurricane events:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I first heard that it was going to be about hurricane Katrina … you know, I had never expressed the way I felt about it, so I was thinking that this would give me a great opportunity to do that for myself and others.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, community health workers expressed a strong need to document and story the realities of post-Katrina New Orleans in terms of both their personal and professional challenges and transitions. As we worked on this project, some participants were living with family and friends waiting for housing to become available, while others occupied spaces under renovation. Those with children frequently discussed school opportunities, which changed regularly as different charter systems began to open in the city. Family and friends who were displaced were in and out of town for visits, with concerns about whether they could return. While the participants themselves were living in the city and were working paid jobs, all were actively engaged in the ongoing disruptions of creating a new sense of “normal” in the recovering and rebuilding city.</p>
<p>The project was an opportunity for participants to share and reflect upon personal experiences. Initial discoveries were autobiographical with participants’ learning more about each other. For example, B.T., a Walker Talker, described how seeing photographs from the <italic>Promotoras</italic> introduced her to their immigration stories, experiences that they would not have otherwise shared:
<disp-quote>
<p>Miss H. did the family photo. [We had not known] that her husband passed [and would have been scared to ask more]. [I was surprised that they] managed to take family pictures … So, I mean if we never came together as one [in] this photovoice we would never have known.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>M.R., a Walker Talker, shared similar feelings about how working collectively facilitated interpersonal exchanges that, in turn, created strong foundations for familiarity and collegial respect.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When we got in the groups and we did the collective stories, I really enjoyed that because it helped us to build better relationships with the <italic>Promotoras</italic>. Also it just, it was fun, working together as community health workers for one purpose … We laughed, we discussed what we were writing, we discussed different reasons different reasonings, you know, we had different discussions that helped me to learn about them as well as help them to learn about me. So I appreciate that experience, because before, we would just go to events and see each other and smile and hug each other like “always good to see you” but we never really got to know the person, the people who they really were.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>L.K., a Walker Talker, expressed a similar response:
<disp-quote>
<p>You know I always enjoyed in our workshops the part where we would come in and talk about, I guess, growing up and I always enjoyed listening to R., H., and J.’s stories about growing up in Honduras, Puerto Rico and Guatemala even L.S., growing up in Colombia, and just listening to, you know, stories about their culture and about their way of life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With stronger personal and cultural awareness of each other, the participants began to share their unique post-Katrina challenges and discover the similarities in the experiences each was having despite differences in language, culture, nationality, and so on. Building on these collaborative workshops, we decided that coresearchers would shadow each other in their jobs for the purposes of documenting each others’ work through pictures and stories from each others’ communities and professional experiences. This shadowing experience is routinely described by the community health workers and program coordinators as the “favorite” aspect of the project.</p>
<p>A <italic>Promotora</italic>, J.F., described the cultural exchange that occurred during the shadowing exercise, and the opportunity that it brought to all involved when they came across a Latino in the African American community:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I went with them to walk and they saw a [Latino] man they didn’t [know]. … they talked to him, too … one of them took a picture. I think, that, I think, there’s a lot of misconceptions, and that was a good opportunity. They got to know a little bit about our culture and the food and stuff, because we ended up, you know, talking about different things. So I think they learned and we learned, too. But working together, I think it made a big, big, big difference.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The success of the shadowing exercise was due in part to the workshop space having created a foundation for shared knowledge creation, cultural respect, and familiarity. This then allowed the participants to engage more comfortably in situations where they did not speak the language, were new to the community, and/or were seeing community outreach work being done in a completely new way.</p>
<p>The Central City neighborhood is one of the most dangerous in New Orleans. It is also the location in which most of the Walkers Talkers had grown up and/or are currently raising their families. When working there during the shadowing process, the teams were advised by police not to go down certain streets due to recent violence. This experience was embraced as an opportunity by the teams who were able to offer each other social and professional support and to gain a deeper appreciation for the unique challenges of each community within the rebuilding process.</p>
<p>R.S., one of the <italic>Promotoras</italic>, described the experience of seeing parts of Central City with the Walkers Talkers:
<disp-quote>
<p>So it was like a discovery for me, you know? When I went to some street, like Banks Street, that I saw how many houses, closed houses still in New Orleans, how abandoned were some part[s] of the city, even in the very downtown, like Jefferson Davis and Banks Street, that it is just downtown, you know? So for me [it] was like a, wake-up. Like: Wake-up, R.S.! Man, [it] is tremendous, the job that had to be, [that] needs to be done here, you know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the <italic>Promotoras</italic> recounted that the challenges of immigration status created greater vulnerabilities for local Latinos and made outreach among the African American community “simpler” and more “straight forward.” Seeing the danger inherent in door-to-door outreach in Central City helped bridge a more meaningful understanding of the dangers in the African American community and of the ways in which the Walkers Talkers serve as visible signs to the community of recovery, safety, and hope for those in need.</p>
<p>H.D., a <italic>Promotora</italic>, describes:
<disp-quote>
<p>[What] caught my attention [in shadowing] [was seeing] how people [are] in need, you know, of so many services [including] health care. Then I learned that the Walker/Talkers [are actually] touching, knocking [on] doors. [This] is a very important job, and is very risky sometimes. But [there] is reward, because behind those doors [are] a lot of people who [are] in need for diverse reasons. Maybe they can’t come out, or they don’t look for the services. But it was, it was very touching for me [to see] what they do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The shadowing experience helped the community health promoters appreciate the challenges in each community outreach program and develop empathy for each other. Through these experiences, they found similar health challenges within and across their different communities. L.K., a Walker Talker, affirmed that:
<disp-quote>
<p>I learned that, you know, I think, that we’re similar in a lot of different ways and I think that we’re all affected in some way or other by a lot of the same issues, although how it may affect one community and another may be a little different.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This nuanced appreciation for the subtleties of similarities and differences is critical to situate oneself while simultaneously being able to build coalitions with others who are “different” from me—resources sorely missing in many urban US communities including pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans. Moreover, as they observed how each others’ communities were engaging in this process, they found that the African American neighborhoods were being rebuilt largely by the efforts of newly arrived Latino families. Finally, these exchanges enhanced health promotion among newly arrived Spanish speakers by introducing the <italic>Promotoras</italic> to those among their community living within what were traditionally African American communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1359105312470127">
<title>Recognizing and responding to structural constraints on health and well-being</title>
<p>Each group identified many everyday health concerns, which lead to group recognition and identification of structural differences in their communities that contributed to the health challenges they worked toward addressing. In generating one of the project’s “collective stories” to be presented back to participating communities, the coresearchers chose a collection of stories and photographs organized around the themeof “Promoting a Healthy Lifestyle.” They discussed how in both the African American and Latina communities, their challenge is to promote good health practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105312470127">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The similarities in their lived experience and post-storm recoveries were further explored in relation to the individuals they photographed and interviewed. Mastering documentation skills meant first studying themselves reflexively, then each other, and then venturing out to photograph and interview, that is, “identify and study” members of their own and each other’s community. As they did this, they began to recognize and identify varying levels of health awareness and of health disparities. For example, in photographs of their community environments, both groups focused on billboards advertising fast food and alcohol, which they identified as challenges to their efforts to improve healthy eating and living within their communities. The shared discovery of the disconnect between the positive messages in their work as health promoters and the unhealthy messages promoted by advertisers and big business lead the group to critically interrogate why these billboards were in their neighborhoods, and not in wealthier or whiter areas of the city. They drafted individual and collective stories about this issue, illustrating awareness of the structural inequities that negatively influence health in their communities. One example follows wherein a <italic>Promotora</italic> interviews a Walker Talker about a billboard advertising fast food sandwiches near the home where she grew up:
<disp-quote>
<p>Question 1: As a person who used to live a few blocks away from these billboards, how does it make you feel to have to look at these in your neighborhood?</p>
<p>These [fast food] ads don’t have anything positive. The 2 for $4 fish sandwich—I would rather see a healthier sandwich. I think instead of advertising this they should advertise Ms. Janie’s services and other agencies, nurseries and other things to help people.</p>
<p>Question 2: Is healthy/nutritious food available or advertised in this area?</p>
<p>No, because when you drive around, you don’t see it. Our people are not pushing the issue. Some people may feel like no one cares about them or [about] advertising healthy things.</p>
<p>… I see plenty of signs at the corner stores for liquor, beer, cigarettes, ice, and unhealthy foods. People don’t know to eat healthy foods where they are. If you don’t know, then how will people show concern? Growing up you were told to eat three hot meals a day [but] you weren’t taught about healthy eating.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the iterative processes described earlier, our analysis of the interview data revealed that for some participants, self-awareness emerged only at the end of the project when the group’s <italic>photonarratives</italic> were visually exhibited on banners and presented to a wider public.</p>
<p>J.F., a <italic>Promotora</italic>, describes her early uncertainty about the workshop exercises:
<disp-quote>
<p>I did learn a lot. But [not] until the very end when you put all these pictures together, it’s when you really say; wow, there was a purpose, for all this, which at the beginning, you don’t really understand. At least I didn’t. You know? I know that it had to do with pictures and story and Katrina, … [but] until you go to the seminar and talk [about the project] … until you see the [entire] project … Is when you realize, wow, people can do these things. And I can do it, too. It was nice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, for some, it was through the performance of their “findings” and the multiple interpretations of their <italic>photonarratives</italic> within their organizations, before professionals at conferences, and to New Orleans residents at community markets and festivals that they recognized what they had learned about cross-community collaboration and shared knowledge construction. The audiences with whom they dialogued generated new spaces for recognizing some of the multiple contributions they were making as community health workers in post-Katrina New Orleans—and the particular contributions they could make as women crossing communities to work together. One Walker Talker described her hopes for the knowledge generated through this <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> process in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>I hope that [those who see the exhibit] learn that, I guess, the work that we are doing as community health workers has had a huge impact on helping people … in the community recovery after the hurricane … I hope that they can see that there is a group of people out here … that there is work that’s being done across communities to try to learn from each other. I hope that they can read the stories and see some of the issues that people are being affected by in both the African American and the Hispanic community and that it’ll open their eyes to some of those things. But that they also see that there are people that are out there that are trying to get people the resources that they need to be more self-sufficient … [and see] that community health workers [are] a valuable part of the community and … of the public health and social work fields and … how there’s a model here, a group of people who are doing this work successfully and it works, so ideally, to maybe, you know, to, for people to want to work with us and want to support us and what we’re doing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In describing the project to one of her social work classes, one of the Walkers Talkers noted that she had:
<disp-quote>
<p>… explained how, in the African American communities, you see the negative billboards and unhealthy eating, but it is different in the other communities when it comes to their billboards.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps more useful in terms of health literacy was her moving from the descriptive recognition of “difference” to an analysis of similar struggles within seemingly different cultural contexts—and a more nuanced perception of individual differences in the face of structural inequalities. She reported that she had:
<disp-quote>
<p>… learned that people are really struggling and need help to get them on their feet … [and] that a lot of people want handouts and are not really trying to better themselves. I also know that many of them are trying to better themselves, but there are not enough jobs or there is little to no assistance to help people in their communities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the participants developed and demonstrated critical awareness of some of the multiple systems impacting health in their communities at the individual, community, and societal levels—thus enhancing their health literacy, that is, their capacities to describe and then critically analyze both the effects and the causes of illness locally and within cross-community contexts.</p>

<sec id="section12-1359105312470127" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through creatively voicing their concerns and understandings—through images, storytelling, and critical analyses—women recognized themselves and were recognized by others as knowledge producers and contributors to responding to post-disaster challenges. As importantly, the combined methodologies drawing on PAR and photography-based documentation and elicitation strategies enabled local African American and Latina women who work as community-based health promoters to tell their individual and collective story—and that of post-Katrina recovery—in their “own voices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312470127">Belenky et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>This study is similar to, but distinctive from, a wide range of arts-based programs developed in the post-Katrina context. Specifically, REACH NOLA, an organization founded to address the needs of the Central City community post-Katrina, partnered with filmmakers and academics in a method called “videovoice.” Videovoice builds off of photovoice and participatory media as an advocacy tool. REACH NOLA used videovoice as an advocacy tool to increase awareness of the needs of the Central City community within the city planning commission’s rebuilding of the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312470127">Catalani et al., 2012</xref>). The videovoice project worked specifically to create media in order to reach and influence local government officials. Although similar in their goals of responding to the effects of this “unnatural disaster,” this study differs fundamentally from the <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> project reported here in that the latter focused on building individual and shared leadership, self- and group exploration, and new knowledge related to the contributions of community health workers during the post-Katrina recovery process.</p>
<p>One of the clear challenges of working with local community residents in a post-disaster context is that they are both providers and recipients of relief. This project was thus layered with both personal stories of recovery and rebuilding and, over time, a shared knowledge of those seeking help. Working at this interface is not infrequent in contexts of disasters yet requires a double discourse or literacy. Coresearchers embraced <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> and photographic documentation and elicitation resources as a set of individual and small group strategies that would facilitate collaborative work to respond to the dance of being a survivor as well as a responder to post-Katrina realities. Documentation of and critical reflection on individual and community experiences in the post-Katrina context through images (photos and drawings), dramatic play, and storytelling (listening, interviewing, and writing) constituted this <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> project that elucidated participants’ emerging critical health literacies and a participatory community-based model for post-disaster community-based health promotion. This project thus provides one example of how a small cross-community group of African American and Latina women developed and performed critical health praxis.</p>
<p>Despite its many successes, the work was not without its challenges. First, it had a small number of participants within a very particular context, thus limiting its generalizability. Second, some women found sustaining the rhythm of data collection and analysis over several years exceptionally challenging. Third, as resources for post-Katrina work waned—and the New Orleans and southern coastal Louisiana area experienced a second unnatural disaster in the BP oil spill—the work of the promoters was shifted away from Central City to areas directly affected by the oil spill. Fourth, with their enhanced skills and, for some, completion of college degrees, several of the participants as well as one of the coordinators moved on to other work contexts. Despite these challenges and limitations, the <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> collaboration leaves a legacy of how local women health promoters in post-Katrina New Orleans negotiated their personal and work-based healing in the wake of an unnatural disaster and humanitarian crisis while enhancing critical health literacies.</p>

<sec id="section13-1359105312470127" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> methodology described herein was a resource for crafting and a site for performing one model of women’s cross-community health promotion. The work described here suggests ways in which local women who are leaders within their communities collaborated within and across ethnic, racial, and linguistic diversities to document and critically analyze their own and their communities’ experiences of a humanitarian disaster and post-disaster challenges. One participant described cross-community women’s leadership as:
<disp-quote>
<p>… women of different cultures [coming] together to learn what was happening in each other’s culture and bec[oming] a voice and leader, not only for their community, but for the culture of the other community as well. The unique perspective was the fact that we were all able to get along and put aside our differences. This is not a norm when a group of women get together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to participants increasing self-knowledge and empathy, they also enhanced their capacity to self-care and sustain the challenging work of responding to their own post-disaster needs. Moreover, the exhibit created audiences where the voices of a small group of women who have been living and working “in the shadows” could be heard by wider circles of people. One participant described the success—and the ongoing challenge—of the project in this way:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think we achieved the goal of telling the stories of our communities post-Katrina. When people look at the work that we have done, they don’t just look at it, they comment and read each and every story that is displayed. We have gotten the attention of some of the people we wanted to, but so many more are still out there that need to read the stories. When we show the project or do a presentation it gives the people who are looking at the pictures or listening to the presentation a better view of what is going on in New Orleans post-Katrina.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, during the <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> processes and in the multiple presentations of their work, the community-based health workers documented and critically analyzed structural inequalities due to impoverishment and racism. As significantly, they recognized class-based similarities despite ethnic, racial, and linguistic differences among themselves and in their communities, forging solidarity within a city that all too frequently evidences fractures and conflict along these lines. This <italic>PhotoPAR</italic> process and its products provide an emerging model that threads documentation, photo elicitation, and participatory and AR strategies toward participants’ and coresearchers’ generation of restorative processes and community actions toward collaborative social change work with local survivors in a post-disaster setting.</p>
