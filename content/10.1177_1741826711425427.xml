<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Several studies suggested that exercise training might improve myocardial perfusion by inducing coronary vascular adaptations or enhancing collateralization. However, these findings were obtained in patients with chronic coronary artery disease using thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. We evaluated whether a long-term exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) started early (9 ± 3 days) after ST elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) improves myocardial perfusion and left ventricular (LV) function, evaluated by gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Randomized controlled study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty patients with recent STEMI were randomized into two groups: 24 enrolled in a 6-month exercise-based CR programme (group T) and 26 discharged with generic instructions for maintaining physical activity and correct lifestyle (group C). All patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise test and gated SPECT within 3 weeks after STEMI and at 6-month follow up.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> At follow up, group T showed a significant reduction of stress-induced ischaemia (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and an improvement in resting and post-stress wall motion (both <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) and resting (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and post-stress wall thickness (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) score indexes. At follow up, group T showed an improvement in peak oxygen consumption (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), O<sub>2</sub> pulse (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and in the slope of increase in ventilation over carbon dioxide output (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). No changes in myocardial perfusion parameters, LV function, and cardiopulmonary indexes were observed in group C at follow up.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Six months of exercise training early after STEMI reduces stress-induced ischaemia and improves LV wall motion and thickness. Exercise-induced changes in myocardial perfusion and function were associated with the absence of unfavourable LV remodelling and with the improvement of cardiovascular functional capacity.</p>

<p>Exercise training, whether isolated or within a structured cardiac rehabilitation programme, has several beneficial effects after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), reducing long-term morbidity and mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711425427">1</xref></sup> preventing cardiac remodelling,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711425427">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425427">4</xref></sup> and improving cardiovascular functional capacity, cardiac symptoms, and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711425427">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711425427">6</xref></sup> The mechanisms by which exercise training might exert its beneficial effects in post-infarction patients are probably multifactorial and have been usually attributed to either improvement of endothelial function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711425427">7</xref></sup> reduced inflammation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711425427">8</xref></sup> and improved neurohormonal and autonomic balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711425427">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711425427">10</xref></sup> Several observations, both in experimental setting and in humans, have also shown that exercise training may improve myocardial perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711425427">11</xref></sup> by inducing coronary vascular adaptations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711425427">12</xref></sup> or enhancing collateralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711425427">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711425427">17</xref></sup> The majority of these observations, however, were obtained in patients with chronic coronary artery disease using thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. It is still uncertain whether an early exercise training might favourably affect myocardial perfusion in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after AMI, thus possibly influencing LV remodelling and function and clinical outcome. Cardiac imaging with gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has an established role in the evaluation of myocardial perfusion and analysis of LV function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711425427">18</xref></sup> The present study was designed to assess the effects of a long-term exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation initiated early after ST-elevation AMI (STEMI) on myocardial perfusion, as evaluated by gated SPECT imaging, and its association with the evolution of LV function and cardiovascular functional capacity.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1741826711425427"><title>Study population</title>
<p>From October 2008 to January 2009, 85 consecutive patients admitted to our cardiac care unit with a diagnosis of immediately after acute STEMI diagnosed according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711425427">19</xref></sup> (typical symptoms suggestive of an acute MI within 24 hours of presentation and with ≥1 mm ST-segment elevation in two contiguous leads on electrocardiogram) and undergone an invasive procedure with primary or rescue percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were screened for the inclusion into the study protocol. Exclusion criteria were: body mass index &gt;30 and &lt;18 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; residual myocardial ischaemia (prerandomization persistence or recurrence of angina and/or new ST segment depression/elevation &gt;1 mm in any lead); severe ventricular arrhythmias; II or III degree atrioventricular block; valvular disease requiring surgery; pericarditis; severe renal dysfunction (i.e. creatinine plasma levels &gt;2.5 mg/dl); severe concomitant noncardiac diseases such as cancer; liver dysfunction (alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase level &gt;1.5 times the upper normal limit); dementia; any systemic disease limiting exercise; inability to participate in a prospective study for any logistic reason. After exclusions, the remaining 50 patients were enrolled into the study protocol. Demographic, clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics of the study population are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711425427">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711425427">2</xref>. Thirteen patients were admitted to our catheterization unit with a diagnosis of STEMI within 2 hours from the symptom onset and underwent primary PTCA with placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES) on the culprit vessel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711425427">Table 2</xref>). Culprit vessel in this group was the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in nine patients (69.2%), the right coronary artery (RCA) in three patients (23.1%), and the circumflex artery (Cx) in one patient (7.7%). The remaining patients (37 patients) received systemic thrombolysis in a nearby community hospital that resulted unsuccessful (less than 50% ST segment resolution or persisting angina 60–90 min after the administration of fibrinolytic therapy, with or without haemodynamic deterioration), and were therefore immediately transferred to our university hospital to undergo rescue PTCA of the culprit vessel (performed within 6 hours from unsuccessful thrombolysis) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711425427">Table 2</xref>). Culprit vessel in the latter group was the LAD in 22 patients (59.5%), the RCA in 12 patients (32.4%), and the Cx in three patients (8.1%). A DES was placed in the culprit vessel in 27/37 patients undergoing rescue PTCA (73%). Both primary and rescue PTCA patients received a pre-PTCA loading dose of clopidogrel (300 mg), in addition to a dose of 300 mg of aspirin. Twenty-seven of the 37 failed thrombolysis patients received in the course of rescue PTCA i.v. glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist (abciximab). Post-treatment Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 was achieved in 40 out of 50 (80%) of patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711425427">Table 2</xref>). PTCA was successfully completed in all patients. After randomization, all patients completed the study protocol. All investigations were completed under the same conditions both at baseline and at follow up. The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and our institutional ethical committee the approved protocol. The purpose of the protocol was explained to the patients and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before inclusion.

<p>After a mean of 4 ± 2 days, and following routine clinical and diagnostic evaluation (12-lead electrocardiogram, Doppler-echocardiography), all patients were discharged in stable clinical conditions and on routine post-AMI medications. At hospital discharge, patients were randomly subdivided into two groups: 24 patients were enrolled in a 6-month exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programme (group T) performed on hospital outpatient basis. This started at a mean of 5 ± 2 days after discharge. The remaining 26 patients were discharged only with generic instructions for maintaining physical activity and a correct lifestyle (group C). Both groups underwent a baseline symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test (within 3 weeks after AMI), and stress cardiac SPECT imaging (within 1 week after AMI). Beta-blocking medications were withheld for 48 hours and long-acting nitrates for 12 hours before SPECT imaging and patients were instructed not to consume products containing caffeine for 24 hours before the test. After 6 months, all patients underwent a follow-up assessment by symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test and stress cardiac SPECT imaging.</p>

<p>All patients underwent incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. After 1-min warm-up period at 0 Watts workload, a ramp protocol of 15 W/min was started and continued until exhaustion. The pedalling was kept constant at 55–65 revolutions/min. Respiratory gas exchange measurements were obtained breath-by-breath with use of a computerized metabolic cart (Vmax 29 C, Sensormedics, Yorba Linda, CA) as previously described in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711425427">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425427">4</xref></sup> The ventilation (VE) versus carbon dioxide (VCO<sub>2</sub>) relationship was measured by plotting VE against VCO<sub>2</sub> obtained every 10 seconds of exercise (VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope): both VE and VCO<sub>2</sub> were measured in litres/min. The VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope was calculated as a linear regression function, excluding the nonlinear part of the relationship after the onset of acidotic drive to ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711425427">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711425427">4</xref></sup> The same physician who was blinded to the patient assignment and unaware of the results of gated SPECT studies performed all cardiopulmonary exercise tests.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1741826711425427"><title>Gated SPECT imaging</title>
<p>Gated SPECT studies were acquired and processed according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine and European Society of Cardiology guidelines using single-day stress/rest technetium-99 m sestamibi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711425427">20</xref></sup> and a dual head rotating gamma camera (E.CAM; Siemens Medical Systems, Hoffman Estates, IL) equipped with a low-energy, high-resolution collimator and connected with a dedicated computer system. Imaging was started 60 min after the tracer injection at rest and 30 min after pharmacological stress with dipyridamole (0.142 mg/kg/min intravenous over 4 min). Identical doses of the tracer were used for the baseline and follow-up studies. All raw data of gated SPECT images (two sets per patient) were reconstructed using standard back-projection and identical filtering (Butterworth filter with a critical frequency of 0.4 cycles/s, order 5). Motion correction was applied before image reconstruction if &gt;1 pixel of x or y axis deviation was observed over the 180° acquisition. No attenuation correction was used.</p>
<p>Quantitative SPECT was performed using a previously validated automated program (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA) that determines the extent and severity of LV perfusion defect size and the extent of reversible (ischaemia) or fixed (scar) perfusion defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711425427">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711425427">22</xref></sup> The automated program was used to derive the summed stress score, summed rest score, and summed difference score based on conventional 17-segment model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711425427">23</xref></sup> The program assigned a score of 0–4 to each segment based on activity level: 0 = normal and 4 = absent. The summed stress score is obtained by adding the scores of the 17 segments of the stress images. A similar procedure is applied to the resting images to calculate the summed rest score. The summed difference score represents the difference between the stress and rest scores and is taken to be an index of ischaemic burden. These indices were converted to percentage of the total myocardium (% myocardium) involved with stress and ischaemic or fixed defects by dividing the summed scores by 68 (the maximum potential score, 4 × 17) and multiplying by 100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711425427">24</xref></sup> In addition to perfusion data, the LV ejection fraction, wall motion score index, wall thickening score index, end-diastolic volume, and end-systolic volume were measured from the gated SPECT as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711425427">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711425427">22</xref></sup> All data reported are based on automated analysis of the data. Two independent observers who were unaware of the patient’s clinical data and group assignment interpreted all studies. Discordance in the evaluation was resolved via a consensus with a third observer. The intra-observer and inter-observer concordances (98% and 96%, respectively) for SPECT studies have been previously assessed in our laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711425427">25</xref></sup> At the conclusion of the protocol, the images were again interpreted side by side in a blinded fashion by one reader to qualitatively grade the perfusion pattern as improved, worsened, or no change.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1741826711425427"><title>Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programme</title>
<p>The cardiac rehabilitation programme was a multicomprehensive intervention based on an exercise training protocol followed by the enrolled patients on hospital outpatient-based regimen three times/week. Training sessions were performed under continuous electrocardiographic monitoring and were supervised by a cardiologist and a graduate nurse. Each session was preceded by a 5-min warming-up and followed by a 5-min cooling-down. Exercise was performed for 30 min on a bicycle ergometer with the target of 60–70% of the peak oxygen consumption achieved at the initial symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test monitored by a wearable device. Exercise protocol was performed with a gradual increase in exercise workload until the achievement of the predefined target. Other contents of the cardiac rehabilitation programme included tailored psychological evaluation and intervention, dietary counselling, risk factors control and secondary prevention, and advice on refraining from smoking and maintaining an at-least moderate level of leisure-time physical activity and of daily physical activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711425427">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711425427">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec8-1741826711425427"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data are expressed as percentages for discrete variables and mean ± SD for continuous variables. Comparisons between groups at randomization were performed by unpaired t-test, χ<sup>2</sup> test, or Fisher’s exact test as required. The distribution of continuous variables was analysed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normality. Data were also analysed with the use of general linear model repeated-measures procedure that provides analysis of groups of related variables that represent different measurements of the same attribute as well as multiple measurements on the same participant (within-subject factor). The model included a between-subjects factor that divided the study population into groups to investigate its effect on the variance. Bonferroni test was used as post-hoc analysis. In order to evaluate whether exercise training was an independent predictor of ischaemia perfusion defect (SDS) and of stress LV wall motion score index changes, multivariate analysis was performed adjusting for age, history of cardiovascular disease, prior acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery by-pass graft, thrombolysis, TIMI grade flow, LV ejection fraction, baseline VO<sub>2</sub> peak, drugs use (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statin, and aspirin), being on target values for smoking (not smoker), body mass index (20–25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (&lt;100 mg/dl), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (&gt;40 mg/dl), and fasting glucose (&lt;110 mg/dl).

As shown, there were no differences among groups in demographic and cardiovascular risk profile. No difference in clinical course and interventions during acute phase and in type and mean dosage of drugs assumed throughout the study was observed between the two groups. Beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers were titrated to the maximal tolerated dose in each group and no statistically significant differences were observed between groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711425427">Table 3</xref>). All patients were on aspirin and clopidogrel throughout the study period. All patients completed the study protocol and all procedures were performed under the same conditions and at the same time of day both at baseline and at follow up. The study period was similar in patients of group T and group C (185 ± 11 days and 186 ± 12 days, respectively, <italic>p</italic> = ns). No adverse event was observed during any of training sessions in patients of group T. Training patients had a mean exercise intensity of 67 ± 5% of the initial VO<sub>2</sub> peak and 90 ± 8 min of training time/week.

<p>In the control group no significant changes were observed at 6-month follow up in HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and body mass index, whereas LDL cholesterol decreased from 109 ± 27 to 96 ± 25 mg/dL (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and only 23% of patients were still smokers (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Conversely, in the training group we observed, beyond a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol (106 ± 28 vs. 80 ± 20 mg/dL, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002) and in smoking status (only 13% were still smokers at 6 months, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 compared to baseline), a significant improvement in HDL cholesterol (34 ± 8 vs. 42 ± 9 mg/dL, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), with no changes of the other risk factors. After adjusting for age, history of cardiovascular disease, prior acute myocardial infarction or coronary artery by-pass graft, thrombolysis, TIMI grade flow, LV ejection fraction, baseline VO<sub>2</sub> peak, drug use (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statin, and aspirin), being on target values for smoking (not smoker), body mass index (20–25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), LDL cholesterol (&lt;100 mg/dL), HDL cholesterol (&gt;40 mg/dL), and fasting glucose (&lt;110 mg/dL), multiple regression analysis showed that exercise training [β (SE) = −3.02 (0.90), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002] was an independent predictor of the ischaemia perfusion defect (SDS) reduction and of the improvement of stress LV wall motion score index [β (SE) = 7.98 (3.88), <italic>p</italic> = 0.04].</p>

<p>The main finding of this study is that 6 months of exercise training starting early (9 ± 3 days) after STEMI induces an improvement in perfusion pattern, characterized by a significant decrease in the amount of stress-induced ischaemia, while no significant changes were observed in the resting perfusion pattern. Conversely, control patients showed no changes of myocardial perfusion parameters. Previous studies performed in coronary artery disease patients explored the effects of exercise training on myocardial perfusion as evaluated by thallium scintigraphy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711425427">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711425427">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711425427">29</xref></sup> Shuler et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711425427">26</xref></sup> evaluated the effects of a regular exercise programme (plus dietary modification) over a 1-year period in patients with chronic stable angina. Training patients (<italic>n</italic> = 18, mean age 50 ± 7 years) showed a 54% reduction in reversible ischaemia, whereas no changes were observed among controls. Todd et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711425427">27</xref></sup> studied 40 patients (aged &lt;60 years old) with chronic stable angina with no prior myocardial infarction. They found a 34% reduction in the extent of ischaemia in training patients (<italic>n</italic> = 16) but no changes among controls. In patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (42 men, mean age 57 ± 9 years), Belardinelli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711425427">11</xref></sup> reported that moderate exercise training improves both thallium activity and contractile response of dysfunctional myocardium to low dose dobutamine. Similarly, in chronic heart failure patients (<italic>n</italic> = 50, 45 men, mean age 56 ± 7 years), Belardinelli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711425427">28</xref></sup> found that the percentage of both myocardial defects with increased thallium uptake was significantly higher after 2 months of exercise training in trained than in control patients. In patients following acute myocardial infarction (<italic>n</italic> = 15, median age 64 (51–81) years, starting time of exercise training within 2 weeks from AMI), Gunning et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711425427">29</xref></sup> found a significant improvement in myocardial perfusion after a 6-week exercise programme. However, Hung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711425427">30</xref></sup> reported no improvement in myocardial perfusion after 5-month exercise training in post-infarction patients (<italic>n</italic> = 23, mean age 53 ± 9 years, starting time of exercise training between 3 and 11 weeks after AMI), although exercise capacity was improved. Beller et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711425427">31</xref></sup> using a semi-quantitative visual scoring of segments to assess myocardial perfusion in post-infarction patients (<italic>n</italic> = 19, mean age 53 ± 7 years, starting time of exercise training 25 ± 3 days after AMI) undergoing a 12-week exercise training programme, found no change in thallium defect perfusion score. However, the use of thallium imaging for the evaluation of myocardial perfusion is limited by reduced spatial resolution, with overlapping of evaluated areas. Another limitation of many imaging modalities is the mode of interpreting the results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711425427">32</xref></sup> Quantitative automated methods are superior to qualitative methods. For example, in a recent trial in &gt;2000 patients who had two sets of vasodilator imaging within a short period of time, the agreement rates of the presence and extent of perfusion abnormality were 60% by visual analysis and &gt;90% by automated quantitative analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711425427">33</xref></sup> For these reasons, in this study myocardial perfusion imaging were performed using a Tc-99 m sestamibi and analysis was based entirely on automated quantitative methods. Tc-99 m sestamibi ensure better spatial and time resolution and therefore allows better quantification of myocardial perfusion and LV function changes after AMI.</p>
<p>The improved myocardial perfusion found in trained patients could reflect structural and/or functional adaptations to exercise of the coronary circulation including exercise-induced enhancement of endothelial function and improved angiogenesis and collateral development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711425427">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711425427">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711425427">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711425427">34</xref></sup> The improvement in the severity of the ischaemia was apparent on visual assessment in the side-by-side analysis and confirmed by the automated analysis.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the exercise-induced favourable effects on myocardial perfusion changes were accompanied by the improvement of LV myocardial wall motion and thickening score indexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating this association in the early post-infarction period, at a time potentially able to favourably interfere with the post-infarction LV remodelling. However, we did not observe any change in LV volumes or LV ejection fraction at 6-month follow up. It is possible that the segmental wall motion changes were not large enough to lead to an increase in LV ejection fraction, or to a reduction in LV volumes. Alternatively, it could be possible that a period of 6 months was still an insufficient time for translating the training-induced improvement in segmental wall motion in a beneficial anti-remodelling effect, which possibly requires a longer follow up.</p>
<p>In addition, the present study confirmed the well-known favourable effects of exercise training on cardiovascular functional capacity after AMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711425427">6</xref></sup> We believe that these changes were mostly driven by peripheral rather that central adaptation. Although previous studies in patients after AMI have shown a correlation between improved myocardial perfusion and changes in peak VO<sub>2</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711425427">28</xref></sup> we did not find any correlation between improvement in functional capacity and changes in myocardial perfusion or in wall motion and thickness score indexes. Therefore, the increase in cardiovascular functional capacity and O<sub>2</sub> pulse found in our training patients was likely due to a higher peripheral oxygen uptake by exercising muscles, rather than to an increase in cardiac output.</p>
<p>A limitation of the present study could be the relatively small number of patients, who were characterized by young age, predominantly male gender, and only mild LV dysfunction. Thus, our findings may not be applicable to elderly patients or to patients with more severe compromise of LV systolic function. With our study being a single-centre trial, less heterogeneity in the distribution of interventions and co-interventions occurs. Therefore, a more precise intervention effect (explanatory effect) may be detected. The weakness, however, is that single-centre trials may have less external validity (pragmatic effect). Another limitation is that this study was not powered enough to assess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>In addition, cardiac rehabilitation being a multidisciplinary intervention including not only exercise training but also diet, pharmacological treatment, risk factor control, and life-style and psychological counselling, we cannot rule out with certainty that the beneficial effect observed in our patients may not be attributable, at least in part, to the other element of the core components of cardiac rehabilitation other than training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741826711425427">35</xref></sup> Interestingly, although data on leisure-time physical activity and diet habits were not available, after adjusting for several cardiovascular risk factors and prognostic markers, multivariate analysis showed a strong association between exercise and the observed improvement in myocardial perfusion and LV contractility after MI. Therefore, with the above limitations, it is plausible that exercise training might have played a major role in the favourable changes of myocardial perfusion and LV contractility.</p>
<p>Despite the aforementioned limitations, the present study has some unique strengths. First, myocardial perfusion was assessed by gated SPECT imaging technique, which is the gold standard for the noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion; in addition, we used state-of-the-art methods to assess cardiopulmonary functional capacity. The score adopted in the present study gives information not only on the anatomical extent, but also on the severity of perfusion defect, thus giving more complete information of myocardial injury, which can be only partially compared to the thallium scintigraphy. In addition, our study patients represented a contemporary population with adoption of all up-to-date interventions and evidence-based drugs. In particular, differently from previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711425427">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711425427">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711425427">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711425427">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711425427">31</xref></sup> the large majority of patients were taken beta-blockers. Moreover, post-infarction patients were enrolled into a long-term exercise training programme early after the acute event, with the aim of detecting changes in myocardial perfusion early in the post-acute phase.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study shows that exercise training early after AMI reduces the amount of post-infarction stress-induced myocardial ischaemia, without modifications in the resting perfusion pattern. These changes in myocardial perfusion were associated with an improvement in resting and post-stress LV wall motion and thickness score indexes, and with an augmented cardiovascular functional capacity. Further studies are needed to confirm our data in larger population of AMI patients with different demographic and clinical characteristics and with an extended follow up, and to evaluate differences according to the time and mode of reperfusion. Finally, the impact of exercise training alone or as an integral part of multifactorial Cardiac Rehabilitation programmes on outcomes such as LV wall motion and myocardial perfusion after acute myocardial infarction needs further investigation.</p>
