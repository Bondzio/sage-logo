<p>‘It does exactly what it says on the tin’ – Gijs Walraven’s book provides a compelling discussion on how poor health and poverty are inextricably linked and what can be done to overcome this vicious cycle. The book is based on the author’s extensive experience of working as a healthcare provider in developing countries which provides it with a more personal account of the health-related problems that continue to affect poorer communities disproportionately around the world.</p>
<p>Following the foreword written by Princess Zahra Aga Khan, this book kicks off with a general introduction on <italic>global health and inequity</italic> (Chapter 1). It draws upon key health indicators and socio-economic data that illustrate the vast gaps in health outcomes and access to healthcare between and within nation states. The author echoes the growing outcry against the persistent differentials in health in modern society and deems this to be a reflection of policy failures that are unfair, inhumane and unjust.</p>
<p>This book contains discussion of the usual topics one would expect to appear in a book on poverty in health, such as <italic>malaria</italic> (Chapter 2), <italic>tuberculosis and HIV</italic> (Chapter 3), <italic>safe motherhood</italic> (Chapter 4), <italic>family planning</italic> (Chapter 5), <italic>water and sanitation</italic> (Chapter 7), <italic>tropical diseases</italic> (Chapter 8) and <italic>undernutrition</italic> (Chapter 9). However, it certainly breaks the mould by raising some new health issues, such as <italic>cervical cancer</italic> (Chapter 6), <italic>hypertension</italic> and <italic>diabetes</italic> (Chapter 10), which are emerging in the developing world. It also calls for improved <italic>palliative care</italic> in poorer nations (Chapter 6), the promotion of <italic>cross-border healthcare</italic> (Chapter 12) and implementation of more equitable <italic>health financing</italic> (Chapter 11). The book concludes with an argument to strengthen health systems through effective <italic>primary care</italic> (Chapter 13) with an emphasis on local ownership and recognition of the socio-cultural contexts that influence health.</p>
<p>Each chapter is neatly and consistently structured, each beginning with stories of people with whom the author has personally worked. This is followed by a discussion on the historical context of the health issue in focus and details as to why the problem continues to exist in poor communities despite concerted efforts to resolve this. Unlike conventional epidemiological books on poverty and health, this book is not all doom and gloom. Albeit bold and ambitious, Walraven presents solutions, which he argues are achievable and within our economic and technological reach. The message passionately conveyed throughout this book, is that we have adequate knowledge and resources available to put an end to unnecessary suffering and loss of life in poor communities. There is no room for excuses any more.</p>
<p>Recognizing the complex nature of health and its wider social determinants, integrated solutions are necessary to achieve effective and sustainable health for all. Walraven takes a balanced approach and understands the relevance of both individual and social responsibility for health. For example, when discussing the growing prevalence of cardiovascular disease in developing countries, personal factors such as diet and smoking are presented alongside the strategic hard-selling of rich tobacco corporations. When discussing tuberculosis, negative social attitudes and weak health systems are both seen as mechanisms that enable this preventable and treatable disease to thrive in poorer communities. When discussing HIV, the lack of education and access to antiretroviral medicine, its stigmatization and the refusal of religious groups to promote the use of condoms are some of the difficulties presented to overcome this issue. The promotion of better individual health-related behaviour, whether it be more frequent hand-washing or treatment adherence, to advocacy for political and socio-cultural changes such as balancing between prevention and treatment efforts, advocating for women’s education and empowerment, providing better training and development for local healthcare providers to address ‘brain drain’, improving agricultural productivity, expanding access to safe water and sanitation, investing in early childhood development and promoting better political leadership and fair trade agreements are some of the headline recommendations raised in this book to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are met in 2015.</p>
<p>This book takes a refreshing approach to health and poverty and is a joy to read. It is powerful, inspirational and thoroughly engaging. It is one of those books that urges you to get off your chair and do something yourself. It is accessible to anyone interested in global health, whether you are a novice or an experienced player in this field. The diagrams, tables and glossary provided are particularly helpful, especially for those from a non-medical background. It also has an excellent reading list at the end of each chapter for more in-depth information concerning each topic.</p>
<p>The chapters are clearly tied together with the health and social justice theme running throughout the book. Its interdisciplinary approach shines all the way through, with inputs from biomedicine, economics, epidemiology, history, politics and law. Although there are obvious areas where health psychology can contribute to address issues related with poverty and health, the role of psychology is downplayed, almost entirely invisible in this book. I do not see this as a criticism of the book, but rather another call for health psychologists to be more engaged and proactive with such matters.</p>
