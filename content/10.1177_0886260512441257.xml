<abstract>
<p>This article documents the coping strategies adopted by women victims of spousal violence in Pakistan. By drawing on 21 in-depth interviews conducted in Lahore and Sialkot (Pakistan), we found that the women tried to cope with violence by using various strategies, both emotion focused (e.g., use of religion, placating the husband, etc.) and problem focused (e.g., seeking support from formal institutions, etc.). The data showed that a majority of the women used emotion-focused strategies, especially spiritual therapies, which somehow reduced the violence and provided them with psychosocial solace. Nonetheless, these strategies incurred some costs, such as the consumption of scarce resources, time, and emotional energy. Our data also showed that few women opted for problem-focused strategies, such as seeking help from formal institutions, as these strategies could lead to overt confrontation with their husbands and may result in divorce, the outcome least desired by most of the Pakistani women. We noted that the coping behavior of Pakistani women was complex, subjective, and nonlinear and that the boundaries between emotion-focused and problem-focused strategies were diffuse and blurred. Although the women never surrendered to violence, they were fully aware of their structural limitations and vulnerabilities. Being mindful of the consequences of their actions, women carefully tailored a combination of strategies which could be helpful in resisting or reducing violence but, at the same time, should not be counterproductive. This article argues that Pakistani women alone cannot effectively resist violence while living under a harshly patriarchal regime, where violence against women is embedded in the social, political, and legal structures of society. There are no quick fixes to change the status quo. The Pakistani government, civil society, and formal institutions must proactively support women in reducing their vulnerabilities and facilitate them in expanding their capabilities to address the real causes of violence against them.</p>

<p>Pakistan has one of the worst records of violence against women, especially spousal violence (SV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512441257">Ali, Asad, Mogren, &amp; Krantz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512441257">Amnesty International, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512441257">Jilani &amp; Ahmed, 2004</xref>). It is a critical and burgeoning issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512441257">Fikree, Razzak, &amp; Durocher, 2005</xref>), and in recent years the country has regularly attracted international media attention due to a number of gruesome acts of violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512441257">Khan &amp; Hussain, 2008</xref>). The gravity of the situation may be measured by the fact that a national survey of violence against women found that women in Pakistan experienced various forms of violence such as verbal and emotional abuse, restrictions, sexual, and physical violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441257">Andersson et al., 2010</xref>). About 66% women experienced one or more of these forms of abuse and about 30% experienced physical abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512441257">Andersson et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, little is known about how these women respond to this violence and which strategies they use to cope with the physical and psychological damage caused by violence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886260512441257">
<title>A Brief Overview of Coping Strategies</title>
<p>Conventionally, abused women are portrayed as helpless, hopeless, and psychologically paralyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260512441257">Walker, 1979</xref>). However, recently, several studies have demonstrated a number of coping and resistance strategies adopted by abused women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512441257">Campbell, Rose, Kub, &amp; Nedd, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512441257">Goldblatt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512441257">Gondolf &amp; Fisher, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512441257">Goodman &amp; Fallon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512441257">Shannon, Logan, Cole, &amp; Medley, 2006</xref>). <italic>Coping</italic> is often defined as “constantly changing cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512441257">Lazarus, 1991</xref>, p. 112).</p>
<p>Coping is a dynamic, rather than a static, process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0886260512441257">Yoshihama, 2002</xref>), and various scholars have conceptualized it using different constructions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512441257">Finn (1985)</xref> used the concept of “passive” and “active” coping strategies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512441257">Finn (1985)</xref> argued that unobservable and emotional efforts are categorized as passive strategies, whereas observable and behavioral efforts to cope with stress are classified as active strategies. Other dichotomizations of coping mentioned in the literature are “disengagement” versus “engagement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512441257">Kemp, Green, Hovanitz, &amp; Rawlings, 1995</xref>); “avoidance” versus “approach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512441257">Moos, 1995</xref>); “avoidant” versus “active” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512441257">Holahan &amp; Moos, 1987</xref>); and “cognitive/emotional” versus “behavioral” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512441257">Holahan &amp; Moos, 1987</xref>) coping strategies. These classifications demonstrate the complexity and multidimensionality of coping behavior and how a single behavior is given multiple labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512441257">Tamres, Janicki, &amp; Helgeson, 2002</xref>). Broadly, passive, disengagement, avoidance, and emotional strategies are all described as coping through avoiding or denying the unpleasant reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512441257">Carver, Scheier, &amp; Weintraub, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512441257">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>), whereas active, engaged, and behavioral coping are considered to address the real causes of the problem.</p>
<p>The most widely used coping categories are classified as “emotion-focused” and “problem-focused” coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512441257">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512441257">Lazarus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512441257">Lazarus &amp; Folkmann, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512441257">Shannon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512441257">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>). Emotion-focused strategies try to manage the stressful situation by using techniques to overcome the distress by modifying emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512441257">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512441257">Lazarus &amp; Folkmann, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512441257">Shannon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512441257">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>) rather than trying to alter the real causes of the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512441257">Lazarus, 1999</xref>). However, problem-focused coping strategies use observable techniques to address the real causes of the stress to solve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512441257">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512441257">Lazarus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512441257">Shannon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512441257">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>). Usually, emotion-focused strategies are considered to be “sweeping things under the carpet,” denying the problem, or avoiding the stress, whereas problem-focused strategies are perceived to be more realistic and more helpful in finding a solution and removing or reducing the underlying causes of the stress.</p>

<title>Coping Strategies of Pakistani Women Against SV</title>
<p>As in other patriarchal societies, in Pakistan men are the controllers of their wives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512441257">Critelli, 2010</xref>) and, in some situations, the culture allows a selective and “justified” physical punishment for a “deviant” wife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512441257">Fikree et al., 2005</xref>). The popular literature propagates various stereotypes, such as the idea that “ideal wives” passively and habitually bear violence in the name of religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512441257">Hajjar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512441257">Haj-Yahia, 2002</xref>) and do not effectively resist it. Nonetheless, research documents various coping strategies adopted by women living under the threat of SV in South Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>) and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512441257">Shannon et al., 2006</xref>). These women are usually determined and creative in designing coping strategies, despite the fact that they are economically and socially dependent on the perpetrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has documented that women’s responses to violence are shaped largely by the circumstances of the abuse and their assessment of the available options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512441257">Ellsberg, Winkvist, Pena, &amp; Stenlund, 2001</xref>). Variables like “class, ethnicity, socio-economic viability, accessibility of alternative support system, play a major role in determining the women’s use of strategies of resistance and their efficacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>, p. 254). The women carefully and strategically find a way, within the cultural and structural constraints, to confront the SV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>). That is why the selection of coping strategies by women reflects the prevailing cultural norms and status of women in any given society. Given the weaker and subordinate position of women in South Asia, they are more likely to employ emotion-focused coping strategies as these are covert and less confrontational compared with problem-focused strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260512441257">Ruhi, 2010</xref>). In short, coping choices are dependent on both the assessment of the threat and the assessment of one’s resources to address the threat.</p>
<p>We did not find any study specifically focusing on coping strategies against SV adopted by Pakistani women. However, some studies are available on other South Asian women. For example, Indian women used various strategies like silence, unspoken confrontation, hiding, talking back, making implied challenges to the abuser’s fiscal control, and contemplating suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>). In many societies, including Pakistan, religion is also used as a coping strategy against stress and stressful life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441257">Banning, Hafeez, Faisal, Hassan, &amp; Zafar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260512441257">Watlington &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>). Religion provides meaning to life events and occurrences, a sense of justice and comfort, and a justification for unfortunate events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441257">Belavich, 1995</xref>). By using religion, women expect and solicit support from supernatural forces to resist and confront unjust and oppressive situations and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260512441257">Watlington &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>). In some situations, religion also provides alternative arrangements to escape the physical and cognitive control of the oppressor and also gives motivation to liberate women from socially confined and structurally disadvantaged situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512441257">Belavich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512441257">Khan &amp; Hussain, 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, neither is the stress-buffering role of religiosity straightforward or linear nor is the religiousness simple or uniform. Instead, “it is a complex process consisting of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, interpersonal, and psychological dimensions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512441257">Pargament, Ano, &amp; Wachholtz, 2005</xref>, p. 482). This may be the reason why religious coping strategies cannot be placed in a binary classification such as “effective” or “ineffective.” It all depends on the kind of religion, the person, the social context, and the degree to which the various components of religion are integrated into that person’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260512441257">Pargament, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature on religious coping strategies is quite rich as the definition of religion is broad enough to encompass the wide range of religious pathways that people take as a part of their coping mechanism. Nonetheless, to reduce the complexity, behavioral scientists have introduced various conceptual tools and constructs to analyze the coping role of religion across cultures. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512441257">Hill and Hood (1999)</xref> offered 17 different categories of religious coping strategies, such as beliefs, prayers, involvement in congregational activities, visits to holy places, sacrifices, seeking help from religious leaders, and so forth.</p>
<p>More than half a century ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512441257">Allport (1950)</xref> provided a distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation. In explaining this distinction, intrinsic religiosity was described as mature and meaningful, whereas extrinsic religiosity was considered to be immature and utilitarian in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512441257">Beck &amp; Jessup, 2004</xref>). In other words, intrinsic religious feeling is religion as a meaning-endowing framework in terms of which all life is understood, whereas extrinsic religious observance is the religion of comfort and social convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512441257">Donahue, 1985</xref>). Although this distinction between mature and immature religion has been widely applauded, it is difficult to operationalize these constructs, especially when their relevance is measured in terms of stress-coping strategies. Defining such a complex phenomenon as religion in terms of this binary distinction is also considered to be simplistic, superficial, and “neglecting the purity of conceptualization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512441257">Dittes, 1971</xref>, p. 375). Furthermore, such distinctions and classifications are usually developed by Western scholars and these constructs were empirically tested in industrialized countries. There have been very few in-depth studies in Muslim majority countries to test the applicability and relevance of such theoretical constructs.</p>
<p>Of late, some studies have been conducted in developing countries using the theoretical construct of emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies in stressful situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512441257">Maman, Cathcart, Burkhardt, Omba, &amp; Behets, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260512441257">Taleghani, Yekta, &amp; Nasrabadi, 2006</xref>). The problem-focused coping strategies include developing and revitalizing social networks, seeking help from formal care-providing institutions, overtly challenging the coercion and control of the perpetrator, and leaving the violent relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512441257">Abraham, 2005</xref>). More specifically, in problem-focused strategies, women garner social support from their neighborhood, acquaintances, or extended family relationships. The process of coping is not linear, it does not have easily identifiable stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512441257">Campbell et al., 1998</xref>), and it changes or transforms from one behavior to another over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512441257">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>). In short, each coping strategy, be it emotion-focused or problem-focused, provides a unique learning opportunity for the abused women. Coping behaviors are a part of the empowerment process that helps many women to retain or regain a sense of self and individual autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512441257">Lampert, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a dearth of systematic research on the coping strategies of abused women in Pakistan and, to the best of our knowledge, no specific study is available. This research intends to explore how women cope with SV in the complex and paradoxical setting of Pakistan, where powerful forces of globalization and modernization are colliding with the gendered politics of conservative forces and discriminatory legal structures that continuously push women to the social margins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260512441257">Shaheed, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>For this article, data were drawn from 21 in-depth interviews with married women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who were currently or had been in an abusive intimate relationship. Women were selected through the purposive sampling method from different localities in Lahore and Sialkot. Lahore is the second largest city in Pakistan with a population of 10 million and Sialkot, situated about 125 km northwest of Lahore, has a population of 1 million. In Pakistan, cities are divided into various administrative towns. Lahore is divided into nine administrative towns. Each town has more than 50,000 inhabitants and has its own local government. Sialkot comprises four administrative towns. Each town in Lahore and Sialkot consists of many residential areas (called localities), each consisting of 1,000 to 1,500 households. For the present study, two towns were selected at random from each city and from each town two localities were purposively selected.</p>
<p>For the recruitment of respondents, the researcher sought help from the community-based lady health workers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512441257">1</xref></sup> (LHWs) in each locality. The reason for contacting LHWs was that, being community-based workers and living in the same community, they knew almost all the families in the locality. Because of their close contact with women, they also had knowledge about the occurrence of spousal violence among couples in a given locality. When accompanied by a LHW, it was easy for the researcher to explain the research objectives to the respondents in a more frank and friendly manner. In addition, the LHWs also used their influence and connections to make appointments for interviews with the women. The LHWs arranged the time and location of the interviews according to the convenience of the participants.</p>
<p>Ten percent (3 of 30) of the selected women refused to participate in the study because they considered that speaking about violence was a taboo, and 20% (6 of 30) declined due to their heavy workload of household chores. The interviews were conducted during a 12-week period from October to December 2008. Thirteen in-depth interviews were conducted in the women’s own homes after ensuring the privacy of the respondents, and eight were conducted in a private room at the office of the LHW because in these cases privacy was not possible at home due to living in a joint family system or the presence of adolescents at home.</p>
<sec id="section4-0886260512441257">
<title>Safeguarding women’s privacy and safety</title>
<p>In Pakistan, the issue of violence against women is controversial, and any research or intervention activity is viewed with suspicion and skepticism. So the researchers were particularly aware of the potential risks and problems. In accordance with the World Health Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260512441257">WHO; 2001</xref>) guidelines, the privacy and safety of the respondents was the primary concern of this research. To ensure the women’s safety, they were first approached by LHWs. Keeping the LHWs on board sent a message to the respondents’ families and the community at large that the research was something related to women’s health. Such an impression reduced the chances of a negative reaction or backlash from the community or from the perpetrator. Second, the research was framed as a study on women’s health and family relationships instead of a study on spousal violence.</p>
<p>Third, the women were interviewed in their homes at a time they chose and that was convenient for them, when they were alone. Most of the interviews were conducted during the morning, when their husbands were at work and children were at school. It was ensured that the mothers-in-law or sisters-in-law or any other relative of the women, including children, were not there at the time of the interviews. In one case, when privacy was breached by a neighboring woman, the interview process was terminated and was rescheduled for another suitable time. In cases where children below 5 years were present, they were kept busy with different games by giving them colored pencils, paper, or rubber balloons by a woman in our research team. However, no male relative ever interrupted the interview process as in Pakistan men are culturally forbidden from interfering in “women’s meetings.” Nonetheless, in cases when privacy was not possible at the women’s homes, they were interviewed in a private room at the office of the LHW.</p>
<p>Fourth, in line with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260512441257">WHO (2001)</xref> guidelines, we constructed a dummy questionnaire consisting of questions related to breastfeeding or child health in case of an unexpected entry. We told the women in advance about the existence and purpose of the dummy questions. Fifth, at the time of interview, no personal information such as names, addresses, or phone numbers were obtained. Instead, unique codes were used to distinguish the women’s responses. At the end of the interviews, participants were requested not to tell other people about the detailed nature of the interview.</p>
<p>This study was part of a dissertation project on spousal violence against women and its implications for women’s health in Pakistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0886260512441257">Zakar, 2012</xref>). The study was approved by the dissertation committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences, Bielefeld University, Germany. In Pakistan, the study was coordinated by the University of the Punjab, Lahore. The study objectives and methodology were also reviewed and approved by a committee of academicians from the Institute of Social and Cultural Studies, University of the Punjab, Lahore.</p>

<title>Study Instruments</title>
<p>The study used a semistructured interview guide, which allowed the researchers to follow certain topics and open up new lines of inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512441257">Bowling, 2009</xref>). Open-ended questions were formulated on the basis of three informal discussions with women and a review of the existing literature on the topic. We specifically tried to formulate our questions and structure our conversation in such a way that it could explore “. . . deep beneath the surface of superficial responses to obtain true meanings that individuals assign to events, and the complexities of their attitudes and behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512441257">Bowling, 2009</xref>, p. 407).</p>
<p>Talking about unpleasant and violent experiences may be psychologically damaging for the respondents. Therefore, despite having obtained the consent of each respondent, before starting the section enquiring about violence, we warned them in advance about the nature of the questions. This provided the respondents with the opportunity to either stop the interview or to skip the unpleasant questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260512441257">WHO, 2001</xref>). The interviews began with questions regarding sociodemographic characteristics and some questions were asked about their knowledge and awareness of the issue of spousal violence, its perceived magnitude in Pakistani society and the health consequences of violence. The questions then moved to more specific domains of inquiry, that is, their personal experiences of any type of violence from their husbands. Finally, questions were asked about the women’s coping strategies against spousal violence, their sources of support and help and their methods of managing violence-generated stress. All questions were open-ended and were asked in a very polite and respectful language (in Urdu or Punjabi). Questions related to the women’s marital experiences and their coping styles were asked in the following ways: “Can you please tell me about your experiences of living with your husband? Would you like to tell me how do you deal with tense situations? What strategies do you usually use to cope with tense relationship situations? What sort of activities/things would have helped you to manage such difficult situations? Have you ever discussed your problems with others? How did they respond? From whom do you seek help in such situations?”</p>
<p>Women were encouraged to express their views frankly and openly. For analytical purposes, the term <italic>spousal violence</italic> was properly explained to the respondents. For the purposes of operationalization, SV refers to “any act of physical (e.g., beating, kicking, slapping, etc.), psychological (e.g., insulting, humiliation, intimidation, etc.), sexual, and coercive behavior perpetrated by the husband against his wife” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0886260512441257">WHO, 2002</xref>). By fully realizing that violence is a sensitive and stigmatized issue in Pakistan, the questions about violence and coping were asked in a supportive and nonjudgmental manner. All interviews ended on a positive note and reinforced the women’s coping strategies.</p>
<p>All the qualitative data were collected by the first author with the help of a female interviewer, having a considerable experience of conducting qualitative interviews in the local setting. The fact that the interviewers were females and married helped to develop a good rapport with the participants. Most interviews were conducted in the first language of the respondents, that is, Urdu, but some participants preferred the Punjabi language, so six interviews were conducted in Punjabi. Before the start of each interview, written informed consent was obtained from all the participants and they were also informed about the reason for their selection and the maintenance of confidentiality. A written background survey was administered to gather sociodemographic information about the participants. The duration of the interviews ranged from 1.5 to 2 hr. With the permission of the participants, all interviews were audio-recorded and written notes were taken during the interviews. The confidentiality and safety of the respondents were ensured throughout the data-collection process. The participants were offered an information list of social services and resources provided by local service agencies.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All audio-recorded in-depth interviews were transcribed verbatim into written form by the first two authors. The transcribed material was then translated from Urdu into English. Although we also asked women about their experiences of abuse, in this manuscript we only analyzed the data relating to their coping strategies. Initially, all authors reviewed each transcript line by line. The constant comparison method of qualitative data analysis was carried out by systematic examination of similarities between the women’s views to identify emergent themes within and across in-depth interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260512441257">Strauss, 1987</xref>). At first, transcript coding was performed independently by each author and then in joint sessions involving all the authors. After multiple readings of the transcript, we first identified the initial units of meaning (categories) that emerged from the data (e.g., prayers, pleasing husband, seeking help from friends, family). This resulted in a list of words and phrases representing the broad areas of women’s coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260512441257">Strauss, 1987</xref>). Second, the researchers discovered relationships between categories and subcategories by context and content (e.g., placating the husband as a main category, with appeasing, showing submission, denial, and self-blaming as subcategories). This involved more abstract analysis, including identifying the properties and dimensions of categories and articulating relationship between the categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260512441257">Strauss, 1987</xref>). Third, we searched the data for coherence and different ideas about the same phenomenon and comparatively analyzed existing and incoming data to illuminate and expand the developing categories into meaningful constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260512441257">Strauss, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure accuracy and consistency, we met regularly during the process of data analysis, first to articulate and then to refine the qualitative categories used in the coding process. To preserve the validity of the responses, the first author shared the initial manuscript with all of the authors. The results were also discussed with available study participants. The authors’ and participants’ reviews of the transcript provided corrections to errors and clarifications on specific points.</p>

<title>Participants’ Characteristics</title>
<p>The women’s ages ranged from 20 to 46. Among the 21 women, 18 were currently married, 2 were divorced, and 1 was living separately from her husband with her parental family. A majority of the women were Muslim and were from the lower-middle class. Two women had no children, whereas the rest had between 1 and 6 children, ranging in age from 9 months to 19 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512441257">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and Strengths</title>
<p>Like all qualitative studies, this research had some limitations. First, the sample was not representative; it presents the views of a group of women who were mostly from the urban lower-middle class. Therefore, these findings may not represent the views of all women, especially those living in rural areas or from the lower and upper urban classes. We relied on the self-reporting of experiences of abuse and women’s coping strategies and so the possibility of recall bias and desirability effects could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>However, the strength of this research is that it is the first qualitative study of its kind in Pakistan and will add to the scientific literature in this crucial area. The findings of this study will also initiate a debate on this topic and will lay a foundation for further academic research. Usually the research on women’s coping strategies against SV is limited to women living in shelter homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512441257">Lampert, 1996</xref>) or women who have left the violent relationship. In contrast, our study included women who were still in a violent relationship and were struggling with it.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260512441257">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Our data showed that women adopted various coping strategies to avert, prevent, or minimize the anticipated occurrence of violence and, at the same time, tried to reduce the psychologically damaging effects of already committed violence. As most of the women could not overtly fight back or call the police because of social constraints, they carefully tailored strategies which provided them with some relief from the violence and its psychological consequences. We also noted that the women were mindful of the fact that their coping strategies should not provoke or further infuriate the violent husband. We found that a majority of the women used emotion-focused strategies, which included increased engagement in religious activities, placating the husband, avoiding contact with the husband, self-blaming, denying, or downplaying the existence of violence.</p>

<title>Emotion-Focused Coping Strategies</title>
<sec id="section11-0886260512441257">
<title>Increased Engagement in Individual Religious Activities</title>
<p>Using religion as a coping strategy is common across cultures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512441257">Shannon et al. (2006)</xref> found in their study that 12% of women in America used religion to seek support and psychological solace against violence. In our sample, we found that almost all of the women (19 of 21) invoked some kind of religious activity as a violence coping strategy. It may be noted that the women reported special religious activities (e.g., prayers, attending congregation, visiting holy shrines/tombs, etc.) as a part of their religious coping strategy. Mandatory religious prayers (e.g., five times daily prayer, fasting during Ramadan, etc.) were a normal routine for these women. However, three women reported that they adopted mandatory religious activities as a coping strategy (as they were not performing prayers before they experienced SV). It has been well researched that the use of prayers is not for a uniform objective. More than half a century ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441257">Clark (1958)</xref> differentiated several different kinds of prayers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441257">Clark (1958)</xref> argued that, depending on the individual situation, different kinds of prayers serve different functions for the individual. For example, some prayers are offered as mandatory religious duty, whereas others are offered as petition, confession, communion, intercession, or thanksgiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512441257">Clark, 1958</xref>).</p>
<p>In Pakistan, using religion to reduce worldly suffering and solve day-to-day problems is common and is considered to be a part of faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512441257">Banning et al., 2009</xref>). To be overtly religious and perform religious rituals increases one’s social status and is considered a sign of one’s piety and “good moral character” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512441257">Hegland, 1998</xref>). Respect for some religious practices is protected by law, and nobody can dare to ridicule these practices. For example, one woman in her mid-40s whose husband was short-tempered and violent said:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I see him in a bad mood and anticipate aggressive behavior, I go for prayer. He cannot touch me while I am praying. When I am afraid and under stress, I engage myself in performing <italic>Nawafil</italic> [optional prayers] and <italic>Tasbih</italic> [reciting Allah’s name]; it gives me satisfaction, <italic>zahni sakoon</italic> [mental solace], and security from <italic>waswas</italic> [satanic insinuation] and fear of violence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some religious practices and prayers are perceived as having the power to solve worldly problems and ward off forthcoming troubles. In Pakistan, there are thousands of spiritual personalities who offer specialized religious remedies, especially for solving “conjugal problems,” the treatment of infertility, <italic>nazar</italic> (evil eye), taming the husband or lover, or helping to solve other problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0886260512441257">Zakar, 1998</xref>). Our data showed that the majority of the women were strong believers in the problem-solving capacity and potential of certain religious prescriptions, especially if they are performed at <italic>Mazars</italic> (holy shrines) or with the advice and help of <italic>peers</italic> (spiritual leaders). Anthropological studies have shown that such help-seeking behavior thrives when limited structural opportunities are available to women to address their day-to-day problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512441257">Hegland, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In Lahore and Sialkot (where the data were collected), there were dozens of famous and popular tombs and <italic>Mazars</italic> (graves of holy persons). A sizeable number of the women interviewed (5 of 21) reported having visited Data <italic>Darbar</italic> (the shrines of famous saints, Ali Hajvari), and the graves of other popular saints, with the hope that through prayers their husbands would change their behavior. The women visited these shrines to offer special prayers, give <italic>Nazrana</italic> (donations), and to perform other rituals. These women also believed in the strong healing power of <italic>Taweez</italic> (amulets) and <italic>Peryan</italic> (spiritually empowered medicine) provided by the spiritual leaders. The women reported that religious involvement helped them in reducing violence-induced stress and psychological damage. Two women thought that it also reduced the anticipated incidence of physical violence from their husbands. Although many positive results of religious therapies were mentioned, some women also talked about the “cost” of these activities.</p>
<p>While doing an in-depth appraisal of the situation, these women thought that involvement in some religious activities made them “too busy” and were tiring as these activities needed additional time, emotional energy, and financial resources. For example, when they visited shrines, it took time and incurred travel costs and the hassle of travelling on a male-dominated and uncomfortable public transport system (none of the women owned a car). Moreover, they had to offer donations to the caretakers of these shrines. Hence the already overworked, marginalized, and stressed women had to bear an additional burden. In fact, women’s involvement in these activities potentially reduced the time and attention they were supposed to give to their household and husband. By looking at this angle, it can be seen that women’s increased engagements in religious activities to cope with SV may be only partly helpful. In one case, it rather aggravated the situation, as involvement in spiritual activities reinforced some gendered stereotypes. A woman in her late 30s with 5 years of schooling, whose husband was a truck driver, stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>When I participated in religious activities, my in-laws, especially my mother-in-law, started expressing much suspicion and skepticism. She suspected that I was indulging in <italic>kala jado</italic> [black magic, which is forbidden in Islam] and other illegitimate spiritual practices to control her son [the woman’s husband]. Sometimes my husband and father-in-law seemed to agree with her views. It is quite disgusting to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to individual religious activities, an involvement in collective and congregational religious activities was also used as a coping strategy against SV. We noted that a sizeable number of the women (7 of 21) were involved in collective religious activities like participating in Friday prayer at the mosque (generally women in Pakistan say their prayers at home; however, on some special occasions, such as Friday prayer and Eid prayers, they can perform them at the mosque, where a separate space is allocated for women), <italic>Mehfila-Melad</italic> (celebrating the birthday of Prophet Muhammad), attending or arranging <italic>Kahtum</italic> (gatherings to pray for dead relatives), or <italic>Muharram</italic> congregations (mourning the <italic>Shahadat</italic> of Imam Husain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad) and other such activities, where women had a chance to get in contact with other women from their locality. Some women also got together for special prayers, especially during Ramadan, <italic>Eid ul-Fitr</italic>, and <italic>Eid al-Adha</italic> (Muslim festivals).</p>
<p>Women perceived that participation in such gatherings provided them with <italic>sabar</italic> (patience) and spiritual solace and also reduced stress and fear. Such gatherings, though arranged for religious purposes, gave them an opportunity to get a feel of the outside world and exposed them to new information, relationships, and acquaintances. One woman felt that engagement in these activities enhanced her social standing, relationship network, and social support. One illiterate woman who had two children stated, “I got a chance to learn from the experiences and perspectives of others.” Another woman reported that her husband was not happy about her participation in such activities. She further stated, “He never tried to stop me. He can’t stop me. Nobody can stop prayer to Allah.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886260512441257">
<title>Avoiding Contact With Husband</title>
<p>Avoiding contact with the violent husband was another common strategy adopted by women to cope with both physical and psychological SV. One woman, who was 5 years older than her husband (considered a very unusual match in Pakistan), stated, “He usually talks to me in a sarcastic manner that hurts me. So I avoid talking to him.” Another woman told us, “I usually communicate with my husband through my children or other family members.” She further said, “He [referring to her husband] is a cynical man, a very negative person. He always finds fault in my personality and work. So I avoid talking to him unnecessarily.” Another woman noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>Ever since my marriage, I have learnt that it is better to avoid him. I talk to him when it is absolutely necessary; otherwise I avoid interaction with him. When he is in the bedroom, I prefer to stay in the living room; and when he is in the living room, I try to spend time in the garden even though I have nothing to do there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We found that women adopted different strategies to keep themselves away from their husbands. The educated and relatively more skilful women used different strategies than less educated and socially excluded women. One woman in her mid-40s with a university degree, while explaining her strategy, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Ours is an arranged marriage. He is a moody person. He spends most of his time with his business friends. Ever since our marriage, he is less interested in me. For me, the best option was to involve myself in some kind of creative and useful activities. I became a member of a local NGO and spend my spare time teaching poor children and raising funds for the handicapped. It gives me strength and <italic>hosla</italic> (courage) to cope with stressful life situations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While narrating her strategy of minimizing contact with her violent husband, one woman, the mother of three sons and one daughter, stated that she spent her time with her children. She explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe this strategy helps me in two ways. First, by spending more time with my children, I am able to reduce contact with my husband, thereby minimizing the chances of conflict and consequential violence. Second, spending more time with the children and developing stronger bonds with them gives me strength and hope. With my children, I have a real and lasting relationship. When my sons are <italic>jawan</italic> [adult] and understand his <italic>zulm</italic> [cruelty], they will stop his hand. Then I will see how he dares to beat me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886260512441257">
<title>Placating the Husband</title>
<p>Some women (6 of 21) tried to placate their violent husbands instead of confronting or challenging their aggressive behavior. The placating strategies included denial or downplaying the violent behavior; considering violence an isolated or “emotional occurrence,” taking violence lightly or denying it altogether, remaining silent, and showing docility. There could also be other forms of denial, such as justifying the actions of the husband and blaming herself. One woman in her mid-20s, whose husband was an unskilled worker in a textile factory, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, he beats me; he throws at me whatever comes to his hand. But he is a short-tempered person. To be honest, sometimes I also make mistakes. But after all, he is my <italic>majazi-khuda</italic> [impersonate God], I must respect him under any circumstances.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such thinking implies that there was no violence per se but that it was her fault or failing which caused the violence. So the assumption is that, if she corrects herself, there will be no more violence. Some women (3 of 21) also denied or downplayed the violence by hoping that “he will change,” “he will learn with the passage of time,” or “my love and patience will change him.” It may be noted that, like other strategies, placating the husband was not an exclusive coping strategy; rather it was mixed and sometimes a part of other, “rational” strategies.</p>

<title>Problem-Focused Coping Strategies</title>
<sec id="section15-0886260512441257">
<title>Revitalizing and Garnering Support From Social Networks</title>
<p>One definition of poverty and social exclusion is the absence of social networks or a social support system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512441257">Cattell, 2001</xref>). In Pakistan, most women, with the exception of a minority of Westernized upper-class women, are supposed to remain within the four walls of their household, taking care of the family and performing household chores. As SV is committed within these four walls, women may try to escape this “confinement” to get some outside contact and support. This may be the reason why, despite cultural restrictions, women try to establish relationships with other women living in their neighborhood. These relationships and networks are important sources of information and also an opportunity for catharsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512441257">Hamid, Johansson, &amp; Rubenson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It may be noted that, in Pakistan, neighbors usually take an interest in and are concerned about what is going on next door. Sometimes, neighborhood pressure and interventions are considered important and effective. In our sample, 7 of 21 women reported seeking help from their neighborhood in cases of physical violence. One woman in her early 20s said that she sought the help of the neighboring woman to “educate” her husband about the adverse consequences of violence. She felt that the initiative was effective. Another 32-year-old woman, while narrating her situation, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>In the past, my husband used to beat me quite often. But, once the neighboring folks knew this, they came in a group to us and warned my husband not to repeat it. They threatened that if he [husband] did it again, he would be thrown out of the neighborhood. Now he is conscious and careful about beating me. To avoid neighborhood pressure, sometimes he insists we leave this locality and move somewhere else.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Men were also aware of the consequences of women’s social networking and some women reported that their husbands tried to restrict them to staying within the household. However, women were very creative in finding excuses and it was sometimes difficult for their husbands to totally block such contacts. One woman, whose husband worked as an assistant in a real-estate company, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Look, I am alone here, my parents live far away. My husband is a short-tempered person. Previously, when he yelled at me or beat me, I felt helpless; I used to weep quite often. Then I realized that weeping was not a solution. In my neighborhood, there were kind and friendly ladies. I talked to them and shared my problem with them. Now I usually go to them; they always console me.</p>

<title>Seeking Support From Family and Other Available Resources</title>
<p>Family is an important source of informal support for women and can reduce the risk of isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512441257">Kasturirangan, Krishnan, &amp; Riger, 2004</xref>). Close ties with extended family members can reduce financial problems, provide child care during times of women’s absence, and provide emotional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512441257">Fernandez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512441257">Kasturirangan et al., 2004</xref>). In our study, almost all of the women (20 of 21) sought emotional as well as material support from in-laws or parental family and/or friends and other relatives. Generally, the women considered their in-laws to be on the side of their husbands. However, some women (5 of 21), whose parents lived far away or were not able to help (had died or were too old or too poor), tried to seek help from in-laws or friends of their husbands to influence their husbands’ violent behavior.</p>
<p>The data showed that seeking help from in-laws was not the women’s first choice because of inherent tensions and jealousies between the relationships. Some women only grudgingly tried to strengthen their relationships with their husbands’ relatives/acquaintances to use them as a resource to embarrass their husbands if they committed violence. One woman in her mid-20s, living with her in-laws, opined,
<disp-quote>
<p>They [referring to the in-laws] are very tough and fussy people. But my father-in-law is a relatively kind-hearted, wise, and soft person. When my husband tries to beat me, my father-in-law intervenes. He usually warns my husband that it is un-Islamic to misbehave with women.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the Pakistani cultural setting, elders, especially parents, are highly respected and are expected to be prudent and wise. They are supposed to be the family monitors and inhibitors of the irresponsible and violent behavior of younger family members. Women usually feel secure in their presence. One woman reported that she sought her in-laws’ help very selectively and only in extreme situations because she knew that they would demand a price for this help. She further explained, “In exchange for their [in-laws’] help I had to take on extra household responsibilities and provide nursing services to my old mother-in-law and father-in-law. Besides this, they also try to control my behavior in their own interests.”</p>
<p>Most of the women (18 of 21) sought support from their parental family, a very common source of support in Pakistan. One woman with primary education, who had two children and was living with her married brother (because she had separated from her violent husband 2 years before), said,
<disp-quote>
<p>In hard times, my parents, brothers, and sisters proved real supporters. . . . “blood is thicker than water.” Two years ago, when I decided to leave my husband, I had no place to go. I went to my brother’s home; my brother is always helpful and kind to me, though his wife is a bit antagonistic. Sometimes I feel embarrassed; I am a burden on my brother’s family. But what can I do right now? I am not well educated and cannot find a good job to buy my own house and earn my living. My only hope is my 13-year-old son; he will grow up and do something for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, for some women, parental support was not always helpful and it too had some limitations. As per Pakistani custom, girls are not encouraged to seek parental support after marriage. They are socialized to focus on their matrimonial family and try to solve their problems by themselves. As one woman said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Previously, I used to share the abusive behavior of my husband with my sisters and brothers. Although they got worried and wanted to help me, at the same time, they started blaming me for being an incompetent and emotional wife. The spouses of my brothers and sisters considered me mad and a “psychiatric case.” So now I am not sharing my problems with them anymore.</p>

<title>Seeking Help From Formal Institutions</title>
<p>Our data showed that seeking help from formal institutions (e.g., police, lawyers, doctors, psychologists, social workers, etc.) was very rare. Only one woman talked to a lawyer and only two consulted doctors, but they perceived that doctors were not very helpful. Not a single woman even thought to go to a women’s shelter house or any other such institution, although the government’s department of social welfare has established a chain of such institutions in each district.</p>
<p>Almost all the women (19 of 21) stated that seeking help from formal institutions was not feasible within the Pakistani cultural context, and they feared that this option could be counterproductive. They thought that it would increase their difficulties instead of decreasing them. While narrating the perceived difficulties of approaching formal institutions, one woman, who was beaten by her husband quite often, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>If I get help from the police or courts against my husband, I will be divorced next morning. Then where will I go? Back to my parents’ home? No: My parents will never accept this. Society will not accept this. Such a scenario will be far more tragic and traumatic for me than violence from my husband.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another woman, while explaining her distrust and reservations about the formal institutions, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Usually, the police and lawyers are not a kind and helpful source for us [abused women]. You read stories of <italic>ziadti</italic> [rape] and <italic>tashdat</italic> [torture] by the police; they are not friendly people. Lawyers generally make things more complicated than solving the problem. Such options are not workable for Pakistani women.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another woman, who had experienced violence for the past 11 years, told us,
<disp-quote>
<p>I am trying to cope with this violence by using many strategies. But I don’t want to file for a divorce. I don’t want to go back to my parental family. The reason is that I have five brothers. Here I am under the control of one male [referring to her husband]. In the case of divorce, I would have to go to my parents’ home. There I would have to live under the subordination of five males [referring to her brothers]. So I don’t want to invite bigger trouble.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While explaining the problems of seeking help from doctors, social workers, and psychologists, one woman said,
<disp-quote>
<p>What is the use in talking to doctors or social workers? They cannot help with family problems. Doctors are too busy; they put a <italic>Tooti</italic> [stethoscope] on your chest for half a minute and prescribe medicine and call the next patient. They are not interested in our problems; they don’t have time to listen to poor women.</p>

<title>Leaving the Violent Husband</title>
<p>Although it is rare in Pakistani society, two women had found the courage to overtly challenge their violent husbands and invoked legal channels to deter and punish the perpetrators. One woman, in her late 30s with a university education, who got divorced after a protracted legal battle, said, “It was a horrible experience but I have come through it. I never looked back. I have changed a lot. Now I have a good job and good social contacts. I learned to enjoy my life independently.”</p>
<p>Another woman in her early 40s, who got divorced 4 years back and had three children, stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Before getting divorced, I left my husband’s home many times. And each time my husband brought me back after apologizing that “this will not happen again.” Then came the turning point. . . . once he not only abused me but also severely beat my son. This was the end . . . and I realized that this [violence] will never stop and he will not reform. . . . and I decided to leave my husband permanently.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that the abused women were using various coping strategies by mobilizing their personal and social resources. This study debunks some common stereotypes which suggest that women are inactive and submissive in taking steps to manage, reduce, or resist intimate partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512441257">Gondolf, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512441257">Hutchison &amp; Hirschel, 1998</xref>). Rather, these women were creative and thoughtful in devising coping strategies but were also aware of their own vulnerabilities and structural constraints.</p>
<p>We noted that the relatively marginalized women (belonging to the poor working class and having no education) usually preferred emotion-focused strategies (e.g., increased religious activities, placating or avoiding their husbands, etc.) as these strategies were considered to be safe, less risky, and less confrontational. The data showed that using religion as a coping strategy tended to reduce violence and provided some psychological consolation to the victims. Other studies have also found that religion and spirituality provided strength and solace to women victims of SV in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512441257">Gillum, Sullivan, &amp; Bybee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260512441257">Watlington &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>), women suffering from breast cancer in Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260512441257">Taleghani et al., 2006</xref>) and women suffering from HIV/AIDS in Congo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512441257">Maman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study showed that, by using religious coping strategies, women reported having achieved various objectives, both expected and unexpected. For instance, these coping strategies helped women find emotional release, gave meaning to the events, increased their social integration, helped in attaining a sense of controllability over ongoing life events and developed feelings of hopefulness. The women’s faith in Allah and His benevolence helped them to make a positive evaluation of life events; women hoped that, due to their prayers, Allah would change the behavior of their husbands one day. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512441257">Braxton, Lang, Sales, Wingood, and DiClemente (2007)</xref> also noted in their study that spirituality was strongly associated with positive and optimistic feelings in stressful situations. Paradoxically, some studies have shown that a heavy reliance on spiritual coping therapies may undermine women’s efforts in taking realistic steps to solve the underlying problem and could also contribute to delay in seeking institutional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512441257">Maman et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these positive aspects, our data showed that shrine-based religious coping strategies also had some costs. The women revealed that they had to spend a lot of time, economic resources, and emotional energy to visit shrines/tombs. These resources could otherwise be used for child care and undertaking other essential household responsibilities. Furthermore, the women felt that sometimes involvement in these activities further complicated the relationship between husband and wife; as the husband blamed his wife for neglecting household chores or ignoring him.</p>
<p>The women who visited shrines and the tombs of saints reported that they had to pay the travel costs and bear the hassle of uncomfortable and male-dominated transport facilities. These activities also posed some additional risks and unforeseen troubles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512441257">Naz, 2011</xref>). In some cases, young children also accompanied their mothers and they could also be sucked into these activities, which might have negative effects on their education and personality development. Shrine-based religious involvement might also increase women’s fatalistic attitudes and wishful thinking. Sometimes, women’s presence in shrines and other such places could expose them to unforeseen dangers. For example, shrines in Pakistan attract unregulated mobs, which pose multiple risks like bomb blasts, stampedes, and the spread of contagious diseases. Usually, women and children are the worst victims of such eventualities. It may be noted that such “negative experiences” were not due to the religious coping strategies themselves but due to the poor governance and security arrangements at shrines and the absence of a women-friendly transport system and insecure public spaces in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that, in general, women considered religious coping as effective and positive experience. The basic premise of these strategies was that “Allah is the most powerful and He can change everything.” It is a fundamental belief in Islam that “one should not be disappointed with the blessings of Allah under any circumstances.” This faith gave women courage, hope, and strength to seek out-of-the-box solution. These coping strategies opened up new opportunities and possibilities for women to develop social network, garner family and community support, and gather new information. This also gave them psychological strength and increased their social resources, resilience, and determination to fight the stressful circumstances.</p>
<p>We found that sometime women also adopted short-term strategies such as avoiding contact with their husband or placating their husband. These strategies might provide some temporary relief but might not necessarily help the women to effectively resist violence. Studies have reported that emotion-focused strategies sometimes led the women to deny or downplay the violence and this denial and self-blame can hardly help women to take systematic and concrete action to confront the perpetrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512441257">Lampert, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512441257">Shannon et al., 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, we noted that placating strategies were not just a “total surrender” or “unconditional” submission to violence. Rather, this was a strategic tactic to avert a “showdown” or a serious violent encounter. By using placating strategies, women tried to “buy time” to look for an appropriate opportunity when they could actively challenge the violent behavior of their husbands.</p>
<p>We found that usually women did not actively resist violence at the beginning of their marriage as they needed some time to understand and analyze the situation; therefore, they adopted a wait-and-see policy. Before taking any action, to be on the safe side, women wanted to consolidate their position within their in-laws’ family (e.g., proving their worth by serving the in-laws, giving birth to male babies, etc.). The coping strategies against SV adopted by the women were contingent on the available resources, their perceived personal competencies, and the economic strength and social standing of their parental family.</p>
<p>Our data showed that the women were intelligent and thoughtful in identifying and using whatever resources were available within the family or community to consolidate their position and save them from violence. For example, some women considered family elders (especially father-in-law) to be an effective agency to check and control the “serious” violent behavior of their sons. In Pakistani culture, family elders are usually considered responsible to monitor the behavior of the younger family members and check their culturally deviant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260512441257">Shariff, 2009</xref>). For instance, a father may less likely to allow his son to commit severe acts of violence against his daughter-in-law that may entail the risk of visible injury or death (normally a father never wants his son to be charged with murder). Nonetheless, this protective role of father-in-law may be restricted to serious acts of violence as studies have reported that in-laws may encourage their sons to control and “snub” their wives to ensure their subordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512441257">Fernandez, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512441257">Hyder, Noor, &amp; Tsui, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260512441257">Raj &amp; Sliverman, 2002</xref>). Hence, the role of joint family in controlling or promoting spousal conflict or violence is intricate and complex issue: In-laws can serve as both protector against and a creator of conflict within the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512441257">Hyder et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Women’s coping strategies may be studied and evaluated within the broader institutional and legal framework of Pakistani society. Generally, in Pakistan, a woman’s decision to overtly confront her husband is proscribed and culturally incongruent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512441257">Khan &amp; Hussain, 2008</xref>). The patriarchy, powered by gendered politics and discriminatory laws, places women in an extremely disadvantaged position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260512441257">Shaheed, 2010</xref>). In Pakistan, women are discriminated against by customary practices, social inhibitions, and patriarchal norms that restrict their social space and access to basic human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512441257">Cheema &amp; Cheema, 2009</xref>). The situation of women’s rights further deteriorated when General Zia (1977-1988) introduced various <italic>Sharia</italic> laws to Islamize the Pakistani legal and social systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512441257">Jilani &amp; Ahmed, 2004</xref>). This Islamization project was controversial; women’s rights organizations and other moderate sections of society claimed that it was against gender-justice and a violation of basic human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260512441257">Shaheed, 2010</xref>). Successive governments, especially the regime of General Musharaff (1999-2008), tried to partially amend the discriminatory laws and, to some extent, eased the state pressure on women, but the societal transformation that was triggered by the Zia regime still poses serious challenges for women to reclaim their social space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260512441257">Shaheed, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>At the societal level, the whole public space is dominated by men and women have to confront males wherever they go; if they go to their paternal home, the decision maker is their father or brother; if they go to a spiritual healer, he is male; the whole judicial system and all formal institutions are dominated by men. Keeping this reality in mind, they adopted strategies which could be workable and at the same time not be counterproductive. The women always “kept the back door open,” so that, if their strategy backfired, they could limit the damage by back-tracking on their actions.</p>
<p>In the present study, some women used problem-focused strategies, such as getting a divorce, separation, or seeking help from doctors and lawyers. Mostly the women wanted to preserve the marital bond “at any cost.” Family sanctity, the inability to earn independently, loss of social status, stigmatization, and societal pressure to keep the family intact were the factors that discouraged women from leaving a violent relationship. As shown in the data, women were fully aware of the adverse implications of divorce. They tended to calculate that divorce could provide relief from violence but would not offer adequate protection or a realistic option for their postdivorce life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512441257">Hajjar, 2004</xref>). The women who found the courage to come out of the violent relationship (leaving the husband) were successful in getting rid of the violence. However, predictably, they had to pay a heavy price. During their struggle, formal and informal systems remained unresponsive, noncooperative, blaming, and discriminatory. This may be the scenario that leads to women being discouraged from seeking help from formal institutions, especially women’s shelter houses.</p>
<p>Our data presented a complex picture of coping behavior by women, as the process of coping was neither easily identifiable nor linear, as also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512441257">Campbell et al. (1998)</xref>. The data showed that the boundaries between emotion-focused and problem-focused strategies were blurred, and it was difficult to dichotomize them. In real-life situations, one strategy combined with another, sometimes both types of strategy were used concurrently or consecutively. For example, involvement in religious activities gave women hope and psychological solace but also helped to increase their capacities through developing social networks. We noted that coping strategies were sometimes obscure and subjective in nature and intent. For example, seemingly passive strategies (e.g., placating the husband) may be “an active strategy-in-waiting” (waiting for the appropriate time and opportunity). Similarly, active strategies (e.g., threatening to leave the relationship) may be passive in the sense that the women did not actually want to break up the relationship; rather they wanted to exert a symbolic pressure on their husbands to achieve an end to the violence.</p>
<p>The women were aware of their strengths, options, resources, and limitations. That may be the reason why the women carefully and intelligently watched and analyzed the situation, tried to anticipate the efficacy of their planned actions, and modified and adjusted them to achieve the best results. In short, while planning and implementing coping strategies, women moved back and forth, evaluated their own strategies and strengths, and assessed the response of the perpetrator and the possible support from family and community. After making careful and rational calculations of the situation, they made decisions about their strategy. The coping process adopted by Pakistani women has been schematically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512441257">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>This study documents women’s coping strategies against SV in the face of their subordinated and powerless position vis-à-vis the perpetrators in Pakistan. The women used a combination of strategies to cope with violence, and the majority of their coping strategies were positive and helpful. Nonetheless, in the presence of weak social and institutional support, women’s agency seemed not to be powerful enough to address the real causes of violence or to stop it permanently. Of late, in Pakistan the development of a vibrant and independent media, powerful civil society organizations, and the proactive role of the judiciary have been effectively highlighting the phenomenon of violence against women. Under pressure from civil society, the Pakistani parliament passed the Domestic Violence (Protection and Prevention) Act 2009, which criminalizes violence against women. However, obviously, laws alone cannot effectively help the abused women. Society needs to do more. The women alone cannot liberate themselves from the shackles of an all-encompassing and repressive patriarchal regime. They need proactive structural support from civil society, the media, and formal institutions, which could facilitate the process of their empowerment and strengthen their capacity to live in a secure and violence-free environment with dignity and autonomy. Pakistani society has a long way to go to achieve this.</p>
