<p>The articles in this issue concern a number of associated issues which have been regarded as marginal by top-down accountability regimes and the kind of ‘improvement’ they promote. Centrally, they concern the establishment of cultures which promote rather than stifle creativity and innovation, and the conditions under which this can take place and professionals can truly listen to young people and their families.</p>
<p>John M Davis of Edinburgh University, Scotland, has been working with research teams in several European countries and regions to examine organizational conditions that support creativity and innovation. The article mediates skilfully between Professor Davis’s longstanding involvement in childhood studies and organizational and policy matters. The data point away from individualistic conceptions of creativity to examine how it depends upon having the right kind of context, and, like earlier studies, places important question marks over restrictive performativity regimes. Standardized approaches to children’s services, he argues, stifle initiative among staff and have ‘failed to enable service users to define what a service’s outcomes should be’. In particular, in top-down ‘command and control’ structures, it becomes impossible to establish dialogue between key workers, children, families and other professionals. The issues raised by this article are particularly important once we recognize the diversity of children and families in contemporary societies.</p>
<p>In parallel to this study, Divya Jindal-Snape, Dundee, Scotland and Dan Davies, Bath Spa, England, have produced a systematic literature review concerning creative environments for learning. They examine what school conditions best promote creative skills development. Among the aspects they identify we find play, pedagogies involving tasks and problem-solving, and more open-ended investigations in science. Play-rich environments lead to more originality in open tasks and better communications. A crucial and often neglected issue is referred to as ‘possibility thinking’, the recognition that things can be different, that particular events are not inevitable, that the world can be changed. Some of the research they discuss demonstrates that creative approaches are also valid in areas of deprivation, contrary to much-cited studies which show that students in these areas tend to receive less creative teaching.</p>
<p>The notion of ‘student voice’ has been seen as a benign and gentle means to help democratize schools and make them more humane environments. However, Carol Robinson and Carol Taylor, from Brighton and Sheffield Hallam Universities, England, subject this to critical scrutiny, not from negative motives but to insist that barriers of power imbalance cannot be skirted over. They examine the overt and tacit power dimensions behind ‘students as researchers’ as a specific form of student voice. The questions they raise involve the parameters within which students choose their research issue, the relative power dynamics involving teachers and university researchers, and how the findings are acted upon. Their study draws upon, and develops, theories of power and participation from Foucault, Bourdieu, Hart and others. As they express it, ‘power conditions what is possible in Students as Researchers work’ and ‘Student voices may be co-opted by dominant school agendas.’ Their insightful conclusion is that schools cannot be democratized by the back door.</p>
<p>Participatory self-evaluation of schools remains a crucial foundation for sustainable change, and Jill Aldridge and Kate Ala’l of Perth, Australia, report on the development of a questionnaire to evaluate students’ perceptions of school climate. It places a particular emphasis on the extent to which they feel welcome, and are connected to the school, but also covers other issues such as their perceptions of bullying and their likelihood of reporting problems to teachers. This important aspect of school self-evaluation is easily neglected in a forest of performance targets, despite the well-established link between ethos or relationships and student commitment and achievement.</p>
<p>The final article concerns aspects of the work of schools and their senior staff which are particularly important in areas of high youth unemployment. Stephen McKinney and his team, involving researchers from both Glasgow University and the City Council, Scotland, focus on how schools can help leavers find positive initial destinations of school leavers. This issue is too easy to neglect in accountability frameworks which focus on examination success and university access, but is crucially important in situations of chronic unemployment, exacerbated by the current pressures of Austerity. Their detailed investigation compares schools that are more or less successful in this. They highlight the importance of key members of staff in senior positions, their need to understand family situations, and their detailed knowledge of local employers. These dedicated teachers are prepared to intervene proactively both with families and potential employers, careers officers and of course the young people themselves.</p>
