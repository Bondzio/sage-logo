<abstract>
<p>A three-dimensional polymer composite system consisting of polyvinyl alcohol/gelatin (PVA/GE) was fabricated via the electrospinning method and physically cross linked by methanol treatment. The effects of cross-linking between PVA/GE blend on physical, mechanical, and biological properties were investigated. After treating with methanol, PVA/GE mats become dense, hard, and aggregative with increased resistance to water dissolution. Osteoblasts like MG-63 cells were seeded on the surfaces of the cross linked PVA/GE mats and were found to attach firmly by expressing philopodial extensions. In addition, MTT assay and Western Blot analysis confirmed that the cells readily proliferated on the cross linked PVA/GE scaffolds. The osteoblast cell–matrix interaction demonstrated that the active biocompatibility of the mats was facilitated by using GE and cross-linking. In conclusion, our results suggest that cross-linked PVA/GE scaffolds hold promise for tissue engineering applications, especially in the field of artificial bone implant.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211401932" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several new promising approaches in tissue engineering have recently been developed to create biological alternatives for various regenerating tissues. Several requirements are necessary in the design of tissue engineering scaffolds, including a high porosity, large surface area, adequate pore size, and uniformly distributed interconnected porous structures throughout the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211401932">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211401932">2</xref></sup> Biodegradable polymeric fiber structures can provide a large surface area, and a relatively high porosity, which can be optimized for specific applications. Due to the structural similarity between electrospun polymeric mats and the collagen fiber arrangement in the natural extracellular matrix component of bone, the electrospinning process has drawn a great deal of attention in scaffold processing for tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211401932">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211401932"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211401932">5</xref></sup> In addition, electrospinning is regularly used to fabricate nano-fibrous structures from a number of natural synthetic polymers, such as collagen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211401932">6</xref></sup> chitosan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211401932">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211401932"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211401932">9</xref></sup> silk fibroin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211401932">10</xref></sup> hyaluronic acid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211401932">11</xref></sup> poly(<sc>l</sc>-lactide),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211401932">12</xref></sup> and polycaprolactone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211401932">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211401932"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211401932">15</xref></sup> among others. Within the last few years, this technique has proven to be especially suitable for biomedical applications, including tissue engineering of scaffolds, wound dressings, drug delivery, and in other fields such as medical implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211401932">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211401932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211401932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211401932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211401932"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211401932">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Biodegradable polymers have been proposed as a possible alternative to other tissue engineering materials and have gained a large amount of attention. These polymers can be easily processed into three-dimensional porous structures with the proper degradation behavior and mechanical strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211401932">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211401932">23</xref></sup> Among the biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), gelatin (GE) and their blends have extensive applications as surgical sutures, implant materials, drug carriers, and scaffolds for tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211401932">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211401932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211401932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211401932"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211401932"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211401932">29</xref></sup> PVA is a semi-crystalline polymer that possesses good chemical and thermal stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211401932">30</xref></sup> PVA is a nonhazardous material, has no negative effect on animals, and does not cause any injuries to the skin upon contact. Due to their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, GE fibers are widely used in a variety of biomedical applications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211401932">31</xref></sup> including wound or burn dressings, surgical treatments, and tissue engineering of bone, skin, and cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211401932">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211401932">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211401932">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, GE fibers can be easily extended into three-dimensional structures of woven, knitted, and nonwoven structures. This is mainly derived from the fact that GE is a natural polymer that has well-known wound healing abilities and a biological aptitude for stimulating cell proliferation. PVA/GE nano-fibrous membranes with different compositions could have different clinical applications, especially the controlled release of drugs and bone tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211401932">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most common strategy employed to engineer bone is to use a scaffold combined with osteoblast cells, or cells that can mature/differentiate into osteoblasts and regulatory factors that promote cell attachment, differentiation, and mineralized bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211401932">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211401932">33</xref></sup> However, the requirements for designing and production of an ideal scaffold for bone regeneration are very complex and not yet fully understood. It is generally agreed that the scaffold must be a biocompatible, porous (more than 90% and pore sizes between 100 and 350 µm), interconnected, and permeable structure in order to permit the ingress of cells and nutrients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211401932">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211401932">33</xref></sup> Clearly, structures designed with biodegradable fibers can meet all these criteria and may serve as a scaffold for the engineering of bone. Many different fiber-based polymeric matrices have been tested with different cell types to create a bone construct.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211401932">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211401932">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211401932">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211401932">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fabrication of a composite material from PVA and GE nano-fibers for using in tissue engineering or in guided tissue regeneration, particularly for bone regeneration, has already been reported earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211401932">35</xref></sup> In that study, nano-structured scaffolds of PVA/GE blends were fabricated via electrospinning and analyzed <italic>in vitro</italic>. The hydrophilic of this biocomposite resulted in the ability to support osteoblast cell MG-63 attachment and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211401932">36</xref></sup> However, due to their good solubility at room or body temperature, hydrophilic scaffolds made from PVA/GE blends were easily dissolved in water or cell culture mediums. Therefore, a cross-linking step was needed prior to <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis to increase the resistance of the scaffold to dissolution in water. The purpose of this study was to better understand the effect of cross-linking the PVA/GE blends. These effects were assessed using a number of techniques, including SEM, DSC, tensile strength, and contact angle. Moreover in order to understand the initial behavior of osteoblast cells, cellular adhesion, proliferation, and toxicity were assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> using osteoblast like MG-63 cell line.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328211401932"><title>Electrospinning setting</title>
<p>Aqueous PVA solutions (12 w/v %) were dissolved in deionized water at 80°C with constant stirring for at least 3 h and electrospun to obtain the PVA mat. 12 w/v % GE solutions in a solvent consisting of deionized water: acetic acid = 1:9 were prepared at room temperature under gentle stirring for 30 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211401932">37</xref></sup> and subjected to electrospinning. To obtain the PVA/GE blend, similar concentrations were used for both PVA and GE solutions. Then, the GE solution was added to the PVA solution at specific volumes to obtain a PVA/GE weight ratio of 2/8. Owing to the excellent biocompatibility of GE, the PVA/GE = 2/8 biocomposite was chosen for further investigation. The mixture was then stirred for an additional 15 min before electrospinning.</p>
<p>For electrospinning (eS-robot, Electrospinning/Spray system), the solutions were placed into a 10 mL syringe fitted to a needle with a tip (diameter of 25 gages, inner diameter 0.25 mm), a syringe pump (lure-lock type, Korea) was set to a constant feeding rate of 0.5–1.0 mL/h, and a grounded cylindrical stainless steel mandrel was used to collect the mat. The electrospinning voltage was directly supplied by a high DC voltage power supply (NNC–30 kV–2 mA portable type, Korea). A piece of aluminum foil, which was used as the collector, was located 10 cm from the capillary tip. The electrostatic field was controlled at 22 kV and electrospinning was performed at room temperature.</p>
<p>Electrospun PVA mats have been stabilized against disintegration in water by treatment with methanol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211401932">38</xref></sup> In this study, Electrospun PVA/GE mats were stabilized against disintegration in water through treatment with methanol for several h (8-24 h; 24 h is typical) by immersing the mats in methanol. Then, the methanol-treated PVA/GE mat was dried in a ventilated hood at room temperature overnight.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211401932"><title>Characterization</title>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211401932"><title>Morphology analysis</title>
<p>The morphology of the electrospun fibers and fiber diameters were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7401 F). The diameter of at least 10 different positions on the fiber mat was measured. A small section of the fiber mat was placed on the SEM sample holder and sputter coated with platinum (Cressington 108 Auto). An accelerating voltage of 15 kV was used to acquire the SEM images.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0885328211401932"><title>Differential scanning calorimetry</title>
<p>DSC has been widely used to examine the miscibility of polymer blends and cross-linkable polymers by measuring thermal properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328211401932">39</xref></sup> The crystal melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of the membranes was measured using DSC (METTLER TOLEDO KOREA – DSC822e) with a sample weight of 3–5 mg under a nitrogen atmosphere. The samples were heated from 0 to 250°C at a scanning speed of 10°C/min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211401932"><title>Contact angles measurement</title>
<p>In order to track changes in water resistant of cross-linked PVA/GE mat, water contact angles of uncross-linked and cross-linked PVA/GE nanofibers mat were measured using a <italic>EasyDrop</italic> Contact Angle Measuring System (DSA1, KRUSS GmbH) apparatus. A droplet of water was placed on the uncross-linked and cross-linked PVA/GE nanofibers mat located on a sample table. For contact angle measurement, the thin needle for sessile drops was used. The drop is usually produced at the tip of the needle and then picked up by turning the sample table upwards and back downwards again. The drop is illuminated from one side and a camera at the opposite side records an image of the drop. The drop image was transferred to a computer and shown on the monitor. The DSA software contains time-prove tools for analyzing the drop image with whose help it is possible to calculate the contact angle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328211401932"><title>Tensile strength</title>
<p>The mechanical properties of the scaffolds were assessed using tensile tests of thin membranes. In order to use the as-fabricated fibers in the tensile tests, a method to handle and align the ultrafine fibers is required. The frame was cut into rectangular pieces along the vertical lines. The gage length (20 mm) of the electrospun fibers was determined by the gap between the parallel strips of the frame. The cardboard partitions were cut along the discontinuous lines before the fiber was stretched. The tensile strength of the electrospun fibrous membranes was determined using a universal testing machine (R&amp;B UNITECH – T, Korea). All samples prepared from the electrospun fibrous membranes were in the form of a rectangular shape with dimensions of width × length = 4 mm × 20 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211401932">35</xref></sup> The thicknesses of the samples were measured using a digital micrometer that had a precision of 1 µm. At least five samples were stretched to failure for each type of electrospun fibrous membrane. The measurements were taken with a 500 g.f load cell. Load–deformation data were recorded at a deforming speed of 0.5 mm/s, and the stress–strain curve of the nano-fibrous structure was constructed from the load–deformation curve.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0885328211401932"><title>Cells and cell culture</title>
<p>MG-63 cells were maintained and suspended in a humidified incubator at 37°C and a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (incubator, ASTEC, Japan) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 g/mL of glutamine (Sigma), 100 units of penicillin–streptomycin as an antibiotics, 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Sigma) and 0.25 µg/mL of fungizone (Bio-Whittaker).</p>

<sec id="sec11-0885328211401932"><title>Cell viability assay</title>
<p>Cellular survivability or toxicological evaluation against cross linked PVA, GE, and PVA/GE blend has been evaluated by using MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211401932">40</xref></sup> This standard test method is based on exposing the cells to the fluid extract of the test materials and control materials. The extract solution of the PVA, GE, or PVA/GE blend was prepared according to the protocol as outlined in ISO 10993.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328211401932">41</xref></sup> In brief, to determine the cytotoxicity of osteoblast-like MG-63 cells on the electrospun samples, samples were incubated with DMEM media at 37°C for 72 h in a shaking incubator at 100 RPM (Rotation per Minute). The extract solutions were diluted serially with media (0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, and 100%). For the control, 100% media was used to compare among the dilution, and then 200 µL of extracted and diluted solution was added in a 96-well plate. The 96-well plate was previously (24 h before adding the extract solutions) incubated and coated with osteoblast like MG-63 cells (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well). The plate was then incubated in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C for 1 day, 3 days, and 5 days. In MTT, assay cell survivability is measured through the production of purple colors by the reaction of dehydrogensae enzymes of living cells and MTT. Metabolically active and viable cells produce mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzymes during incubation in media which can be read out through the change of color intensity by a spectrophotometer. The optical density (OD) corresponds to the viable cell numbers. Therefore, cell survival and proliferation at the different dilutions and time points were quantified by adding 100 µL of the MTT solution (20 µg/100 mL) to each of the wells. After 4 h of incubation, the OD values of the solution were measured using an ELISA reader (EL, 312, Biokinetics reader, Bio-Tek instruments) at a wavelength of 595 nm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0885328211401932"><title>Optical microscope study</title>
<p>In order to observe directly whether viable cell numbers increase after treating the osteoblast like MG-63 cells with samples extract at day 1, 3, and 5, an inverted light microscope (Olympus, 1 X 71) attached with LCD monitor (Samsung) was used. After 70–80% confluent growth in the subculture flask, cells were trypsinized (0.25% Trypsin-EDTA), detached, and counted. Approximately 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells/mL media was pipetted into the wells of a microtiter plate containing 24 wells. The plate was then incubated in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37°C) for 24 h. After seeding cells into the wells of microtiter plates, media was removed carefully and replaced with the extract solution of the samples and the microtiter plate was kept back into the CO<sub>2</sub> incubator either for 1 day, 3 days, or 5 days. After finishing each of the incubation periods, cell growth in the microtiter plate was observed using an inverted light microscope.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0885328211401932"><title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Western blot analysis is one of the most commonly used methods to evaluate cell proliferation. The cells were rinsed and harvested using a lysis buffer (Tris 50 mM, pH 7.4, NaCl 40 mM, EDTA 1 mM, Triton X-100 0.5%, Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> 1.5 mM, NaF 50 mM, sodium pyrophosphate 10 mM, glycerolphosphate 10 mM, PMSF 1 mM, Protease inhibitor cocktail 10 mM), vortexed, and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C. Aliquots (30 µg) of the proteins were analyzed via Western blotting using a 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal anti-PCNA. An anti-β actin antibody was used as the loading control. The immunocomplexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0885328211401932"><title>Cell seeding on the PVA/GE scaffolds</title>
<p>Electrospun nano-fibrous PVA/GE were initially sterilized under UV light for 6 h per side, sterilized further with 70% ethanol (30 min), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and finally soaked in DMEM for 1 h. MG-63 cells were seeded on 1 mm of the PVA/GE scaffold (20 mm in diameter), and tissue culture plate (TCP-control) at a density of 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211401932">2</xref></sup> in 24-well plate culture medium with 10% FBS and 1% PS. The growth behaviors of MG-63 were observed on 1, 3, and 5 days by SEM after seeding on the PVA/GE scaffolds. For SEM (JSM-5410LV JEOL) observation, the cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde (v/v) and dehydrated in ethanol solutions (50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%). The dehydrated cells were dried in Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, ≥99%, Sigma) and coated by gold sputtering.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211401932">Figure 1</xref>(d), the nano-fiber structure of the PVA/GE blend was not altered by cross-linking and dense fibers were obtained. Treatment of the PVA/GE fiber mats with methanol for 24 h stabilized the fibers against disintegration when in contact with water. This may have occurred due to the removal of residual water within the fibers by the alcohol, allowing PVA–water hydrogen bonding and GE–water amine bonding to be replaced by intermolecular polymer hydrogen bonding resulting in additional crystallization. When an electrospun PVA/GE mat (which is white because of light scattering from the fibrous structure) was immersed in water, the mat instantaneously shrunk and beame a clear, gelatinous material. Thus, the unique nanofibrous structure of the electrospun material was lost in an aqueous environment. However, we have found an apparently new and simple method to physically cross-link electrospun materials using lower alcohols such as methanol. Soaking the electrospun PVA/GE mat in methanol for 24 h preserved the integrity of the mat when it was immersed in water. Methanol resulted in an effective way to fabricate PVA/GE water-resistant membrane and make it possible to be used for tissue engineering scaffolds.

<p>The amount of GE added to the PVA solution was up to 80%. Acetic acid, which was used as the solvent for GE, has been shown to reduce the surface tension of a solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211401932">37</xref></sup> Therefore, the surface tension of the PVA/GE blend might be decreased with the addition of GE solution in this study. Because of the effect of surface tension, the diameter of the PVA/GE nano-fibers was smaller than the PVA nano-fibers and larger than GE nano-fibers (as observed by the SEM). The average diameters of the PVA/GE blends before and after cross-linking by methanol were 100 ± 10 and 150 ± 10 nm, respectively. Moreover, the nano-fibers had a fine morphology without the presence of beads. Because of the nano-size of the PVA/GE scaffolds and their overall porous structure, the electrospun fibers had a high, specific surface area, which is beneficial for tissue engineering applications.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211401932">Figure 2</xref> shows the DSC thermograms of the PVA, GE, and PVA/GE blend and cross-linked PVA/GE blend prepared by electrospinning. Two peaks were observed in the DSC scans of the blend membranes, one corresponds to PVA (221°C) and the other due to GE (88°C). These results clearly showed that the blend fibers of PVA and GE were immiscible in the as-spun state due to the limited solubility of one in the other. As demonstrated in these experiments, it is difficult to form miscible polymer blends using a 99+% hydrolyzed PVA because of the high surface tension and high viscosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328211401932">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328211401932">43</xref></sup> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211401932">Figure 2</xref>, the two peaks of the cross-linked PVA/GE blend increased up to 227°C and 95°C compared with the uncross-linked PVA/GE blend.

<p>These results clearly indicate that the blend fibers of PVA and GE were immiscible in the as-spun state due to the limited solubility of one in the other. At a composition of 20% PVA and 80% GE, the methanol treatment promoted the formation of fiber aggregates on the PVA/GE scaffold. Methanol treatment not only preserved the fibrous structure of the PVA/GE mat but also significantly increased the formation of fiber aggregates on the PVA/GE scaffold. When immersed in water, methanol treated PVA/GE mats swelled significantly, thus softening the material while still maintaining the characteristics of a mechanically stable hydrogel. Importantly, the electrospun PVA/GE fibers can be stabilized against disintegration in water by simply soaking in methanol. It was concluded that methanol treatment increased the degree of crystallinity of the PVA/GE fibers, thereby increasing the number of physical crosslinks responsible for fiber stabilization in water.</p>
<p>The methanol treated mat appeared to retain a significant degree of its fibrous character. Without methanol treatment, even though the PVA/GE electrospun mat does not dissolve in water, it completely lost its mechanical integrity, forming a soft, gelatinous mass. In contrast, the water-swollen, methanol-treated PVA/GE mat remained. These observations can be verified by examining individual fibers using a light microscope.</p>
<p>Thereby, we confirmed that methanol can be used as a physical cross-linking agent for PVA/GE nano-fibers. In addition, the GE component of the PVA/GE scaffold was gradually dissolved during cell culture, which created more space for cell migration because of the immiscibility of PVA and GE.</p>

<sec id="sec20-0885328211401932"><title>Contact angle measurement</title>
<p>The specific contact angle for both uncross-linked and cross-linked PVA/GE is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211401932">Figure 3</xref> to observe and predict how water dissolute on the surfaces before and after cross linking of the mat. The contact angle of uncross-linked PVA/GE blend was measured to be 2.2 ± 0.3°. Both PVA and GE are very soluble to water and their physical blending by electrospinning did not alter the solubility in water so much. This might be because of the poor aggregation of the fibers and high hydrophilicity of the mat. However, after cross-linking with methanol treatment, the solubility of the mat in water decreased and the contact angle increased dramatically. The contact angle of the cross-linked PVA/GE was found to be 52.5 ± 0.5°. From scanning electron images, it was found that after cross-linking, fibers become more dense and aggregative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211401932">Figure 1</xref>). Also the surface area of the mat increased after cross linking. Therefore more air might be trapped in the cross linked fiber mat than the uncross-linked fiber which at the same time contributes to decrease the actual contact area of a water droplet on a cross-linked mat. The high contact angle of the cross-linked PVA/GE blend made the fiber mat less hydrophilic than that of the uncross-linked PVA/GE.

In these experiments, the blending of PVA and GE was shown to result in an increasing stress compared with PVA alone and increasing strain compared with GE alone. On the other hand, the toughness of PVA may have compensated for the brittle characteristics of GE. The tensile modulus of the uncross-linked and cross-linked PVA/GE nano-fibers were around 3.6 and 4.2 MPa, respectively, and the tensile strains were 19% and 31%, respectively.

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211401932">Figure 4</xref> indicates that the tensile strain of the cross-linked PVA/GE nanofibers was sufficient to support proliferation and mineralization of osteoblast cells.

<p>Yao et al reported that the mechanical strength of the PVA mat was increased due to increased crystallinity following post-spinning treatment with methanol. By removing residual water within the fibers by the alcohol treatment, the degree of crytallinity was increased, which in turn increased the physical cross-links and mechanical properties, making the fiber mat stable from disintegration in water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328211401932">38</xref></sup> As the cross-linking by methanol in PVA/GE blend was found to produce a stable scaffold system in water, there is the possibility that high crystallinity might result in high mechanical properties. Yang et al. reported that the tensile strength of 100% PVA and 10% PVA was 11.6 MPa and 2.4 MPa, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211401932">25</xref></sup> However, in this study, a simple cross-linking step resulted in a tensile strength of 4.20 ± 0.40 MPa (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211401932">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, for bone applications, multiple mat layers should be hot pressed together, which is assumed to further increase the mechanical properties of the scaffold system.

<p>The MTT assay, which is a rapid, standardized, sensitive, and inexpensive method to determine cellular viability and proliferation or whether a material contains significant quantities of biologically harmful extracts, is the first step used to screen the biocompatibility of a biomaterial. The effect of PVA, GE, and cross-linked PVA/GE nano-fibers on cell viability (cytotoxicity) and proliferation of MG-63 were examined using the MTT assay, which is a colorimetric assay that measures the metabolic activity of viable cells. The cytotoxictities of MG-63 on the electrospun PVA, GE, and cross-linked PVA/GE are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211401932">Figure 5</xref>. Based on the cytotoxicity results, a fairly acceptable viability of the cells was observed on GE (&gt;90% at 100% extract solution) and PVA/GE (&gt;85% at 100% extract solution) while PVA membrane showed a slightly lower viability (70% at 100% extract solution). Although the biocompatibility of PVA was low, the general survival rate of the cells for PVA/GE scaffold was satisfactory; therefore, the PVA/GE scaffolds were not toxic to the MG-63 cells and could be used for tissue engineering scaffolds.

Especially, at day 5, cellular growth was almost confluent. However, in case of cross-linked PVA/GE, cellular growth pattern was better than that of the uncross-linked PVA/GE. In fact, this result corresponds with the cell viability and proliferation results very well. Cell morphology was also found very well with typical spindle shape of osteoblasts with an average diameter of 10–20 µm.

<p>In order to determine on the molecular scale if the MG-63 cells were proliferating on the scaffolds, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is a marker for the S phase (synthesis phase) of the cell cycle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328211401932">44</xref></sup> was used as a marker for cell proliferation in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0885328211401932">Figure 8</xref>). Because the synthesis phase in the cell cycle is related to cell proliferation, an increase in the level of protein expression can be used as a measure of the status of DNA synthesis in the S phase of cell cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328211401932">44</xref></sup> The expression of PCNA was evaluated using western blot method after collecting total proteins from lysed cells at day 1, 3, and 5.

The expression of this protein in GE was similar throughout 1, 3, and 5 days of cell culture. However, for the PVA/GE cross-linked scaffold, the intensity of the band slightly decreased at day 5, suggesting that cross-linked scaffold promoted cell proliferation by reducing the level of toxicity of PVA alone or in other words, the addition of GE was beneficial to the scaffold system containing PVA. This result is in agreement with the MTT assay where it was shown that cells on the PVA/GE cross-linked scaffold proliferated better than that on the PVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211401932">Figure 6</xref>).

<p>Various pore diameters were formed within the nano-fiber structures and the interconnected porous structure provided a large surface area for cell residence and proliferation, and effectively simplified the exchange of nutrients between the scaffold environments. Osteoblasts cultured on composite nano-fibrous scaffolds showed higher proliferation rates and formed a multilayer of cells on the surface of the composite nano-fibrous scaffolds. Both PVA and GE are hydrophilic polymers, which is a beneficial attribute for cell attachment. The surface topography of nano-fibers plays an important role in cell behavior, including cell adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885328211401932">45</xref></sup> It is known that human cells can attach and organize themselves well around fibers with diameters smaller than those of the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885328211401932">46</xref></sup> This might explain the behavior of the MG-cells on the combined scaffolds, which had a nano-scale structure.</p>

These scaffolds provided a surface for cell residence, interaction, and growth. After 1 day of culture, the MG-63 cells tended to adopt a normal phenotypic shape and adhered according to the nano-fiber orientation. Cell shape was observed to be round to oval with philopotial extension. After 3 days of culture, the cells exhibited a flat morphology over the membrane and integrated with the surrounding fibers. After 5 days of culture, the cell number reached a plateau, possibly because the cells may have occupied all of the available spaces on the prepared scaffold. The number of cells seemed to grow slowly after 5 days of seeding due to the degradation of the hydrophilic PVA/GE. As PVA/GE degraded the fiber structure inside and on the surface of the scaffold dissolved, retarding cell growth. Overall, this result indicates that nano-fibrous PVA/GE positively promoted cell–matrix and cell–cell interactions.

<p>PVA/GE fibers were produced using the electrospinning technique. A cross-linking treatment with methanol was used to decrease the dissolution of the fibers in water.
