<abstract>
<p>The relationship between breakfast consumption and academic success has been extensively studied over the past 30 years. Despite the wide availability of school breakfast programs and the preponderance of evidence that breakfast consumption has positive effects on a student’s ability to learn and function in the school setting, many students do not eat breakfast. A survey of students at a large Midwestern high school identified the main barriers to breakfast consumption as not having enough time in the morning to eat and not feeling hungry before school. A program that included extending breakfast cafeteria hours and providing a mobile cart that served a complete school breakfast during students’ morning study hall classes was implemented. By the end of the school year, average daily school breakfast participation increased by more than 400%. In a student survey conducted 6 months after implementation of the program, more than a quarter of the students reported purchasing food from the cart.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the wide availability of school breakfast programs nationally and the preponderance of evidence that breakfast consumption has a positive impact on a student’s ability to learn and function in the school setting, many students do not eat breakfast. Nationally, only 47% of children who participated in the free/reduced price lunch program also participated in the breakfast program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513476094">Food Research and Action Center, 2010</xref>). In a study of high school students’ breakfast eating habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840513476094">Sweeney &amp; Horishita, 2005</xref>), 57% had skipped breakfast on the survey day. The most common reasons for not eating breakfast included a lack of time and not being able to eat early in the morning. Other identified barriers to School Breakfast Program participation included the perceived stigma of participating in a program designed for low-income students and the need to arrive to school early in order to eat breakfast before school started (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513476094">Basch, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of adequate nutrition for school-age children became a national concern decades ago. The U.S. Congress created the School Breakfast Program in 1966 to address the nutritional needs of low-income children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840513476094">United States Department of Agriculture[USDA], 2012</xref>). Since that time, the relationship between breakfast consumption and academic performance has been extensively studied. As early as 1987, students who participated in the school breakfast program had higher standardized test scores and lower levels of absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840513476094">Meyers, Sampson, Weitzman, Rogers, &amp; Kayne, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>More recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513476094">Kleinman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513476094">Murphy et al., 1998</xref>) have demonstrated a positive correlation between school breakfast program participation and academic grades, especially in mathematics, along with a reduction in absences and tardies. Sixth-grade students in a Midwest urban school district who ate breakfast had significantly higher measures of academic progress math scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513476094">Edwards, Mauch, &amp; Winkelman, 2011</xref>). Students with low nutrient intakes had lower grade point averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513476094">Kleinman et al., 2002</xref>) and even scored lower on intelligence quotient tests, such as the Weschsler Intelligence scale for Children–Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513476094">Alaimo, Olson, &amp; Frongillo, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to its impact on academic performance, breakfast participation has been shown to have a positive impact on psychosocial behavior. Behavior rating scales completed by teachers, parents, and students at three inner-city schools found an increase in reports of depression, anxiety, and hyperactivity in children who rarely ate school breakfast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513476094">Murphy et al., 1998</xref>). In a study of high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513476094">Widenhorn-Muller, Hille, Klenk, &amp; Weiland, 2010</xref>), male participants reported feeling more positive after they ate breakfast and both male and female students reported that they were more alert after breakfast consumption.</p>
<p>One inner-city high school attempted to eliminate students’ identified barriers to eating breakfast by offering a midmorning nutrition break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513476094">Sweeney, Tucker, Reynosa, &amp; Glaser, 2006</xref>). Results indicated that 69% participated at least once a week. Students who participated in the program reported that they were able to focus more often, were less tired, and had a reduction in headaches and stomachaches. At a large, urban school district, breakfast participation was increased by 24% when the traditional breakfast program served in the cafeteria before school was supplemented with a program that delivered breakfast to the students’ classroom after the beginning of the school day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513476094">D.C. Hunger Solutions, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the evidence from numerous studies linking breakfast participation to improved learning, the U.S. House of Representatives issued a resolution in 2009 to encourage all states to improve access to school breakfast programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840513476094">USDA, 2012</xref>). In addition, The Healthy, Hungry-Free Kids Act of 2010 authorized the provision of grants to state and local agencies to expand school breakfast programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840513476094">USDA, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe an innovative school-based breakfast program that was developed to increase school breakfast participation of students at a Midwestern suburban high school. The program was designed to provide students with opportunities to obtain a complete breakfast after the beginning of the school day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1059840513476094">
<title>Conceptual Model</title>
<p>The health promotion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513476094">Pender, Murdaugh, &amp; Parsons, 2002</xref>) was used to guide this school health program. The health promotion model focuses on how participants’ characteristics, as well as their perceptions, influence their health-related behaviors. Thus, personal factors influencing teenagers’ breakfast-intake habits include their natural biorhythms, their motivation to perform well at school, and peer influence. Situational influences and options, such as having food readily available to students when they are hungry, impact their diet choices. This program was designed to reduce barriers to action and provide healthy options. The results of this program show that once the barriers were removed, many students chose the health-promoting behavior of eating food in the morning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840513476094">
<title>Background and Setting</title>
<p>The setting for this program was a public high school located in a Midwestern suburban area with a population of 2,560 students in the 2010–2011 school year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513476094">School District U-46, 2011</xref>). Approximately 43% of students came from a minority background and 27.5% belonged to low-income families (families with incomes at or below 130% of federal poverty level, which qualifies them for free meals at school).</p>
<p>Based on anecdotal evidence, the school nurse was concerned that many students were starting their school day without any nutritional intake. This issue was discussed by the school’s Wellness Team, a collaborative committee chaired by the school nurse. Members included the school’s food services supervisor, the health/physical education (PE) building administrator, a classroom teacher, two parents, and a student. The teacher and administrator on the team also expressed concern that students were reporting that they did not eat any food before school started. The Wellness Team strategized on how to increase school breakfast participation in the spring of 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840513476094">
<title>Needs Assessment</title>
<p>Before proposing any interventions, a needs assessment was completed. A convenience sample of all students enrolled in PE classes were asked to complete a survey on their morning food consumption habits (See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1059840513476094">Appendix A</xref>). The needs assessment survey was also used to determine if the students at this school identified the same barriers as reported in the literature. This population was chosen because PE is required for a majority of students. In addition, the PE administrator was on the Wellness Team and able to ask PE teachers to distribute and collect the survey. Of the 1,644 students enrolled in PE, 1,405 (86%) returned the survey. The responses to the paper surveys were tabulated by four student pages who worked in the nurse’s office. Almost 63% of students reported not eating any food in the morning at least once a week (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840513476094">Table 1</xref>). Over 18% never ate breakfast food. When asked what kept them from eating food in the morning, 61% of students reported not having enough time before school and 32% reported not being hungry before school. Additional reasons for not eating breakfast included not being allowed to eat food in classrooms, the perception that food at school was too expensive, and the lack of available food after school started. At the beginning of the 2010–2011 school year, school breakfast was available in the cafeteria for about 45 min before the start of the school day. Prior to the launching of this program, an average of only 80 school breakfasts were served daily (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513476094">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Program Planning</title>
<sec id="section6-1059840513476094">
<title>Description of the Breakfast Program</title>
<p>The goal of this program was to make food available to students during the morning after school started and to increase breakfast participation. The breakfast line in the cafeteria would remain open until lunch preparation began. Students who had a morning study hall in the cafeteria would be able to purchase breakfast food and eat while they studied. In addition, a mobile cart stocked with breakfast food would move throughout the hallways and stop at the morning study hall classrooms. The cart would offer a complete school breakfast and an assortment of à la carte items (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840513476094">Figure 1</xref>). Students would step into the hallway, acquire their food, and then return to their study hall to eat it in the classroom while they studied. The program would be available to all students.</p>

</fig>
<p>No hot meals would be provided on the breakfast cart. Most of the food on the cart would be shelf stable, meaning it was in packaging and did not require refrigeration. An ice-filled tub would be used to keep some items cold, such as the milk and yogurt. The only other food to be provided on the cart that did not have a long shelf life was the fresh fruit, which would be kept in a bowl and replenished daily.</p>
<p>The complete school breakfast to be sold on the breakfast cart would meet the minimum nutrient and calorie levels set for Grades 7–12 by the USDA (2012), including 12 grams of protein, 300 mg of calcium, 3.4 mg iron, and the recommended daily allowances of Vitamin A and C. Fat content would not exceed 30% and saturated fat content would be less than 10%. Only skim and 1% milk products and whole grain bread and cereals would be sold. Examples of the main breakfast item included cereal bars, cereal bowls, bagels with low fat cream cheese, and peanut butter sandwich. Students would also be allowed to take 2 other items, such a piece of fresh fruit, canned fruit, milk, cheese sticks, and yogurt. While milk and fruit would always be offered; many items would be rotated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840513476094">
<title>Elimination of Barriers</title>
<p>Before this proposal could move forward, the Wellness Team had to address the barriers to its implementation. The first barrier was gaining the approval of the school administrators. The principal supported the concept but had reservations about serving food in the cafeteria after school started since it was a study hall site. Administration was also concerned about the impact serving food in the study hall classrooms would have on cleanliness and decorum. To address these concerns, a list of rules was developed and approved by the principal. Members of the Wellness Team volunteered to go into all morning study hall classes and explain the program and rules to students. Students were informed that breakfast cart privileges for their classroom would be suspended if students did not clean up their trash or did not remain quiet and study during class.</p>
<p>The next barrier was acquiring approval of the school district food services administrator. The administrator was invited to a Wellness Team meeting and the program proposal was described in detail. Because school food service programs are being encouraged by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to increase school breakfast participation, the school district food services director was interested in any proposals that focused on this issue. The Wellness Team presented the literature review that the team had already conducted, along with the results of the student survey. After the presentation, the director of food services encouraged the Wellness Team to go forward with their proposal at this school site and committed food services funds to pay for half of the computer that would be needed to run the breakfast cart.</p>
<p>Initially there was resistance to the program from some faculty members. To allay potential concerns of the school staff, a thorough description of the plan was presented at a faculty meeting. The principal also supported of the program at the meeting. Staff was informed that Wellness Team members would speak to the students prior to the launching of the cart and warn them that breakfast cart privileges would be revoked if students did not properly dispose of their trash. Teachers were able to limit participation if they had reservations about the negative effects. The number of garbage cans in study hall classrooms was increased and maintenance staff agreed to empty them more frequently. The school nurse also met individually with teachers to discuss their apprehensions. Some of their concerns were easily resolved by reinforcing with students' the need to clean up. As students began using the cart and shared information about the cart to their friends, students began requesting the cart in classes that did not have it. The students were able to persuade several of the teachers to change their minds.</p>
<p>The Wellness Team also needed to address the issue of protecting student’s privacy and the perception that school breakfast was only for low-income students. Before the implementation of this program, students used their IDs in the cafeteria to obtain school food. A barcode on their IDs was scanned and money was removed from their accounts or in the case of students on free meals, the computer notated that a free school meal was acquired by the students. This method of payment allowed all students, whether they were paying for their breakfast or participating in the free/reduced breakfast program, to obtain their food in the same manner. The computer did not identify to the other students or the food services employee which method was used to pay for the meal. It was determined that a laptop computer that could scan IDs would be needed, so that the same method of payment could be used on the mobile cart. It was also decided that a small number of healthy à la carte items would also be available for students who did not want to purchase a complete school breakfast.</p>
<p>Initial financial barriers included the need for funds to purchase the laptop and the need for additional staff. The school district food services director approved the hiring of an additional part-time staff member to operate the cart. The director also allocated funds ($1,500) to pay for half of the laptop cost. An existing food services cart was used. The team applied for and received an expanding breakfast grant for $2,500 from a regional dairy council. The grant money was used to cover the remaining cost of the laptop ($1,500), purchase initial supplies for the cart ($193), and to market the program ($807).</p>
<p>The final barrier was determining how to encourage students and parents to participate in the program. The breakfast cart was marketed in several ways. A ceremonial ribbon cutting was conducted on the opening day and all participating students were provided with free meals. A banner was displayed in the cafeteria. Students on the school newspaper and the school’s broadcasting academy were contacted and stories on the cart were produced. Coupons for items on the cart were distributed to students. Samples were also made available when the cart was first implemented.</p>
<p>To market the program to parents, articles were published in the school’s biweekly e-newsletter to parents. The school nurse also sent information to two local newspapers, both of whom sent reporters to the site and published articles on the breakfast cart program. The breakfast cart menu was posted on the school website. The school nurse and food services supervisor developed an informational display for the school’s annual fall back-to-school night. During the evening, school breakfast samples were distributed. The school nurse and food services supervisor were available to answer parents’ questions. Parents’ reactions to the program were positive. Parental permission was not needed for students to purchase food from the cart. However, parents were responsible for providing the money students would need to purchase the breakfast food, with the exception of students receiving free school meals.</p>

<title>Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section9-1059840513476094">
<title>School Breakfast Participation</title>
<p>The extended breakfast hours in the cafeteria were launched September 20, 2010. The number of school breakfasts served nearly tripled during the first 2 weeks of operation (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513476094">Table 2</xref>). The breakfast cart was launched on October 12, 2010, and by the end of the school year, daily school breakfast participation was averaging 324 meals per day, an increase of 400%. Fresh fruit, cereal bars, and milk were popular à la carte items.</p>
<p>The increase in school breakfast participation was the main evidence used to determine program success. However, the Wellness Team was interested in the perceptions students had about the cart and if it was resolving previous barriers to breakfast participation. A follow-up survey was conducted in the spring of 2011(See <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1059840513476094">Appendix B</xref>). Again, all students enrolled in PE were asked how often they ate food in the mornings and whether they had purchased food during their morning study halls. The proportion of students who reported that they had skipped breakfast at least once a week was 8.7% lower when compared to the respondents from the needs assessment survey. Findings also indicated that 42% had taken advantage of the breakfast line in the cafeteria and 27% had purchased food from the breakfast cart (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840513476094">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>There were several limitations to the follow-up survey that limit comparisons to the first survey. The second survey was not conducted with the same student population, since it was conducted 1 year after the first survey. The number of follow-up surveys returned was also lower with 823 (49%) follow-up surveys returned out of the 1,673 students enrolled in PE at the time. Only one question was identical on the two. The evaluation surveys were conducted to indicate students’ needs and impressions and were not intended to provide research data. Despite these limitations, the survey results did provide evidence that students were taking advantage of the expanded breakfast program.</p>
<p>The number of complete school breakfasts continued to rise in the 2011–2012 school year (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513476094">Table 2</xref>). By the end of the first semester, the average daily school breakfast participation was nearly 400 meals per day. It has become so popular with students that the food service employee operating it must call to the cafeteria midmorning on a daily basis to restock food items. Because of the volume of students purchasing food from the cart, the operator cannot currently get to all of the morning study halls. The school’s food services supervisor is in the process of procuring a second laptop so that an additional cart can be launched for the 2012–2013 school year. The program is also being duplicated at other middle and high schools in the school district.</p>

<sec id="section10-1059840513476094">
<title>Long-Term Financial Consequences</title>
<p>Most of the initial costs for this program were covered by grant money and an initial allocation from the school district’s Food Services department. Recurring costs of the program included the cart operator’s salary, the food, and supplies. The amount of money collected from the meals that were sold along with the reimbursement received from the state covered all of the overhead costs. School meal programs that receive reimbursement from the USDA must be nonprofit. The USDA reimburses $1.55/meal for free breakfast, $1.25/meal for reduced breakfast, and $0.27/meal for paid breakfast (USDA, 2012). This school district charges $1.25/meal for paid breakfast and $0.30/meal for reduced breakfast. The program did not generate any food waste. All food sold on the cart was prepackaged and any leftovers were used the following day.</p>

<sec id="section11-1059840513476094">
<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>There were multiple lessons learned during the planning and implementation of this program:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Successfully launching a new program into the school setting requires proper assessment and planning. Evidence from the literature review established the importance of the need being addressed. But it was the collection of site-based evidence that convinced the school staff to go forward with the project.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Getting administrative support early in the planning stages is crucial for program success. Once the school principal and district food services director supported the program, they assisted the wellness team in promoting it to teachers and providing the financial support needed to sustain the program.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Belonging to school health-related listservs was the main source of information on grant opportunities. The grant application process was easier than the team initially expected it to be. A simple application form was submitted with the project proposal and an initial project time line. However, the team learned that it is important to assign one staff member to be the liaison between the school and grantor. There were many reports that had to be submitted and the grantor periodically called for updates.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The school wellness team did several things to market the program, but it was the support from the students that appeared to have the biggest impact.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Because of the large size of this school and the popularity of the cart, the logistics of moving the cart around to all of the morning study halls was not possible. Some alternative ideas to solve this issue might include having a cart stationed in the main hallways or having a separate cart for each floor of the building.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1059840513476094">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>This program demonstrated that students will take advantage of school breakfast if it is offered at time when they are hungry and they have the time to eat it. Schools must sometimes come up with creative ideas to eliminate the barriers that interfere with students’ ability to make health-promoting choices.</p>
<p>In most school districts, school nurses do not control the food services program. Therefore, school nurses who are interested in implementing a similar program will need to collaborate with the director of food services and the school administrators to initiate a change in how breakfast is delivered to students. Having an established Wellness Team that was composed of interested staff, students, and parents made this task easier to accomplish. The Wellness Team worked collaboratively to initiate this program, but most of the ongoing success has been the responsibility of the food services supervisor, and not directly under the control of the school nurse. The food services supervisor involved in this program was an enthusiastic supporter from the initial planning stages. School nurses may need to establish a relationship with the food services supervisors in their schools and share information on the success of this program with them before attempting to develop a similar program.</p>
<p>Initial costs to establish a similar program may be prohibitive for some school districts. However, there are many public and private agencies that are currently providing grants for innovative programs that improve students’ nutritional intake and many are specifically targeted at expanding school breakfast programs. Once this program was established, it proved to be self-sustaining and continues to be popular with the students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1059840513476094">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Developing and implementing this program was challenging. However, it demonstrated that school nurses can introduce successful health promotion programs with proper planning and support. Before initiating this program, school nurses will need to use their leadership skills to recruit team members, organize meetings, and advocate for school health promotion within their schools and in their community. This program will not succeed unless the school nurse brings the interested parties together and organizes the ideas that are generated. The other team members will have many other issues competing for their time. The responsibility to keep school health a priority will be an essential skill for any school nurse interested in implementing this breakfast program or any other sustainable school health promotion plans.</p>
