<abstract>
<p>Purpose: To present a case of aortic sac occlusion using an Amplatzer vascular plug II (AVP). Case report: A patient with sigmoid malignancy and an infrarenal aortic aneurysm ultimately required an axillobifemoral graft for acute limb ischemia. The sac was ligated at subsequent laparotomy. Persistent filling of the sac was seen post surgery, and the sac was successfully occluded with placement of an AVP in the neck of the sac in conjunction with coil embolization of lumbar arteries. Sac occlusion was confirmed at follow-up CT. Conclusion: The AVP was successfully used to occlude an aortic sac after failed surgical ligation, another novel indication for this versatile embolic device.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This case report demonstrates a novel and successful use of an Amplatzer vascular plug (AVP) in the occlusion of the neck of an aortic aneurysm sac after attempted open ligation, another indication for use of this versatile embolic device.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 65-year-old female had a 5.4 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) found incidentally on a staging computed tomography (CT) performed for colorectal carcinoma. The day before elective sigmoid colectomy, the patient was admitted as an emergency with a cold, painful left foot and a CT angiogram demonstrated an acute occlusion of the left iliac system and bilateral renal infarcts, likely secondary to a prothrombotic tendency due to the known malignancy. An endovascular aortouniiliac graft with a right-to-left femoral–femoral crossover graft was planned. Attempted endovascular repair was unsuccessful due to the stenotic disease in the external iliac artery and iliac tortuosity which precluded device deployment despite iliac angioplasty. After prolonged attempts to place the endovascular graft, the procedure was abandoned, and as the flow down the right external iliac was deemed insufficient to support a femoral–femoral crossover graft, and the patient was not a suitable candidate for conversion to open repair at this stage, an axillobifemoral graft was performed (ABFG).</p>
<p>After an uneventful recovery, the patient was then rescheduled for resection of the malignant sigmoid polyp. A Hartmann procedure and ligation of the neck of the aortic aneurysm (using nylon tape) were performed at laparotomy. A repeat CT scan demonstrated that the aorta remained patent, but the sac size was 5.3 cm and this remained stable at 3 months post ligation.</p>
<p>Six months later, follow-up CT demonstrated constriction at the site of aortic ligation, but a patent lumen with hypertrophied lumbar arteries and a sac size which had increased to 5.9 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411433297">Figure 1</xref>
). By this stage, the right common iliac artery had also occluded and the left common iliac artery was occluded at presentation. The case was re-discussed at the multidisciplinary vascular meeting and decision was taken to proceed to endovascular embolization of the lumbar arteries and occlusion of the sac.</p>

<p>Left brachial access was obtained under ultrasound guidance and a 5-F pigtail catheter was sited in the infrarenal aorta. The angiogram showed a patent sac and filling of the 2 large lumbar arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574411433297">Figure 2</xref>
). The pigtail was exchanged for a long 5-F sheath and the lumbar vessels were embolized with coils and a 10 mm AVP (AGA Medical, Golden Valley, Minnesota) was placed into the ligation zone. Post placement angiogram demonstrated an occluded sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574411433297">Figure 3</xref>
). Follow-up CT scan at 3 months after the embolization confirmed sac occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538574411433297">Figure 4</xref>
) and concomitant reduction in sac size from 5.9 to 5.4 cm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Amplatzer vascular plugs are self-expanding devices made from nitinol and have an ever expanding range of uses. The use of these devices have been reported in many different vascular territories,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411433297">1</xref></sup> and they are commonly used for embolization of iliac arteries pre-endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411433297">2</xref></sup> the proximal splenic artery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411433297">3</xref></sup> and in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411433297">4</xref></sup> and further novel applications of this versatile device continue to be reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411433297">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Axillobifemoral grafts are commonly performed in the setting of mycotic aneurysms, where the aorta cannot be repaired or stent grafted due to the risk of infection of the prosthetic material. Axillobifemoral grafts are therefore usually performed in conjunction with excision or ligation of the distal aortic sac. In this setting, the ABFG was performed to allow revascularization of the left leg (and as the patient was scheduled for a sigmoid colectomy, aortic ligation could be subsequently performed).</p>
<p>The aortic sac continued to enlarge despite attempted aortic ligation. Successful sac occlusion was ultimately obtained with coil embolization of the lumbar arteries and deployment of a second-generation AVP in the proximal neck of the sac at the site of attempted ligation. The retrograde filling of the right iliac system was deemed not significant and this vessel was preserved. There was evidence of ongoing occlusion at 3-month follow-up CT scan. There are now 4 generations of these devices, and the latest AVP4 device is low profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411433297">6</xref></sup>; and as a 10 mm device was needed, this would have still resulted in the option to use a smaller sheath in the brachial artery with reduced risks of an access-related complication. Other embolic material such as the use of multiple large coils or even the deployment of a guidewire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411433297">7</xref></sup> could have been used but would have resulted in a large number of coils, which would have increased procedure dose, procedure time, and also cost. The delivery mechanism of the AVP also allowed accurate and controlled placement of the device into the ligation zone.</p>
<p>Tsilimparis et al have reported a series of 3 cases where an endovascular approach was used to treat a nonexcluded aortic sac, but they performed coil embolization of iliac vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411433297">8</xref></sup> Coleman et al have reported 2 cases with ABFG with coil embolization of the sac and iliac vessels in the setting of ruptures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411433297">9</xref></sup> This is the first report of a case using the AVP device to occlude the aorta after failed surgical ligation of a persistent perfused sac after an ABFG.</p>
<p>The AVP was successfully used to occlude the neck of an aortic sac after failed surgical ligation and describes another novel application for this versatile embolic device.</p>
