<sec id="sec22-0961203313486193"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>The objective of this paper is to investigate conventional and nonconventional brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with diffuse neuropsychiatric involvement (dNPSLE) compared to healthy controls (HCs).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0961203313486193"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Twenty-six (26) SLE patients with one or more diffuse NP syndromes related to the central nervous system (CNS) (dNPSLE) and 36 age- and sex-matched HCs were scanned on a 3T MRI using a multimodal imaging approach. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine MRI-specific measure differences between dNPSLE and HCs for lesion burden, tissue-specific atrophy, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0961203313486193"><title>Results</title>
<p>In univariate analyses, dNPSLE patients showed significantly increased T1 lesion number (<italic>p</italic> = .001) and T1-lesion volume (LV, <italic>p</italic> = .008) compared to HCs. dNPSLE patients showed decreased whole brain volume (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), gray matter volume (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), cortical volume (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and increased lateral ventricle volume (<italic>p</italic> = .004) compared to HCs. dNPSLE patients had increased axial diffusivity (AD) of NAWM (<italic>p</italic> = .008) and NA brain tissue (<italic>p</italic> = .017) compared to HCs. In the multivariate regression analysis, decreased cortical volume was associated with SLE (<italic>R</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 0.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-0961203313486193"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study shows that cortical and central atrophy are associated with SLE patients with diffuse CNS syndromes. Microscopic tissue injury in the NAWM on AD DTI measures in SLE patients indicates a predominant reduction of axonal density.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313486193" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease in which auto-antibodies target a variety of body organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). Although CNS involvement is present in SLE, the underlying pathogenesis of CNS involvement giving rise to neuropsychiatric (NP) symptoms is poorly understood. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313486193">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486193">2</xref></sup> A standardized nomenclature for NP involvement was established by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) that includes 19 syndromes of either central or peripheral nervous system origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486193">3</xref></sup> Thus, patients may be classified as NPSLE if they have peripheral involvement (e.g. peripheral neuropathy), CNS involvement, or a combination of the two. The NP syndromes related to CNS involvement range from diffuse manifestations such as headache, mood disorder, and cognitive impairment, to focal manifestations such as seizures and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313486193">4</xref></sup> While clinical correlation between CNS involvement and focal syndromes is fairly easily established, the relationship between CNS involvement and diffuse syndromes is much more difficult. In spite of the classification criteria proposed by the ACR and the advances that have been made in the understanding of CNS involvement through imaging technology, the assignment of SLE patients with diffuse syndromes into NPSLE or non-NPSLE groups for research purposes remains difficult, in part, because of the activity and severity of each syndrome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313486193">1</xref></sup> and the uncertainty of the pathogenic validity of the diffuse CNS syndromes. The use of multimodal imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can contribute to a better understanding of pathogenic events in SLE leading to demyelination and axonal loss,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486193">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313486193"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313486193">7</xref></sup> and, thus, provide a clearer link between CNS pathology and diffuse NP involvement.</p>
<p>Studies of SLE using conventional MRI have revealed lesions within the cerebral white matter (WM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486193">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486193">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313486193">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313486193">8</xref></sup> The WM lesions are located diffusely in both cerebral hemispheres, with a predilection to periventricular regions, in up to 70% of the NPSLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313486193">4</xref></sup> It has been established that NPSLE patients show increased WM lesion burden compared to healthy controls (HCs);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486193">2</xref></sup> however, there are exceptions to this finding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313486193">9</xref></sup> In fact, SLE patients frequently have a normal conventional MRI scan, thus prompting the use of innovative nonconventional MRI techniques to increase sensitivity and specificity of MRI assessments, for clinical and research purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486193">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most investigated nonconventional MRI techniques used for differentiation between NPSLE and HCs include assessment of tissue-specific atrophy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486193">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313486193">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486193">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313486193">10</xref></sup> magnetization transfer imaging (MTI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313486193">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313486193">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486193">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486193">12</xref></sup> diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486193">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313486193">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313486193"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313486193"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313486193">16</xref></sup> and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313486193">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486193">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313486193">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the multimodal approach of using different conventional and nonconventional MRI techniques to better understand the pathogenesis of SLE is only in its infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486193">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486193">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313486193">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313486193">19</xref></sup> and more research studies are needed. The aim of the present multimodal imaging study was to contrast conventional MRI findings with nonconventional MRI indices in SLE patients with one or more diffuse syndromes related to the CNS (dNPSLE) and age- and sex-matched HCs.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313486193" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 26 dNPSLE patients (23 Caucasian, two African American, and one Hispanic) and 36 HCs (34 Caucasian, one African American, and one Hispanic). The study included MRI, electrophysiological testing, comprehensive neuropsychological and psychological evaluations, and a medical component. The SLE patients were recruited from a local hospital and rheumatologists in the area. The diagnosis of SLE was independently confirmed by a rheumatology specialist and clinical routine laboratory testing obtained from medical records.</p>
<p>Potential participants were first phone screened for general selection criteria, and then further evaluated for other exclusionary criteria during a psychiatric interview (see below). Exclusionary criteria included history of head trauma (with loss of consciousness &gt;five minutes), visual problems not corrected by glasses, learning disability, or other medical conditions unrelated to SLE that could affect cognition. Controls were not included if they had an Axis I psychiatric disorder, were on a psychotropic medication, or if they were on any other medications that could affect cognition. The psychotropic and disease-modifying medications for the dNPSLE patients at the time of testing were: hydroxychloroquine (<italic>n</italic> = 24), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<italic>n</italic> = 16), antidepressants (<italic>n</italic> = 12), corticosteroids (<italic>n</italic> = 10), methotrexate: (<italic>n</italic> = 4), azathioprine (<italic>n</italic> = 5), non-narcotic pain medication (<italic>n</italic> = 4), antianxiety (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and narcotic pain medication (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Ten of the patients were taking medication for hypertension (beta blocker, angtiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist). An estimate of the burden of lifetime use of corticosteroids was also determined based on the number of times on corticosteroids, the average length of time of each administration of corticosteroids, the highest lifetime dosage, and number of years since diagnosis. Patients were categorized from 1 (no lifetime steroid usage) to 5 (high lifetime steroid usage).</p>
<p>All participants also met criteria for MRI testing based on a health screening MRI questionnaire containing information about medical history (illnesses, surgeries, medications, pregnancy, etc.) and a screening interview before the MRI testing. The study was approved by an internal institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained from all participating subjects.</p>
<p>The SLE patients included in this study were determined to have dNPSLE syndromes related to the CNS based on the ACR classification criteria for NPSLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486193">3</xref></sup> The neuropsychological, psychological, and medical components of the study (see below), as well as a review of the patient's medical records, were used to arrive at the diagnosis. Five patients had migraine, mood disorder, and cognitive decline or impairment; nine had migraine and mood disorder; three had migraine and cognitive decline or impairment; one had mood disorder and cognitive impairment; seven had migraine, and one had mood disorder. In all of the cases, mood disorder was diagnosed as major depression related to a medical illness (SLE). In addition to the CNS-related syndromes, 11 of the 26 patients also had peripheral involvement (peripheral and/or cranial neuropathy).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313486193"><title>Psychological, neuropsychological, and disease-related measures</title>
<p>The Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) (SCID-IV) was administered to all participants by a licensed clinical psychologist to assess current and lifetime history of major depression as well as other Axis I disorders. For depression, information regarding the severity, history, and relationship to their medical illness was obtained. None of the patients met diagnostic criteria for a mood disorder other than major depressive disorder. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was also administered to compare current symptoms of depression between the dNPSLE patients and controls.</p>
<p>The neuropsychological testing was overseen by a board-certified clinical neuropsychologist. The battery consisted of tests in the domains of simple/complex attention, memory and learning, language, reasoning/problem solving, motor speed, and executive function. Criteria for determining cognitive impairment were based on the ACR guidelines established by the cognition subcommittee of the Ad Hoc Committee on Lupus Response Criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313486193">20</xref></sup> Cognitive decline is defined as deficits of 1.5 to 1.9 SD below the mean, compared to normative data, in the domains of attention, memory, and psychomotor speed/executive function, and cognitive impairment is defined as deficits of 2.0 SD or more below the mean in the three domains. SLE disease duration was calculated as the number of years since diagnosis. Disease activity was calculated as the total number of positive responses on a 19-item checklist derived from the clinical manifestation categories of the systemic lupus activity measure (SLAM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313486193">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>As part of the medical component of the study, blood samples were drawn on the same day as the cognitive testing and frozen at −70° C. The blood samples were thawed at a later date and delivered to the Kaleida Health Center for Laboratory Medicine for analysis of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL). An initial screening was conducted using solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to test for clinically significant elevation of aCL antibodies. All positive samples were then tested for aCL IgG and aCL IgM.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0961203313486193"><title>MRI acquisition</title>
<p>All scans were acquired on a 3T GE Signa Excite HD 12.0 TwinSpeed 8-channel scanner. The following sequences were acquired: two-dimensional (2D) multiplanar dual fast spin-echo (FSE) proton density (PD) with and without magnetization transfer (MT) pulse images and T2-weighted image (WI); fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR); three-dimensional (3D) high-resolution (HIRES) T1-WI using a fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR) with magnetization-prepared inversion recovery (IR) pulse; SE T1-WI and DTI. All scans were prescribed in an axial-oblique orientation, parallel to the subcallosal line. One average was used for all pulse sequences.</p>
<p>All sequences were acquired with a 256 × 192 matrix (freq × phase), field of view (FOV) of 25.6 cm × 19.2 cm (256 × 256 matrix with phase FOV = 0.75), for an in-plane resolution of 1 mm × 1 mm, except for DTI. For all 2D scans (PD/T2, FLAIR and SE T1), 48 slices were collected, thickness of 3 mm, no gap between slices. An axial PD was also obtained with MT contrast (1500 Hz off-water resonance pulse). For the 3D HIRES IR-FSPGR, 184 locations were acquired, 1 mm thick, providing for isotropic resolution.</p>
<p>Other relevant parameters were as follows: for dual FSE PD/T2, echo and repetition times (TE and TR) TE1/TE2/TR = 9/98/5300 ms, flip angle (FA) = 90°, echo train length (ETL) = 14; for FLAIR, TE/TI/TR = 120/2100/8500 ms (inversion time, TI), FA = 90°, ETL = 24; for SE T1-WI, TE/TR = 16/600 ms, FA = 90; for 3D HIRES T1-WI, TE/TI/TR = 2.8/900/5.9 ms, FA = 10°.</p>
<p>A 2D echo-planar imaging (EPI) DTI sequence was acquired with TE/TR = 90.9/8600 ms, 96 × 96 matrix, 28.8 × 21.6 cm FOV (due to pFOV = 0.75), FA = 90°; ETL = 1, slice thickness 3 mm with no gap, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3 mm × 3 mm. DTI-specific parameters included a <italic>b</italic> value of 1000 and 39 directions.</p>

<p>A fully automated processing pipeline was used to calculate mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in NABT, NAWM, and in T2- and T1-LVs. First, the DTI image was corrected for eddy currents and deskulled. Next, a diffusion-tensor model was fit at each voxel, using dtifit, part of the FSL package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203313486193">27</xref></sup> The resulting MD, RD, and AD maps were then masked with the tissue segmentation from SIENAX and lesion masks to calculate mean values.</p>

As expected, depression scores were significantly higher in SLE patients compared to HCs. As noted above, of the 26 dNPSLE patients, 16 met criteria for major depressive disorder based on the diagnostic interview. The depressive episodes were more attributable to SLE than to other life circumstances. Nine of the patients met ACR criteria for cognitive dysfunction (see methods, above): six with cognitive decline, and three with cognitive impairment. All of the patients had positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titers (obtained from medical records), and four patients were positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. The categorization of patients based on their lifetime corticosteroid usage resulted in 16 patients with low usage, four with moderate usage, two with moderate to high usage, and four with high usage.

<sec id="sec19-0961203313486193" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This multimodal imaging study investigated differences in lesion burden, tissue-specific atrophy, MTI, and DTI indices of WM and GM in SLE patients with diffuse NP syndromes. The dNPSLE patients presented with increased T1 lesion burden and global and GM tissue-specific brain atrophy compared to HCs, with a predilection to cortical and central brain regions. These findings support those of earlier MRI studies that found diffuse brain pathology in NPSLE. Although volumetric T2 WM differences were not detected between dNPSLE patients and HCs, increased AD were found in NAWM of patients. Thus, nonconventional MRI techniques like DTI were able to detect microstructural damage in the NAWM that was not visible by using conventional MRI measures. This finding indicates that microstructural damage in the NAWM of dNPSLE patients is potentially related to a decrease of axonal density. Finally, the multimodal imaging approach revealed that cortical atrophy was the most important MRI measure associated with dNPSLE. These findings suggest that macroscopic damage in the cortical GM is more important for identifying dNPSLE patients than is the microstructural damage in the NAWM or in the WM lesions.</p>
<p>SLE is an autoimmune disease in which both cellular and humoral immunity play an important role in creating reactivity to multiple organ systems in the body, including the CNS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313486193">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203313486193">29</xref></sup> Chronic inflammation is thought to be one of the key factors leading to the development of CNS vasculopathy. The nature of the mechanisms leading to vascular injury is not clearly understood; however, it is postulated that autoimmune complexes attack the endothelial walls and other components of the vasculature, causing an inflammatory response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486193">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313486193">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203313486193">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, dNPSLE patients did not show increased T2 WM lesion burden compared to HCs, contrary to a number of previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486193">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486193">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313486193">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313486193">8</xref></sup> but in line with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313486193">9</xref></sup> However, more dNPSLE patients showed presence of T2 lesions compared to HCs in the current study. The lack of difference in T2 WM lesion burden in our study may be due, at least in part, to the inclusion of patients with only diffuse NP syndromes, compared to other studies that included a broader range of NP syndromes. In the multivariate regression analysis, the T1 lesion number was the only lesion variable associated with dNPSLE. Therefore results from this study suggest that assessment of T1 hypointense lesions may be more relevant for differentiating dNPSLE patients from HCs than the T2 WM hyperintense lesions.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that both global WM and GM atrophy are present in SLE patients compared to HCs, and that atrophy rapidly evolves over a short-period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486193">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313486193">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313486193">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203313486193">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203313486193"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203313486193"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203313486193">34</xref></sup> The findings from our study confirm these previous observations and add to the understanding that selective GM, but not WM tissue-specific atrophy, predominantly occurs in dNPSLE patients. In the multivariate regression analysis, the decreased cortical volume was the only tissue-specific atrophy measure that was associated with dNPSLE disease. This finding is in line with a number of previous studies that suggested that cortical atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486193">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203313486193">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203313486193">33</xref></sup> is present in NPSLE patients.

The current study also detected advanced central atrophy in dNPSLE patients compared to HCs, in line with previous literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486193">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313486193">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313486193">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203313486193">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203313486193"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203313486193"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961203313486193">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The MTR findings revealed no difference between dNPSLE patients and HCs. Although the dNPSLE group had decreased MTR of NAWM compared to HCs, this finding did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. A number of previous MTI studies showed microstructural damage in the WM and GM of NPSLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313486193">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313486193">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486193">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486193">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203313486193">36</xref></sup> The selective microstructural injury confined to the WM was corroborated by the DTI findings. The MD of NAWM was significantly increased in dNPSLE patients compared to HCs. This finding is in line with previously published data reporting increased MD in the brain parenchyma of SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486193">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313486193">14</xref></sup> One recent preliminary DTI study showed reduced integrity of WM tracts in areas around limbic structures and in the internal capsule, by using a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313486193">15</xref></sup> A number of other studies showed altered WM integrity on various DTI indices in NPSLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313486193">16</xref></sup> Summary parameters deriving from DTI, like MD and fractional anisotropy (FA), have not demonstrated sufficient specificity to define underlying pathology of WM injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203313486193">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203313486193">38</xref></sup> Animal model experiments suggested that directional diffusivities within the WM tract correlate with axonal and myelin pathologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961203313486193">39</xref></sup> Although reservations in translating directional diffusivity approach to humans were raised in the past,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961203313486193">38</xref></sup> a number of recent DTI studies applied this approach to investigate surrogates of axonal and myelin WM integrity in patients with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961203313486193">37</xref></sup> Our univariate analysis findings confirmed selective axonal injury of the NAWM in the dNPSLE patients. In the multivariate analysis, the AD of NAWM was the only variable associated with dNPSLE disease among the DTI measures. This result indicates that the underlying pathological substrate of the WM damage in dNPSLE patients may be more related to a decrease of axonal density than to damage of myelin integrity. Use of MRS and perfusion imaging in addition to directional diffusivity measures may help to discern the underlying pathological substrate of WM damage in dNPSLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486193">11</xref></sup> There could be a temporal disassociation between the detection of damage on nonconventional MRI and its translation to a significant tissue loss on conventional MRI. Future longitudinal studies should determine whether early AD changes of the WM in dNPSLE patients may result in higher accumulation of tissue-specific brain atrophy over time.</p>
<p>A multimodal imaging approach using different MRI techniques to assess damage of GM and WM and the presence of lesions, can help to better understand the pathogenesis of dNPSLE, and may potentially be diagnostically useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486193">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486193">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313486193">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313486193">19</xref></sup> In the multivariate regression model that included MRI measures significantly associated with dNPSLE in specific multivariate models, cortical atrophy was the most associated with disease in our study. This finding is indeed interesting, as it suggests that cortical atrophy is more important for mediating CNS damage in dNPSLE patients than is WM disruption or the presence of lesions.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study that must be considered when interpreting the findings. The sample size was relatively small, which likely reduced the statistical power. The study did not include a group of SLE patients without neurological involvement, nor SLE patients with focal CNS involvement nor a non-NPSLE group. Therefore, the findings cannot necessarily be generalized to these other subsets of SLE patients. Further, the study does not provide information about which diffuse syndrome or combination of syndromes may be more or less associated with CNS involvement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that the use of a multimodal imaging approach was able to detect MRI abnormalities in SLE patients with diffuse NP CNS syndromes. Cortical, but not subcortical GM atrophy, was the best associated with dNPSLE when compared across domains with lesions, MTI, and DTI. Severe microscopic tissue injury in the NAWM on AD DTI measures in dNPSLE patients indicates a predominant decrease of axonal density.</p>
