<p>Social democracy after the short-lived Third Way is arguably at its weakest state since the 1930s. This weakness can be clearly shown by recent election results. In 2006, the Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) achieved its worst election result since the right to vote was won in 1921, and in 2010 managed to do even worse (p. 233). In Germany and Britain, the latest elections saw their social-democratic parties achieve in the first instance the worst, and in the latter the second worst result since 1945. This is thus a crucial conjuncture for social democrats, which makes <italic>Social Democracy After the Cold War</italic> very timely, and of enhanced importance. The volume’s case studies cover much of the developed world, with chapters on the most well established and historically successful social-democratic parties (Labour, the SPD, the SAP and the ALP) and due to the book’s North American origins, there are two chapters on Canadian social democracy and one on American. Preceding these case studies is a theoretical chapter by Ingo Schmidt. In this chapter, Schmidt attempts to define the driving forces behind social-democratic success. Importantly, seeking to break with the simple economism of Third Way social democrats who claim that traditional social democracy is no longer feasible or desirable due to the decline of the industrial working class and/or the need for flexibility and competitiveness inherent in a global economy, Schmidt instead argues that social-democratic success and failure have historically been defined by economic growth, and that this theoretical insight can explain the rise and fall of the Third Way. The booming new economy allowed the Third Way to achieve electoral success by promising an ever-expanding middle class, and social justice for those who could not adjust (p. 31). But ever since the new economy collapsed in 2001, social democrats have either lost ‘government power or have had great difficulty retaining it’ (p. 31). This is because a weakened economy pushed the social democrats into surrendering to the primacy of economics, and into taking ‘measures to restore profits and investment even if this hurt their own constituencies’ (p. 42). This is certainly a convincing argument, but one that allows Schmidt himself to drift into economism, playing down the role of class struggle in enabling social-democratic success or reactionary austerity. It must be noted that political parties, social-democratic or conservative, have always tended to pursue measures that attempt to promote capitalist profitability during boom or crisis. The way in which power relations between the social classes place barriers in the way of achieving this politically, influencing whether it takes on a social-democratic form, needs to be further explored. Unfortunately, Schmidt’s theory does not provide a basis for the subsequent case study chapters, but does successfully show the flaws in Third Way logic.</p>
<p>The central theme emanating from the chapters on the UK, Germany and Sweden is the destructive nature of the social-democratic parties’ move to the right and abandonment of their traditional constituents. Ostberg is particularly excellent at highlighting the Swedish social democrats’ distancing from the working class, and the breakdown of a historic ‘movement’. He shows how the leadership is no longer ‘fiercely loyal to the movement and its values’, but likely to move on to elite private-sector employment as soon as possible (p. 212). These elites are also more isolated from the organised working class, as shown by the fact that LO-affiliated workers in the cabinet had dropped to 2 by 2006, half that of the early 1970s (p. 211). This distancing from the working class has weakened the connection between party and class, with only 51 percent of LO members voting for ‘their’ party in 2010 (p. 234), which surely helps explain their dire electoral performance. The evident failures of ‘modernisation’, shown most directly in the Swedish case, lead Schmidt to the conclusion that the parties have ‘learned the hard way that their electoral success in the 1990s was not built on the unstoppable rise of new middle class constituencies bred by a global knowledge society but, to a large extent, on a still-existing taste for the welfare state among working class voters’ (p. 239). While it is hard to agree that the social democrats have learned anything from their decline, or that they will anytime in the immediate future, Schmidt still provides an extremely important message, suggesting that the move to the right and the abandonment of the working class is not vote-maximising but electorally unwise, taking away one of the moderniser’s most persuasive arguments.</p>
<p>The book contains as many chapters on North American social democracy as it does on European. North America, though, provides particular difficulties for the study of social democracy, primarily due to the fact that the region has never experienced a classic social-democratic government at the national level. However, as Bryan Evans shows, this has not stopped the Canadian New Democratic Party (NDP) pursuing a similar modernising trajectory at the state level. Rosenfeld’s chapter on US social democracy stands out from the rest, and faces even more difficulties since he is not analysing a social-democratic party, but social democracy within a bourgeois party. Rosenfeld shows that the reforms enacted during the New Deal era ‘became one cornerstone of the Democratic Party’s hegemony over the labour movement and made it the political home for most social democrats’ (p. 112). Social democrats found themselves in a party ‘claiming to represent working people and the downtrodden, all the while representing the interests of a specific bloc of capital’ (p. 112). This in itself would not seemingly make US social democracy fundamentally different, since all social-democratic parties have always represented in government, and often in opposition, fractions of capital concerned with ‘progressive’ goals such as increased demand and industrial peace. Also, social democracy does not need a party of the working class implementing it: as Schmidt correctly argues, social-democratic hegemony is not always accompanied by social democrats in power (p. 23). Thus Rosenfield’s excellent analysis could be improved by placing the weakness of the US working class at the forefront, a weakness Rosenfield analyses before he gets somewhat bogged down in an engagement with the small social-democratic organisations inside and outside the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Each of the book’s chapters provides an excellent analysis of the state of contemporary social democracy in its case-study country. The volume as a whole should be regarded as vital reading for anyone concerned with contemporary social democracy. But it could have become more than an excellent collection had it been more theoretically orientated. Each chapter provides a similar story of social democrats abandoning their traditional policies and the working class, and the book would have been improved if this process had been unified theoretically, perhaps in a concluding chapter.</p>
