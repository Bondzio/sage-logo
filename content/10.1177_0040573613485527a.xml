<p>My invitation as a participant on this panel is “to comment on the themes” of James Cone’s recent book, <italic>The Cross and the Lynching Tree</italic>, “with an eye to questions of eschatology and apocalyptic rectification in particular.” I appreciate this emphasis upon “questions,” because it does not imply that there is a certain apocalyptic box by which we are asked to judge how well Cone’s theology properly fits. As one who has had the privilege of working alongside Professor Cone as my nearer distinguished colleague in systematic theology for 39 years, I hope I have learned by now that his theology cannot be boxed in by prior labeling and classification. This collegial association has taught me more than he knows, though I am sure he thinks not nearly enough. His “wondering,” as he puts it, “about the relationship between the whites who committed these lynchings and the whites I work with at Union Seminary” has to be kept in mind in any conversation and is certainly to be respected as justified in light of the account he so powerfully documents in this book (98).</p>
<p>Surrounded by horrendous evil, such as lynching and the legacy of white supremacy, and failing to recognize it for what it is, there is a time, Cone earlier has written, for whites not to speak before they have paid sufficient attention, when the answer to their question of what <italic>they</italic> can do is, sit down, and “keep your damn mouth closed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573613485527a">1</xref></sup> Yet, there is also a time when silence becomes complicity in light of the urgency of the need to stand up and to speak out. Praying faithfully to discern the times is part of every call to discipleship. In this text, difficult as it is to hear, Cone plainly states from the opening pages to the conclusion, “I write it in order to start a conversation so we can explore the many ways to heal the deep wounds lynching has inflicted upon us” (xix). “Blacks and whites are bound together in Christ by their brutal and beautiful encounter in this land” (165).</p>
<p>The reference to the words “apocalyptic rectification” readily calls to mind the influential work of J. Louis Martyn in Pauline studies, most especially his commentary on Galatians and its companion volume <italic>Theological Issues in the Letters of Paul</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573613485527a">2</xref></sup> I will focus my attention on points where a conversation may be joined between the work of Cone and Martyn that does not take either out of its context, or compare apples and oranges, but which sheds light on unsettled questions regarding eschatology and apocalyptic. These questions have largely to do with the vexing problem for apocalyptic theology of <italic>concreteness.</italic></p>
<p>Nothing can sound more abstract in what Alfred North Whitehead called “speculative philosophy” than talk of “concreteness,” whether it be that of Aristotelians, Hegelians, other “footnotes to Plato,” or Whitehead’s own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573613485527a">3</xref></sup> I use the word here simply to indicate the opposite of what Cone repeatedly criticizes as “theological abstraction” (63) in Christian theologies that may speak of “a transcendent reality” and “eschatological vision,” but do so in avoidance of “concrete signs of divine presence” (155). As early as 1975, Paul Lehmann wrote of “the insistence upon <italic>concreteness</italic>” in Cone’s black theology as a “<italic>sociological concreteness</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573613485527a">4</xref></sup> That may be nearer the point, but not in my judgment sufficient. For whether in the case of metaphysical or sociological modes of thought, the issue of <italic>concreteness</italic> poses particular problems with respect to what are most often designated as “apocalyptic” claims.</p>
<p>Therefore the sequence of my remarks will consist of three comments: first, on “apocalyptic rectification,” then on “apocalyptic theology,” followed by a summary conclusion on “apocalyptic concreteness.”</p>
<sec id="sec2-0040573613485527a"><title>1. Apocalyptic rectification</title>
<p>At first hearing, a change in the wording of the English translation of Gal 2:16 from “justification by faith <italic>in</italic> Christ” to “rectification by the faith <italic>of</italic> Christ,” as Martyn proposes, would seem to have little bearing in a world where, as Cone writes, “between 1880 to 1940, white Christians lynched nearly five thousand black men and women in a manner with obvious echoes of the Roman crucifixion of Jesus” and saw no “contradiction in their actions” (31). Yet Martyn’s commentary analysis prompts consideration of why even among the most victimized blacks, whose sufferings were indeed too deep for words, one finds some of the most fervent communities of hopeful rejoicing in “the word of the cross.” “That God could ‘make a way out of no way’ in Jesus’ cross was truly absurd to the intellect,” Cone writes, “yet profoundly real in the souls of black folk” (2). While not mentioning the word “apocalyptic” itself, there is no clearer summation of the cross’s apocalyptic significance, as Martyn assesses it, than this saying Cone quotes from black faith tradition: <italic>God makes a way out of no way</italic>.</p>
<p>Trust that <italic>God makes a way out of no way</italic> places the emphasis in confessing liberation through what happens in the cross exactly where Martyn’s exegesis finds Paul putting it, not on human faith as a prior condition for things being made right—“justification by faith <italic>in</italic> Christ,”—but on <italic>God</italic> making things right, rectifying, by the faith, or better, by the faithfulness <italic>of</italic> Christ. Martyn writes:<disp-quote>
<p>The result of this interpretation of <italic>pistis Christou</italic> [<italic>ek pisteōs Christou</italic>] is crucial to an understanding not only of Galatians, but also of the whole of Paul’s theology. God has set things right without laying down a prior condition of any sort. God’s rectifying act, that is to say, is no more God’s response to human faith in Christ than it is God’s response to human observance of the Law. God’s rectification is not God’s response at all. It is the <italic>first</italic> move; it is God’s initiative, carried out by him in Christ’s faithful death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573613485527a">5</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In his discussion of “apocalyptic rectification,” Martyn addresses a complex range of textual and contextual issues with regard to the struggle between Paul and his Galatian opponents over observance of the Law in the Gentile mission. Here I point out one unsettled question for today’s theology. <italic>Does apocalyptic concreteness reside in human praxis?</italic> Does hearing from Martyn that “the subject Paul addresses is that of God’s making right what has gone wrong”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573613485527a">6</xref></sup> without any “prior condition” of human faith or lawful observance, and also hearing from Cone of black traditional testimony to “God making a way out of no way,” lead to the conclusion that concreteness in light of the Gospel’s “word of the cross” is not to be found in praxis? Do theologically appropriated concepts of <italic>praxis</italic> in liberation theologies, for example, or <italic>poesis</italic>, as emphasized in a critical alternative such as Radical Orthodoxy, allow for such an interpretation of Pauline apocalyptic as Martyn’s?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573613485527a">7</xref></sup> Or do their understandings of the role of human and divine agency require that such talk as Martyn’s “apocalyptic rectification” be rejected as “theological abstraction”?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573613485527a"><title>2. Apocalyptic theology</title>
<p>It is no secret that apocalyptic perspectives for the most part have been viewed unfavorably by mainstream traditions of Christian theology. Ernst Käsemann’s celebrated thesis that “apocalyptic was the mother of all Christian theology” is followed by his acknowledgement that “it cannot be disputed that the theology of the Church has to a large extent seen its task as consisting in the vanquishing of apocalyptic.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573613485527a">8</xref></sup> Among the reasons traditionally cited for this rejection are that the instability of apocalyptic is not in keeping with an enduring apostolic canon or “rule of faith,” nor is it in keeping with “the real world” since the imminent end of the world to which it testifies did not happen.</p>
<p>These two issues emerge with new vigor with Cone’s penetrating assessment of Reinhold Niebuhr’s theological concreteness in appealing to “Christian realism” and “the facts of experience” in the light of the cross (34). “Unless we look at ‘the facts of experience,’ as Niebuhr’s own realism demanded,” Cone writes, “what we say about the cross remains at the level of theological abstraction, like Karl Barth’s Word of God, separated from the real crosses in our midst” (63). “And yet, in the end…Niebuhr’s focus on realism (‘facts of experience’) and the cross (tragedy) should have turned his gaze to the lynching tree, but he did not look there” (38).</p>
<p>To read this critique of Niebuhr with an eye to the questions of apocalyptic rectification raised by Martyn’s interpretation of Paul, it is instructive as background context to note how Johannes Weiss’s monograph, <italic>Jesus’ Proclamation of the Kingdom of God</italic>, in 1892, sets the table for modern historical-critical discussion of whether there can be such a thing as a Christian “apocalyptic theology,” much less one considered concrete.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573613485527a">9</xref></sup> Weiss did not think so, and argued that since a modern worldview could not accept such Gospel teaching of the Kingdom of God as coming down from heaven to a world passing away, it could only understand the Kingdom “in a different sense from Jesus’” by issuing what Weiss calls “the old coinage” (<italic>Münzen</italic>) of Jesus’ apocalyptic teaching at “a new rate of exchange” (<italic>Kurs</italic>). It is this different “rate of exchange” for the old apocalyptic “coinage” of the Gospel teaching that becomes the de facto hermeneutical principle for modern theology regarding apocalyptic and how it relates to “realism” and “the real world.” In Weiss’s judgment, Gospel apocalyptic has an unrealistic view of the world because a modern world view shows Gospel apocalyptic to be unrealistic. The “rate of exchange” for the Gospel’s apocalyptic interpretation and what determines it is the issue of canon.</p>
<p>Martyn’s account of “apocalyptic rectification” in Paul’s testimony regarding the cross also speaks of both “canon” and “the real world.” The realism Martyn finds in Paul arises precisely from what Paul says is “apocalypsed,” that is, revealed as coming to pass in the cross. This apocalypsed realism is based upon what Paul calls a “canon” of nothing less than a “new creation,” a “turn of the ages” in Martyn’s words, that brings with it a way of seeing that what is real is not embodied in the binary differences ruling over the passing age. That age, or <italic>cosmos</italic>, Paul testifies, has been “crucified” in the cross:<disp-quote>
<p>As for me, God forbid that I should boast in anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the cosmos has been crucified to me and I to the cosmos. For neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision anything. What is something is the new creation. And to all those who will follow this canon [<italic>kanoni</italic>]―peace be upon them, and mercy, upon the Israel of God. (Gal 6:14–16)</p></disp-quote>Here another unsettled question arises. If the canon to be followed in recognizing Christian realism―if the “rate of exchange” for the old apocalyptic “coinage” in the Gospel―is “the new creation,” does this not lead to the very avoidance of the “facts of experience,” or “facts on the ground,” that Niebuhr’s realism, despite its limitations, was intent to expose?</p>
<p>Martyn writes that in the new creation of which alone Paul confesses to boast, “the territory in which human beings now live is a newly invaded space, and that means that its structures cannot remain unchanged.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573613485527a">10</xref></sup> Does it follow that theological <italic>transcendence</italic> and <italic>immanence</italic> are to be understood dynamically as <italic>imminence</italic>?</p>
<p>But if so, are we left with an abstract dialectic asserting a cosmic rectification in which an eternal vindication of grace over its opposition never, as it were, touches down to earth or is concretely grounded anywhere―a cross without the lynching tree? Here Martyn’s reading of the Pauline testimony as calling for and calling forth “bifocal vision” firmly rejects any such view. “To see <italic>bi-focally</italic> in Paul’s terms is to see <italic>both</italic> the enslaving Old Age and God’s invading and liberating new creation,” and to see them “simultaneously.” Yet this liberating invasion that is apocalypsed in the cross is “not demonstrable in the categories of the Old Age or with the means of perception native to the Old Age.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573613485527a">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>What then would count as a <italic>concrete</italic> example of such “bifocal” envisioning today? In what “territory in which human beings now live” is there to be witnessed what Martyn describes as “a newly invaded space” by the power apocalypsed in the cross?</p>
<p>It is to the “civil rights struggle in the southern states” that Martyn turns for his concrete example, that “to see bi-focally in Paul’s terms is to see <italic>both</italic> the enslaving Old Age and God’s invading and liberating new creation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573613485527a">12</xref></sup> In remarking on this, Martyn has mentioned how instructive he had found his seminar exchanges with Cone in an early course they taught together some years ago on Paul and Black Theology, when Cone introduced Du Bois’s concept of “double consciousness” into the discussion of “bifocal” vision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573613485527a"><title>3. Apocalyptic concreteness</title>
<p>Cyril O’Regan in discussing “the apocalyptic turn” in theological discourse today observes that “there seems to be a binary opposition in the modern world between apocalyptic and the discipline of theology.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573613485527a">13</xref></sup> Yet O’Regan argues that “there are two basic concerns in modern and contemporary theology” that are of “apocalyptic vintage.” One is the concern for Christian identity. The other is the concern for justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573613485527a">14</xref></sup> A conversation between the work of Cone and Martyn brings both of these concerns together. Neither Cone nor Martyn is willing to abide by a binary of the modern world that would oppose justice to the identity, in Cone’s words, of “Jesus’ cross,” or oppose the Gospel identity of Jesus’ cross to, in Martyn’s words, God’s “making right what has gone wrong.”</p>
<p>In conclusion, this brings us back to the issue Cone’s text insists we focus on, the concreteness of the inseparable fact of lynching and white supremacy with the power of the cross that binds blacks and whites “together in Christ by their brutal and beautiful encounter in this land” (165). Paul refers to the cross and crucifixion as a cosmic event, and this raises questions as to whether a “<italic>cosmic</italic> concreteness” would not be a contradiction in terms? But reading Cone’s account of black faith communities’ rejoicing in the power of the cross as <italic>God’s making a way out of no way</italic> suggests another answer that cannot be dismissed as pious sentimentality or cheap grace. What the cross reveals in those called forth to become its embodied witnesses is that there is an in-breaking <italic>contravention</italic> in the real-world sufferings of the present time that is not a <italic>circumvention</italic>. Like the cross and the lynching tree, the one cannot be affirmed concretely apart from the other.</p>
<p>In conveying so unsparingly such specific testimony to the reality of a new creation, Professor Cone’s book itself may be said to be an embodiment, not only of sociological, but indeed of <italic>apocalyptic</italic> concreteness.</p>
