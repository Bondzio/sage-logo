<abstract>
<p>Qualitative interviews with ten women found that following corrective surgery for congenital breast asymmetry, women were still concerned with the symmetry of their breasts and expressed high ideals regarding symmetry. Although women found an improvement in body confidence, some felt their confidence and socializing would be further improved with time. Women were secretive about their breast asymmetry and their surgery, being fearful of negative reactions from other people. It is necessary to establish and improve patients’ expectations of the outcome of surgery particularly regarding symmetry, as well as providing psychological and social support to women after surgery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe congenital breast asymmetry can cause considerable psychological difficulties for adolescent and adult women, with many of these women attending their general practitioners and plastic surgeons seeking advice and treatment regarding this condition, as well as using internet forums to elicit information and support. Although a degree of breast asymmetry is common amongst all women, it is estimated that approximately 10 percent of women may have severe breast asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312436766">Losken et al., 2005</xref>). The existence of these active on-line forums suggest breast asymmetry causes significant distress to women with the condition and that there is a need for advice and support regarding coping with, and treating, this condition. It is also essential to consider that for most women with breast asymmetry, it first becomes apparent during adolescence, which is a time when women are most vulnerable to concerns about their body and how they perceive it in relation to other adolescents.</p>
<p>Despite this apparent prevalence of breast asymmetry, there is a dearth of research regarding the distress and appearance concerns experienced by women living with breast asymmetry, and in particular, the experiences of those who have undergone corrective surgery, as most research has focused on surgical techniques and surgical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312436766">Grolleau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312436766">Kazbari et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Plastic surgery offers the potential to regain ‘normality’ and improve quality of life for individuals with breast asymmetry. Previous research among women undergoing surgical treatment for breast asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312436766">Neto et al., 2007</xref>) found a significant improvement in women’s subjective psychological health a year after their surgery compared to before their surgery, although the study found no improvement in patients reported social function. Additionally, the study did not address sexual function and body image, which may be especially relevant for patients undergoing breast surgery and may motivate them to seek surgery in the first place.</p>
<p>Further research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312436766">Chan et al., 2011</xref>) assessing women who had undergone corrective surgery for breast asymmetry two years previously found that, of the patients that completed a satisfaction questionnaire, 39% wanted further improvement regarding their breasts as they were concerned with scar, size, shape and symmetry. However, after being shown their pre-operative photos, 67% of those initially wanting further improvement, realised their significant aesthetic improvement and subsequently did not want to have further surgery. In addition, patient satisfaction with overall aesthetic outcome was poorer than professional evaluation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312436766">Chan et al. (2011)</xref> acknowledged the high expectations of this particular group and the need to counsel them with regard to the limitations of surgery.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the experiences of women who have undergone corrective surgery for breast asymmetry in order to assess whether surgery is an effective and appropriate treatment for breast asymmetry. Qualitative research has been widely used to gain a greater understanding of patients’ experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312436766">Streubert and Carpenter, 1995</xref>), motivations of women undergoing breast augmentation surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312436766">Solvi et al., 2010</xref>) and other types of breast surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312436766">Klassen et al., 2009</xref>), but has not been used to examine the experiences of women who had surgery specifically to correct breast asymmetry. Qualitative research has been deemed particularly useful to identify the appropriate variables to be measured for future quantitative research, in order to fully understand the underlying issues of a topic of interest and thus target the appropriate factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312436766">Black, 1994</xref>). Additionally, the use of qualitative research in the area of plastic surgery to explore patient’s feelings about surgical outcomes has been recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312436766">Shauver and Chung, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The present qualitative study aimed to investigate the experience and outcome of undergoing corrective surgery for congenital breast asymmetry, in particular the social, sexual and body image issues of these women, in order to inform future avenues of research.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1359105312436766">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 women over the age of 18 who had undergone surgery for breast asymmetry at a specialist plastic and reconstructive surgery hospital in the UK. A sample of 35 patients was initially identified through the patient administration system that had undergone surgery in the previous year (July 2008–June 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105312436766">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>NHS ethical and Research and Development committee approval was obtained. Following this, 35 patients received a letter and information sheet from their Consultant Plastic Surgeon inviting them to participate in this qualitative study. Participants were then contacted by the interviewer (RD) to answer any questions they had about the research and determine whether they fit the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria consisted of having undergone surgery for congenital breast asymmetry for the first time in the previous year, being over 18 years of age, having a fluent understanding of English and willingness to participate. Women were selected to represent a range of circumstances in terms of age, condition and location, to ensure they were representative of all women being referred for correction of breast asymmetry at the hospital. Of the 10 participants interviewed, one patient diagnosed with Poland’s syndrome (a rare birth defect characterized by underdevelopment or absence of the chest muscle on one side of the body) was included to ensure that the views of women that have asymmetrical breasts as a result of Poland’s syndrome were represented.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted in participants’ homes using an interview guide developed by members of the research team covering experience of living with breast asymmetry but more specifically, the women’s experience of surgery in terms of satisfaction, expectations, complications and life impact. Interviews were conducted by an experienced qualitative researcher (RD) and lasted up to one hour, tape-recorded with the participant’s written consent. Participants were offered a token payment of £25 for their involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105312436766">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312436766">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). This analysis technique was chosen based on its flexibility and potential to produce meaningful data that would reflect each participant’s experience. Thematic analysis is widely used in health research and has specifically been used to examine women’s experiences of appearance during breast cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312436766">Harcourt and Frith, 2008</xref>), informational needs relating to breast surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312436766">Spector et al., 2010</xref>), and women’s attitudes to an ideal body image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312436766">Ahern et al., 2011</xref>). Two researchers separately coded the data, reading the transcripts repeatedly and marking ideas and notes in relation to the text. From this method codes were produced and collated. Themes were produced from these codes by the researcher (SN) that were then reviewed and refined until meaningful and distinct themes developed between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312436766">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). Lastly, themes were defined and named. Quotes are provided in the results in order to illustrate the relevant themes. Pseudonyms are used throughout this article.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants’ mean age was 26.4 years (range of 20 to 37 years) at the time of interview and 25.6 years (range of 19–36 years) at the time of surgery. For all women it had been a year or less since their first surgery. Women were operated on by a variety of surgeons from the same surgical team. Differences in breast size varied from 1–3 cup sizes. Two women in the sample were married, two were living with their partner, a further two were in long-term relationships but living with parents and four were single. Patients underwent a variety of different procedures to correct the breast asymmetry, including use of tissue expanders, implants and reduction surgery.</p>
<p>Women described the profound effect of breast asymmetry, particularly how they perceived themselves as ‘weird’, ‘deformed’, ‘a freak’ and ‘unfeminine’. Additionally, behavioural consequences of asymmetry such as difficulty finding clothes, avoidance of physical and social activities and intimacy issues appeared to be motivations for women to seek and undergo corrective surgery. This qualitative report describes women’s perception of the outcome of undergoing corrective surgery for breast asymmetry. The outcomes are discussed in terms of three themes: Seeking ‘the same’, Body confidence and Secrecy.</p>
<sec id="section7-1359105312436766">
<title>Seeking ‘the same’</title>
<p>Most women were generally satisfied with their surgical result and reported it is an improvement on their previous breasts:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah:</speaker>
<p>‘They are perfect yes. Loads better than what they were.’</p>
</speech>
<p>However, although acknowledging that the surgery was an improvement on their previous breasts, many were still concerned that their breasts were still asymmetrical in shape, size and positioning:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ann:</speaker>
<p>‘They are still a different shape, she didn’t take enough off the nipple because the nipple is bigger on that side as well, and it is a funny shape and it is still bigger and in a sense she couldn’t do too much about it because the base is bigger on that so it was always going to be . . . So I am not 100% happy with the result but it is still a million times better than it was.’</p>
</speech>
<p>The symmetry of the breasts after surgery was an important consideration for women and of particular importance in assessing their satisfaction with their surgical result. Women particularly feel that the symmetry is important, as that was the sole reason that they needed the surgery:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Helen:</speaker>
<p>‘To me they look perfectly matched now so I’m really happy with the result.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ann:</speaker>
<p>‘even though the operation has been done, I am still not even and I still notice it, and it does still get me down, because they still look different.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Carol:</speaker>
<p>‘I am happy except for the fact that they didn’t uplift this one. If they had uplifted this one they would have looked pretty spot on and he said they won’t do that on the NHS, I can’t remember what they call it, the words he said! He said they won’t do that on the NHS but I have got them the same size which is what I wanted, which was the point of it, but the point of it is to make them look the same as well and by not doing the uplift, they still don’t look the same. So I would say that psychologically they still look wonky, in that sense, because they are wonky.’</p>
</speech>
<p>In addition, some women did admit that the result did not match their expectations, especially in terms of symmetry:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Maria:</speaker>
<p>‘I was expecting my breasts to look exactly the same and behave the same, look the same, but they don’t in as much as because this breast had less tissue and this had more, it’s a slightly different shape, but it’s not a problem at all because when I have a bra on they look the same’.</p>
</speech>
<p>Women described an expectation of ‘amazing’, ‘perfect’, the ‘same’, despite admitting that surgeons had warned them not to have too high expectations:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Emma:</speaker>
<p>‘No, they [surgical team] were . . . you know, you are not going to have perfect, you are going to have different still but you get this expectation in your head that they are going to be like amazing. But, they were quite clear that it wasn’t going to be.’</p>
</speech>
<p>Several women explained that undergoing surgery was an ‘extreme’ thing to do. This perception may lead women to wanting an ‘extreme’ change post surgery, to justify that the surgery was worthwhile:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Elaine:</speaker>
<p>‘But they’re still . . . because to me, I said to him, there’s still a size difference between them, or maybe a couple of cup sizes, so to me the asymmetrical is still there, it’s just that instead of having one really big boob and one flat chested, which obviously was extremely noticeable, I have got two proper boobs, but to me they’re still different sizes, and I think to me it was a lot to go through . . .’.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Carol:</speaker>
<p>‘and I knew they were different, I knew they weren’t right, as soon as I took the bandage off, I was so upset, because they were still odd. And it looked like I hadn’t had it done . . . you expected something and you didn’t get it . . . and I think you get so hyped up because you think they’re going to fix you or make you look reasonable, and it didn’t happen and you just come crashing down.’</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105312436766">
<title>Body confidence</title>
<p>Most women reported improved self-confidence, particularly an improvement in how they felt about their body and attributed it directly to having surgery. Indeed, some women also described feeling comfortable showing their unclothed body and breasts to other people:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Tracy:</speaker>
<p>‘Now, I don’t have any . . . definitely, my confidence has hugely grown because of it . . . I wouldn’t feel embarrassed about taking my top off or anything.’</p>
</speech>
<p>Additionally, for many, their social life had improved because of their newfound confidence:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Emma:</speaker>
<p>‘I can go out whenever I can afford it. It’s the first time I have ever been to a concert . . . everyone thinks it’s normal to do that . . . but it wasn’t for me to do that . . . it just makes you think I’ve wasted my life really, well my young life.’</p>
</speech>
<p>Most women described how the improved confidence with their body has improved their relationships with their partners; and those that were not currently in relationships had improved confidence with men due to a new found feeling of femininity and can now envisage having future relationships. However, a few women expressed concerns about how future partners might react to the look of their breasts:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Susan:</speaker>
<p>‘if I met someone new, a new partner, I wouldn’t be able to show them my breasts straight away. I would have to tell them, because to me they’re still bad, but to other people they’re not.’</p>
</speech>
<p>Despite this improved body-confidence, women still admitted that their self-confidence could improve some more and expected that over time their confidence would gradually improve as they became more used to their new body image. Women also described the need to change long-standing avoidance behaviour, such as not going out and still wearing the same baggy clothes as before. These behaviours limit their socializing and in turn affect their ability to pursue relationships:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Emma:</speaker>
<p>‘No, not at the moment [boyfriend] no. Its just . . . I think its trying to get out of a routine I’ve had for years of not going out at the weekend and not going out generally to meet people really. I think it’s trying to change that as well.’</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Ann:</speaker>
<p>‘Yes it is better but I do still struggle with it [self-esteem], I mean it affects you for so long, it is hard to just switch off.’</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359105312436766">
<title>Secrecy</title>
<p>Most women admitted to telling few people, mostly only family and close friends, that they had undergone surgery for breast asymmetry. The motivation for keeping it secret appears to be that women want to blend in to society, along with a fear that others will not understand their need to undergo surgery, and they will therefore be talked about and ridiculed. Some women will reveal that they have had breast surgery to others but will mislead them as to the reason for the surgery:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Maria:</speaker>
<p>‘[At a bra fitting] I said I’d had a reconstruction so I think they just assumed that I’d had cancer or something. And I just left it as that, I didn’t go into detail. I didn’t tell them what was wrong with me I just said I’d had reconstruction and so they just assumed that I’d had . . . It’s really strange because I’d rather people think that I’ve had reconstruction through some sort of illness . . . .’.</p>
</speech>
<p>In particular, one young woman kept the real reason for undergoing surgery secret from her boyfriend; he believes she had a breast augmentation for small breasts and not for breast asymmetry. The reason for the secrecy is that she is embarrassed about her breast asymmetry and afraid that her boyfriend would tell other people, and she did not want people to talk about her:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah:</speaker>
<p>‘I don’t know. I thought everyone would think I was weird. And it would be like, ‘Oh she’s got this and she’s got that!’ And I thought it would be gossip and everyone would pick on me, and I just thought I couldn’t tell anyone. I was so embarrassed. I still don’t talk to people about it now.’</p>
</speech>
<p>This secrecy seems to be related to an individual perception of whether the surgery is socially acceptable:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah:</speaker>
<p>‘I’m fine, absolutely fine, talk to people about it, well I don’t tell them why I had it done, but I talk to people saying that I’ve had it done, so people know that I’ve had my boobs done but they don’t know why, so I’m confident talking to people in that way about it. . . . I think it’s more common for people to have breast enlargements and it’s getting more and more common, and girls are doing it a lot now . . . look at Jordan and things like that, so I’m quite happy to say to people, “Yes, I’ve had my boobs done.” I don’t care . . . I’d rather them think I was vain than know that I had that problem.’</p>
</speech>
<p>For those that did confide in others about the surgery, they had a favourable and supportive reaction. However, some participants ended up resenting those they had told about the surgery, for fear that they are now looking at them:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Ann:</speaker>
<p>‘I just don’t want people to know and the more people that know I resent them knowing, because I feel that she is looking at me . . . You are just trying to blend into the crowd and not have people looking at you is the aim.’</p>
</speech>
<p>Maria admits that this prevalent secrecy regarding breast asymmetry and corrective surgery adds to the problem of making people aware and understanding the condition:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Maria:</speaker>
<p>‘And I think that nobody knows about it because nobody wants to talk about it. And I can understand that.’</p>
</speech>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is the first qualitative study examining the experiences of women who had congenital breast asymmetry, and offers an insight that compliments and builds upon the limited psychosocial research in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312436766">Neto et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, this study explored the impact of having corrective surgery for breast asymmetry, examining topics of importance to women themselves, particularly relationships and body image, that previous research has not examined. The three themes: seeking ‘the same’, body confidence and secrecy describe the experience of corrective surgery for breast asymmetry, in women’s own words.</p>
<p>Women were very concerned with the symmetry of their breasts after surgery, and the perceived level of symmetry appeared to determine their satisfaction with the surgical result. This is unsurprising given the sole reason women are undergoing surgery is to correct breast asymmetry. However, it is worrying that women admit to having expectations of ‘same’ and ‘perfect’ despite being warned by surgeons to lower their expectations. Previous research in breast reconstruction patients has suggested that when patient’s expectations are not met regarding surgical results, this leads to patient dissatisfaction with the overall surgical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312436766">Snell et al., 2010</xref>). However, previous findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312436766">Chan et al. (2011)</xref> suggest that women may also not realize the extent of change in their breasts from pre-surgery to post surgery. Showing women pre-operative and post-operative photographs of their breasts may improve post-operative satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312436766">Chan et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this research found that most women reported an improvement in body confidence following surgery, this research and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312436766">Neto et al., 2007</xref>) has found that women also expect their self-esteem to improve further over time. It was also revealed some women struggle to change their lifestyle from before their surgery, due to long standing habits of avoiding social situations. This finding may explain previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312436766">Neto et al., 2007</xref>) that social function did not improve significantly a year after surgery. It may be that a longer follow up is needed for women to fully change their socializing habits, as although they are starting to feel improvement in body confidence, social confidence may take a little longer.</p>
<p>Women reported not wanting many people to know they had undergone surgery for breast asymmetry. The main reasons for this were a fear that other people would not understand or take the condition seriously, as well as wanting to blend in to society. Wanting to be ‘normal’ and be ‘like other women’ is a commonly used reason for women choosing to undergo a variety of breast surgeries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312436766">Klassen et al., 2009</xref>). These findings suggest that it is important that the existence of breast asymmetry be publicized more to young people during adolescence as well as the general public.</p>
<p>Given the outstanding confidence issues that some women still reported after surgery, sychological or peer support before and after surgery may be useful to support these women with their pre- and post-surgery body image. Support is also needed to manage confidence and behavioural issues in adult years for women with breast asymmetry. Social interaction skills training can be useful for people with appearance concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312436766">Rumsey and Harcourt, 2007</xref>); this can promote confidence and proficiency in forming and continuing relationships, which will be beneficial for women with breast asymmetry. One-on-one peer support would be beneficial, so a ‘buddy’ system may be useful by providing emotional comfort and reassurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312436766">Spector et al., 2010</xref>), but this may not suit all women.</p>
<p>It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study with regard to the small sample size. However, given the small study population of women who are eligible for corrective surgery in the NHS, the authors feel the numbers were sufficient to help inform future research avenues with larger samples. Previous qualitative studies with similar size samples (eg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312436766">Egan et al., 2011</xref>) that were also examining the experiences of individuals with visible difference using inductive thematic analysis, found the sample size sufficient to produce meaningful themes.</p>
<p>With regard to the second limitation, women were interviewed after they had undergone corrective surgery. This does not allow analysis of women’s reflection on their condition before their surgery and expectations for their surgical outcome. Future research utilizing a prospective design of women about to undergo surgery will allow examination of whether women’s expectations of surgery are met.</p>
<p>Future research should also consider examining the experiences of women who have not sought, or have decided against, corrective surgery. Insight into how these women manage the challenges presented by breast asymmetry could offer useful input when designing non-surgical interventions to support those who seek help with managing their distress, or who are not satisfied with the outcome of surgery. Therefore, research is needed that examines women living with breast asymmetry, to understand motivations for surgery and experiences of seeking treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Women had an overwhelming desire to look ‘the same’, not only in terms of expecting their breasts to be the ‘same’ in terms of symmetry, of size, shape and feel, but they also want to be the same as other people, to ‘blend in to the crowd’, to be deemed normal. This led many women to still keep their condition secret along with the details of why they underwent their surgical procedure. This study demonstrates that surgery is not a panacea for their appearance-related distress, and adjusting to a change in body image and appearance after surgery can take some time. Women with high expectations of the outcome of surgery may be dissatisfied with the results. It is important for health professionals to elicit a detailed understanding of a woman’s pre-surgery expectations, by providing appropriate information and having the time and ability to manage any misperceptions. Further research is needed to develop and explore the efficacy of interventions to help women consider their expectations in detail. The experiences of women who manage breast asymmetry without surgical intervention could be useful in this regard.</p>
