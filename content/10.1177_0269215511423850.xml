<abstract>
<p><bold>The problem:</bold> Rehabilitation professionals recognize the need to adopt a social as well as a medical model of disability, but the full implications of a social orientation towards disability are less easily accepted. If the physical environment can both produce and alleviate disability, so also can the social environment. If disablement is not to be seen as the problem of one individual then problems in rehabilitation must be ‘owned’ not solely by a single patient but also by other people implicated in a situation. It follows that ‘patient-centred care’, where a professional directs assessments and interventions towards one person, has shortcomings in rehabilitation.</p>
<p><bold>Theoretical considerations:</bold> A human systems model, shifting the focus of rehabilitation towards relationships, enables rehabilitation problems to be seen as provisional and context-dependent; the relational context of problems is clarified, and the positive and negative effects of professional power are more apparent.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical implications:</bold> Rehabilitation practitioners using a systemic approach would no longer view ‘carers’ and other significant individuals as mere bystanders but would integrate them within rehabilitation’s ethical and therapeutic system. Professionals would more readily recognize their roles within such a system, and would be better positioned to manage their negative as well as their positive effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Professionals normally recognize a primary duty towards a single client, the patient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511423850">1</xref></sup> but a single individual can rarely be the sole focus in rehabilitation. At one level this claim is uncontroversial since the social model of disability (with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511423850">2</xref></sup> has taught us that the environment can be the focus for an intervention, as when a ramp enables a wheelchair user to access a building; by the same token, the environment can sometimes produce disability. More complex implications follow from recognizing that people as well as things are environmental factors.</p>
<p>Human systems (‘systemic’) ideas provide a theoretical basis for taking the human as well as the physical environment fully into account. A systemic perspective has four important effects on the way in which we might view rehabilitation. The first of these is that clinical ‘problems’ are seen to be slippery concepts: different social perspectives produce radically different professional formulations of an individual’s needs and problems. Second, we see that professionals, along with others, can potentially be part of the problem as well as part of the solution. Third, personal and social meanings become more intimately connected with the way in which problems are approached so that we can more clearly see how therapeutic possibilities can be opened (or closed) by conversations between clients, family member and professionals. Fourth, in recognizing the paramount importance of social relationships, we better understand why the individual patient (for example in a hospital ward or in a physiotherapy gym) so often seems like a ‘fish out of water’.</p>
<p>This editorial therefore makes a radical suggestion, that patient-centred care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423850">3</xref></sup> can be a negative as well as a positive influence in rehabilitation. By adopting a relational or systemic approach rather than an individually focused one, rehabilitation practitioners would be better able to understand and respond to clients in their ecological contexts. Significant persons such as carers and family members would no longer be regarded merely as concerned bystanders but as integral parts of the complex ethical and therapeutic systems on which good rehabilitation outcomes depend.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511423850">
<title>Rehabilitation problems are slippery concepts</title>
<p>Patients who come to rehabilitation usually belong to a network of relationships with family members, referrers and others who constitute a ‘community of concern’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511423850">4</xref></sup> Different members of the network may have differing perspectives but professionals who aspire to client-centred practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423850">3</xref></sup> typically place the client and his or her problem at the centre, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511423850">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0269215511423850" position="float">

</fig>
<p>The more we scrutinize the concept of the clinical problem, however, the more elusive it appears. To take a simple example, we might see an inability to stand as the individual patient’s problem, with a standing wheelchair as the solution. But when a request for this costly piece of equipment is rejected by a funder, the ‘problem’ must be redescribed as a relative rather than an absolute need: since few wheelchair users are provided with standing chairs we must consider what could reasonably be provided for our client in relation to the claims of others. The case we make might be economic (for example the equipment might enable the individual to earn money and no longer require benefits) or our justification might be humanitarian (the client will suffer more than others from the social restrictions of a wheelchair). The purpose of this example is not so much to highlight ethical implications as to demonstrate that the description of an individual’s problem is affected when other people, who also have claims on limited resources, are taken into account.</p>
<p>The relevant issues come into sharp relief when they are translated from the societal to the interpersonal level. Suppose I have a patient, Jack, who says he needs more help from his wife, Sally. Because Sally has physical and emotional stresses of her own I am torn between responding to Jack’s and to Sally’s difficulties, but Jack’s status as my client means that his problem is my problem in a way that Sally’s is not. While I will want to help Sally access carer support services I will feel obliged to remind her that my responsibilities are primarily towards Jack who, it appears, has unmet needs. Already a rehabilitation problem (‘not enough care for Jack’) has implicated one other person, his wife, who presents a new problem (‘carer burden’). But what if we asked: ‘Is Jack making reasonable demands on Sally?’ Simply raising the question creates a new perspective from which the nature and the locus of the ‘problem’ may seem less clear.</p>
<p>In the case of Jack and Sally I initially see myself as exclusively committed to my client (Jack) but the question of whether he is being ‘reasonable’ invites me to take the context of a human relationship into account just as, in assessing the need for a standing wheelchair, wider social relationships became relevant as a result of resource limitations. Perhaps Jack is more dependent on Sally than he needs to be; or maybe his demands are provoked partly by fear or mental confusion; or is it that he is continuing a habit of oppression that predated his multiple sclerosis? Or are Sally and Jack expressing tensions unrelated to caring? Alternatively, we might wonder if Sally in some way encourages Jack’s dependency. If so, we have to think of her as an ‘environmental factor’ in the same sense as a physical barrier to wheelchair access. A question-mark now hangs over Jack’s impairment, Sally’s status as ‘carer’ and Sally and Jack’s relationship; the original ‘problem’ formulation must now be seen as provisional and (perhaps) misleading.</p>
<p>Practitioners who recognize that rehabilitation problems are slippery concepts will need to replace the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511423850">Figure 1</xref> with something akin to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215511423850">Figure 2</xref> in which various perspectives generate differing conceptions of the ‘problem’, with no single description of the problem prevailing. The cost of adopting this model is its complexities and uncertainties; the dividend is that the client, and also the professional, are less likely to ‘miss the point’ because we become more able to recognize the relevance of people with different levels of relationship to the rehabilitation process.</p>

<p>In this scheme the multiple perceptions of different members of the ‘community of concern’ generate different perceptions of problems. Any ‘node’ in the system could represent the client (including the position with no avowed concerns).</p>

<title>Others, including professionals, can be part of the problem as well as part of the solution</title>
<p>We professionals have a very human tendency to ignore the way we, too, operate as ‘environmental factors’ in situations such as Jack’s. Thus I, as doctor, am among those who create the assumptions that regulate the way in which Sally and Jack think about their situation. Professionals have the power to validate Jack’s position as someone who should receive care and we are also liable to contribute to the tacit assumption that someone such as Sally would feel obliged to provide it. It is we, as much as anyone, who position Sally as ‘carer’ rather than as ‘wife’. In asking the question ‘Is Jack being unreasonable?’ we position ourselves, moreover, as arbiters of what would be ‘reasonable’ for Sally or anyone else to provide.</p>
<p>The power we wield in such situations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511423850">5</xref></sup> is a far cry from the person-centred, client-focused position which we typically claim as the guiding principle of rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511423850">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511423850">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511423850">7</xref></sup> Our difficulties are not solved solely by empathizing with Jack or with Sally; we also have to acknowledge that we are necessarily implicated along with our clients and their families within a wider social system. We should not keep this insight to ourselves: the influences and power we have are more likely to be beneficial, and less likely to ‘miss the point’ if our clients join us in the effort to be useful in a complex field of relationships.</p>
<p>As a social perspective in rehabilitation would predict, the strategies people themselves use in response to disability are rarely carried out alone (unless social isolation is forced on them). Only a minority appear to have chosen to exclude others from their quests for self-determination. Such people often describe their strategies as reactions against family members and others (such as doctors) who are, thereby, still influential in the process. One of many examples among our patients is a woman with multiple sclerosis (Sharon) whose narrative is of constant struggle not merely (or even mainly?) with physical impairments but also with the need to assert independence from her sister and her elderly mother. To formulate Sharon’s problems simply in terms of her physical disability is to neglect a large part of their meaning to her and thereby to close off therapeutic possibilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269215511423850">
<title>Therapeutic possibilities are opened (or closed) by conversations about meanings</title>
<p>Being cognizant of the social dimension enables us to offer more therapeutic options but only if the client chooses to share our relational perspective. Sharon (in the last example) is currently declining our invitation to take her family context into account and this has so far limited our ability to be useful to her. However, the experience in our outpatient work is that many people with physical disabilities, along with their partners/spouses, welcome a shift from an individual to a relational focus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511423850">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much time may be required for people to move from an intensely private view of disability to an appreciation of a wider context. For a full month after one patient of mine (Aidan) was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis neither he nor his wife (Cath) exchanged one single word about the condition or its implications. For them, silence was an agreed form of communication no doubt made possible by shared understandings of each other’s fears and limitations. Gradually, in the ensuing year, Aidan and Cath began to talk to each other and also to form relationships with relevant health and social services. The psychological work they were doing over this period belonged to neither individual alone; one could say that the couple had jointly ‘got’ multiple sclerosis or perhaps that the two of them were progressively ‘getting’ it over 12 months or more. During that period problems and solutions unfolded dynamically, with no one moment when a definitive description of them could have been given. Aidan and Cath’s shifting perspectives mirror the inevitably dynamic nature of relationships. Just as their early perceptions of multiple sclerosis were co-created, so the articulation of future problems will continue to have a relational context, so long as they remain together (and potentially for longer than that). Because we professionals are related in varying ways with couples like Aidan and Cath, we also are constantly involved in the revision or reframing of problems at the same time as we are addressing them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511423850">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The constant re-creation of meaning is what,in large part, relationships are about.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511423850">10</xref></sup> Philosophically, there is ‘no meaning without context’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511423850">10</xref></sup> and conversely, meanings that people attach to words express their family and cultural contexts. For example, ‘caring’ was a pivotal concept for Jack and Sally and their rehabilitation team would do well to learn how ‘care’ defines Jack’s expectations of Sally and Sally’s obligations (and feelings) towards Jack. In the public discourses of disability, the term ‘carer’ or ‘caregiver’ can sometimes ride roughshod over understandings shared by a couple such as Jack and Sally or Aidan and Cath; how, for example, would they interpret the assumption that they are part of the current British government’s notion of a ‘big society’?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511423850">11</xref></sup> ‘Care’ can connote ‘burden’, ‘guilt’, ‘blame’, ‘anger’ or ‘duty’, as well as ‘love’. In the same way, many other key words acquire special significance within relationships: for example, ‘disability’, ‘normality’ and ‘illness’. Even clinical words, for example ‘pain’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511423850">12</xref></sup> can have different resonances in different family contexts. It is only through an understanding of what words mean for particular people in particular relationships that professionals can make sense of the language of ‘problems’ and contribute to conversations that facilitate useful changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269215511423850">
<title>Towards a better theory of problems and solutions</title>
<p>The assumption I am challenging here is that rehabilitation problems are produced by a linear process of effects and causes and that interventions should be organized primarily around the individual, with the needs of ‘carers’ separately accounted for. I have provided an alternative picture in which clinical problems tend to be dynamic rather than static, changing their form, their content and their meaning in response to social influences. Hence problems come to ‘belong’ to someone in addition to the identified ‘patient’. These ideas, which are derived from human systems theory as applied in systemic family therapy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511423850">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511423850">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511423850">14</xref></sup> open up new therapeutic possibilities.</p>
<p>A useful way of understanding the problems (and solutions) of couples and families is to interpret them as products of a human system. In systemic theory a professional observing a system from the outside is said to adopt a ‘first-order’ perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511423850">13</xref></sup> A ‘second-order’ perspective moves a professional from the position of observer to that of participant within the client’s system. As such, professionals contribute to the ‘re-creation’ of problem descriptions, for better or for worse.</p>
<p>The concept of positions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511423850">15</xref></sup> can be helpful in defining the relationships of people like Sally and Jack but in systemic therapy positions are not seen as immutable facts: perhaps Jack is positioned sometimes as Sally’s ‘patient’, sometimes as her lover, and sometimes as her oppressor. A professional can also move from one position to another in negotiation with clients, sometimes functioning as a directive expert and at other times as a collaborative enabler. Such flexibility can be helpful if it is compatible with professional ethical codes, transparent to the patient and cognizant of risks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511423850">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Risk is a touchstone for many of the issues I have been raising here. Aidan and Cath, who were so silent following the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, were not receptive to my medical advice about physical and psychological risks. I suspect that contemplating the future was difficult because of uncertainties not only about the disease but also about its potential effects on their relationship. My instinctive professional response would have been to reinforce education concerning risks (for example about falls, driving, employment, relational stress and so on). Indeed, offering ‘take it or leave it’ information about risks is part of a professional’s ethical responsibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511423850">1</xref></sup> Given his rejection of advice (and Cath’s anxieties on his behalf) I might at the same time have put a little pressure on Aidan to allow me to refer him for individual counselling. These clinical strategies would have ensured that the problem ‘belonged’ solely to Aidan. Ironically, they could themselves generate a new set of risks if my expert forcefulness alienated Aidan from us, and Cath from Aidan.</p>
<p>A relational focus for rehabilitation offers an alternative whereby Aidan, Cath and myself could come to own the ‘problem’ jointly (just as, in a previous example, Sally, Jack and I were together implicated in their situation). The insight that my professional position is affecting Aidan and Cath would encourage me to facilitate a therapeutic conversation in which we would all be more interested in our effects on each other than we would have been in a strictly medical frame. For example, we would get to know the meanings of risk for each of us (including my own conception of ‘safe’ professional practice). This new way of working could reduce the risk of professional expertise silencing either Aidan or Cath, or of my adding pressure to a relationship that might already be strained. Cath and Aidan would experience my contribution and theirs differently and in the process might learn things that could be useful in the future, about each other and also about the professionals who try to help them. Such a conversation would set the scene for a joint understanding of future problems and a joint negotiation of future risks and uncertainties. Such conversations should be (and often are) at the very heart of rehabilitation processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269215511423850" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A systemic perspective suggests that different social perspectives produce different formulations of an individual’s problems; that people around the patient (including professionals) can be part of the problem as well as part of the solution; and that meaning(s) can be a central part of a problem, so that re-creating meanings through conversations is a crucial aspect of therapy.</p>
<p>Few professionals would fundamentally disagree with these ideas but if they were taken seriously they would produce little short of a revolution in clinical rehabilitation. Patients and family members and others would be integrated within the therapeutic process, and professionals would be repositioned in a way that is discouraged by the standard model of client–professional relationships and by standard interpretations of ‘patient-centred care’. These changes would entail a fundamental shift in power relations. Systemic theory provides a framework for radically rethinking professional practices in rehabilitation and for resolving ethical issues that inevitably arise when more than one individual’s interests are taken into account.</p>
