   <body>
      <p>This year has brought in its wake the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its requirement that pharmaceutical and device companies document all their payments to doctors, medical practices, and teaching hospitals so that, starting in 2013, these costs can be listed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services on a public website. This action will result in unintended but not unforeseeable consequences on 21st-century medical progress.</p>
      <p>The Sunshine rules are unclear and complicated—a bad combination. Not only direct compensation to doctors but also all other costs of industry-supported physician-related research, consulting, and education will be reported.</p>
      <p>Why this drastic and invasive step? In a disingenuous preamble, the Sunshine Act asserts—unsupported by any evidence—that collaborations between physicians and industry might introduce conflicts of interest that could compromise research, education, and clinical integrity.</p>
      <p>But, in reality, the opposite is true. Collaborations between physicians and industry are fundamental to advancing medicine. Academic physicians have the experience to identify unmet clinical needs, advise on potential new treatments, design and conduct innovative research, and, through publications and teaching, bring vital new information to colleagues and patients.</p>
      <p>Without in any way diminishing the governmental and nonprofit agencies that support research, it is the partnership between physicians and industry that has created many, if not most, of the major medical breakthroughs that have reduced the rates of death and other serious outcomes in recent years—as any literature search of major medical journals will quickly confirm.</p>
      <p>Consider, for instance, some examples of collaborations between physicians and pharmaceutical companies in the cardiovascular area: the development of blood-pressure-lowering drugs that sharply cut stroke rates, drugs for fighting cholesterol that dramatically reduce heart attacks, and the creation of treatments for patients with diabetes that protect kidneys and delay or prevent the need for dialysis.</p>
      <p>What, then, is the real agenda of the Sunshine Act? It’s all about money. Its supporters hope that physicians, seeing their compensation made public, will curtail their interactions with industry—thus limiting the development and use of “expensive” new products.</p>
      <p>Understandably, government and private health insurers want to keep costs stable. And with prescription copays being patients’ most visible expense, they might find this action appealing—for a while—until they see how new treatments and their uptake are seriously delayed.</p>
      <p>Still, the reasoning behind the Sunshine Act’s attack on physicians completely misses the point. True, physicians have contributed to increased health care costs, but only a very small fraction of this outlay goes in paying for new medicines and other innovative treatments.</p>
      <p>Overwhelmingly, the steep growth in health spending has been driven by the conspicuous success of our collaborative research and professional education in prolonging the lives of our patients and the resulting need to sustain a growing burden of expensive medical services to an aging population enjoying its newfound longevity.</p>
      <p>Conducting clinical research has become so rigorous and sophisticated that those of us who serve as consultants and investigators to industry recognize it as a major commitment or, in many cases, a primary career path. In addition, as studies are completed, physician researchers add to their professional responsibilities by becoming the teachers of these new findings. This, again, is a complex and demanding task, particularly as presenting medical information in a rigorously balanced and objective fashion—which includes following rules set up by the FDA and other authorities—requires time-consuming and meticulous preparation.</p>
      <p>Critics of these collaborations see compensation of physicians as evidence of undue influence on medical practice. But doctors, like all professionals, should be paid fairly for their time and work. In reality, industry is now so conscious of not appearing to overpay doctors that they employ stringent “fair value” scales to set fees for research, consulting, and teaching activities.</p>
      <p>The fact is that physicians who are busy with these activities are often not as well rewarded as their fellow specialists in full-time clinical practice. Adding to this remunerative divergence is that a key part of research, writing articles for publication, can take weeks of work—usually unpaid so as to avoid any suggestion of bias.</p>
      <p>The Sunshine Act will create troubling misconceptions for and about physicians. Payments reported <italic>for</italic> physicians by industry will almost certainly include funding <italic>they didn’t personally receive</italic>, nor will they take into account the often substantial costs incurred by these physicians in paying their own staff and covering direct and overhead expenses.</p>
      <p>Doctors involved in industry-supported research and education may easily get discouraged and frustrated explaining these complexities to an audience already biased and sated by sensationalistic media reports of physicians “on the take.”</p>
      <p>Yet if the intent of the Sunshine Act is to intimidate physicians and impede availability of new therapies, it could very well backfire. After all, there are still innumerable challenges and unmet needs across the spectrum of medicine obvious not only to professionals but, thanks to the media and particularly the Internet, to a large part of the lay public.</p>
      <p>And so, despite the near impossibility of reliably interpreting financial data reported by Sunshine, this information paradoxically might well have a positive effect and serve as a yardstick of cooperative achievement—acknowledging those physicians whose ongoing professional contributions to collaborative work in research and education have put them at the forefront of advancing patient care.</p>
