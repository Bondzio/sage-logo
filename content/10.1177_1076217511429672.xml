<p>Gifted education consistently comes under scrutiny and criticism regarding the persistent and pervasive underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic students in gifted education. Their underrepresentation is one of the most significant problems facing our schools, along with the achievement gap and special education overrepresentation. It cannot be denied that racially segregated gifted education classes contribute to the national achievement gap. Nationally, Black students are underrepresented in gifted education by at least 50% (some 26,000 students) and Hispanic students are underrepresented by some 40% (some 250,000 students) in gifted programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511429672">Ford, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511429672">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511429672">U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights Data Collection, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>How are these half million underidentified and unidentified gifted and high-potential Black and Hispanic students being served and educated in our schools? How are they not being served in our schools? How and to what extent are they being miseducated and denied an appropriate education based on their needs as gifted <italic>and</italic> culturally different students? Space limitations do not allow for an in-depth discussion; however, several problems permeate much of the scholarship. Rather than reiterate the problems, which others and I have complained and kvetched about <italic>ad nauseum</italic>, I prefer to discuss solutions and recommendations.</p>
<list id="list1-1076217511429672" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Increase accountability.</italic> Educators and families blame each other for poor student performance; they do not take responsibility or hold themselves accountable. Students are caught in the middle of this stalemate; all parties lose. Honest self-appraisal on how we as educators and parents are failing Black and Hispanic students is the first step toward increasing access to gifted classes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Adhere to gifted education philosophy and goals.</italic> Gifted education is often used (and misused) to entice high-income families to public schools and to prevent White flight to private and parochial schools. This is not the purpose of gifted education. More accurately, gifted education exists to meet the needs of gifted and high-potential students—to provide them with an appropriate, responsive, and equitable education.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Improve data analyses.</italic> Analyze and use data in meaningful and instructive ways. Inadequate teacher referrals, tests, and policies and procedures contribute greatly to segregation in gifted classes. Eliminate barriers. A formal evaluation of gifted education is needed in every school district, with data evaluated annually.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Improve teacher cultural competence.</italic> Few colleges and universities have courses and programs in gifted and multicultural education. Most teachers are not prepared to work competently with culturally different, low-income, and gifted students. Highly qualified teachers must be placed with minority students to nurture and develop gifts and talents.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Professional development in schools must prepare teachers to be culturally competent.</italic> All that we as educators (teachers, counselors, psychologists, administrators, etc.) need to know about students cannot be addressed in 4 years. Professional development is vital. However, professional must be of the highest quality—ongoing, rigorous, and addresses real issues and tough issues. When professional development is substantive, it can do much to assist teachers and their students.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Improve expectations.</italic> High expectations improve referrals of Black and Hispanic students to gifted education classes and programs. The data on expectations is overwhelming and quite consistent. High expectations often beget high student achievement; low expectations often guarantee low achievement among students.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Increase teacher diversity.</italic> Nationally, only about 15% of teachers are non-White. The percentages are not much higher in local schools. A diverse school staff improves achievement and morale. Leaders in gifted education need to make a concerted effort to diversify the teaching force—teachers, counselors, psychologists, and administrators.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Collaborate with and reach out to uninformed families.</italic> Black and Hispanic families want their children to have a rigorous education. They need educators’ understanding, empathy, and support. Educators must ensure that communication with all families is transparent—that Black and Hispanic parents are viewed as legitimate and valuable members of the gifted education community.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Provide mentoring.</italic> The more advocates students have, the better they perform academically. Effective mentoring motivates and inspires Black and Hispanic students and aids them in coping with barriers to achievement. Educators ought to pay greater attention to the effectiveness of mentors and role modes in the lives of Black and Hispanic students. The more we have input and support from other professionals, the more equitable it will be for underrepresented students in gifted education.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Promote a scholar identity among Black and Hispanic students</italic>. Students learn to believe and accept low expectations and negative stereotypes about them. Dr. Whiting and I have created the Scholar Identity Institute for Black males. We are devoted to unbrainwashing them and exposing them to all they are capable of being academically. Schools and families must advise and counsel Black and Hispanic students in ways that develop and nurture their gifts and talents, as well as racial pride and identity.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Two thoughts come to mind as I end this column. I hope readers will take them to heart and take action.</p>
<p>In 1954, the landmark decision <italic>Brown v. The Board of Education</italic> ruled segregated schools unconstitutional. This includes segregated gifted education classes.</p>
<p>Horace Mann said that education is the greatest equalizer. When we open doors to gifted education, this idea and ideal can be achieved.</p>
