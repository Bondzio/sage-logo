<p>“You cannot enslave a mind that knows itself, that values itself, that understands itself,” Wangari Maathai tells us. So begins the story of Maathai’s 35-year struggle to defend human rights, promote democracy, and protect the environment in Kenya by confronting not just deforestation and poverty, but ignorance, intransigent economic interests, and violent political oppression. In a testimony to her struggle, Wangari Maathai received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy, and peace. <italic>Taking Root</italic> is a powerful account of how respect for human dignity and belief in the transformative power of ordinary women and men can “take root” where “normal forms of democracy” are considered impossible.</p>
<p>The film begins with Maathai describing her life in Kenya as a child, where frog eggs flourished in clear rivers beneath massive trees. Earning a scholarship in 1960, she leaves to study in the United States and eventually becomes the first East African women to earn a PhD. When she returns to her childhood home, she finds the frog eggs gone along with the rivers and trees. She also discovers rural women struggling to find firewood and water for their families. They had to put too much land into cash crops and their children were suffering from disease associated with malnutrition, Maathai recalls. “Why don’t you plant trees,” she asked the women? “We would,” the women replied, “but we don’t know how to plant trees.” Thus, the Green Belt Movement was born.</p>
<p>Deforestation, however, was a symptom of a deeper pathology rooted in colonialism. Through the skillful use of maps and interviews combined with archival and contemporary film clips, the film reveals the depth of the challenges facing the Green Belt Movement. We see that upon arrival the much smaller British force established control by undermining local tribal organizations. “The British came with the utmost force of terrorism,” environmental activist Kamoji Wachiira explains, to weaken local cultural infrastructures and convince the indigenous populations that their history and traditions were inferior. What began as razing villages, cutting down forests, and massacring populations ended with a scorched earth campaign to drive out the Mau Mau—Africa’s first armed liberation struggle—from the forests. But the film demonstrates that colonial devastation was not limited to the environment or human lives, but also involved cultural genocide. “Our culture was not written down, so when the elders died the culture died with them.” The resulting vacuum, Maathai explains, was filled with a European culture that commercialized nature and set the stage for the pattern of ecological destruction. In the end, the British established structures that ensured that Kenya’s postcolonial leaders continued the disastrous environmental policies necessary to provide international markets with timber, coffee, tea, and other cash crops.</p>
<p>It was a brutal postcolonial system most felt impossible to change, and not surprisingly, as the Green Belt Movement grew, the government began a campaign of harassment. Movement organizers responded with capacity-building workshops so that women and men could develop strategies of resistance as well as understand the importance of environmental rights, women’s rights, and political rights. As consciousness-raising exercises empowered the “little grassroots people,” the movement strengthened sufficiently to confront the repressive postcolonial system.</p>
<p>A turning point came in 1989 when the Green Belt Movement successfully challenged the government’s attempt to privatize Uhuru Park in Nairobi. Fearing the loss of a significant public space, Maathai urged the international community to withdraw financial support for the project. Although Maathai’s appeals and the government’s tyrannical response eventually led foreign investors to cancel the project, the achievement was predicated upon prior organizing as part of building the Green Belt Movement. During this event (and after), Maathai’s life was in constant danger; these networks became her protector. As human rights activists explain, the event was critical because it taught people that anyone can make a difference while reframing the ecological struggle as a struggle for human rights and human dignity. As long as ordinary Kenyans were excluded from the political system, all public space—the environment—was threatened.</p>
<p>The documentary is not a linear account of Maathai’s life or of social change in Kenya, which creates some disjuncture in the story. The film nonetheless develops a deep and complex account that contextualizes a range of issues relating to social change and community building. Among these are the legacies of colonialism; the effects of neoliberal globalization; the importance of civil society and social capital; the links between culture and gender relations; environmental, human, and women’s rights; and the meaning of democracy. While some, such as the environment, are brought into sharp focus, other issues are more subtly interwoven into the narrative. What is social capital and civil society and why are they important? How might reframing social problems as human rights serve to generate a broader movement? What is the role and responsibility of wealthy societies, global corporations, and global organizations like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund to improving the quality of life? While these are not explicitly addressed in the film, the rich detail will allow instructors to generate active and fruitful discussions around these issues in such courses as social problems, social change, and globalization, as well as those on the environment, women’s rights, human rights, and social movements.</p>
<p>In sum, the film provides an opportunity to critically examine how to build societies in which decision makers and decision takers sit at the same table. In this regard, the film is not so much a story of Wangari Maathai’s life, but a broader narrative about the journey of Kenya with implications beyond Kenya—the significance of which comes from Major General Njuki Mwaniki at the end of the film: “We believe that soldiers and trees are brothers,” he says. “Our role is to protect the country. And the role of the trees is to protect the environment.” Given the history of colonial and postcolonial repression in Kenya, footage of soldiers planting trees is an extremely powerful positive image.</p>
