<p>Unfortunately, prejudice remains a significant experience for the majority of African Americans in varying contexts within the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798411414020">D’Augelli &amp; Hershberger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095798411414020">Landrine &amp; Klonoff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798411414020">Swim, Hyers, Cohen, Fitzgerald, &amp; Bylsma, 2003</xref>). Researchers since the time of Freud have attempted to understand and explain this disturbing phenomenon by grounding it in specific theoretical frameworks, thus making them amenable to systematic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798411414020">Freud, 1923/1959</xref>). In <italic>The Relational Origins of Prejudice: A Convergence of Psychoanalytic and Social Cognitive Perspectives</italic>, Ron B. Aviram continues and extends this tradition making significant contributions to the theoretical and psychotherapeutic enterprise of understanding the psychological birth of prejudice. Indeed, a valuable work for all clinicians and researchers interested in better understanding prejudice toward African Americans and others. Aviram amplifies our understanding of prejudice, in part, by expanding our understanding of object-relations theory and introducing into the representational world what he terms <italic>the social object</italic>. For Aviram, the social object is a natural outgrowth of W. R. D. Fairbairn’s conceptualization of how love objects and primary identification with these objects aid in forging self-identity.</p>
<p>Fairbairn proposed that identity formation was the outgrowth of a gradual process of intrapsychic identifications, beginning with the quality of the child’s relationship with his/her primary caregivers as well as those forged with progressively larger social groups (e.g., the family, the school, the nation). Due to Fairbairn’s tenet that human beings are by nature object related, dependence or identification with these love objects is understood as natural and necessary within certain healthy limits. In addition, Fairbairn posited that salutary psychological development depends on the person’s ability to establish and maintain psychic equilibrium (i.e., dependence and separation) with his/her love objects. Therefore, the social object is Aviram’s way of psychologically representing a person’s general unconscious working relationship with these love object representations, which consciously manifest themselves both with and within the large group.</p>
<p>The social object significantly expands our understanding of traditional object-relations theory, in this case the person’s perceived relationship to the larger group based in early caregiver experience, in that it affords the clinician the added conceptual possibility of understanding the person <italic>as</italic> integral group member (i.e., collective identity). Hence, Aviram’s social object retains the affective intensity of its identification with its early caregivers as well as the relational blueprint for how such a person identifies with the large group. Aviram cogently argues that prejudice occurs when a person overidentifies with his/her in-group. According to Aviram, overidentification can be understood to occur as a defense mechanism against annihilation anxiety, which includes loss of identity and self; fears that are psychically immature in nature that lead to unhealthy dependence on love objects for a sense of self, security, protection, and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Aviram incorporates as well as extends traditional attachment theory vis-à-vis prejudice at this critical conceptual stage of his argument. He contends that the affective bond that serves as a <italic>secure base</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095798411414020">Bowlby, 1969</xref>) for the child in classic attachment theory mirrors the affective binding of the person to the group. He suggests that most persons who possess a secure attachment engage out-group members in a nonpartisan manner when there exists a secure base, but insecurely attached and insecure ambivalent attached persons may find it necessary to cling to and overidentify with the large group to defend against perceived threat as well as to indemnify. In other words, prejudice may be viewed as a maladaptive intrapsychic survival mechanism. In sum, Aviram concludes, “Prejudice is a result of an aberration in the relationship of the individual with his or her ingroup” (p. 2).</p>
<p>Aviram provides an in-depth review of the psychoanalytic and social psychological literature in relation to prejudice in a manner that is readable and scholarly. In addition, he provides useful clinical examples from personal experience that highlight and advance his theorizing. Moreover, a significant strength of Aviram’s work is his ability to present complex theoretical material in such a manner that comprehensive knowledge of it is not compulsory. Case in point is his introduction to differing aspects of Fairbairn’s object-relations relational theory in well-situated places within the narrative where such information helps clarify his argument. This monograph should prove useful to students, clinicians, academics, community workers, and the countless persons who work in the education system.</p>
