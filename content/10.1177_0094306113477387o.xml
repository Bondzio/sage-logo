<p>The topic of immigration has generated many ingrained notions about the integration and outcome of migrants. <italic>Helping Young Refugees and Immigrants Succeed: Public Policy, Aid, and Education</italic> challenges these ideas based on an analysis of past and current immigrants. Despite idealized notions of quick assimilation by young immigrants and refugees at the beginning of the twentieth century, Gerhard Sonnert and Gerald Holton, along with other scholars and advocacy groups, demonstrate that the earlier group faced issues similar to those faced by current immigrants. Education and a group’s beliefs surrounding it are particularly important in the quicker assimilation of some groups, in addition to social class, and the context of reception, argue some of authors. Both in the past and in recent years, organizations and co-ethnic groups, as well as other minority groups, have been crucial to the integration of immigrants and refugees. Well-respected immigration scholars and professionals in humanitarian organizations pull from a rich history of experiences from previous young immigrants, develop excellent analyses of current immigrants and refugees, and reveal the underlying goals and specific actions of organizations aimed at assisting this population today.</p>
<p>The book, divided into six parts, starts by offering an historical framework for understanding the social context and public debate on the integration of young immigrants in the early twentieth century. Part II looks at specific aspects, practices, and social dynamics that enabled or hindered the success of many “Second Wave” young European immigrants. The third part focuses on current immigration to the United States and its interaction with race and ethnicity, politics and public policy, assimilation, the receiving country’s views, identity issues, and legal status. The fourth part sheds light on the link between language, graduation rates, institutions, and young immigrants’ educational outcomes. Part V reveals government and non-governmental organizations’ view on assisting a very diverse immigrant population and defining immigrant success from an organizational perspective. The two chapters that make up the sixth and final part of the book discuss the changing contexts and actions of immigrants within their origin and host communities.</p>
<p>Displaying a brilliant balance between lessons learned from past immigrant experiences, deep analyses of current immigrant groups, and the role of various factors affecting integration like education, culture, policies, and organizations, this is an excellent read for anyone interested in immigration and refugees and their integration into a host society. Immigration scholars in sociology, demography, anthropology, public policy, and human development, as well as educators, volunteers, and professionals in organizations, will find this text extremely enriching and thought-provoking.</p>
