<p>This edited volume centres on an important political and academic issue since the financial crash of 2008: the relationship between the state and the market. The book uses a collection of 10 case studies based on a diverse range of geographical and policy settings to provide a timely empirical contribution to new public management (NPM) and public sector reform debates. What all of the authors have in common is their shared view that markets, and the state’s relationship with markets, should not be used in a one-size-fits-all approach across public service contexts.</p>
<p>The book begins with a well-written and thought-provoking introductory chapter by Ramesh and Araral centring on the reform of the public sector and the role of markets in public service provision. This is followed by Peters’ chapter (Chapter 2) which introduces theoretical discussions on the concept of governance and the role of the state (including ideas such as the neo-Weberian state, the primacy of politics and the concept of metagovernance). Peters proposes a ‘pendulum’ concept regarding the role of the state and the market in public service delivery and suggests that, post-financial crisis, the pendulum has swung back towards the state. However, Warner (Chapter 3) calls for the ‘emergence of a new balanced position which combines use of markets, democracy and planning to reach decisions which may be both efficient and more socially optimal’ (p. 43). The need to balance state and market relations is central to the remaining chapters, which identify or call for a move away from dichotomous ideas of public service delivery. For example, Pierre and Painter (Chapter 4) highlight the tensions between the use of NPM reforms and the legal framework of public administration, arguing that market reform at some stage will clash with the traditional normative foundation of the public service. They criticize the retrospective nature in which some states have sought to reassert legal and public good frameworks into market-based approaches. Similarly, in Chapter 5, Walker et al. test UK local government reforms guided by the normative assumption that public organizations should have a market orientation with a strong customer focus, and that the adoption of such a culture will lead to public service improvement. Their statistical model finds that market orientation does a poor job of explaining performance in this context, and other variables, such as organizational comparison between similar public sector bodies, have more of an effect. Their findings add to the broader discussions in the book of the transference of NPM delivery methods across sectors and the extent to which public-choice theory is an appropriate approach for service design and evaluation.</p>
<p>Chapters 6–12 use a series of policy-based case studies (transport, electricity, water and healthcare) and national contexts (Hong Kong, Asia, Vietnam, China and Brazil) to discuss NPM policy approaches outside the usual Anglo-American and Western European settings. The inclusion of research findings on the use and regulation of markets in post-communist states demonstrates the complexity of political and institutional structures in state–market relations. These case studies focus on attempts to marketize services or privatize utilities and are a valuable addition to recent NPM debates because of their context and research depth. As the book title suggests, ways of ‘reasserting’ are key findings in these studies and, in most cases, are linked to the response of the state to views of market failure; for example, Painter and Mok’s (Chapter 9) research on the Chinese education market where the response of the state was to introduce regulatory and financial reforms. The authors argue that retrospective action signifies a redefining of the relationship between state and market. In most of these chapters the authors identify state attempts to ‘claw back’ power that had ‘been deleted, delegated, or otherwise diffused to market or social actors’ (p. 8).</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter Fritzen and Xun consider whether collectively the case studies help to question the uniformity of processes of reassertion across geopolitical boundaries. They refer to two conceptual ideas of state–market relations: first, a pendulum view presented by Peters in Chapter 2; and, second, the ‘golden mean view’ touched upon by Warner in Chapter 3. Drawing on the findings of the case studies in the previous chapters the authors argue that (referencing Stone, 2001), ‘reforms are part of political strategies that are profoundly representational and symbolic, and in which different meanings can be attached to the same phenomenon by different observers’ (p. 213).</p>
<p>In sum, the need for academics and policy practitioners to consider the application of NPM reforms in localized contexts is an important message of the book. The strength of the book lies in the variety of case studies which collectively reveal the ideological tensions between neo-liberal policy approaches and the normative framework of public services. As such, the book is an important contribution to recent NPM debates and public sector reform strategies</p>
