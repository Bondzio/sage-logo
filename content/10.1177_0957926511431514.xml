<p>This study aims to offer a fresh look at the relationship between identity, stance-taking and code choice. The study provides three examples of different forms of Egyptian public discourse related directly to identity that took place during the 2011 revolution of Egypt, a time when state TV media stations cast doubt on the identity of the protestors by utilizing linguistic resources. This article argues that during the process of stance-taking speakers employ linguistic resources, discourse resources and structural resources. These linguistic resources include the associations and indexes of different languages and varieties, in this case Standard Arabic (SA), Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) and English. This stance-taking process depends on code-switching as a mechanism that lays claims to different indexes and thus appeals to different ideologies and different facets of identity. Second, this study also shows how speakers use public discourse in order to construe language as a classification category and an identity builder.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Times of conflict are also times when discourses about identity are in the limelight. The Egyptian revolution of 25 January 2011 became a media war. The main question behind this war was: who represents the ‘real Egyptian’ and what does s/he want? Does the real Egyptian want to change the regime, or are the couple of million in Tahrir Square no more than a couple of million who do not truly represent the majority of the 85 million Egyptians? While there were protests throughout the country, the media feud made Tahrir Square its focal point and all over the world news broadcasts also concentrated on the same square. Egyptian state TV, as well as pro-government satellite channels, tried to ignore the whole protest movement for as long as possible. On 25 January, the state Egyptian channel, during the revolution, broadcast cooking programmes. While other media (for example, Aljazeera and the BBC) covered these events in detail, the Egyptian media pretended there were only a few dozen people in Tahrir Square rather than millions.</p>
<p>When the government media finally did talk about the protest movement, they tried to cast doubt on both the motivations and core identity of the protestors. It is noteworthy, however, that Egypt is a diglossic community, a community in which two language varieties exist, each with a different function: an H variety – in our case, Standard Arabic (SA) and an L variety – in our case, Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA). This diglossic situation provides a rich environment for the study of identity and language in general.</p>
<p>The media linguistic war during the Egyptian revolution needs a book by itself. The government official discourse in all Arab countries in which protests have erupted is indeed worth studying and analysing. However, in this article, I will discuss three clear and representative examples in detail. The three examples present three different forms of public discourse; what they all have in common is the fact that they all occurred while a political struggle – a revolution – took place. These struggles were mostly peaceful, but at times they turned bloody, as on 2 and 3 February 2011. They all took place days before Mubarak abdicated. They also all directly discuss ‘the Egyptian identity’. The first example is from a special programme from Nile TV that covered the current affairs in Egypt during the protest movement. The programme accepts and discusses calls from audience members as well. The example analysed is of a live call-in from an ‘Egyptian’ on 3 February, who supposedly gives a first-hand account of the identity and motivations of the people in Tahrir Square. The second example is from a talk show, <italic>Life Today</italic>, on the Al-Hayat channel, in which the revolution was also discussed by an Egyptian conservative actress (who significantly wears a headscarf) on 5 February. In the example analysed, she discusses the identity of the protestors in Tahrir Square. The third example is different since it is a poem that presents the opposite point of view. It is a poem supposedly written by the protestors to defend their identity and motivations. However, this poem had one of the widest distributions possible during the revolution: directly after being broadcast on Abu-Dhabi TV on 8 February 2011, the poem was uploaded on YouTube, shared on Facebook links, and eventually became a symbol of the revolutionary discourse. While the first two examples cast doubt on the identity of the protestors in Tahrir Square by giving verdicts about their linguistic abilities, in the third example, the poet uses language to re-claim ‘the Egyptian identity’ for himself and all those in Tahrir Square. Although poetry is a different kind of public discourse, the distribution of specific poems, especially this one, underscores their importance in the discussion of identity.</p>

<title>Approaches and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0957926511431514">
<title>Approaches adopted in this study</title>
<p>In this work, I adopt the social process and practice approach to language which considers language as a social practice, speakers as social actors and boundaries as an outcome of social action. According to this approach, languages are not whole independent systems, but are considered linguistic resources that speakers draw upon under specific conditions and in specific circumstances. Language form and language content are both considered to be part of the same process. Therefore, languages have to be studied in relation to ideology, social practice and social organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957926511431514">Heller, 2007</xref>: 1–2). Language attitude and ideology are of pivotal importance in Egypt as will become clear below.</p>
<p>The aim of this article is twofold: first, this study shows how speakers use public discourse in order to construe language as an independent variable similar to religion, social class and ethnicity – a variable that is studied as a classification category or an identity builder. The examples below will show how language ‘is talked about’, as well as how it is used to reflect identity.</p>
<p>Second, the article argues that stance-taking as a process is directly related to identity construction. In other words, speakers use language to take a stance and by doing so give themselves a specific identity and impose on others a different one. During the process of stance-taking, people employ linguistic resources, discourse resources and structural resources. These linguistic resources include the associations and indexes of SA, ECA and even foreign languages. That is, this stance-taking process, which reflects directly on identity construction, depends on code-switching as a mechanism that lays claim to different indexes and thus appeals to different ideologies and eventually different facets of identity. Therefore, I refer to indexicality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957926511431514">Johnstone, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957926511431514">Woolard, 2004</xref>) and markedness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957926511431514">Myers-Scotton, 1993</xref>), two theories that can further our understanding of code-switching as a structural strategy that is employed in the process of stance-taking. By so doing, I attempt to add a new dimension to research on both stance and identity construction as related processes.</p>
<p>Before analysing the data, I will explain the concepts mentioned above, including stance, indexicality and markedness.</p>
<p>Stance is considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926511431514">Ochs (1992)</xref> as the mediating path between linguistic forms and social identities. To explain further, stance is a ‘contextualization cue’ that informs interlocutors of the nature of the role the speaker aims to project in relation to the form and content of his or her utterance; for example, choices of aspect, modals or evidential statements can display a speaker’s attitude with the claims or content of reported speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957926511431514">Jaffe, 2007</xref>: 56). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431514">Du Bois (2007)</xref> posits that ‘I evaluate something and thereby position myself, and align or disalign with you’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431514">2007</xref>: 163). In a single act of stance-taking, three things are achieved: evaluation, positioning and alignment. Evaluation refers to the process by which a stance-taker ‘characterizes’ an object of stance as having ‘specific quality or value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431514">2007</xref>: 143). Positioning is when the stance-taker makes his affective stance clear and claims to have some degree of certainty or knowledge. Alignment is the act of standardizing and normalizing the relation between different stances (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957926511431514">Damari, 2010</xref>: 611; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431514">Du Bois, 2007</xref>: 144; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957926511431514">Jaffe, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of indexicality is originally a philosophical concept that was introduced by the American philosopher Charles Sanders Pierce and later adopted into linguistics by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926511431514">Ochs (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957926511431514">Silverstein (1996)</xref>. It refers to the ways in which an observable fact, including a linguistic one, can be considered an iconic sign if it resembles what it is taken to mean. A sign is symbolic if it is related to its meaning by convention and not resemblance. A sign is indexical if it is related to its meaning mostly because of co-occurrence with the thing it is taken to mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957926511431514">Johnstone, 2010</xref>: 31). Indexical forms can imply and/or construct identity. The concept of indexicality involves the creation of semiotic links between linguistic forms and social meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926511431514">Ochs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957926511431514">Silverstein, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957926511431514">Ochs (1992)</xref> argues that one should consider identity formation at multiple indexical levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957926511431514">Bucholtz and Hall (2010</xref>: 21) define an index as a linguistic form that depends on the interactional context for its meaning. Indexical processes occur at all levels of linguistic structure and use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957926511431514">Johnstone, 2010</xref>). This concept will be employed in relation to the associations of SA, ECA and English in Egypt, and how language form and code choice are manipulated by speakers to construct identity. SA is associated with religion, mainly Islam, and with history and tradition. It is also associated with a broader national identity in which SA is ‘the glue’ that ties the Arab world together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957926511431514">Walters, 2007</xref>). It is the language variety used in formal settings such as court rooms, political speeches, etc. Therefore, it is associated with authority, power and, to some extent, authenticity. SA has been attacked by the British colonizers in Egypt (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926511431514">Bassiouney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957926511431514">Suleiman, 2003</xref>), and this has also emphasized the associations of SA with Arab national identity more generally.</p>
<p>ECA is associated with spontaneity, intimacy, informality and, again, to a great extent, authenticity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957926511431514">1</xref></sup> In a number of studies on code-switching between SA and ECA, linguists have argued that ECA is used by politicians, for example, to appeal to their audience and position themselves as one of them (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926511431514">Bassiouney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957926511431514">Holes, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Related to indexicality is markedness theory which was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957926511431514">Myers-Scotton (1993)</xref>. Myers-Scotton argues that whether code-switching has a discourse function or a social motivation depends on both the speaker and the audience. Both are aware of what is conventionally expected from them in a community. This idea of mutual agreement concerning the expectations of audience and speaker is what differentiates marked from unmarked choices. Myers-Scotton explains what she means by markedness by proposing that ‘what community norms would predict is unmarked, what is not predicted is marked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957926511431514">1998</xref>: 5). In other words, switching is governed by tacit social conventions. Markedness is related to social practices and how speakers position themselves in relation to others, as will be clear in the following sections.</p>

<sec id="section4-0957926511431514">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>When relating the concept of stance to variationist research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957926511431514">Kiesling (2009</xref>: 173) argues that there is a methodological problem with coding stance. Kiesling contends that ‘there is a general problem in such work of coding stances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957926511431514">Kiesling, 2009</xref>: 173). Stance in general and not just in variationist research is a concept that is at times subjective and difficult to quantify. I attempt to partially solve this problem by concentrating on specific linguistic resources, as will become clear in the following text.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that language is a social process and social practice, and by applying theories discussed above that relate identity to stance-taking processes, I argue that speakers use the following linguistic resources to take a stance and by so doing reveal an identity or cast doubt on other identities.</p>

<title>Data analysis and discussion</title>
<p>Identity, national, social and collective is not necessarily what one ‘is’ but what one believes s/he is. It is directly related to self-perception. This perception is the product of years of conditioning by economic, socio-historical and ethno-global contexts. This perception is also mainly the product of public discourse. The conditioning that happens to all of us is a process that takes place from a number of outsiders and insiders. Insiders are usually members of a group of similar individuals who share the same self-perception and differentiate themselves from others by indexing their common traits. The media’s main task is to categorize and generalize: the West versus the East, the black versus the white, the Hispanics, the Arabs, the Muslims, the Jews, etc. This is exactly what occurs in the first two examples discussed.</p>
<p>National identity has been defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957926511431514">Wodak (1999</xref>: 22) as primarily the product of public discourse. She argues that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We assume ‘national identity’ to imply a complex of similar conceptions and perceptual schemata, of similar emotional dispositions and attitudes, and of similar behavioral conventions, which bearers of this ‘national identity’ share collectively and which they have internalized through socialization (education, politics, the media, sports and everyday practices). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957926511431514">1999</xref>: 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Wodak, it is the shared perception of attitudes, conventions, moral disposition and even shared prejudices that define our sense of national identity. She adds that, in that sense, a national identity is both vulnerable and impressionable. It is, to a great extent, also subjective, as will become clear later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957926511431514">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section9-0957926511431514">
<title>Tamer’s attack on the identity of the protestors</title>
<p>The first example is a famous, or rather infamous, example of a man who only gives his first name and his supposed whereabouts: ‘Tamir min ġamra’. ‘Tamer from the district of Ghamra in Cairo’ claims to have had first-hand encounters with people in Tahrir Square. Tamer phones Nile TV to participate on air for the current affairs programme on 3 February 2011. Tamer and the announcer discuss the identity of the protestors in Tahrir Square and both agree that these protestors are not ‘real Egyptians’, and therefore do not represent what Egyptians want or demand. Note that, throughout the call, Tamer is in tears and sometimes has to stop speaking altogether, to control his crying. In the English translation, T stands for Tamer and A stands for the announcer.</p>

<p>If we apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431514">Du Bois’ stance triangle (2007)</xref>, then we note that Tamer disaligns himself from the people in Tahrir Square. He positions himself as the well-informed Egyptian sufferer who posits that the people in Tahrir, because of their linguistic practices, are not Egyptians (an evaluative statement). Both Tamer and the announcer have the same stance. Through discourse resources and structural resources that include presupposition, stance adverbs, adjectives, tense, pronouns, negation, deixis, rhetorical questions and code-switching, they attempt to achieve their aim, which is mainly to influence the wider audience watching them to adhere to their stance as the real Egyptians who love Egypt and care about its future.</p>
<p>Tamer also uses both discourse and structural resources to attack the core identity of protestors in Tahrir and to position himself as the ‘real Egyptian’ who thus represents the millions of Egyptians who did not go to Tahrir Square but stayed at home to watch the events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957926511431514">3</xref></sup> What distinguishes Tamer from these Egyptian bystanders is that he ‘was’ in Tahrir Square and, supposedly, has first-hand knowledge of what happened there, although he was helpless to stop it.</p>
<p>In his first factual statement, Tamer comes across as a caring wise Egyptian: ‘the country has been wrecked and we are the reason’. The tense changes in this statement from past to future: this is what took place, and what will come is even worse. History will blame us for being so passive. The pronoun <italic>ʔih.na</italic> is repeated twice to distinguish between ‘the Egyptians’ and the others who are foreigners and pretend to be Egyptians. Tamer employs the ‘we’ and ‘they’ dichotomy discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957926511431514">Gumperz (1982)</xref> throughout and uses code-switching to emphasize this dichotomy. The announcer then asks Tamer to distinguish between the Egyptians and non-Egyptians in Tahrir Square:</p>
<list id="list4-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(2)</bold> <bold>Announcer</bold>: ʔismaḥ li ʔinta bitʔu:l fi magmuʕa:t guwwa bitimnaʕ in-na:s mil-xuru:g. il-magmuʕa:t <bold>do:l</bold> sawa:ʔ kanu maṣriyyi:n aw aga:nib/ tiʔdar/ timayyiz il-maṣriyyi:n <bold>do:l</bold> aw il-aga:nib <bold>do:l</bold> ginsiyya:t muʕayyana/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  <bold>A</bold>: Allow me, you say the groups that are inside (Tahrir Square) stop others from getting out of the square? These groups, are they Egyptians or foreigners? Can you distinguish between them? Can you distinguish their nationalities?</p></list-item></list>
<p>In this part, the announcer uses ECA lexes and structure. It is notable that the ECA plural demonstrative <italic>do:l</italic> is repeated three times. There are no SA features in this part.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957926511431514">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tamer starts to answer the announcer’s query about whether they are foreigners or Egyptians by using the pronoun <italic>humma</italic> (‘they’). The juxtaposition becomes clearer in this part. He starts relating language directly to identity. Language is regarded as a classification category rather than a communicative one: an independent variable such as religion or ethnicity. He says: ‘they are foreigners, they speak English very well’. The adverb is followed by an adjective, <italic>kuwayyis giddan</italic>; both are used to emphasize that the protesters can by no means be Egyptians. Their mastery of English is impeccable. The fact that he code-switches to English himself, saying ‘English language’, puts him in the position of the fair assessor of their linguistic capabilities. He has also mastered English so he can judge whether they are foreigners or Egyptians. Code-switching is used as a structural strategy to clarify his stance and give weight to his statements. The indexes of English are also clear in this example: it is simply the language of past colonizers and foreigners. It is also a language that is easily understood and accessible, and therefore these foreigners are dangerous: they can appeal to masses of people and ‘these foreigners’ do not necessarily come from an English-speaking country. They could be (as was implied in other state-sponsored TV programmes) trained in English but work in or belong to Iran, Qatar, Israel or even Hamas – all accused by Egyptian media at that time of stirring the revolution and backing it.</p>
<p>Tamer uses ECA negation after this statement. He uses the existential negative construction, ‘no one speaks anything but’, to confirm his previous statement. Rather than use English again in saying ‘English language’, he repeats his statement in ECA and refers to English in SA and not in ECA or English. He could have said <italic>ingli:zi</italic> but he says <italic>ingli:ziyya</italic>. He then refers to the slogan that will be used the day after: <italic>yo:m il-xala:ṣ</italic> (‘day of riddance’). The English word ‘slogan’ is used rather than the Arabic <italic>ʃiʕa:r</italic>. Again, this brings to mind the indexes of English. Another structural strategy that he uses is the rhetorical question ‘riddance of what?’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957926511431514">5</xref></sup> The rhetorical question implies that there is really no problem. It is the protestors who created this problem.</p>
<p>The announcer’s affective statement <italic>ʔana ʔaqaddar lak da</italic> (‘I appreciate this from you’) clarifies his stance. He not only believes Tamer but appreciates his love for his country. What is really noteworthy is the marked phonological use of the SA ‘q’ rather than the ECA glottal stop in <italic>ʔa<bold>qa</bold>ddar</italic>, the verb ‘to appreciate’. Although the whole statement is in ECA (including again the ECA demonstrative <italic>da</italic>), the use of SA ‘q’ clearly marks the stance of the announcer. The term of address ‘my professor’ is endearing but also prestigious. The announcer does not for a moment doubt Tamer or argue with him. He not only agrees with him, but bestows upon him the status of the expert who should be appreciated. This, in itself, will, after the revolution, be criticized ruthlessly by opposition media makers.</p>
<p>Tamer then bursts into tears and cannot answer the announcer’s question. So the announcer repeats his demands, this time using presupposition and code-switching:</p>
<list id="list5-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(3)</bold> <bold>Announcer</bold>: ʕustað ta:mir/bi-ḥaʔʔi xo:fak ʕala <bold>ha:ða</bold> l-waṭan innak tilabbi:h/inta fi ġamra dilwaʔti/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  <bold>A</bold>: Mr Tamer, I ask you through your love for this country that you answer my request. You are in Ghamra now?</p></list-item></list>
<p>The announcer presupposes that Tamer loves this country. This is why he asks him through his ‘love for this country’ to answer his request. For the first time, the announcer uses the SA demonstrative, <italic>ha:ða</italic> (‘this’), when he refers to Egypt as ‘this homeland’, laying claim to the authoritative indexes of SA, indicating that this homeland is not a laughing matter and is not to be tampered with. It has to be respected and protected. It is Tamer who is the one who loves ‘this’ country – the protestors do not care about it. They in fact want to harm it, since they are not even Egyptians. The announcer then makes attempts at verifying Tamer’s whereabouts by asking ‘You are in Ghamra now?’. By so doing, he again adds credibility to Tamer’s statements. Tamer exists, he is real and he is now in Ghamra after leaving Tahrir Square.</p>
<p>Tamer replies that he is indeed in Ghamra and then refers to his personal experience about finding difficulty in telephoning the programme. The use of the personal pronoun ‘I’ is followed by reference to other people who may fail to call in. When the announcer tries to interrupt him, Tamer breaks down completely and starts pleading with the TV and also with what he calls ‘the real Egyptians’.</p>
<list id="list6-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">

<list-item><p>  <bold>T</bold>:  Please for my sake, I need the [government] TV. I need the real Egyptians.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Tamer positions himself as the one who really cares but is helpless to stop what is happening. For Tamer and the announcer, the dichotomy between ‘us’ and ‘them’ is now complete: we are passive Egyptians, they are simply not Egyptians at all.</p>
<p>The announcer then code-switches again to SA and uses two SA demonstratives (highlighted here):</p>
<list id="list7-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(5)</bold> <bold>Announcer</bold>: ʃarrafna fi qana:t in-ni:l/ inta ʔa:rif wi kull in-na:s ʕarfa inn <bold>ha:ðihi</bold> layla wa <bold>ha:ðihi</bold> ẓuru:f hiya ẓuru:f daqi:qa giddan/ʕayzi:n niʕraf e:h illi biyihṣal guwwa. ḥadd ġayyu:r ʕala maṣr/ ḥadd ġayyur ʕala l-balad/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  <bold>A</bold>:  Please come and visit us on Nile TV. You know and everyone knows that <bold>this</bold> night and <bold>these</bold> circumstances are very serious. We need to know what happens inside Tahrir Square. We need to hear from you, from someone who was inside the square, someone who cares about Egypt, someone who cares about this country.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The SA demonstratives are used to index the seriousness of the situation that Egypt is in (‘this night’ and ‘these conditions’). The announcer’s marked choice of pronouncing <italic>daqi:qa</italic> with the SA ‘q’ rather than the ECA glottal stop is also worth mentioning and again emphasizes the concern of the announcer for Egypt in such difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>The conversation between Tamer and the announcer concludes in a dramatic fashion when Tamer says tearfully, ‘it is difficult for me to come’, and then the line is cut. Playing on the emotions of Egyptians was part of the media war; language and identity were the two main weapons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0957926511431514">
<title>Actress Shuweeb’s postulations of the ‘fake’ identity of the protestors in Tahrir</title>
<p>An even more linguistically interesting claim was made by Egyptian actress Afaf Shuweeb in the current affairs talk show <italic>Life Today</italic>. The protests were discussed and the identity of the protestors was evaluated. On 5 February 2011, Afaf Shuweeb (a mother figure in the Egyptian media, due to a recent performance in the role of a mother) also casts doubt on the identity of the protestors in Tahrir Square. When asked by the announcer to say what she thinks of the people in Tahrir, Shuweeb also claims that the people in Tahrir are not ‘Egyptians’. However, she uses a conspiracy-driven theory and a supposedly more subtle argument. Note the example below:</p>
<list id="list8-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(6)</bold> <bold>Shuweeb</bold>: ṭabb dilwaʔti ig-gizi:ra ṭu:l in-naha:r bitʔu:l/fi wa:ḥid gabu:h ma:sik farx abyaḍ/ʔiddulu ʔalam filumastar wi ʔalu:lu ʔiktib no muba:rak/landan bitḥa:wil tidarrab wila:d ʕala il-lahga il-maṣriyya wi tgibhum kulluhum lo:n baʃritna/miʃ illi huwwa il-lo:n il-ʔabyad bitaʕhum/bitgibhum min kulli ginsiya:t/bitdarabbhum ʔizza:y yirkabu dabba:ba/wi ʔizza:y yiʃi:lu: il-ʕaskari: il-maṣri: min id-dabba:ba wi yirkabha huwwa/ʕaʃa:n fi ḥarb qa:dima/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  <bold>S</bold>:     ‘okay now Aljazira channel claims all day that … they brought someone with a white sheet of paper and they gave him a crayon and asked him to write on the sheet of paper ‘no Mubarak’. London tries to train young men on the Egyptian dialect and they choose them all with our skin colour. They are all not white like them. They are from all nationalities. London trains them on how to drive tanks and how to take out the Egyptian soldier from the tank and drive it, because there is a war coming.’</p></list-item></list>
<p>Afaf Shuweeb’s proposition is that the people in Tahrir are simply not Egyptians but people who look and speak like Egyptians. The fact that they have been trained in London brings to mind the British colonization struggle. In addition, the fact that they have been trained in London to master ECA rather than SA does not only bring to mind the colonizers’ manipulation, but also the colonizers’ language policy and ideology. The British occupation of Egypt (1882–1952) encouraged and promoted colloquial Egyptian Arabic; the first Egyptian Arabic grammar was published in 1901 by a British linguist, Wise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926511431514">Bassiouney, 2009</xref>). In the minds of most Egyptians and perhaps many Arabs, when foreigners encourage colloquial Arabic, it is a disintegrating device to divide the Arab world and, more importantly, to erase the national Arab identity. It is no coincidence that these foreigners are trained in Egyptian Arabic. This implies more than the fact that they are foreigners: they are foreigners that are there to colonize, divide and rule.</p>
<p>Afaf Shuweeb uses ethnicity as it is reflected in skin colour, and language as it is reflected in the colloquial language of the protestors as two independent but related factors. She differentiates between ‘our’ colour and ‘their’ colour, ‘our’ language and ‘their’ language. According to her, what London attempts to do is trick Egyptians into believing that there are ‘other Egyptians’ protesting and taking actions against the government. London manages to trick Egyptians by ensuring that these foreigners have the same identity verification and classification variables as Egyptians: they are dark and they speak ECA.</p>
<p>Afaf positions herself as all-knowing. She employs linguistic resources to clarify her stance, such as the ECA aspectual marker b-prefix in verbs such as <italic>bith.a:wil</italic> (‘tries to’). This indicates that this process is still occurring and we must try to stop it. By referring to her skin colour as different from the British white colour, she emphasizes the fact that she is Egyptian. She then finally ends with the declarative proposition ‘there is a war coming’, again positioning herself as the expert, real Egyptian. Afaf Shuweeb switches to English only once when she says ‘no Mubarak’. This is indeed significant. The sentence that is written on the flyer by this anonymous person who was driven to write it by ‘someone with bad intentions’ is written in English. This implies that whoever is against Mubarak works with foreign powers and may either be a non-Egyptian or a traitor. The only opposition to Mubarak is referred to in English, with all its indexes discussed above and also in Tamer’s example, rather than Arabic. She then uses the salient SA phonological feature ‘q’ in her last proposition <italic>ʕaʃa:n fi h.arb qa:dima</italic> (‘because there is a war coming’), again making SA a marked choice that indexes seriousness and knowledge. If there is a war coming this is really serious, but she seems to be the one with all this knowledge.</p>
<p>What she has in common with Tamer is the use of code-switching to English, the casting of doubt on the core identity of the protestors and, more importantly, the clear knowledge of what really takes place as opposed to what may seem to take place.</p>

<title>The revolutionaries fight back: Laying claims to SA authoritative indexes</title>
<p>During the Egyptian revolution, the famous Abu Dhabi competition, <italic>The Prince of Poets</italic> (a programme that selects the best Arabic poet of the year who is then awarded a million dollars), was still being broadcast on air. The competition was fierce, especially between an Egyptian poet, Jugh, and a Yemeni one. Jugh could not attend one of the episodes, due to the events in Egypt at the time (end of January 2011). However, he appeared unexpectedly in the penultimate episode, on 8 February, days before Mubarak abdicated. He said, in a southern Egyptian dialect of colloquial Egyptian Arabic, that he realizes he only has two minutes but he first wants to observe a moment of silence for the martyrs of the revolution. Then he started reciting a poem in SA; the poem is a clear reply to accusations and attacks on the identity of the people in Tahrir. While Jugh is a poet who uses both ECA and SA in his poetry, sometimes code-switching between both in the same poem, he chose to authenticate the identity of the Egyptians in Tahrir Square in SA. By using SA, he re-claims possession of ‘the real Egyptian’. Through his code choice and language content, he presents himself as the real Egyptian, declaring forcefully: ‘I have now spoken. My language is not English, and it is not even ECA. It is the authoritative SA, with all its powerful indexes.’</p>
<p>No sooner did Jugh recite the poem, than it was distributed on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and thousands of blogs; it was viewed on YouTube more than one million times. The poem started to act as a counter-attack by the pro-democracy protestors and sympathizers. One day after Mubarak’s abdication, the same recording of the poem was broadcast with images from the revolution on Nile TV, ironically the same channel that several days earlier had broadcast the famous call by Tamer discussed above. The sudden change of attitude of the Egyptian media needs a book by itself. However, the message and language form of the poem ‘A Bird’s Eye View from Tahrir Square’ provides an important example of how language can be used to re-claim an identity through a stance-taking act by using structural and discourse resources, including intertextuality and dialogicality.</p>

<list-item><p>  The crowd of the cowardly is now silent and the masses of those who love you have said their word.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The poem starts with the imperative: ‘Hide all your old poems’. The verb ‘hide’ is in the first-person singular. Verbs used throughout this poem to refer to Egyptians are verbs of action. The first two imperative verbs are ‘hide’ and ‘write’. Unlike Tamer, the poet positions himself as the active powerful Egyptian that can and will change Egypt. Negation is used in the first declarative statement of the poem:</p>
<list id="list10-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(8)</bold> There is no silence after today that will impose its fear.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The statement presupposes that before today, Egyptians were silent and thus cowardly and passive. This is no more. After this declarative statement, another imperative verb (‘write’) is repeated again, denoting the new state of ‘action’ that Egyptians are in.</p>
<p>The poet orders himself to write.</p>
<p>The poet uses intertextuality when he says ‘greetings from the river Nile’. This phrase is in fact taken from a poem by Poet Laureate Ahmed Shawky, <italic>Ghandi 1931</italic>, in which Shawky was welcoming Ghandi to Egypt as a peaceful freedom fighter who shared with Egyptians the same aspirations and demands. Ghandi passed by Egypt on his way to India in 1931. Shawky says:</p>
<list id="list11-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(9)</bold> Sala:ma n-ni:li ya ġandi:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  Wa ha:ða z-zahru min ʕindi:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  Greetings from the river Nile to you Ghandi</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  And these flowers are from me to you.</p></list-item></list>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957926511431514">Damari (2010</xref>: 612), intertextuality is the ‘engagement of a current speaker’ with ‘a prior spoken or written text, the prior text exists at some temporal distance from the current interaction’. Intertextuality can be used in constructing local identities and family ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957926511431514">Damari, 2010</xref>: 612; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957926511431514">Hamilton, 1996</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957926511431514">Tannen, 2007</xref> [1989]).</p>
<p>By referring to Shawky, one of the most powerful poets of his time, and the poem that deals specifically with Ghandi, Egypt and the struggle for independence and freedom, the poet relates Egypt’s present to its past. He also explains indirectly that the struggle for freedom is not a betrayal of stability but a continuous process. By referring to Shawky and quoting from him, he is also adding legitimacy and importance to his message. It is as if he says: ‘my poetry before that event is not good enough. I have to write poetry that is as grand as the event but I first have to borrow from a grand poet who also witnessed a great struggle for freedom.’</p>
<p>The poet addresses himself and then later addresses Egypt, as usual with a female metaphor, since Egypt is also feminine in Arabic. The shift from the poet addressing himself and later describing himself as one of the people in Tahrir and then addressing Egypt as a woman with beautiful eyes shows the intimate relation he has with Egypt. He is definitely not a foreigner who speaks English, nor a foreigner who is trained in colloquial Arabic. He is an Egyptian who addresses his beloved country in perfect SA, though in intimate and direct statements. He starts explaining what he and the people in Tahrir used to do. It was hard for him to spend the freezing night at the square, but knowing that Egypt was happy made him do it. Use of aspect in this part is important. The poet uses the auxiliary verb <italic>kunna</italic> followed by a verb in the imperfect to denote continuity in the past:</p>
<list id="list12-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(10)</bold> kunna nudaffiʔ baʕḍana fi: baʕḍina wa nara:ki tabtasimi:n nansa: bardaha:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  We used to warm ourselves with each other and when we see you smile, we forgot our coldness.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Example 10 presupposes that Egypt, as a woman, in fact approves of his decision to protest and strike in Tahrir. When he is fed up or angry, Egypt shows its smiling, encouraging face, endorses his decision and he is then able to endure the challenging situation.</p>
<p>The female metaphor is emphasized with facial details such as smiles and eyes. Yet Egypt is also a chaste woman who is sacred enough for the protestors to feel ashamed of displaying their anger in front of her. Although the metaphor of Egypt as a woman is an old one, employing it here to show intimacy, respect and, more importantly, love towards Egypt is essential as a device to refute arguments that people who protest ‘do not love Egypt’.</p>
<p>He then orders Egypt not to listen to the cowardly ones by saying:</p>
<list id="list13-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(11)</bold> la: tatruki:him yuxbiru:ki bi-ʔannani/ mutamarridun xa:na l-ʔama:nati ʔaw saha:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  La: tatruki:him yuxbiru:ki bi-ʔannani/ ʔaṣbaḥtu ʃayʔan ta:fihan wa muwajjaha:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  Do not let them tell you that I am a rebel who betrayed you or forgot you.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  Do not let them tell you that I have become something trivial and controlled by foreigners.</p></list-item></list>
<p>This imperative statement in which the poet forbids the woman Egypt from listening to ‘them’ reflects again his intimate, direct relationship to Egypt and also situates him and Egypt on one side, and ‘them’ who accuse him of treason on the other. He clearly aligns himself with Egypt and its ‘real sons’ and disaligns himself from those who accuse the people of Tahrir of treason, and of being without character or aim. The real Egyptians are he and others in the square.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Jugh had produced an earlier poem, <italic>goh.a:</italic> (‘Goha’) (30 July 2010), in which he also addresses Egypt angrily and yet lovingly. The poem is not in SA but is a mixture of SA, ECA and his own southern colloquial dialect. In fact, his own southern dialect prevails in the poem. Though both poems are similar in the sense that both address Egypt as a woman that they care about, his poem before the revolution was an angry, frustrated cry from an Egyptian to Egypt represented as a woman who seems to be either indifferent or forced to act in a cruel manner. The example translated below is from this poem and is in pure ECA:</p>
<list id="list14-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(12)</bold> I have fertilized your land with gold and you feed me dung.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  You have blindly betrayed me for their sake.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  I wonder whether you are treacherous or like me oppressed by them?</p></list-item></list>
<p>The fact that he chooses to address Egypt in pure SA in the poem analysed in this section makes his choice a marked choice with a specific aim which is, as was said earlier, to lay claim to all the authoritative and credible indexes of SA.</p>
<p>Dialogicality is also used in this poem. According to Du Bois, dialogicality ‘makes its presence felt to the extent that a stance-taker’s words derive from and further engage with the words of those who have spoken before – whether immediately within the current exchange of stance utterances, or more remotely along the horizons of language and prior text as projected by the community of discourse’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957926511431514">2007</xref>: 139). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957926511431514">Lempert (2009)</xref>, in a study of US presidential candidate John Kerry’s stance-taking during a 2004 debate, shows how Kerry took stances and positioned himself as a person of conviction, and indirectly addressed attackers who accused him of ‘flip-flopping’. This is exactly what the poet does in this poem. It is clear that he is addressing pro-government attackers who accused the people of Tahrir of being agents of foreign countries or even of not being Egyptians in the first place. The poem is an attempt at reclaiming his identity as an Egyptian after this identity was attacked and distorted by others. This act of stance-taking on the poet’s part would not have been as effective if it were not expressed using SA with all its indexes. It is noteworthy, however, that this poem may have directly addressed the accusations of Tamer and Afaf Shuweeb discussed above. The poem repeats the verb <italic>yiwaggih</italic> (‘control’ or ‘drive’) used by Tamer in the example above, in the form of a participle <italic>muwaggaha</italic> (‘foreign controlled’):</p>
<p>The poet’s reply is:</p>
<list id="list15-0957926511431514" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>(13)</bold> la: tatruki:him yuxbiru:ki bi-ʔannani/ʔaṣbaḥtu ʃayʔan ta:fihan wa muwajjaha:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>  Do not let them tell you that I have become something trivial and controlled by foreigners.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Note again that Shuweeb in example 6 claims that the foreigners in Tahrir Square are fluent in Egyptian Arabic and have been trained in London. She clearly attempts to recall to the minds of average Egyptians the British occupation of Egypt and the linguistic struggle that took place between the British calls for the use of ECA and the Egyptian intellectuals’ insistence on preserving SA as the language of the Quran and of the Arab identity more generally. By reciting all of his poem in SA, the poet refutes Shuweeb’s argument directly and re-claims SA as the language of the revolutionaries rather than of the cowardly. By employing intertextuality with reference to the poem by Shawky in which he welcomes Ghandi and his struggle against the British, the poet is again replying directly to the accusations of Shuweeb. The struggle of Egyptians in Tahrir is in fact similar to their past struggle against the British. Rather than working with foreigners, these Egyptians are again struggling for freedom like they did at the beginning of the 20th century, and as the Indians did through Ghandi. They also recall Ghandi’s struggle as a peaceful one.</p>
<p>There are two dominant themes in this poem: the metaphor of Egypt as a woman who is cherished, and the recurrent theme of speaking versus silence. Silence is first mentioned with a negative construction.</p>
<p>‘No silence after today.’ Rather than say ‘I will not be silent after today’, using a negative marker and a verb, the poet uses nominalization, a negative marker ‘La’ followed by a noun, to indicate the definiteness of this new stance of never keeping quiet after today. Silence is again mentioned in the last line of the poem in which the now-silent cowards are juxtaposed with the lovers of Egypt who spoke up.</p>
<p>The verb <italic>ṣamatat</italic> (‘to stop speaking’, ‘keep silent’), and the verb <italic>qa:lat</italic> (‘to speak’) are both in the perfect form, the action is complete and the future is decided. The stance of them and us is also clear. They kept silent. We, those who loved you, spoke up: <italic>Qa:lat qawlaha</italic> (‘said their word’). <italic>Qawlaha</italic> refers to deeds as well as words. They have acted, not merely spoken up. Speaking is associated here with action. Note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957926511431514">Suleiman (2012</xref>: 349) argues that in the Arabic grammatical tradition, speaking is also action. So literally, by speaking up, Egyptians have already taken action. Again, he positions himself as the active lover who takes a stance. This stance is reflected in what he says, his language form and also his actions. While he spent the night in the cold recalling the face of beautiful Egypt, the cowardly group ran out of words.</p>
<p>Rather than portray himself as innocent of the crimes the media accuses him of, the protestor/poet uses the powerful, authoritative indexes of SA to position himself as the authentic, reliable and brave Egyptian. SA again has moral values associated with it. When the protestors are denied their identity, they fight back. The poet pleads with Egypt to believe that he has lost neither his character nor his identity. He is not, however, helpless. He has spoken up and his words, unlike in his other poems, are in SA.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article aims at providing a fresh look at the relationship between language and identity in a diglossic community during a politically challenging time, and that between stance-taking as a process and identity construction as a directly related process. Throughout this article, language was regarded as a social process as well as a social practice. These functions of language could not be separated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957926511431514">Heller, 2007</xref>). Linguistic resources acquire indexes by being associated with specific domains. Markedness theory is dependent on speakers’ norms and expectations, which are the product of linguistic practices. That is, indexicality and markedness are an integral part of language as a social practice. Furthermore, language ideology was called upon in the three examples discussed. In the first example, the speaker uses and refers to English to cast doubt on the identity of protestors. The speaker appeals to the indexes of English and to language ideologies associated with English as the language of the British colonizers. In the second example, the Egyptian actress uses the attitude and ideology surrounding foreigners who learn colloquial Arabic and promote it, rather than standard Arabic, to again cast doubt on the identity of the protestors. According to her, they are foreigners who came to conquer, and their language variety, ECA, is the one promoted by the British Empire in the past. Note that, again according to her, they are trained by the British.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957926511431514">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the third example, the poet, obviously aware of the state of the media argument, chooses to position himself as the ‘real Egyptian’, by using SA with its powerful, authoritative and nationalistic indexes. To reiterate, with no knowledge of the linguistic resources available for Egyptians and the indexes of SA, ECA and English, one would miss the significance of code choice and direct reference to ‘language’ used by all three speakers.</p>
<p>In terms of indexicality, while ECA has been associated with intimacy, informality and affection, the poem shows that when a poet wants to combine indexes of SA and ECA, then SA will dominate by default. When trying to express his intense love for Egypt as well as his authoritative powerful stance, the poet uses SA rather than ECA. SA domains are for him more pressing and, by prioritizing his indexes, SA indexes win over ECA ones. The same poet, as was said before, addressed Egypt in ECA and in a southern Sidi dialect in several other poems before the revolution. Sometimes he even addresses Egypt angrily and with frustration, and when he does so, he still uses ECA rather than SA. Indexes themselves are hierarchical and more complex than one thinks. This needs further research and is beyond the scope of this work. The authoritative and powerful indexes of SA are dominant in Egypt and were later used by the higher council of armed forces to address Egyptians on their Facebook pages.</p>
<p>In addition, in the first two examples language was construed as an independent variable, a passport photo so to speak. Whoever speaks Arabic is Egyptian, and whoever does not is not Egyptian. There are some who may of course attempt to pass as Egyptians by speaking colloquial Egyptian Arabic. This linguistic verification technique is as old as language itself. In 1312 in Poland, there was a supposed German-led revolt of Cracow against Lokietek. Although the revolt was not successful and was put down, anti-German sentiments developed. The instigators were then tried and their guilt was determined by whether or not they could correctly pronounce such Polish words as <italic>soczewica</italic> (‘lentil’), <italic>kolo</italic> (‘wheel’) and <italic>mlyn</italic> (‘mill’). Those who mispronounced any of these words were judged to be either German or Czech and deemed guilty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957926511431514">Grosby, 2005</xref>: 70). Language, in this example, is also employed as a classification and verification category to cast an identity on individuals or, conversely, to rob them of one.</p>
<p>This study can contribute to our understating of stance-taking linguistic processes as a means of identity construction. According to Du Bois’ stance triangle, positioning oneself is an important angle in stance-taking. The study argues that code-switching can be a marked choice that enables people to position themselves within a wider context and community. SA, ECA and English have different indexes and all these indexes can and are employed in public discourse, not only to appeal to an audience but also to position and situate oneself in relation to one’s country, political affiliations and identity in more general terms, and align or disalign with a specific group. While language form plays a pivotal role in this article, other linguistic resources have also been employed, including both structural and discourse ones such as mood, tense and aspect, pronouns, negation, deixes, metaphor, presupposition, dialogicality and intertextuality. The last two resources, dialogicality and intertextuality, do not just depend on previous shared assumptions and knowledge, but are also dependent on shared ideologies and attitudes that may be related directly to language, as was clear in the third example discussed.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning, however, that discussion of language and manipulation of linguistic devices in these examples does not aim to reflect the way Egyptians communicate or the way Egyptians interacted in Tahrir Square, but rather the way language was employed in public media discourse. There is no implication that people in Tahrir spoke SA or English or ECA. Their images have all been manipulated by people in Tahrir Square and by media makers.</p>
