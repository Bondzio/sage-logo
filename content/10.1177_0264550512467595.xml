<title>Organizations supporting ex-offenders in the community</title>
<p>Works for Freedom is a website highlighting organizations that provide support in different ways to, for example, serving prisoners and those recently released from prison, people with alcohol and drug addictions, the homeless and the marginalized. Organizations included on the website are working towards trying to keep people out of the criminal justice system by addressing needs rather than viewing them as potential offenders. Maintaining the view that rather than ‘prison works’, freedom works. As well as including projects, there is also a ‘Have your say’ section where, for example, an academic, an ex-probation officer, an ex-prisoner and a practitioner are amongst those who share their views and experiences in 500 words. Works for Freedom is a website that is expanding with new visitors each day to share information and to see what other organizations share the same mission, aims and values. The website can be accessed at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.worksforfreedom.org">www.worksforfreedom.org</ext-link></p>

<title>Disclosing previous convictions</title>
<p>The Criminal Record Disclosure Calculator (‘the calculator’) is a web tool that can be used to find out when a criminal record becomes spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (ROA). The need to interpret complex legislation means that many people with a criminal record do not benefit from their legal rights under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, making it harder for them to reintegrate into society. UNLOCK’s new web tool makes it simple to calculate when convictions become ‘spent’ and no longer need to be disclosed to employers and insurers, removing the discrimination which acts as a barrier to successful reintegration. The calculator meets the needs of both individuals and organizations working with people with criminal records. This calculator established when criminal convictions become ‘spent’ under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. The information collected by this tool is used to provide onscreen results. You also have the option to receive the results by email. Any information provided is not shared with a third party or used by UNLOCK for marketing purposes. Corporate accounts for organizations and professionals who wish to use the Disclosure Calculator can also be set up. For more information on the calculator visit: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.disclosurecalculator.org.uk">www.disclosurecalculator.org.uk</ext-link></p>
