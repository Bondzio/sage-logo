<abstract>
<p>The authors of the <italic>Childhood Autism Rating Scale</italic> (CARS) state in the manual that the best cutoff score for distinguishing low functioning autism (LFA) from intellectual disability is 30 for children and 28 for adolescents and adults. This study determined that a cutoff score of 25.5 was most accurate in differentiating between high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome (HFA; <italic>n</italic> = 197) and ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 74) in a sample of 1- to 16-year-olds with IQs of 80 or higher. Classification accuracy was 96% using clinician scores and 72% using parent scores. Children with LFA (<italic>n</italic> = 193) had significantly higher clinician and parent scores than children with HFA, and scores were negatively correlated with IQ. None of the typical children (<italic>n</italic> = 64) earned parent scores greater than 21.</p>

<body>
<p>The <italic>Childhood Autism Rating Scale</italic> (CARS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler, Reichler, &amp; Renner, 1986</xref>) has strong psychometric support for identifying children with low functioning autism (LFA), and it compares favorably with other autism instruments in studies of children with autism, most of whom also have intellectual disability. In a study of toddlers with autism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088357611406902">Ventola et al. (2006)</xref> found high diagnostic agreement among the CARS, <italic>Autism Diagnostic Observation System–Generic</italic>, and clinical judgment but lower agreement for the <italic>Autism Diagnostic Inventory–Revised</italic>. The CARS was more accurate in identifying children with autism than the <italic>Autism Behavior Checklist</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357611406902">Eaves &amp; Milner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088357611406902">Rellini, Tortolani, Trillo, Carbone, &amp; Montecchi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357611406902">Sevin, Matson, Coe, Fee, &amp; Sevin, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>As stated in the CARS manual, the purpose of the CARS is “to identify children with autism and to distinguish them from developmentally handicapped children without autism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al., 1986</xref>, p. 1). The CARS consists of 15 items rated on a 7-point scale from <italic>normal</italic> to <italic>severely abnormal</italic>. The CARS is designed to be rated by a variety of professionals (e.g., psychologists, physicians, teachers, and therapists) who are trained on the use of the CARS and base their ratings on observations during school and psychological testing, parent report, and relevant medical records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al., 1986</xref>). The CARS standardization sample consisted of 1,606 children with autism. Most (71%) had IQs less than 70, 17% had IQs from 70 through 84, and 13% had IQs of 85 or greater. According to the authors, the CARS is appropriate for children of all ages, including preschoolers. The possible range of scores on the CARS is 15 to 60, and scores of 30 or higher are in the autism range for children. This cutoff score was determined by comparing 1,520 CARS scores with corresponding expert clinical diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al., 1986</xref>, p. 14). Overall percentage agreement between the CARS and clinical diagnoses was 87% using a CARS cutoff of 30. Mean interrater reliability between two trained raters was .71 for the individual CARS items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers independently support the validity of the CARS. In studies of children with clinical diagnoses of autism 2 to 22 years of age, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357611406902">Eaves and Milner (1993)</xref> identified 98% with autism using the CARS and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357611406902">Sevin et al. (1991)</xref> identified 92%. In samples of children with autism and other disorders, agreement between the CARS and diagnoses from the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088357611406902">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) was 100% in one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088357611406902">Rellini et al., 2004</xref>) and 88% in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357611406902">Perry, Condillac, Freeman, Dunn-Geier, &amp; Belair, 2005</xref>). Diagnostic agreement was 86% between the CARS and the <italic>Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised</italic> in a study of individuals 1 to 32 years with suspected autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357611406902">Pilowsky, Yirmiya, Shulman, &amp; Dover, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088357611406902">Teal and Wiebe (1986)</xref> demonstrated that CARS scores significantly differentiated children with autism from children with intellectual disability and no autism. We found that classification accuracy was 98% for CARS clinician scores and 93% for CARS parent scores in a sample of children with clinical diagnoses of LFA versus attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2009</xref>). Diagnostic agreement was 98% between clinician scores on the CARS and the <italic>Checklist for Autism Spectrum Disorder</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611406902">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 1999</xref>). Diagnostic accuracy using CARS parent scores also was high (93%). However, we found that CARS validity data for children with high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome (HFA) were not as positive, and 25% of these children scored below the CARS autism cutoff of 30.</p>
<p>CARS scores are significantly negatively correlated with IQ and mental age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357611406902">Perry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357611406902">Pilowsky et al., 1998</xref>). This is probably because the CARS has some developmental items (e.g., level of intelligence, language skills, and imitation ability), so that children with LFA tend to earn higher scores than children with HFA. CARS scores also tend to decrease with age, and the CARS manual recommends a cutoff score of 28 for adolescents and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al., 1986</xref>). In a study of individuals with both autism and intellectual disability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088357611406902">Garfin, McCallon, and Cox (1988)</xref> showed that all children had CARS scores of 30 or greater, whereas some of the adolescents and young adults had scores less than 30.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to determine if the CARS autism cutoff should be lowered for children with HFA (as it has been for adolescents and adults), so that the CARS can identify children with HFA as effectively as it identifies children with LFA. In this study, we analyze CARS scores for children with autism, ADHD, and typical development. We selected ADHD as a comparison group because ADHD is a common childhood disorder that, together with autism, composes a large portion of referrals for child diagnostic evaluations. Children with ADHD and autism have many overlapping features, including inattention, overactivity, mood and behavior problems, early language delay, and difficulty with social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088357611406902">de Boo &amp; Prins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611406902">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088357611406902">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088357611406902">Miniscalco, Hagberg, Kadesjo, Westerlund, &amp; Gillberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088357611406902">Miniscalco, Nygren, Hagberg, Kadesjo, &amp; Gillberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088357611406902">Van der Oord et al., 2005</xref>). These shared symptoms complicate a differential diagnosis. Therefore, identifying a CARS cutoff score that accurately differentiates between children with HFA and ADHD is of clinical value. The goals of our study are to (a) determine the CARS cutoff score that differentiates best between children with HFA and children with ADHD, (b) determine if children with LFA earn significantly higher CARS scores than children with HFA, thus justifying a lower cutoff score for HFA, and (c) determine if a lower CARS cutoff for HFA results in misclassification of typical children as having autism.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Our sample comprises 528 children 1 to 16 years of age, including 193 children with diagnoses of autism and full-scale IQs less than 80 (LFA), 197 children with diagnoses of autism or Asperger syndrome and full-scale IQs of 80 or greater (HFA), 74 children with ADHD combined or inattentive type and an IQ of 80 or above, and 64 typical children. Demographic data for the sample are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088357611406902">Table 1</xref>. The most common tests administered to estimate overall IQ were the <italic>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition</italic> (WISC-IV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088357611406902">Wechsler, 2003</xref>), <italic>Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence–Third Edition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088357611406902">Wechsler, 2002</xref>), and <italic>Bayley Scales of Infant Development Mental Scale–Second Edition</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088357611406902">Bayley, 1993</xref>). An IQ cut point of 80 for differentiating HFA and LFA was chosen for several reasons. In the WISC-IV, normal to above normal intelligence is defined as an IQ of 80 or greater, and children with an IQ less than 80 qualify for intellectual disability special education services as specified by the department of education where our study was conducted. Furthermore, 80 is the cutoff used in many previous research studies to distinguish between LFA and HFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088357611406902">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088357611406902">2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088357611406902">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088357611406902">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088357611406902">Mayes, Calhoun, Murray, Ahuja, &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Typical children, who did not have an identified diagnosis of autism or other neuropsychiatric disorder according to parent report, were recruited from colleagues and day care centers. Children with autism or ADHD were patients evaluated in our diagnostic clinics by licensed PhD psychologists, board-certified child psychiatrists, or a board-certified developmental pediatrician using <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria. Components of the diagnostic evaluation included a structured interview with the parent focusing on early history and current symptoms; behavior and autism rating scales completed by parents, teachers, and child care providers; observations of the child during testing; and a review of early intervention, school, and medical records.</p>
<p>In addition to a clinical diagnosis of autism, all children with autism had a score in the autistic range on the <italic>Checklist for Autism Spectrum Disorder</italic> (CASD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611406902">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2009</xref>). The CASD consists of 30 items scored as present (either currently or in the past) or absent by the clinician based on a semistructured interview with the parent, information from the child’s teacher or child care provider, observations of the child, and other available records. The CASD can be administered and scored in 15 minutes. The CASD is based on the belief that autism is a single spectrum disorder, consistent with what is proposed by the <italic>DSM-V</italic> Work Group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dsm5.org">www.dsm5.org</ext-link>). The CASD is normed on more than 800 children with autism 1 to 17 years of age with IQs of 9 to 146. All children in the normative study had a total CASD score at or above the autism cutoff of 15, which is the cutoff for both HFA and LFA. The CASD has strong validity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088357611406902">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357611406902">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357611406902">Mayes, Calhoun, &amp; Crites, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088357611406902">Tryon, Mayes, Rhodes, &amp; Waldo, 2006</xref>). These researchers demonstrate that the CASD differentiates children with autism from children with ADHD (99.5% accuracy) and from typical children (100% accuracy), is equally effective in identifying children at both ends of the autism spectrum, has high diagnostic agreement with other autism instruments (98% with the CARS for LFA and 94% with the <italic>Gilliam Asperger Syndrome Scale</italic> for HFA), has excellent congruence with <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-based clinical diagnoses, and has good clinician–parent agreement (90%). In a recent study, the authors showed that diagnostic agreement between the <italic>Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised</italic> and the CASD completed independently by parents was 93.1% (cite).</p>
<p>Of the children with LFA, HFA, and ADHD in our study, 62% had an independent confirmatory diagnosis (i.e., a separate diagnosis apart from the research team’s clinical diagnosis).

<p>We did not attempt to differentiate between HFA and Asperger syndrome in our study because of the consensus that HFA and Asperger syndrome are on the same continuum. Researchers show that most, if not all, children with a clinical diagnosis of Asperger syndrome actually meet <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357611406902">Eisenmajer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088357611406902">Howlin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357611406902">Manjiviona &amp; Prior, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1088357611406902">Miller &amp; Ozonoff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088357611406902">Szatmari, Archer, Fisman, Streiner, &amp; Wilson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1088357611406902">Tryon et al., 2006</xref>). This is because children with an Asperger syndrome diagnosis meet <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for communication impairment (impaired ability to initiate and sustain a conversation or stereotyped, repetitive, or idiosyncratic language), which excludes them from a <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2001</xref>).

Also, diagnostic agreement for autism spectrum disorder is excellent, whereas agreement for the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> pervasive developmental disorder subtypes is far lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088357611406902">Mahoney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088357611406902">Stone et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088357611406902">Volkmar et al., 1994</xref>). Most clinicians and researchers now concur that autism is a spectrum disorder and that Asperger syndrome is not a separate or distinct disorder but is at the high functioning or mild end of the autism continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088357611406902">Eisenmajer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088357611406902">Frith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088357611406902">Macintosh &amp; Dissanayake, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088357611406902">Manjiviona &amp; Prior, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088357611406902">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2003c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088357611406902">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088357611406902">Miller &amp; Ozonoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088357611406902">Myhr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088357611406902">Ozonoff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088357611406902">Prior et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088357611406902">Schopler, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088357611406902">1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088357611406902">Wing (1998)</xref>, who introduced and defined the term <italic>Asperger syndrome</italic>, contends that Asperger syndrome and HFA are the same, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088357611406902">Hans Asperger (1944/1991)</xref> used the term <italic>autism</italic> (not <italic>Asperger syndrome</italic>) to describe his patients.

<title>Instruments and Procedure</title>
<p>For children with HFA, LFA, or ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 464), the CARS was completed by clinicians who had extensive experience and expertise with autism and ADHD and were familiar with the CARS, including two licensed PhD psychologists, three board-certified child psychiatrists, one board-certified developmental pediatrician, and one certified school psychologist working at a school for children with autism. A subset of parents of these children and the parents of typical children (<italic>n</italic> = 232) independently completed the CARS for their children. For our study, clinicians and parents were simply asked to complete the CARS without having watched the CARS training DVD and without instructions beyond those included on the instrument itself (as is often the case in clinical practice). Researchers have found good validity and reliability when the CARS is completed in this manner by clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088357611406902">Ozonoff, Goodlin-Jones, &amp; Solomon, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For comparative purposes, clinicians also completed the 32-item <italic>Gilliam Asperger’s Disorder Scale</italic> (GADS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088357611406902">Gilliam, 2001</xref>) and the CASD.

<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>The most accurate cutoff score for differentiating between children with HFA and ADHD was determined by calculating the cutoff that maximized overall classification accuracy and yielded approximately equivalent sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the number of children with autism scoring in the autistic range divided by the total number of children with autism, and specificity is number of children without autism scoring in the nonautistic range divided by the total number of children without autism. Positive predictive power (number of children with autism scoring in the autistic range divided by the total number of children scoring in the autistic range) and negative predictive power (number of children without autism scoring in the nonautistic range divided by the total number of children scoring in the nonautistic range) also were calculated to assess the accuracy of the modified CARS cutoff score in identifying children with and without clinical diagnoses of autism. Diagnostic agreement and accuracy percentages were calculated for the CARS (using the modified cutoff score), the GADS, and the CASD. Pearson correlation coefficients and the effect size statistic <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> (explained variance) were used to indicate the degree of relationship between CARS scores and IQ. The significance of differences in variable frequencies between groups was calculated using chi-square. ANOVA, ANCOVA (covarying differences between groups in age, gender, and parent occupation), post hoc Bonferroni <italic>t</italic> tests, independent <italic>t</italic> tests, and Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> effect size were calculated to determine the statistical and clinical significance of differences between diagnostic groups.</p>

<title>Classification Accuracy of CARS Cutoff Scores</title>
<p>Using CARS clinician scores, only 3% of children in the LFA group scored below the recommended CARS cutoff of 30, in contrast to 25% of the children with HFA. Using CARS parent scores, 10% of the children with LFA scored less than 30, whereas 54% of the children with HFA earned scores less than 30. Comparing children with HFA and ADHD, the clinician cutoff score that maximized overall classification accuracy and equalized sensitivity and specificity was 25.5. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1088357611406902">Table 3</xref>, 95% of the children with HFA earned scores of 25.5 or greater (sensitivity 95%), whereas only 3% of the children with ADHD did (specificity 97%), yielding 96% overall classification accuracy. Using the traditional CARS cutoff score of 30, sensitivity was 75%, specificity was 100%, and overall classification accuracy was 82%. Interestingly, the most accurate cutoff using parent scores also was 25.5. However, overall classification accuracy was higher for clinician scores (96%) than for parent scores (72%). Using a cutoff score of 25.5, none of the typical children were misclassified as having autism by their parents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on data reported in the CARS manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al., 1986</xref>), 30 is the best cutoff score for differentiating children with LFA and intellectual disability. In the CARS manual, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al. (1986)</xref> recommend a cutoff score of 28 for adolescents and adults with LFA because CARS scores decrease somewhat with age. We and other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088357611406902">Perry et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088357611406902">Pilowsky et al., 1998</xref>) have shown that CARS scores decrease with increasing mental age and IQ. Therefore, a lower cutoff score may be more accurate in identifying children with HFA than the cutoff of 30. We found that the most accurate CARS cutoff score for distinguishing between children with HFA and ADHD was 25.5. This was true for both clinician and parent scores. Overall classification accuracy was 96% using clinician scores and 72% using parent scores. This level of accuracy is similar to the 87% reported in the CARS manual for children with LFA versus intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088357611406902">Schopler et al., 1986</xref>). In other studies of children with LFA, researchers reveal high classification accuracy percentages as well, including 98% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088357611406902">Eaves &amp; Milner, 1993</xref>), 92% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088357611406902">Sevin et al., 1991</xref>), and 98% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088357611406902">Mayes et al., 2009</xref>). The 96% classification accuracy of clinician scores obtained in our study compares positively with the accuracy percentages for LFA, suggesting that the CARS is clinically useful for children with HFA as well as LFA.</p>
<p>We found somewhat lower parent than clinician CARS scores for children with LFA and HFA and lower classification accuracy for parent scores (72%) than for clinician scores (96%). The minimum and maximum CARS scores for LFA and HFA were approximately 5 points lower for parents than for clinicians, and the maximum score for the ADHD group was 12 points higher for parents than clinicians. The clinicians who completed the instruments for our study had extensive experience with autism and ADHD. This high level of expertise, combined with the fact that accuracy was measured by agreement with the child’s clinical diagnosis, may in part explain the higher classification accuracy for clinicians than parents. Furthermore, neither clinicians nor parents were given specific training on how to complete the CARS. Training may be more important for parents than for the experienced clinicians, which may have negatively affected the parent scores. Therefore, parent scores should be interpreted with caution and should be a supplement to other information in the diagnostic process. Instruments like the CARS and CASD offer simple and cost-effective means of collecting standardized, reliable, valid, and norm-referenced data from multiple sources and settings to aid the diagnostic process. Information from these tests completed by clinicians, parents, teachers, and child care givers can be combined with data from other tests, parent interviews (focusing on early history and current symptoms), standardized observations of the child, and a review of records to assist clinicians in evaluating whether or not the child meets diagnostic criteria for autism.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations, which need to be addressed in future studies. Correlations among the CARS, CASD, and GADS scores may be inflated by common source variance because raters were the same. Furthermore, raters who completed these scales were not blind to the child’s diagnosis. Different tests were used to estimate IQ in our study depending on the child’s age and level of functioning, and separate analyses were not conducted for verbal versus nonverbal IQ. Our age range was very broad, and groups were not matched on demographic variables, so we statistically controlled for differences among groups in age, gender, and parent occupation using ANCOVA. ADHD was the only clinical comparison group. Research is needed comparing children with HFA to children who have clinical disorders other than ADHD to determine if 25.5 is indeed the best cutoff for HFA. Furthermore, the difference in CARS scores between LFA and HFA may be the result of a few developmental items on the CARS. A CARS item analysis is needed to explore this possibility, which may have implications for scoring the CARS with individuals who have HFA.</p>
