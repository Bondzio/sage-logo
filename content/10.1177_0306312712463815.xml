<abstract>
<p>Animal models of human disorders are a ubiquitous feature of contemporary biomedical research, but how is their value and role in understanding human disorders established? This article examines the dynamics of building up (and sometimes knocking down) claims about what a model can demonstrate in the field of animal behavior genetics. Drawing on long-standing analogies that describe scientific knowledge production as a process of construction, I introduce the metaphor of an ‘epistemic scaffold’ to illuminate how scientists create and contest claims about the utility of animal models. The flexible, temporary nature of scaffolding draws attention to the processes of building up claims to increasingly risky heights and reconfiguring the evidence supporting particular models by including or excluding particular facts and claims. As researchers include or exclude observations from epistemic scaffolds, to contest or build up different links, they gradually frame human disorders. Negotiations over how much to claim about the utility of animal models also reflect larger tensions in the discipline concerning what animal studies reveal about human disorders.</p>

<body>
<p>In a quiet, windowless laboratory, a mouse pokes its head around the corner of a plastic wall. Whiskers twitching, it stretches its neck around the wall, sniffing and sweeping its head from side to side. Slowly advancing one paw, and then the other, it steps through an opening in the wall and onto a plastic ledge. A video camera mounted above the maze silently records its movements. As the mouse’s body advances past the opening in the wall, a computer attached to the video camera records this movement – one ‘open arm entry’ – and begins timing the mouse as it walks out onto the open ledge. I sit with a technician in the corner of the room as we observe on the computer screen the mouse’s progress through the maze. The mouse advances slowly. It pauses after a few steps, stretching its neck out and dipping its head over the edge of the plastic balcony. Then, suddenly, the mouse swings its body around, tail flicking out over the side of the narrow ledge, and scampers back along the ledge. As the mouse retreats through the opening in the wall, a timer beeps, and the technician deftly retrieves the mouse from the maze and carries it to a cage. The technician wastes no time in resetting the computer timer and plucking the next mouse from the cage by its tail – an upcoming deadline for grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is looming, and there are many more mice to be tested.</p>
<p>The experiment that is taking place in this dimly lit procedure room is designed to investigate ‘anxiety’. The maze of enclosed spaces and open ledges, known as the ‘elevated plus maze’, was first proposed in the 1980s as a device for modeling anxiety in experiments with rodents. Today, this maze design and its associated experimental protocols are used for running a wide variety of experiments on anxiety, from large-scale screens to discover new antianxiety drugs to experiments that investigate the impact on anxiety behaviors of ‘knocking out’ particular genes.</p>
<p>This article examines how animal behavior geneticists build up, modify, and manage the arguments and evidence that support the use of a mouse in a plastic maze as a credible means for gaining insight into human anxiety disorders. The mouse is the most widely used organism in biomedical research today, so widely used that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306312712463815">Creager et al. (2007)</xref> argue that ‘at the dawn of the twenty-first century, the face of biology may well be that of a laboratory mouse’ (p. 1). At the NIMH, funding for animal models has markedly increased since the mid 1990s, especially for studies using mice to investigate the genetics and neurobiology of behavioral disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306312712463815">Hyman, 2006</xref>). If you ask an animal researcher why the mouse is a good model for studying human disorders, he or she will likely reply with some well-known arguments: they are inexpensive and easy to maintain in the laboratory; they reproduce quickly and have a short life span; their anatomy, genetics, and behaviors are well characterized; and they share many biological and genetic similarities with humans. But, as Karen Rader has argued, this neatly packaged rationale decontextualizes the mouse from the places and circumstances where it first came to be seen as a good tool for investigating biomedical questions. As she puts it, it is more productive to think about the laboratory mouse and other model organisms as ‘the result, rather than the cause, of consensus amongst early twentieth century experimental biologists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312712463815">Rader, 2004</xref>: 15). Establishing plausible relationships between mouse experiments and human disorders is arguably especially challenging in the field of animal behavior genetics, where researchers use animals to model disorders that even they sometimes describe as ‘uniquely human’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0306312712463815">1</xref></sup> What, then, makes this animal and this maze a good tool for studying human anxiety in the eyes of animal behavior genetics practitioners? What exactly do animal behavior geneticists believe this model is (or is not) useful for, and how do they articulate their arguments to other scientists, funding agencies, or even the general public?</p>
<p>The elevated plus maze provides a useful case study for exploring these questions, because even though it has been in use for years, there are still active discussions about the best way to conduct and interpret experiments using it. New methodological studies of the maze continue to appear in the literature, exploring pragmatic questions such as whether building mazes out of plastic or metal affects experimental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306312712463815">Hagenbuch et al., 2006</xref>), or suggesting improvements to the original maze design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306312712463815">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306312712463815">Shepherd et al., 1994</xref>). Theoretical discussions also continue about whether the test really measures what it is supposed to. Several research groups, for example, have undertaken statistical analyses to examine whether the measurements taken in the maze can really be said to measure ‘anxiety’ or whether they are confounded by other factors, such as the activity levels of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306312712463815">Milner and Crabbe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306312712463815">Wall and Messier, 2000</xref>). These formal and informal discussions make the elevated plus maze a valuable site for investigating how scientific communities work out the value of animal models for studying human behavioral disorders.</p>
<p>To better understand how these debates reveal important features of animal modeling practice, this article introduces the metaphor of an ‘epistemic scaffold’ that supports the use of a particular test for producing particular types of knowledge about the human. I develop this metaphor in depth by using the case of the elevated plus maze to show how researchers build up the scaffold of arguments that support the test, break down or modify troublesome parts of the scaffold, and signal their understandings of what the scaffold should look like. Examining such methodological debates highlights the social dynamics of claims-making in the animal behavior genetics community, such as how practitioners evaluate the riskiness of claims about the capacities of particular animal models as knowledge production tools. Exploring the rationales for particular animal models also draws attention to how human disorders are framed through the process of developing and working with animal models, and how the enterprise of animal behavior genetics is framed as a credible way of producing knowledge about the human.</p>
<p>This article draws from research conducted between 2006 and 2009, which included ethnographic fieldwork in an animal behavior genetics laboratory and a series of interviews at several different sites with animal behavior genetics researchers, graduate students, and technicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306312712463815">Nelson, 2011</xref>). In 2008, I spent a semester as a participant observer at a university on the West Coast of the United States, which I refer to as ‘Western University’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0306312712463815">2</xref></sup> While at Western, I observed a drug and alcohol research group that uses mouse models to study the genetics and neurobiology of addiction and related behavioral traits, such as anxiety and impulsivity. I attended laboratory meetings, watched experiments, and took the introductory behavior genetics course with the incoming class of graduate students. I also conducted semistructured interviews with researchers at Western and at other institutions in the United States, Canada, and Germany, focusing on methodology in animal behavior genetics work (52 interviews in total, including 28 from Western University). Finally, I attended several conferences and workshops as a participant observer, such as the 2008 <italic>Measuring Behavior</italic> conference, a biennial meeting held in the Netherlands that focuses on methods and techniques in behavioral research.</p>

<title>Animals as tools for knowledge production</title>
<p>The widespread use of animals as models in the biological sciences, especially so-called model organisms, has attracted much attention in science and technology studies (STS) and the history and philosophy of science. One theme emerging from this literature is a focus on the translations that take place in modeling work between different organisms and contexts. Translation is integral to animal modeling; as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306312712463815">Rachel Ankeny and Sabina Leonelli (2011)</xref> point out, model organisms are considered ‘models’ because of the value they have for understanding other organisms or processes, and not because they are interesting in their own right. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312712463815">Angela Creager (2002)</xref> argues that one way in which model organisms model is by acting as ‘exemplars for studying and understanding other entities and organisms’ (p. 5). She explores how researchers studying less-understood viruses, like the polio virus, were able to draw on experimental techniques and concepts developed through work on the tobacco mosaic virus to further their research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312712463815">Kenneth Schaffner (2001)</xref> similarly describes animal modeling of human disorders as a process of ‘extrapolation’, where researchers first establish the biological mechanisms that are at work in animals and then use this information to infer what might be happening in humans (perhaps with the secondary goal of establishing more general biological principles). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712463815">Carrie Friese and Adele Clarke (2012)</xref> point out that many things, not just experimental findings, are ‘transposed’ into new settings in the process of animal modeling work, such as infrastructures from other research programs, laboratory techniques, and even the bodies of the animals themselves.</p>
<p>The focus on translation in the model organism literature draws attention to some of the important ways in which organisms are used as tools for knowledge production, as well as some of the problems that arise from their use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306312712463815">Schaffner (2001)</xref>, for example, voices concerns about how well scientists are able to extrapolate from animal models to humans, especially with more distantly related organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Investigations of how animals and experimental findings move between settings also connect with the STS interests in how standardized objects facilitate social relations within and between communities of scientific practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312712463815">Rader, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306312712463815">Shostak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306312712463815">Star and Griesemer, 1989</xref>), and how organisms as scientific tools are embedded in experimental systems and social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312712463815">Creager, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712463815">Kohler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306312712463815">Rheinberger, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this framing of modeling work as a translation process also creates some blind spots. Describing animal models as ‘exemplars’ or modeling as a process of ‘extrapolation’ creates the impression that findings are first worked out in model systems and then translated to other cases, thereby obscuring the ongoing interactions between the model and the modeled that take place during all stages of animal modeling work. The discussions of model organisms originating from the history and philosophy of science – a field that generally has been more concerned with the relationship between models, scientific theories, and experimental practice – have directed more attention to ongoing interactions between model organisms and the phenomena being modeled. An extensive literature exists in the history and philosophy of science on other kinds of scientific models and how they function. For a discussion of this literature and how it relates to animal models in the neurosciences, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306312712463815">Rose and Abi-Rached (forthcoming)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306312712463815">Ankeny (2007)</xref>, for example, describes the way that <italic>C elegans</italic> has been used to produce knowledge as akin to ‘case-based reasoning’ in medicine, where comparisons between individual cases are used as a means of developing more general principles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306312712463815">Ankeny (2000)</xref> also points out that even in the very early stages of working with model organisms, researchers develop generalizations through a process of iterative comparisons, such as comparisons of electron micrographs from many individual worms to generate the schematic ‘wiring diagrams’ of the worm’s neural structure. These descriptions of how general biological principles emerge through work with model organisms offer less insight, however, into knowledge production with biomedical models that are developed for studying particular phenomena, studies that aim to move not from the specific to the general or the simplified to the complex but from the specific to the specific.</p>
<p>In this article, I direct attention to the ways in which the human disorder is referenced during the very early stages of developing and validating a biomedical animal model. What I am focusing on, therefore, is not the production of knowledge claims about anxiety but on claims about the capacities of animal models as tools for knowledge production: a particular kind of methodological work performed before and alongside the work of producing specific experimental facts. Others also have discussed how animal models are developed as scientific tools, but with a primary focus on institutional, historical, or sociocultural factors that contribute to how particular organisms rise to prominence or disappear from regular use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306312712463815">Ankeny, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306312712463815">Logan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306312712463815">Mitman and Fausto-Sterling, 1992</xref>), or how organisms as living objects have been adapted, standardized, and commodified to transform them into laboratory ‘technologies’ (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306312712463815">Kohler, 1994</xref>, but also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306312712463815">Creager, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306312712463815">Lynch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306312712463815">Rader, 2004</xref>). My inquiry explores how scientists themselves build up the case for their animal models through methodological experiments and arguments that bind together the animal model with the human disorder in a way that makes future experimental work possible and credible. I argue that this is an important site where the human is framed early in the research process, and also an important site where knowledge production is framed for outside audiences. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306312712463815">Sergio Sismondo (1999)</xref> has argued about mathematical models, arguments about models are often also arguments over styles of inquiry and explanation. In animal behavior genetics, discussions about how best to model human disorders using animal experiments are also discussions about whether ‘anxiety’ should be conceptualized narrowly or broadly, whether researchers should aim to produce information about new drugs or about genes and biological systems, and so on.</p>
<sec id="section2-0306312712463815">
<title>Epistemic scaffolds</title>
<p>To illuminate the process of building up a case for an animal model, I develop the metaphor of building an ‘epistemic scaffold’. This metaphor draws on long-standing STS analogies between the production of scientific knowledge and the construction of buildings or other structures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0306312712463815">3</xref></sup> The scaffold is a useful object for thinking about the justification for animal models because of its function as a support structure and platform for doing work and because it is a transient structure that can be modified, reconfigured, and adjusted to different heights. At construction sites, workers build scaffolds to create surfaces from which to perform construction or repair work. The main body of a scaffold is constructed from modular pieces that are linked together horizontally to give stability to the structure and built up vertically to support work at greater heights. The further up it is built, however, the shakier the scaffold becomes and the greater is the support required to create a safe platform for doing work. When the work is complete, the scaffold is dismantled, leaving no trace of its role in the production of the finished product.</p>
<p>My approach to analyzing how scientists build up model claims takes inspiration from descriptions in STS about how scientists build up factual claims, especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312712463815">Trevor Pinch’s (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312712463815">Bruno Latour’s (1987)</xref> descriptions of the processes by which scientists build on a particular observation to generate broader or narrower claims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306312712463815">Pinch (1985)</xref> calls this the degree of ‘externality’ of the claim, which might be thought of as a calibration of the boldness of a claim about what observational data reveal. In his case study of solar neutrino physics, Pinch argues that a scientist’s claim that she recorded ‘splodges on a graph’ has a low degree of externality, while the claim that these data are evidence of a particular ion has a higher degree of externality, and the claim that this ion indicates the presence of solar neutrinos has the highest degree of externality. Claims with low externality not only tend to be safer but also more modest in what they propose to contribute to the field, while claims with high externality are not only bolder but also more likely to draw criticism from colleagues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312712463815">Latour (1987)</xref> describes a similar process of ‘fact-building’ where scientists stack claims on top of each other to create claims with higher degrees of ‘induction’, so that data from three hamsters’ kidneys are transformed into claims about kidney structures in mammals more generally. Latour describes the process of claims-making in self-interested terms: He argues that successful scientists will attempt to ‘prove as much as [they] can with as little as [they] can considering the circumstances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306312712463815">Latour, 1987</xref>: 51), and whether these claims survive depends on the intensity of controversies with other scientists in the field .</p>
<p>Building an epistemic scaffold similarly involves a process of building up a structure of arguments and evidence to substantiate the use of the model to do knowledge production work. What is ‘stacked’ in an epistemic scaffold, however, is not a series of increasingly general claims about a particular observation but a series of increasingly risky claims about the relationship of the model and modeled. To argue for the use of the model as an appropriate tool, researchers select particular facts or observations about both the model organism (the mouse) and the organism being modeled (the human) and attempt to link them together, and these paired pieces of information are stacked to build the epistemic scaffold to greater heights. Like claims about experimental facts, the claims supporting models can get quite complicated. The models may have multiple types of supporting evidence and argumentation, adding strength and resiliency to the scaffold. In the case study that I will describe here, for example, there is both pharmacological and ethological evidence to support the test, which allows practitioners to tailor the evidence they provide to the audiences they encounter. Together, this assemblage of connections between the model and the modeled forms a support structure that justifies engaging in work with the mouse to produce knowledge about the human.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that in this article, I speak of the ‘riskiness’ of the claims embedded in epistemic scaffolds, which is related to, but not synonymous with, their degree of generality or abstractness. The claims about either facts or models that are broad in scope may be generally more difficult to support than narrow ones, but whether this is true in any particular case depends on the context in which that claim is made and the audiences that evaluate it. For example, there is no intrinsic reason for why a genetic factor that affects behavior in the elevated plus maze should be considered any more abstract than an environmental one. But claiming to have discovered a gene that alters anxiety is likely to be viewed by the scientific community as more provocative and risky than an account of how a technician’s handling can alter anxiety levels in mice. A genetic claim is also likely to be seen as important but risky with respect to audiences, such as funding agencies, who have invested significant funds in animal models for the genetics of behavior, or to the general public, whom scientists perceive as being both highly receptive and potentially hostile toward claims about the genetic basis of behavior. Likewise, when building epistemic scaffolds, some types of evidence or ways of making links between the mouse and the human may be considered by the research community to be stronger than others, and therefore more suitable for constructing scaffolds. Evidence of pharmacological similarities (where both mice and humans respond similarly to the same drugs) historically has been considered by practitioners to be stronger evidence for modeling anxiety disorders than so-called face validity, where the behavior of the animal resembles particular aspects of the human condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306312712463815">Rodgers et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, unlike claims about particular observations that are typically produced by an individual researcher or a laboratory group, experimental animal models are shared entities that are used by many practitioners within a scientific community, and this has potential consequences for the way that claims about them are developed and debated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0306312712463815">4</xref></sup> Pinch’s and Latour’s focus on how specific factual claims are built up draws attention to conflicts and competition between practitioners; however, in the case that I describe in this article, researchers often participate in breaking down the epistemic scaffolds and advocating more conservative views of models that they themselves use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0306312712463815">5</xref></sup> For when discussing collectively used models, theories, or scientific objects, other professional concerns and interests come into play, such as competition between scientific fields or the credibility of a particular field in society at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306312712463815">Abbott, 1988</xref>), thus turning discussions about models into a negotiation that takes place at the level of the field. This dynamic is particularly important for understanding claims-making in behavior genetics, where the field’s methods and findings have been the subject of heated public debates at numerous points in its history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306312712463815">Aaron Panofsky (2011)</xref> has argued that these debates have contributed to the development of behavior genetics as an ‘inside out’ field, where practitioners are especially concerned with how their tools and findings are viewed in other fields.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article, I focus on the epistemic scaffold supporting one mouse model – the elevated plus maze – and on how observations and evidence are linked together to support work with this test; how various actors attempt to build up, break down, or modify this scaffold; how practitioners signal shared understandings of the test’s scaffold; and how examining this process can provide insight into how both the human and the animal behavior genetics enterprises are framed.</p>

<title>The elevated plus maze</title>
<p>The elevated plus maze, as its name suggests, is a simple maze in the shape of a plus sign, elevated about half a meter off of the floor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0306312712463815">Figure 1</xref>). Two arms of the plus sign are surrounded by high walls, which are called the ‘closed arms’ of the maze, and the other two arms are narrow, ‘open’ platforms without any enclosures. Many researchers build their own mazes out of plexiglass, fiberboard, or metal, but prefabricated mazes from commercial suppliers are also available. At the beginning of a testing session, a mouse is placed in the center of the maze where the open and closed arms meet, and is allowed to explore the maze for a short period (typically between 5 and 15 minutes). Using a video camera mounted above the maze, researchers track how much time the mouse spends in different areas of the maze. The mouse’s behavior is then scored manually by a trained observer watching the video or automatically by video tracking software. Measurements such as the number of times the mouse enters the open arms, and the percentage of time it spends there, form the basis for assessing the anxiety level of the mouse.</p>

<p>This test builds on work done with other rodent mazes in the 1960s, but it was first described as a ‘novel test for the selective identification of anxiolytic and anxiogenic drug effects in the rat’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306312712463815">Sharon Pellow et al. (1985</xref>: 149). It was quickly adapted for use with mice by Richard Lister, an intramural researcher at the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), who in 1987 published the first article describing mouse data from the test. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312712463815">Lister (1987)</xref> argued that the elevated plus maze had several advantages over other tests for anxiety available at the time. Many existing tests required long training periods, and others used external stressors – such as shocks, bright lights, or loud tones – to create anxiety. Not only did the elevated plus maze measure anxiety without using any of these negative stressors, but it also required no training period and only needed to be performed once to get results. Today, the elevated plus maze is used widely in academic research and by pharmaceutical companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712463815">Dawson and Tricklebank, 1995</xref>), and researchers often refer to it as the ‘gold standard’ of anxiety tests (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312712463815">Crawley, 2007</xref>: 262)</p>

<title>The epistemic scaffold of the elevated plus maze</title>
<p>How do researchers make the case that the elevated plus maze is a useful model for human anxiety? The website of Panlab Harvard Apparatus, a manufacturer of behavioral test equipment, provides a brief description of the test that summarizes some of the main technical arguments that researchers use to connect this test to human anxiety:
<disp-quote>
<p>The elevated plus maze is a widely used animal model of anxiety that is based on two conflicting innate tendencies: exploring a novel environment and avoiding elevated and open situations constituting situations of predator risk. … When placed into this apparatus, naïve mice and rats will, by nature, tend to explore the open arms less due to their natural fear of heights and open spaces. In this context, anxiolytics generally increase the time spent exploring the open arms and anxiogenics have the opposite effect, increasing time spent in the closed arms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306312712463815">Panlab, 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This description presents two lines of argumentation. I call the first argument the <italic>pharmacological argument</italic>, which is based on the effects that anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving) or anxiogenic (anxiety-inducing) drugs have on the behavior of mice in the maze. I call the second argument, which is based on the ‘innate tendencies’ of the mouse to explore some spaces and avoid others, <italic>the ethological argument</italic>.</p>
<p>The pharmacological argument is based on a series of experiments in which mice in the maze were given drugs known to increase or decrease anxiety in humans. In his original article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312712463815">Lister (1987)</xref> reported that when chlordiazepoxide (a drug in the benzodiazepine class, better known by its brand name Librium) was administered to mice, they spent more time in the open arms of the maze. Conversely, when Lister gave mice caffeine, which increases anxiety in humans, they spent less time in the open arms. Lister used the observation that the same drugs that increase or decrease anxiety in humans produce corresponding changes in mice to support an argumentative link between mouse behavior in the maze and human anxiety. The widely accepted claim that Librium is anxiety-relieving in humans is linked to the observed changes in the behavior of mice and thereby forms the base of one section of the scaffold supporting the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0306312712463815">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>On its own, this link between the mouse and the human may not be that useful. The claim that the elevated plus maze can be used to detect the effects of Librium or caffeine is a safe claim with a low degree of ‘externality’; it is easy to defend, but it does not make the elevated plus maze very useful for doing anything other than detecting the effects of these drugs. This link, however, forms a foundation from which researchers can build upward. Based on this observation, researchers have argued that the test can be used to investigate the effects of other anxiolytic or anxiogenic drugs or, even more broadly, to screen new pharmacological agents for antianxiety activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312712463815">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>). Going even further, some have argued that this test can be used not only to find more drugs that affect anxiety but also to identify other factors that affect anxiety. In the mid 1990s, when researchers developed techniques for knocking out genes in mice, they began to employ the test to investigate whether knocking out specific genes changes a mouse’s behavioral pattern in the maze in a way similar to an anxiolytic drug. Today, the elevated plus maze sometimes is described as a tool that permits both ‘a rapid screening of anxiety modulating drugs [and] mouse genotypes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312712463815">Bourin et al., 2007</xref>: 570).</p>
<p>Building up to the claim that the elevated plus maze can be used to find new drugs or genes that affect anxiety in humans requires researchers to incorporate more facts on both the mouse side and the human side to generate support for these claims. For example, further research has been conducted on the effect of other classes of anxiolytics in the elevated plus maze but not all drugs seem to follow the same pattern as those studied by Lister. While benzodiazepines tend to work reliably to change behavior, other drugs, such as buspirone (an anxiolytic chemically unrelated to the benzodiazepines) and fluoxetine (an SSRI commonly described as an antidepressant but which also has antianxiety effects), have produced inconsistent results with mice in the elevated plus maze. Some studies have shown that these drugs have no effect on, or even slightly decrease, the time that mice spend in the open arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306312712463815">Kurt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306312712463815">Moser, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306312712463815">Silva et al., 1999</xref>). This new evidence can be used to expand the scope of the claims made with the elevated plus maze, but it also creates a potentially weak link on the mouse side of the epistemic scaffolding: evidence from drugs that follow the same pattern as those studied by Lister can be used to strengthen the links between the mouse and human, but anxiolytics that do not reproduce that pattern can also be cited by critics to weaken the scaffolding. For example, some researchers argue that because anxiety models, such as the elevated plus maze, have been developed and validated only with benzodiazepines, ‘their sensibility on drugs acting on other system remains questionable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306312712463815">Bourin et al., 2007</xref>: 573). Others attempt to repair this weakness in the scaffold by arguing that the inconsistent findings with different classes of drugs may be due to variations in the way that researchers conduct elevated plus maze experiments and that further standardization of the test protocol might eliminate these inconsistent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312712463815">Hogg, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The further the claims about the utility of the elevated plus maze are built up, the shakier the epistemic scaffold becomes, as claims appear more risky and open to potential criticisms from the scientific community. The scaffold created by the pharmacological argument is particularly shaky in the upper regions on the human side, where the strength (or even the very existence) of the links between mouse data and the human situation are contested among practitioners. In a particularly strong critique of the elevated plus maze, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712463815">Dawson and Tricklebank (1995)</xref> argue that it has failed to produce any new information that has been successfully translated to the human clinical setting. They write that it ‘has yet to make a major contribution to the discovery of a novel anxiolytic or to further our understanding of either the psychological or physiological basis of anxiety or its relief’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712463815">Dawson and Tricklebank, 1995</xref>: 36). The practitioners also express differing opinions about whether the test is suitable for making links between genetic components of anxiety in mice and humans, as I will explore in greater detail in the next section.</p>
<p>The second line of argumentation, the ethological argument, draws on an entirely different body of knowledge coming from studies of animal behavior. This argument contends that the maze is a good test for anxiety because it creates a conflict situation for the mouse in which the instinct to explore a new space is pitted against the instinct to avoid a dangerous place (psychologists term this an ‘approach/avoidance conflict’, a concept first described by psychologist Kurt Lewin in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306312712463815">1935</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306312712463815">Lister (1987)</xref> notes that the rat version of the maze was based on observations in the 1950s by psychologists who found that rats exploring a maze generally preferred to stay in the narrow, dark hallways rather than in open or brightly lit spaces. Although Lister uses observations of rodent behavior that took place in a laboratory setting to make his case, researchers also draw from more ethological bodies of knowledge about the behavior of mice in their natural habitats. For example, a methodological article on the elevated plus maze argues that ‘mice are prey for many other larger animals, which may underlie their natural tendency to avoid open and, thus, unprotected, spaces (and, to a lesser extent, heights)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306312712463815">Walf and Frye, 2009</xref>: 228). Based on this information about innate rodent behavior, researchers argue that mice in the elevated plus maze have an intrinsic motivation to explore the open arms, but how much they explore depends on their assessment of the potential danger in that area of the maze. By tweaking particular variables, researchers can make the plus maze seem more or less dangerous. Shining a bright light on the open arms of the maze, for example, will make mice even more likely to avoid the open arms than they would under dim light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306312712463815">Hogg, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This concept of approach/avoidance conflict forms a foundational link between the mouse and the human in this section of the epistemic scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0306312712463815">Figure 3</xref>), since researchers claim that the behavior of both mice and humans in certain situations can be understood using that theory. The claim that the behavior of two distantly related mammalian species can be characterized by using the same psychological concept is a claim already potentially subject to criticisms from researchers who doubt that the behavior of mice in the maze is related to the human situation. While some researchers claim that the test has solid ‘face validity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312712463815">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>), others argue that the resemblance between the test and the human disorder is ‘questionable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712463815">Haller and Alicki, 2012</xref>: 59). When building the case for the elevated plus maze, therefore, practitioners often recruit additional evidence to support this foundational link. In a textbook on behavioral testing in mice, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312712463815">Jacqueline Crawley (2007)</xref> elaborates on the approach/avoidance concept by providing an example of an anxiety-provoking situation that human researchers might face, which she argues is analogous to the predicament faced by mice in the maze:
<disp-quote>
<p>You want to tell the world about your exciting research results, but have fears about the audience’s response when you walk up to the podium to give your talk. A mouse may want to explore a new environment to find food, but may fear venturing out into the open where it is an easy target for predators.

</fig>
<p>This example draws on culturally available knowledge about public speaking and ethological knowledge about mouse behavior to support the argument that aspects of both mouse and human experience can be characterized as approach/avoidance conflicts.</p>
<p>From this initial human–mouse link, researchers argue that the elevated plus maze can be used not only to measure the conflict between approaching and avoiding particular situations but also to investigate an extreme or disordered version of this behavior that resembles anxiety disorders in humans, a move that once again may be contested. For example, some researchers have claimed that the elevated plus maze is limited in its utility because it models so-called normal anxiety that is provoked by a particular situation rather than the ‘pathological’ anxiety experienced by humans suffering from anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306312712463815">Haller and Alicki, 2012</xref>). Others argue that normal and pathological anxiety are really ‘two sides of the same coin’, since humans or mice with pathological anxiety will also respond more strongly to normal anxiety-provoking situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312712463815">Ramos, 2008</xref>: 496). The claim that measurements taken in the elevated plus maze are measurements of ‘anxiety’, without further qualification, is a risky one that is likely to attract attention and be contested by others, as I explore in the next section.</p>

<title>Dynamics of epistemic scaffolds</title>
<p>By describing the general arguments for the elevated plus maze as a tool for studying anxiety, I have already hinted at how members of a scientific community attempt to modify epistemic scaffolds by introducing new evidence or criticizing particular claims. This section further explores the dynamics of acting on epistemic scaffolds.</p>
<sec id="section6-0306312712463815">
<title>Linking together scaffolding to support animal models</title>
<p>One important feature of the dynamics of epistemic scaffolds is the way practitioners combine arguments to support animal modeling work. Although for the sake of clarity I have presented the pharmaceutical and ethological arguments as distinct arguments, in practice, researchers draw from many arguments at the same time. The validity of tests like the elevated plus maze rests not only on pharmaceutical and ethological arguments but also on other more general arguments about similarities between the mouse and the human. The arguments for evolutionary relationships, genetic homologies, and physiological similarities also are part of the epistemic infrastructure that supports the use of animal models.</p>
<p>By combining several arguments or drawing on a landscape of existing arguments about the relationship between animal models and humans, researchers build up epistemic scaffolds by using the strengths of some arguments to bolster the weaknesses of others. For example, one of the weaknesses of the ethological argument is that it is less quantifiable and seems less ‘scientific’ to some researchers than the experimental evidence marshaled by the pharmacological argument. I observed one training session on behavioral testing in rodents where the presenter struggled to convince an audience of new practitioners of the validity of the elevated plus maze using the ethological argument. After several skeptical questions from the audience, she spontaneously switched over to the pharmacological argument to provide additional evidence for the test. Lister similarly drew together ethological and pharmaceutical arguments to support the elevated plus maze. He argued that tests validated with pharmacological information alone could reach mistaken conclusions (e.g. a drug might be mistaken as anxiety relieving or inducing if it simply sedated the mouse so that it could not move freely between the open and closed arms) and advocated for anxiety models that had an ethological basis as well as pharmacological evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306312712463815">Lister, 1990</xref>: 323). Instances such as these demonstrate how connecting several arguments to support the utility of a particular model can give added strength and stability to epistemic scaffolds by creating a dense framework of arguments that is more difficult to break down than a single argument on its own.</p>
<p>However, piecing together various arguments into a patchwork of connected scaffolding also carries the risk that the weaknesses of some arguments might compromise the strength of others. Amy, a veterinarian I met at a workshop on mouse tests of stress and anxiety, also was skeptical about the ethological argument. Reflecting on what she had learned during the workshop, she told me that she was still not convinced of the utility of the elevated plus maze because the presenter’s ethological arguments simply did not ring true to her:
<disp-quote>
<p>I really think a lot of those – a lot of that – maybe anthropomorphism, or maybe – it’s just off, it just seemed off to me, you know, a lot of the interpretation of what those tests mean. I think that because behavior is so complex, we can’t make those sort of fast leaps like this test is assessing fear. … I think that for the [tests] where it has been pharmacologically proven that anxiolytics decrease that behavior, I think there’s an argument for it. But I’m still not going to say that the mouse is anxious and we’re alleviating it. All I’m saying is that whatever pathways that alleviate anxiety in us exist in the mouse and we’re alleviating that as well. Now whether [the mice] interpret that as anxiety or whatever else, I don’t know if we can make that leap, scientifically.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>If anything, she thought that the test appeared to measure something akin to what she would call ‘bravado’ rather than ‘anxiety’. Although she found the pharmacological argument somewhat convincing, her skepticism about the anthropomorphic reasoning that she saw in the ethological argument made her hesitant to adopt the test for her own use in a commercial mouse production facility. Amy’s reaction to her introduction to behavioral testing shows how weaknesses in particular arguments can generate instability in the entire scaffold of the elevated plus maze, and perhaps even in the scaffolding supporting animal behavioral modeling in general.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0306312712463815">
<title>Modifying and breaking down epistemic scaffolds</title>
<p>Amy’s skepticism about the elevated plus maze can also be interpreted another way: not as mere skepticism about the validity of the elevated plus maze but as a different and more conservative view of the kind of knowledge production the epistemic scaffolding of the maze can support. She suggests that it would be appropriate to use the test to explore biological similarities, such as pathways that respond to anxiolytic drugs in both mice and humans, but not to use it to draw inferences about the mental state of mice. Like Amy, many of the animal behavior geneticists I interacted with were unwilling to say that the elevated plus maze was capable of measuring a mental state, and even frequent users of the test argued against this broad claim about the utility of the maze.</p>
<p>Arguing for or against different moves to build up the epistemic foundations of tests is another means by which researchers reconfigure the epistemic scaffolds of animal models. Earlier, when describing the pharmacological argument for using the elevated plus maze as a model of anxiety, I argued that researchers could conceptualize the maze as a test for novel drugs that affect anxiety, or they could take the riskier position that the elevated plus maze is useful for investigating genetic, neurobiological, or other factors affecting anxiety. Not all practitioners agree with the claim that the elevated plus maze should be used for such purposes. For example, Rachel, a drug and alcohol researcher at Western, says,
<disp-quote>
<p>That particular animal model, I’ll just tell you some of my bias, was developed for screening drugs that work on anxiety in humans. … And for that purpose it’s probably a fairly decent test. But when you’re looking at say withdrawal-induced anxiety, then you have a problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0306312712463815">6</xref></sup> Mice that are withdrawing from alcohol don’t move very much. So how do you interpret their behavior on that maze? You can’t. So you then don’t know if it’s behavioral, they’re not motivated, you don’t know if it’s malaise, they just don’t feel well. There’s no way to interpret those data. So modeling anxiety in mice is a very difficult prospect, and I think it’s very important to understand the difference between a screening test for drugs and a behavioral test for an emotive state; [they] are really two separate things.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Rachel is pushing back against what she perceives as a trend to use the elevated plus maze for research questions that it was not designed to answer. Her example of measuring a mouse in withdrawal demonstrates some of the methodological problems that might arise when it is used for purposes other than drug discovery. In her opinion, the epistemic scaffolding of the elevated plus maze is not robust enough to support its use as a ‘behavioral test for an emotive state’, and it should be used instead as a ‘screening test for drugs’. She told me that she often voices this opinion when she reviews articles or mentors trainees in the laboratory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306312712463815">Dawson and Tricklebank (1995)</xref> go even further in pushing back on the epistemic scaffolds supporting the elevated plus maze, arguing that ‘it is difficult to justify its use as anything other than a preliminary screen as a prelude to testing in more robust animal models of anxiety’ (p. 36).</p>
<p>Researchers can also act on epistemic scaffolds by drawing attention to the facts that the scaffolding of particular tests include or exclude. As I explored above, critics of the elevated plus maze have pointed out that not all antianxiety agents produce behavioral changes in mice in the maze, a potentially weak link in the evidentiary foundation for the test. Critics may also draw attention to observations that have been excluded from the epistemic scaffolding in order to complicate the picture of what this test can be used for. Scott, a behavior geneticist who has extensive experience with running elevated plus maze experiments, expressed concern about calling this test ‘a model for anxiety’. He elaborates in an interview,
<disp-quote>
<p>Are you measuring ‘anxiety’, or are you tapping into some undefined piece of an anxiety dimension that’s hard enough to diagnose in a human? Let’s not pretend that this test is a measure of anxiety behavior. No, it’s a measure of behavior that’s probably somehow related, but let’s not start substituting the label ‘anxiety’ for this behavior.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In his critique, Scott highlights two observations about anxiety that are missing from the human side of the scaffolding, namely, the fact that ‘anxiety’ in humans is an unstable category whose definition and measurement is contested by clinical researchers, and that there are many different behaviors that fall under this global category. By drawing attention to these complications, Scott is effectively pushing down on the epistemic scaffolding of the elevated plus maze, arguing that researchers should make the more circumscribed claim that their animal models capture one component of anxiety but not everything that humans might experience as anxiety. Because of his concerns over what exactly the elevated plus maze was measuring, Scott told me that he could ‘never bring himself’ to publish his experiments with the elevated plus maze and that the data still sit in his filing cabinet years later. Other researchers express similar reservations about the elevated plus maze, but rather than abandoning the test entirely they suggest using multiple animal models of anxiety to capture different facets of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306312712463815">Ramos, 2008</xref>). One research group argues, for example, that because of the clinical heterogeneity of anxiety disorders
<disp-quote>
<p>various animal models may be more appropriate for one type of anxiety disorder than for another, as it is inappropriate to assume that any one model may serve to detect compounds for a disease that is mediated through multiple and diverse mechanisms.

<title>Developing and signaling shared understandings of epistemic scaffolds</title>
<p>Scott and Rachel articulate subtle positions on what the elevated plus maze test is capable of measuring, and while researchers have the opportunity to elaborate on such opinions at length in review articles or in interviews with curious ethnographers, in everyday scientific settings, they often use other methods to express their views. As an observer in animal behavior genetics laboratories at Western University, I experienced firsthand some of the ways in which these understandings are instilled in new trainees, and how researchers learn to talk about behavioral testing in the context of classes, journal clubs, and interactions in the lab. I described one such incident in my fieldnotes, where Marcus, a postdoc, corrected me on my description of mouse behavior as I was watching him score videos from elevated plus maze experiments over lunch.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I sat back and watched a few rounds while I was eating my salad. At one point in watching the video I commented, ‘That guy really likes the open arms’ when the mouse that we were watching at the time seemed to be spending more time there than the others. There was silence, and then Marcus said, ‘Don’t say “like”’. It took me a minute to figure out what he meant here, and then I realized that he was chastising me for anthropomorphizing the mouse. I asked him about this, and he said that he had been corrected before by other people for saying things like what I had just said. He said that you should never say things such as ‘the mouse likes the open arms’ or ‘the mouse is less anxious’, you should say things like ‘the mouse spends a higher percentage of time in the open arms’ or ‘the mouse shows less anxiety-like behavior’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This interaction demonstrates how animal behavior genetics students at Western are simultaneously trained to understand the elevated plus maze as a measure of mouse behavior rather than a measure of an internal state, and trained to talk about behavioral testing in ways that convey these understandings. Marcus’s insistence that the mouse’s behavior should be described as ‘anxiety-like’ rather than ‘anxious’ is a way of teaching me that he and other researchers at Western believe that the claim that the elevated plus maze can be used to measure ‘anxiety’ is too risky and that the epistemic scaffolding of this test needs to be lowered to a safer, more defensible height.</p>
<p>Disciplined use of cautious language, even over lunch, is one technique that researchers employ to signal to each other that they share a cautious view of what kinds of knowledge can be produced by elevated plus maze experiments. The animal behavior geneticist’s vocabulary is replete with cumbersome constructions, such as ‘anxiety-like behavior’, ‘depression-related behavior’, and behaviors ‘relevant to schizophrenia’ that modify and restrict the meaning of data produced with mouse models. This careful language pushes down on the epistemic scaffolding of animal models in a general way: calling the mouse’s behavior ‘anxiety-like’ rather than ‘anxious’ implies that there are some disconnects between mouse behavior and the human state, without necessarily identifying any particular weak links.</p>
<p>Developing and signaling shared understandings of the epistemic scaffolds of animal models become more complicated, however, as scientific communities expand or as tests are taken up in new research communities. The elevated plus maze is an excellent ‘theory-methods package’ for creating ‘doable’ research projects on anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306312712463815">Fujimura, 1987</xref>). As a <italic>Nature Protocols</italic> article puts it succinctly, the test is ‘easy to use, can be fully automated, and valid results can be obtained in a short, five minute testing period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306312712463815">Walf and Frye, 2007</xref>: 327). The availability of standard test protocols, commercially produced mazes, software packages for data analysis, and the existing literature on the test facilitate the widespread uptake of the elevated plus maze for answering questions about how different experimental manipulations change anxiety. Unlike more expensive and cumbersome pieces of laboratory equipment, a researcher could easily purchase a commercially produced maze and a video camera for a few thousand dollars, and it is almost impossible not to produce data, since, barring a mouse who decides to jump off the maze, the mouse will always spend some percentage of time in the open arms and some in the closed arms.</p>
<p>Indeed, some researchers argue that it is almost too easy to access and conduct behavioral tests and that the popularity of the elevated plus maze ‘owes more to practical than to theoretical considerations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306312712463815">Carobrez and Bertoglio, 2005</xref>: 1194). The widespread uptake of mouse behavioral models is problematic to some practitioners, who view both the methodology and the epistemic scaffolds of these tests as not yet stable enough for off-the-shelf use. Some researchers have warned that ‘uncoordinated experimental approaches in applying behavioral tests … bear a high risk of false negative and/or false positive results’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306312712463815">Karl et al., 2003</xref>: 69), and others have cautioned that the elevated plus maze experiments in particular ‘require extreme caution when interpreting the data’ because ‘responses exhibited by these mice may be related to behavioral processes unrelated to anxiety’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306312712463815">Belzung and Griebel, 2001</xref>: 146).</p>
<p>Researchers at Western argued that those who are not aware of the methodological issues might ‘pollute the literature’ with data from badly run experiments. One graduate student explained that she perused the literature with a skeptical eye, looking for particular key phrases in the methodology sections of articles, such as ‘soundproofed testing area’, for reassurance that she can trust the data. Others argued that the problem is that newcomers to the field often are ‘not thoughtful’ about interpreting data from animal experiments and are too quick to simply declare their mice anxious because they do not understand the origins of these tests or their limitations. These discussions often reflected tensions between practitioners with different disciplinary backgrounds. For example, when I asked a senior Canadian behavior geneticist about how researchers from different disciplines might approach behavioral test development, he replied,
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I wouldn’t let the molecular biologists have anything to say about it! [laughter] Because what do they know about [elevated] plus mazes? I mean, this is something where the behavioral psychologists have to get together and provide good, validated tools that the molecular people can then use.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These comments about how newcomers to the field and practitioners from other disciplines use (or misuse) the elevated plus maze suggest that the perceived credibility of animal models may change over time or when models are taken up in new communities. As the test has become more widely used, it has also become more widely referred to as simply a test for anxiety, indicating that the scaffolding of the test has become ‘black boxed’ and the ‘modalities’ in describing the test have been removed as it has traveled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306312712463815">Latour and Woolgar, 1986</xref>: 77). In a heterogeneous field, such as behavior genetics, where researchers from animal behavior genetics, psychiatric genetics, molecular genetics, and psychological behavior genetics interact around shared models and concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306312712463815">Panofsky, 2011</xref>), the task of developing shared understandings about valid uses of animal models becomes more challenging and the need to signal particular understandings becomes more pronounced.</p>

<title>Framing the human, framing animal behavior genetics</title>
<p>As I have shown so far, developing animal models for human behavioral disorders involves an ongoing process of referencing and drawing upon specific facts about humans. While many animal behavior geneticists consider themselves to be basic researchers whose work is far from any clinical application, their research is still intimately concerned with human health and illness. Explicating the epistemic foundations of particular tests is therefore useful not only for understanding the dynamics of knowledge production using mouse models, but also for revealing how mouse and human behavior are framed ‘upstream’ in the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306312712463815">Wilsdon and Willis, 2004</xref>). Examining discussions around animal models also provides an entry into larger issues about claims-making in the animal behavior genetics field. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306312712463815">Lisa Onaga (2010)</xref> suggests in her work on silkworm breeding experiments, negotiations around experimental organisms can be treated as a site for exploring how larger questions are worked out, such as those concerned with the meaning of laws of heredity. When researchers include or exclude particular observations from epistemic scaffolds, and contest or build up different links, they gradually craft a particular framing of the human disorder and of the practice of behavior genetics along with an argument for their model.</p>
<sec id="section10-0306312712463815">
<title>Framing human disorders</title>
<p>Examining researchers’ constructions of the epistemic scaffolds supporting shared models points to some areas where the framing of the mouse and the human are particularly contentious in the scientific community, such as the long-standing debates about studying the mind and subjective experience. In the epistemic scaffolding of the elevated plus maze, some evidence of human subjective experience is used for building the case for the test, but subjective information about what the animal thinks or feels is rarely, if ever, cited. Debates about whether the animal mind is an appropriate topic for scientific investigation have a long history in the behavioral sciences, with fields such as ethology built around the central premise that only animal behavior (and not the animal mind) is accessible to scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312712463815">Crist, 1999</xref>). While a few of the researchers I met privately claimed to have a sense of the subjective experiences of the animals with which they worked, including this information as part of building the case for the use of particular models would create a vulnerable link in the epistemic scaffolding of their models.</p>
<p>The exclusion of the animal mind as an appropriate topic for scientific study has consequences for how both the mouse and the human are represented in models like the elevated plus maze. Particularly at the lower levels of the epistemic scaffolding, the pharmacological argument excludes many aspects of the mouse’s experience and behavior and focuses only on how it responds to drugs. Whether the mouse is experiencing something like anxiety is irrelevant; all that matters is that mice behave in a certain way when they are given anxiolytics, and that this behavioral change accurately predicts which drugs will be effective for relieving anxiety in humans. The mouse represented in the pharmacological argument appears as little more than a lively biological detector for drug effects. As some of the scientists I interviewed pointed out, this arrangement also presents a very flat picture of human anxiety, where anxiety is defined by response to anxiolytic drugs. The ethological argument, in contrast, draws more information from the natural history of the mouse into the epistemic scaffolding. Although researchers could argue that the mouse might not experience anxiety disorders as humans do, the ethological explanation assumes that the mouse is capable of exhibiting some sort of behavior or biological response that is related to what humans identify as anxiety. This framing of the mouse in the maze depicts human anxiety disorders as rooted in ancient evolutionary instincts or biological processes that are triggered too often or in the wrong situations in day-to-day human life but again does not provide any insight into the subjective experience of anxiety.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306312712463815">Eileen Crist (1999)</xref> has argued that bracketing out subjectivity has important consequences for how scientists represent the animal world, but it also has consequences for how they represent the animal in relationship to the human. Animal researchers face a dilemma in providing justifications for their models: If they build scaffolds that link mouse behavior too tightly to human experience, they risk exposing themselves to critiques of anthropomorphism, but adhering strictly to behaviorist descriptions can weaken the perceived significance of mouse models for understanding complex human experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0306312712463815">7</xref></sup> When everyday understandings of human stress or anxiety are directly juxtaposed with the constrained framing of anxiety as encountered by mice in the maze, the result can be more humorous than convincing. In the laboratory at Western, for example, researchers occasionally applied the cautious constructions that they use to describe mice to their own behavior, but in a joking manner. At one meeting where the laboratory manager was explaining that a technician was stressed because of a complicated experiment, the lab manager paused in the middle of her report and quipped that she should say instead the technician was ‘showing stress-like behaviors’.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that the partial representations of human experience generated through animal modeling do not necessarily reflect what behavior geneticists believe to be central to the human condition. Aspects of behavioral disorders can be excluded from experimental frameworks for pragmatic reasons, based on what is considered scientifically ‘doable’ at the time, even if it is not considered ideal. In her discussion of animal behavioral modeling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306312712463815">Monika Cwiartka (2011)</xref> argues that the mouse as scientific apparatus is ‘constrained by the practical limits of doability like any other machine in the laboratory,’ and that scientific narratives emerging from animal behavior genetics are therefore constrained by what is possible to do with mice (p. 38). Many of the animal behavior geneticists I observed and interviewed would likely agree with her assessment. As one researcher put it, ‘[i]f you try to model those complex things, most of us start by being reductionists, whether we want to or not. We start out as obligate, intentional reductionists’. Researchers start out with a model that may reflect only a few aspects of a behavioral disorder and then attempt to use these limited models to build up a more complex picture. In this way, epistemic scaffolds, like their real-life counterparts at construction sites, can often end up becoming permanently provisional structures – they are built for particular pragmatic purposes, but the work that they are needed for often goes on for much longer than expected, turning these temporary structures into semipermanent features of the scientific landscape.</p>

<title>Framing animal behavior genetics</title>
<p>The discussions of methodological issues in animal models also offer an insight into how practitioners attempt to manage tensions over how much to claim about the relationship between genes and behavior and over who has the authority to make such claims. What counts as a ‘risky’ claim in animal behavior genetics depends not only on epistemological questions about how well an animal model represents a human disorder but also on societal debates about the meaning of genetics. The researchers in this field perceive themselves to be caught in a web of conflicting pressures around how much they should claim about their models and experimental results. Failures to replicate findings from previous studies have made animal behavior geneticists cautious about making strong arguments for links between genes and behavioral traits, as have public debates about genetic explanations for human behavior. Many of today’s senior behavior geneticists, who began their careers during the often vicious debates about intelligence and heredity in the 1960s, are wary of the public implications of overly determinist statements about genetics and psychiatric traits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0306312712463815">8</xref></sup> On the other hand, researchers want to demonstrate to funding agencies, to other researchers, and to the public that animal models do have an important role to play in understanding and treating behavioral disorders, even if they cannot fully capture the complexity of the human experience. In particular, animal behavior geneticists perceive themselves to be in a long-standing rhetorical war with animal rights groups and feel compelled to counter activists who forcefully argue that animal models are not useful for understanding human health.</p>
<p>By reinforcing epistemic scaffolds with new evidence or lowering them to a safer height, animal behavior geneticists can produce scaffolds that can not only weather criticisms from those within the scientific community but also attacks from the outside. In their study of the related field of psychiatric genetics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306312712463815">Michael Arribas-Ayllon et al. (2010)</xref> argue that certain linguistic formulations, such as references to the ‘complexity’ of behavioral disorders, can be thought of as rhetorical tropes that help researchers manage and contain some of these debates. They argue that descriptions of the complexity of psychiatric disorders found in review articles provide a way to account for past failures in the field to researchers in other fields, funders, or perhaps even the general public. ‘Complexity’ explains why previous research efforts might have produced inconsistent results about how genes impact particular psychiatric disorders, and it constructs careful optimism about the promises of new methodologies and of what behavior geneticists can hope to accomplish.</p>
<p>Similarly, scaffold-modifying constructions, such as ‘anxiety-like behavior’, can also manage expectations about research with animal models. In her textbook on mouse models, Crawley explicitly makes this link between cautious language and maintaining the credibility of the field. She writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Tread softly when approaching a mouse model of a human psychiatric disease. Investigators have no insight into whether a mouse feels ‘anxious’ or ‘depressed’ … Members of our laboratory are taught from day one to use cautious terminology such as ‘anxiety like’, ‘depression related’ and ‘relevant to schizophrenia’. The credibility of our field depends on avoiding the impression that it is possible to create a comprehensive mouse model of a human mental illness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306312712463815">Crawley, 2007</xref>: 261–262)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, negotiations around the epistemic scaffolds of collectively used animal models can be considered not only as a site where practitioners work out how to use these scientific tools but also where the scientific enterprise that is animal behavior genetics is framed for broader audiences.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article analyzed the arguments with which animal behavior geneticists build up, break down, and modify the evidence that supports the use of animal models to produce knowledge about human behaviors. To better understand how researchers make these claims, I developed the metaphor of building an ‘epistemic scaffold’ that supports animal behavioral models as experimental platforms for producing knowledge. This metaphor helps reframe various methodological disputes, which could be viewed as many small contestations about particular observations, as part of a larger process of negotiation about how to do the work of animal modeling. These negotiations can also be understood as techniques for responding to many different matters of concern, from the strength of the available evidence for the validity of the test to retaining professional credibility in the face of skeptical funding bodies or activist organizations who may argue that behavior geneticists are overstating the capabilities of their knowledge-making tools.</p>
<p>While the literature on model organisms has devoted much attention to understanding how translations take place from the model organism to other organisms or sites, I have argued here that the animal and human are integrally bound together from the very outset, when a new model is proposed for a human behavioral disorder. The implications of the partial representations of the human formed through the process of animal modeling are unclear, though some STS research suggests that these framings may have possible downstream implications for science or public policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306312712463815">Natasha Dow Schüll and Caitlin Zaloom (2011)</xref>, for example, have argued that different models of human decision making in the field of neuroeconomics render the subject of interventions in distinct ways, with potential implications for public policy, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306312712463815">Nancy Campbell (2000)</xref> has argued that cultural representations of drug users have shaped public policies for addressing drug use. Other research, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306312712463815">Friese and Clarke’s (2012)</xref> comparative analysis of the use of animal models for reproduction, suggests that the knowledge from animal models can be taken up into new situations in dynamic and unpredictable ways. The debates about the utility of the elevated plus maze that I have described in this article demonstrate that within the heterogeneous community of animal behavior genetics research, there already are significant differences between how researchers understand the stability of this animal model and what it can contribute to understanding human anxiety. Further empirical research is needed to determine what kinds of understandings about the utility of animal models exist in other knowledge communities and how the information derived from animal models is transformed as it is taken up in new arenas, such as clinical research, policy, or the popular press.</p>
<p>My aim in this article was not to make my own evaluation of the merits of the elevated plus maze as a model for studying human anxiety but to show systematically how practitioners themselves make and manage associations between the mouse and the human to make the case for using this particular model. Although it is advantageous for researchers to make strong claims about what their models show about human disorders, as I have demonstrated in this article, researchers do not want to completely collapse the distance between animals and humans. Excluding aspects of human disorders as inappropriate for animal researchers to study, or using language that suggests uncertainties in the relationship of animal models to human disorders, helps animal behavior geneticists to navigate contentious disputes both inside and outside of their scientific community and to maintain the credibility of their field. By making, managing, and breaking specific links in epistemic scaffolds, animal behavior geneticists carefully negotiate the strength of the claims that they make about the relationship of animal models to human disorders, simultaneously drawing together and pushing apart the human and mouse.</p>
