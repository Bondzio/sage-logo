<abstract>
<p>In 1989, the Business Council of Australia (BCA) produced a blueprint for change titled ‘Enterprise based bargaining units: A better way of working’. To a great extent, this document and the corresponding shifts in business, government and union approaches to wage and conditions determination meant that Australia shifted from a centralised to a workplace system of bargaining. After more than two decades of enterprise bargaining, though, we ask the question: Is it still a better way of working? While the Business Council of Australia pointed to a panoply of advantages, we look at the other side of the argument. Decentralisation may be inefficient at a number of levels. First, there is the procedure of bargaining and the resources, expertise and time that is required. Second, there are the outcomes of bargaining, where despite a more individual focus, in many cases, outcomes demonstrate very little variation across enterprises. Finally, there are the collateral consequences of bargaining: conflict, reduced trust and disruption. Is enterprise bargaining still meeting the needs of the actors or has the model run its course? We consider two case studies of bargaining that demonstrate the limitations and advantages of enterprise bargaining.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612465533" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Australia has gone through three decades of extensive reform to industrial relations regulations, processes and institutions. In 1989, the Business Council of Australia produced a blueprint for change titled ‘Enterprise based bargaining units: A better way of working’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185612465533">BCA, 1989</xref>). The reasons behind the introduction of the enterprise bargaining (EB) principle in 1991 have been outlined elsewhere (McDonald et al., 2001), but they include: economic and organisational rationales around labour deployment and flexibility (Campbell, 1993); improvements in labour productivity (Curtin and Mathews, 1990); and political rationales for enhancing managerial prerogatives and diminishing trade union influence (Fieldes and Bramble, 1992), reducing the influence of the Commission, and allowing some unions to break the controls over wages that were exercised through the Prices and Incomes Accord (Briggs, 2001). There were debates over the flexibility of the tribunal system (McDonald et al., 2001) and the potential for decentralised bargaining to facilitate high-performance work systems (Deery and Walsh, 1999). Since 1991, the industrial relations system has seen regular legislative changes, but EB has more or less become entrenched in the Australian system from this period. We acknowledge that the term EB has been used in different contexts and has taken on different meanings at different times over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185612465533">Dabscheck, 1998</xref>; McDonald et al., 2001). Also, it should be acknowledged that under the pre-1991 industrial relations system, there were forms of EB that coexisted with the award system (McDonald et al., 2001).</p>
<p>This article uses two case studies to provide insight into the current debate around the sustainability of EB. If EB <italic>was</italic> ever a better way of working, have the last two decades proven this to be the case? With pressure building for another round of workplace reform, is it true that greater flexibility of bargaining is required to increase productivity or improve workplace relations? If centralised bargaining is not flexible enough for enterprise needs, and EB is too disruptive and provides little in return, what is next?</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, there have been many studies of EB. The majority of published studies examine the outcomes and terms of bargaining, including pay and non-wage conditions. It makes intuitive sense that studies would examine wage and conditions outcomes across enterprises in the same industry (Buultjens and Cairncross, 2001), the differences between enterprise agreements and awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465533">Knox, 2009</xref>), and the ability of EB to deliver innovative employment arrangements (Whitehouse, 2001). In the research, the process and consequences of EB have been neglected, even though this was one of the issues raised by those who suggested that the case for EB was oversold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612465533">Rimmer and Watts, 1994</xref>). Briggs (2001) highlights the role of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in promoting the reform, but then indicates the danger of the new system for unions that lack the delegate structures or the workplace organisation to effectively participate in the bargaining process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Knox (2009)</xref> reviewed employer choices about bargaining in the luxury hotels sector. She found a preference for awards being driven by the greater certainty of outcomes and lower transaction costs, while EB was regarded as being uncertain in its outcomes and a relatively expensive option. We introduce two case studies to ask:

<list-item><p>Are the EB processes performed in such a way that EB contributes to organisational efficiency and productivity enhancement?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does EB have positive or negative consequences in the workplace?</p></list-item>
</list></p>

<sec id="sec2-0022185612465533"><title>Bargaining and Productivity</title>
<p>There is a wider debate around the link between trade unions and economic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612465533">Peetz, 2012</xref>) and industrial relations systems and economic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612465533">Calmfors and Driffill, 1988</xref>). In their discussion of the link between industrial relations systems, Australian industrial relations reforms and productivity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612465533">Burgess and Waring (2006)</xref> noted that missing from the discussion was an agreed concept of productivity and any unambiguous evidence linking productivity with industrial relations reforms, a notion further progressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Hancock (2012)</xref>. It has been largely an article of faith in the media and by business groups that productivity is an unambiguous concept with unambiguous estimates available and that it can be improved through decentralised (and individual) bargaining arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612465533">Australian Industry Group, 2005</xref>; Business Council of Australia, 2005). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612465533">Peetz (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612465533">2012</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Hancock (2012)</xref> have documented and dissected the evidence around the linkage, demonstrating it to be flawed and inconclusive.</p>
<p>In their review of the evidence of productivity gains and EB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612465533">Loundes et al. (2003)</xref> found not only that the outcomes were inconclusive, but also that the evidence itself was either incomplete or flawed. There are, in fact, many reasons why productivity grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185612465533">Hancock et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">2012</xref>). These include: investment in new plant and equipment; improvements in the quality of the workforce through knowledge and skills; growth in the economy (productivity grows as the economy grows since businesses are more effectively using their inputs); and infrastructure that supports production – roads, rail, communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612465533">Parham, 2003</xref>). Linked to these claims is the related assertion that wages should be determined by productivity, and this process will be facilitated by industrial relations legislative changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185612465533">Costello, 2005</xref>). Once again, the evidence suggests that the link between wages and productivity growth at the sectoral level is tenuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185612465533">Watts and Mitchell, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been a long debate around the impact of centralised versus decentralised bargaining arrangements on economic performance. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Jobs Study (2004) suggested that flexible labour market arrangements, including decentralised bargaining, would improve economic performance, notably, jobs growth and productivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612465533">Calmfors and Driffill (1988)</xref> suggested that it was either complete centralisation or complete decentralisation of wages determination that was linked to improved economic performance, including productivity. Research on the relationship between bargaining systems and macroeconomic performance by the OECD (1997) indicated that the evidence was inconclusive and that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185612465533">Traxler (2003)</xref> suggests, there was a need to consider intermediate linkages, including the degree of unionisation and the coordination of wage-setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612465533">Peetz (2006)</xref> outlined the lack of any systematic evidence supporting the link between industrial relations reforms and productivity in Australia and New Zealand, and, in particular, was very critical of the lack of evidence or the flawed evidence supplied by employer groups to justify such reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612465533">Peetz, 2006</xref>: 62–70). In their discussion of the impact of the Work Choices individual bargaining on productivity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185612465533">Burgess and Waring (2006)</xref> argued that the legislation, by permitting employers to reduce wages and conditions, especially for the relatively low paid, would encourage employers to pursue a cost-minimisation strategy in which employers were unlikely to invest in firm-specific training or upgrade their capital stock. This particular cost-reduction approach provides incentives for low-wage and low-skill employment and an increase in the labour intensity of production, and may potentially reduce productivity growth in the long term (Lowe, 1996).</p>
<p>In contrast to the 2000s, Australia’s productivity record was impressive for the 1990s. Since this period coincided with the shift towards EB, it followed that bargaining arrangements could have had an impact on productivity performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612465533">Parham (2003)</xref> suggested that improved labour productivity growth came as a result of firms using labour more intensively, rather than as a result of increased investment. This is also consistent with the analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612465533">Buchanan (2004)</xref>, who suggested that the industrial relations reforms of the 1990s led to ‘more intensive use of labour in the production process in a climate of chronic understaffing’. These gains are largely one-off and are associated with work intensification, longer hours and the elimination of overtime and penalty rates. This is because ‘productivity bargaining’ and the ‘flexible’ deployment of labour permitted firms to utilise existing workers more intensively, for example, by extending working time. Recent reviews of the evidence of the relationship between productivity changes and industrial relations over the 1990s by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612465533">Peetz (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185612465533">Hancock et al. (2007</xref>) and Hancock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">2012</xref>) found that while there was evidence of productivity growth, there was no evidence that this was related to industrial relations changes or EB.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022185612465533">Wooden (2001)</xref> argued that EB could increase productivity by way of the following processes: through firms being able to operate more efficiently; and <italic>through workplace relations becoming more cooperative</italic>. Whether bargaining improves efficiency is debatable, and whether any gains could not be achieved under other bargaining arrangements is also debatable. Finally, the rhetoric that has surrounded industrial relations reforms and EB has tended to place an unrealistic expectation that workplace productivity will be improved as a result of particular bargaining arrangements.</p>
<p>There is a lacuna around the bargaining process and consequences of EB. There are few studies that investigate the process of bargaining and examine strategies and factors that influence the bargaining process. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Knox (2009)</xref> examined employer strategies and preferences, not much is known about union strategies and preferences. Agreements have a set life of usually three years, so the bargaining process is a recurring one; of interest is the extent to which bargaining is built upon and developed, or whether it starts from a ‘clean slate’ every three years. We use two case studies of bargaining in different industries to examine these issues. Our research reveals a certain fatigue and some reluctance to participate with EB from managers, employees and delegates. The study provides insights into the bargaining process, identifies the factors behind bargaining, and raises questions about the ability of the parties to maintain the support and the resources for bargaining in its present form.</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, we provide a review of the case offered for EB and the empirical research on bargaining. This is followed by an introduction of our two case study sites: one manufacturing firm and one hotel. An explanation of the research methods follows. The article will then evaluate the processes and the consequences of bargaining at our two case study sites. The final section provides a discussion of our findings and draws some conclusions for the future of EB in Australia.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0022185612465533"><title>The Case for Enterprise Bargaining</title>
<p>The path to EB and the various legislative developments associated with it has previously been catalogued by a number of authors, including McDonald et al. (2001), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185612465533">Bray et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465533">the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training (ACIRRT) (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185612465533">Wailes and Lansbury (1997)</xref>. The arguments in support came from employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185612465533">Thornthwaite and Sheldon, 2012</xref>), trade unions, business and the government (Briggs, 2001). While the motivations and the arguments were very different (McDonald et al., 2001), the message was clear: the actors felt that the Australian industrial relations system was too centralised, was in need of modernisation and that a different (and more cooperative) approach to industrial relations was required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465533">ACIRRT, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, there were many critiques from business groups that were advocating more market-based policies across the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465533">Blain, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185612465533">Sloan, 1993</xref>) and the need to make bargaining more responsive to the needs of business. However, the push was not all employer-led. Briggs (2001) shows how the tensions within the union movement and between the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) were important in moving away from the centralised Prices and Incomes Accord towards a system that allowed stronger affiliates the potential to claim higher wages.</p>
<p>Within the media, the BCA played a very active role in lobbying for a fundamental restructuring of the industrial relations system. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185612465533">BCA’s (1989)</xref> blueprint for change, ‘Enterprise based bargaining units: A better way of working’, set the agenda, despite criticism over its research and assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185612465533">Frenkel and Peetz, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185612465533">Taylor (1990)</xref> presents their platform as the technocratic and corporate option for a decentralised industrial relations system based on direct bargaining and linked to productivity improvements at the workplace level. There was additional strong support from economists for direct and decentralised bargaining, with claims that it would lift productivity and growth at the enterprise level and across the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185612465533">Sloan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185612465533">Wooden, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185612465533">Niland (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185612465533">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465533">1990</xref>) was another supporter of decentralised bargaining. He saw the process as an essential component of modernising the industrial relations system and allocating more responsibility to workplace agents in the bargaining process. These principles were set out in the review of the New South Wales (NSW) industrial relations system by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612465533">Niland (1989)</xref>. In his 1990 address at the University of Melbourne, Niland stated that there was a need to develop the supporting infrastructure for what he called the devolution of the industrial relations system: the recommendations included the provision of enterprise-based bargaining units and a floor of minimum conditions. For Niland, the shift to an enterprise focus was in tune with the modernising and economic reforms that were developed around the Accord. He opposed the deregulation of the system; indeed, he suggested new and better regulations. He also suggested that the enterprise-based focus would provide more responsibility for line managers to work effectively with employees and would remove the centrality of industrial relations/human resource managers and employer associations from the bargaining process. This was an essential component of the devolution approach linked to enterprise bargaining.</p>
<p>In an early review of EB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465533">ACIRRT (1999</xref>: 44) stated that: ‘It is clear that a lot of the early agreements set out an ambitious agenda for change. It was an agenda that many organisations soon realised could not be easily implemented.’ ACIRRT then went on to demonstrate from the content of enterprise agreements that the scope and content of agreements appeared similar and covered core issues – wages and hours. They also noted that some issues were rarely mentioned in agreements, such as homeworking, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), quality assurance and profit-sharing.</p>
<p>Given the sporadic research on EB over the last decade, it is opportune to revisit bargaining and the experiences of workplaces where bargaining is taking place. Since the formalisation of a decentralised bargaining agenda, albeit with permutations and different regulatory contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185612465533">Sappey et al., 2006</xref>), the case for EB has been questioned at a number of levels. The outcomes were different from those promised, with an absence of innovation and high-performance work practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612465533">Morris, 1996</xref>); the absence of equity clauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185612465533">Strachan et al., 2007</xref>); an absence of detail around clauses linked to training and staff development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185612465533">Teicher and Grauze, 1996</xref>); and the diminution in terms and conditions of employment for some workers, especially though the individual bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185612465533">Van Barnveld, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This highlighted a concern that the bargaining stream effectively delivered for those with market power, yet for those without market power there was a reliance on award and safety net conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465533">ACIRRT, 1999</xref>) to access improvements in pay and benefits. Moreover, there is an implied expectation that the gap between those inside and outside of the bargaining system would widen. This may simply be inevitable with EB – if awards remain a safety net based on what the weakest can afford, EB allows the strongest to thrive.</p>
<p>The issues of resource and time costs, and the lack of expertise, are problems that have been identified by both employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Knox, 2009</xref>) and unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612465533">Burgess and Waring, 2006</xref>). Awards and industry bargaining allow for economies of scale and lower transaction costs in bargaining for all parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Knox, 2009</xref>). In the early days of EB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612465533">Rimmer and Watts (1994)</xref> highlighted the absence of active bargaining; the large presence of ‘add-ons’ in enterprise agreements (using awards as the basis of an agreement and modifying these); the lack of time and expertise of union delegates; and the absence of workplace managers with the skills and experience to bargain.</p>
<p>This leads to the issue of trade union relevance in a bargaining framework. Briggs (2001) suggested that unions underestimated the resources and infrastructure required for effective bargaining, with the result that bargaining became an employer-led exercise in reducing labour costs. In theory, bargaining brings unions in direct contact with their membership and heightens their potential presence and relevance. However, apart from the resource costs, unions may be forced to defend conditions (concession bargaining) and the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465533">ACIRRT, 1999</xref>). A key question is whether the bargaining framework enhances managerial prerogatives and forces unions to defend conditions, as opposed to developing innovative employment conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465533">Fells, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Knox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612465533">Peetz, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>There has also been a tendency to review bargaining from the macro evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612465533">Loundes et al., 2003</xref>) and to examine the details of enterprise agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465533">ACIRRT, 1999</xref>; Mortimer and O'Neill, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185612465533">White et al., 2003</xref>), looking at the outcomes as opposed to examining the process or other consequences. Case studies that examine the process of bargaining and the views of the participants in the bargaining process are relatively rare (for notable exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465533">Fells, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465533">Knox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612465533">Rimmer and Watts, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185612465533">Scott Ladd, 2003</xref>), although such studies can allow us to examine some of the key dimensions of bargaining that are inevitably missed in macro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612465533">Bray et al., 2005</xref>: 267).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185612465533"><title>The Case Studies and the Research Methods</title>
<p>The research examines the experience of managers and employees with EB at two workplaces. The case studies are of a regional manufacturing plant we refer to as ‘The Manufacturer’ and a luxury hotel we refer to as ‘The Hotel’. The Manufacturer employs over 450 workers, largely in the trades occupations. The Hotel employs over 300 workers (150 Full Time Equivalent) across a number of traditional service occupations. The employees at The Manufacturer are male and full-time ongoing employees. The employment numbers are linked to contract cycles: if tenders are secured, then there is employment continuity and increasing employment numbers; if tenders are not secured, then employment declines. At The Hotel, the majority of employees are part-time and casual, and employment numbers are seasonal. Each form part of a larger organisation with sites both within Australia and internationally.</p>
<p>The bargaining is performed at the workplace level, rather than at the organisational level. These are selective cases and not representative of the experience of other workplaces in the same organisation or sector. However, the case studies allow us to gather data linked to views, experience and interpretations of bargaining by the key actors. We are not looking at the content or outcomes of bargaining in material terms, but rather, the process and consequences of bargaining. This provides the opportunity to consider issues around the process leading up to and following an agreement. The Manufacturer has a high trade union density of around 80% in three unions, while The Hotel has a much lower density of around 15%.</p>
<p>The Manufacturer was heading into its fifth round of enterprise bargaining, and The Hotel had recently ratified its second agreement. In both workplaces, previous bargaining experiences had cast a shadow over the current process, for example: at The Manufacturer, there was a three-week-long strike associated with bargaining in 2003; and at The Hotel, employees rejected the 2007 agreement and it took nearly 24 months to have a new agreement accepted and ratified.</p>
<p>At each workplace there were interviews with senior managers, middle managers (including HR), union delegates and operational-level employees. The interviews lasted for between 50 minutes and an hour and were recorded, transcribed and coded in NVivo. Coding was based on a number of a priori nodes that related to EB, partnerships and participation in decision-making. As interviews were being coded, the coding nodes were iteratively expanded to include sector- and case-specific matters and developing theoretical threads. In total, 19 interviews were conducted at The Manufacturer and 18 interviews at The Hotel. Interviews were semi-structured and linked to issues around workplace participation and communication, and to personal experiences with EB. Each interview was conducted by the same researcher throughout 2010. When EB was explicitly discussed, the respondents were asked to talk about their experience with EB. Consequently, much of the data from The Manufacturer refers to the upcoming round of bargaining in addition to experiences in recent rounds. At The Hotel, the data refers to the round of EB that was recently completed.</p>
<p>To supplement the interviews, the research team were observers in a number of various meetings held within the workplaces. These included team briefs, supervisor meetings, Head of Department meetings and staff focus groups. Finally, a range of corporate documents and records were provided by the management of each workplace to support the data collection and analysis. These documents included minutes of previous meetings, including Joint Consultative Committees and presentations to staff.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0022185612465533"><title>Evaluating Enterprise Bargaining: Processes and Consequences</title>
<p>When we consider our research questions, there are two key factors to investigate: the process of bargaining and the consequences of bargaining. While some of our data refer to measures of productivity, we do not suggest that we have performed an economic analysis to allow definitive measures of productivity within this study. Rather, when our participants have perceptions or data on productivity performance, we report as thus.</p>
<p>In both organisations, EB was viewed as a ritual; as a process that was to be undertaken every three years, which entailed a flurry of activity that would occur over a number of months. At The Manufacturer, the union representatives and management held two ‘pre-bargaining meetings’ in the two months leading up to the formal bargaining process that set out the ‘rules of engagement’. Throughout the formal bargaining process, weekly meetings were held until such time as an agreement had been reached. At The Hotel, meetings were intended to be held on a monthly basis, although this became a point of contention for the management team. The problem with monthly meetings began when there was a change in union organiser and the managers felt that they were forced to start the process from the beginning. According to managers and staff, there were three union organisers involved throughout the bargaining process.</p>
<p>The working relationships between senior management and employees would deteriorate leading up to and throughout the period:
<disp-quote>
<p>…we are getting on good at the moment, but I can see that getting worse over the next few months, because we’ve got an EBA [Enterprise Bargaining Agreement] coming up. So the whole attitude of everyone will change now over the next six months … It will be a split soon and then it will be us and them and we will be all arguing and, that’ll happen, it happens every time. Whenever the EBA pops up. (Employee, The Manufacturer)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Senior managers felt that the costs associated with reaching an agreement and eliciting productivity gains were not achievable through negotiations:
<disp-quote>
<p>…we’ve done the cost calculations, being a manufacturing facility we measure time …  we know how much time is lost and the productivity gains we get out of the EBAs in my opinion, this is my personal opinion not the company’s position, is that it is not that easy to get productivity gains out of EBAs. (Manager, The Manufacturer)</p>
<p>…the increase in productivity, that’s a fallacy, there’s no increase in productivity, everyone talks about increase in productivity, even the union talked about it, but when you say ‘Alright what are you going to give me?’, does that mean housekeeping is going to do an extra room, or we are going to go from 32 minutes a room to 31 minutes a room, oh no. You know when you actually put it on the table they are not interested. (Manager, The Hotel)</p></disp-quote>All parties suggested that bargaining involved substantial resources, a major time commitment and preparation. For employees, this often involved attending special training programmes and being involved in consultation with managers and other employees. The participants saw it as a long and protracted process, but one that was necessary in order to achieve an acceptable degree of consultation and an agreement:
<disp-quote>
<p>We [the union delegates] give out information sheets and inform everybody what is going on and ask for participation in forming a log of claims. We give out survey sheets, anybody got any ideas, we basically know what we are going to go for but you go through the motions and keep conditions etcetera so we have already started that as well as asking for nominations for the Committee … The last EBA was something like 10 months before it was finalised. Eight months before we actually agreed and then it went to the Commission for ratification and that took another two months. (Delegate, The Manufacturer)</p>
<p>Because I had never been involved in any Enterprise Agreements before, you felt ‘Well, no, this is what we want’ and then you go back to your team members and explain to them, and ask them ‘What do you want?’ and are they happy with this or that, it was nearly a whole year. Every week at first and then once a fortnight. (Delegate, The Hotel)</p></disp-quote>In both cases, the key role of managers and the need for systematic preparation and consultation was highlighted as being important components of the process. In both cases, managers spoke to staff in large group meetings and at smaller department- or work group-level meetings about the agreement. There was written communication from managers to all staff and minutes of bargaining meetings left in canteen areas for staff to peruse. At The Hotel, the perception was that the middle managers ‘failed to sell’ the corporate message to the staff – the message to accept and vote for the agreement. However, at The Manufacturer, employees and delegates clearly saw the general manager as a key mediator in the conflict that arises throughout the bargaining process:<disp-quote>
<p>Probably one person here as far as being approachable, is [the manager] … if you had a manager here that wasn’t prepared to see you at fairly short notice and discuss things, like I believe things could probably escalate and start getting out of hand. I think myself and most of the delegates on the floor you can feel that it has got the potential to grow a bit you know. ‘Let’s go and have a talk about it and see what can be done’, and most times we come out with a pretty good result. Everyone walks away happy and you’ve nipped it in the bud before it all happens. That comes down to the approach of the manager making his time available. (Delegate, The Manufacturer)</p>
<p>I wouldn’t replace [the manager] to start with, he is actually a very good mediator …  and is probably one that stops a lot of conflict before it happens … there’s going to be some butting heads, there’s got to be some give, and I know [the manager] does give, he bends over backwards on a lot of issues to try and make people happy. (Employee, The Manufacturer)</p></disp-quote>When speaking of the failure of the first vote (in 2007) on the EBA at The Hotel, one manager stated:<disp-quote>
<p>… it wasn’t even close, it was an overwhelming thing … I have been through this many, many times and the first mistake we made was when we were presenting, you know, our proposal to the staff, it was myself and the previous Director of HR, and um the reason we did that we thought it was important that people heard it from the top, terms and conditions, we wanted them to know that this was serious, actually in hindsight that was a real mistake. They want to hear it from, if you are a room attendant, they wanted to hear it from the head housekeeper, who they work for, who they trust, who is going to tell them this is a good idea guys. (Manager, The Hotel)</p></disp-quote>Importantly, this indicates some problems with representation if managers are seen to be the source of the information for employees about a new agreement, not the union. This will be discussed later when we consider the consequences of bargaining at The Hotel. Returning to the flawed strategy of senior management communicating the message, employees concur that this strategy was flawed, for example:<disp-quote>
<p>That also put the emphasis on the managers having to know and understand it, whereas the first time round, a few of them were a bit lazy and ‘Oh I’m not going to worry about it, it is the GM [General Manager] and HR role, I don’t need to know’, and then since they don’t know it, they don’t then push and encourage their team, but when they do know it, they are always talking to their team about it. (Employee rep, The Hotel)</p></disp-quote>The managers see their role as informing the employees of what the agreement contains and persuading them to vote for it. As we will see in the next section, the union also plays a role in informing employees. Throughout this section, we have seen that the processes involved in EB remain costly and time-consuming. We must turn our attention to the consequences of bargaining to see if the process failings are compensated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612465533"><title>The Consequences of Bargaining</title>
<p>Both employees and managers in each organisation noted that there were generally good, trusting relationships between the parties on an ongoing basis; however, this was punctured by a breakdown in trust and a disruption in workplace relationships leading up to and throughout the bargaining periods. This was particularly heightened if the bargaining led to industrial action, was unsettled or was prolonged:<disp-quote>
<p>[In an earlier EB period] we ended up out on the footpath over here for nearly three weeks, thrashing it out and I can’t see if that can do very good for relationships. No, the guys go back to work and knew that they had lost about $2500 in pay, just to squeeze an extra 1% pay rise out in the end or something. (Employee, The Manufacturer)</p>
<p>There’s this, ‘Now I’m not really sure whether I will trust you’s again’, that sort of thing and it takes a while to die back down again. (Line manager, The Manufacturer)</p>
<p>… it definitely takes a few months to get that level of trust and communication lines back in place again. (Line manager, The Manufacturer)</p></disp-quote>The history of previous agreements lingers in the minds of the parties when the time comes for negotiating new agreements. There was also an admission that absenteeism and leave increased around the time of bargaining at The Manufacturer:<disp-quote>
<p>You will find there is more sick leave, you know, there is more reportable injuries, there will be reports for all little innocuous types of injuries, now whether they are actually physically there or not you don’t know, but they are reported as … After the bargaining period, things generally take up to two or three months to settle back down as well, because everyone has still got their hangover from the agreement. (Line manager, The Manufacturer)</p></disp-quote>In The Hotel, managers were at a loss to understand why employees did not simply vote for the first agreement in the last EB round:<disp-quote>
<p>We had to really analyse what went wrong, we did focus groups, we did all kinds of stuff to understand what went wrong and a lot of it wasn’t, ah you know the most common theme was they didn’t want to commit, they didn’t want the change and all [the union] said was ‘No we will get you something better’, and that is all they ever say, so anyway then we spend nine months communicating ad nauseum, we went to Fair Work Australia on four occasions and the best part about it was that actually the guys who were involved saw the incompetence of the union, they saw the revolving door of representatives, they saw the, ah, ridiculous tactics that were tried. However, it took us 11 months. (Manager, The Hotel)</p></disp-quote>The annual employee engagement survey results at The Hotel suffered as a result of the EB process according to the HR manager:<disp-quote>
<p>… a lot had to do with our EA [Enterprise Agreement] not going through and people not getting an increase for more than two years, you know it is a long time and they were fed up with the EA bargaining process that it stalled, and where we did our engagement survey, we did that early this year, the results were not engaging, but … for two years, nothing was happening, all gets to you. (HR manager, The Hotel)</p></disp-quote>There is little question from the employees’ perspective that the long drawn-out process of bargaining left many of them jaded, not just with the bargaining, but with their employment in more general terms.</p>
<p>One of the positives from the bargaining process was that it spawned a process of consultation and participation that was largely absent away from the bargaining period. It also developed employee involvement and cooperation. This is an important contradiction in the bargaining process: there is evidence of deteriorating relationships at the same time as evidence of improved employee involvement:<disp-quote>
<p>[You] are working and then you stop and you rely on other people as well to do your job rather than at the table, and that is one thing if you don’t have that support system with your team members and other supervisors and that then you are not going to be able to do it properly, because you’re just thinking ‘I’m here and I’ve got all this work to do’ but in that sense I had the support. People just taking over my job while I am in there for the hour. (Employee rep, The Hotel)</p>
<p>It’s good because, like, each department have their own representative and people are like, I represent the laundry department and I report to them what is going on every meeting and then I ask them for feedback, what they want changed, and we discuss it in the meeting. So the agreement has been changed, because at first the agreement was like, nobody likes the first agreement because they just gave us on the table that this is the conditions, right, and nobody liked the conditions, so we had this representative who asked the people what they want. (Employee rep, The Hotel)</p>
<p>You [the employees] probably read it [minutes of the bargaining meeting], well I don’t say they read it all, definitely at EBA time you would definitely be reading it because at EBA time there is feedback and all that, on how things are going. But that is probably the only time. (Employee, The Manufacturer)</p></disp-quote>For trade unions, there were mixed messages emerging from the interviews. The management of The Hotel had a lingering hostility to the union as a result of a previous agreement having been rejected by employees. This agreement was largely written by management and involved limited consultation with the union representatives. The perception was that unions were active around the time of bargaining, but largely absent in the times in between agreements. In the previous section, we discussed the role of the union in the process of bargaining. A small number of employees saw the unions positively in terms of their participation, representation and training activities; others saw them as disruptive and opportunistic:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the union, I have got a whole view of the union in terms of incompetence ah, just some of their tactics were a disgrace, they have absolutely no interest in the team members in this hotel, and in terms of a representative, they are a disgrace. (Manager, The Hotel)</p>
<p>… all of a sudden they [the union rep] would be gone, and he would be off somewhere else and they would get somebody else in, and then the last person we had in didn’t have enough of an idea of what was happening … because he hadn’t been to any of the meetings, and then he is sort of thrown in the deep end, he has one meeting and this is what the union is looking at what they are suggesting in the agreement and then more or less he was there and it was more or less over, so it was a bit unstable in that way, in the sense that we were having too many different people from the union, they would stay ‘So long’ and then they would send somebody else in. (Employee, The Hotel)</p>
<p>The union didn’t contribute that much to solving some of the issues … our team of the committee that formed, I think they did quite a lot of the bargaining and things like that more so than the union I think. (Employee, The Hotel)</p>
<p>I’ve spoken to other people since the enterprise agreement has finished, some actually sort of joined the union I think it was on the proviso that if the union got us what we wanted, then they would start paying union fees, but I know a couple of people that sort of signed that, have decided no they haven’t done anything for them and so no they are not going to keep paying the union. (Employee, The Hotel)</p></disp-quote>Not surprisingly, though, given the nature of manufacturing being a more unionised sector, many employees hold a more positive perception of the role the union plays, even if some do feel the union is only present at EB time. This is despite a well-established delegate system of the shop floor:<disp-quote>
<p>it makes people happy to be part of a union and they feel safer in their job, they are going to work better and I guess that is something that has actually helped them out a little bit too. They’ve got with the agreements of the unions that have been made over the years with the EB and redundancies and things like that, and payments, it has actually made their job a little more secure …  [then] they are more likely to be a bit more content and happy and more productive. (Employee, The Manufacturer)</p>
<p>I can’t remember when we had the last union meeting. That’s probably a good sign that everything is going well in the works, because a few years ago, the guys would want to go out on strike every time some silly incident occurred. You don’t get that anymore. Those days are pretty well gone. Between our EB Agreements and that, we don’t have many union meetings as a group anymore, no very few. (Employee, The Manufacturer)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612465533"><title>Discussion, Limitations and Conclusions</title>
<p>In each of our cases, bargaining was viewed as a necessary and inevitable process. By the time this research was performed, senior management had changed in each organisation at least twice since EB has begun. Consequently, viewing bargaining as necessary and inevitable was simply because it was part of what occurred within the organisation. There was a resigned inevitability about an approaching round of bargaining mixed with some anxiety over the process and the consequences. EB was seen as a chore, time-consuming and costly in each workplace. However, on the positive side, it was associated with increased participation, consultation and communication at each workplace. Trade unions were seen to be more active and engaged around bargaining time; however, if the bargaining was prolonged or the process resulted in strikes and disruption, it tended to undermine trust and cooperation, which was sustained for subsequent bargaining rounds.</p>
<p>Delegates and employee representatives mostly enjoyed their participation and their contribution, with the additional responsibility and the support they received from fellow employees and line managers being important. Importantly, the management of both organisations did not perceive any positive productivity effects flowing from bargaining.</p>
<p>In terms of our first research question, our two case studies reveal that EB is long and costly – certainly not efficient – and, furthermore, perceptions are that it does not lead to productivity gains. Our second question asks whether EB has positive or negative consequences, and we find an interesting contradiction. The process is potentially damaging of relationships between employers and employees; however, there are also positive aspects of bargaining around engagement, participation and communication. This is worthy of further investigation. The temporal dimension of case study research, however, fails to allow comment about the extent to which these benefits remain once an agreement is negotiated. What we can say in these cases, though, is that for trade unions, bargaining gives them relevance and presence; however, this also diminishes in between bargaining rounds.</p>
<p>We are modest in the conclusions that can be drawn from the two case studies and would suggest further research to uncover whether similar patterns emerge among a broader sample of organisations. These patterns might be of frustrations with what the process of EB requires, and the unintended consequences of the bargaining experience. Legislative changes throughout the decades have provided employers with more choice over their wage-fixation strategies and unions are facing increasing pressures on their bargaining resources, similar to that noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612465533">Rimmer and Watts (1994)</xref> almost 20 years prior and far from the mutual understanding and cooperative benefits that were espoused by the early advocates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612465533">Niland, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465533">1990</xref>). Should the evidence presented from our two cases be reflective of a wider experience of Australian workplaces, we would argue that the system of EB is not sustainable. Within the neoliberal context of modern capitalism, employers will grow increasingly hesitant to engage in a process that demonstrates little ‘value-added’. This must be considered in light of the Fair Work Act’s introduction of ‘good faith bargaining’, as discussed recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612465533">Caspersz et al. (2011)</xref>. Good faith bargaining is not tantamount to positive results for all involved parties.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is that we have not included data from interviews with the relevant union officials – that is, those employed by the union rather than employees in delegate roles. While we interviewed senior union officials for each relevant union, we felt that the distance that these officials held from our case study sites means that their views on EB were at a more macro level and less concerned with individual case outcomes, so we have set aside their data. We do acknowledge that the various possible views from unions would be a critical component of any debate about EB and encourage further research specifically targeted at this area.</p>
<p>We are sure that research can uncover cases where EB operates effectively for all parties involved. Our evidence, tempered with the limitations of a two case study project, raises an important policy question for the industrial relations sector within Australia: Is there adequate training and resources to prepare the individuals involved in EB? Again, further research is required to understand what role training and skill development can play in the ongoing sustainability of this system.</p>
