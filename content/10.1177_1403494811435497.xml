<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: Admission to disability pension (DP) in Norway, like most other countries, requires a medical condition as the main cause of income reduction. Still, a widespread assumption is that much of the recruitment to the programme is rather due to non-medical, mainly labour market factors. In this article, we study the grey zones between acceptance and rejection of DP applications, in light of the concept of marginalisation. <italic>Methods</italic>: From the total Norwegian population, aged 18–66 in 1998, we included all first-time applications for DP between 1998 and 2004. Logistic regressions of both application and application outcome were then performed, controlling for a range of socioeconomic variables and medical diagnosis. <italic>Results</italic>: Medical diagnosis had the strongest impact on application outcome, together with the applicant’s age. High rejection risk was found among applicants with complex musculoskeletal diagnoses, and also for complex psychiatric diagnoses as compared to well-defined ones. Persons having previously received social assistance more often applied for a DP and more often were rejected. The same is true, though on a lesser scale, for people with a weak affiliation to the labour market. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>:</bold> <bold>The DP programme in Norway is to a large degree medically oriented, not only judicially but also in practice. Nevertheless, non-medical factors have a bearing on both application rates and application outcome. The control system seems to work in a way that excludes the most marginalised applicants, thus possibly contributing to further marginalisation of already disadvantaged groups.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Disability pension (DP) is one of the costliest benefit schemes in modern welfare states and at the same time perhaps the most difficult to administer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435497">1</xref>]. Given the lack of self-evident criteria to delimit “true disability” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435497">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435497">3</xref>], it has been argued that decisions regarding DP eligibility are characterised by limited reliability and limited justice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435497">4</xref>]. Thus it is important to gain more knowledge about the outcome of such decisions.</p>
<p>In an international perspective, Norway has long been marked by high DP inflow rates, combined with quite few rejections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435497">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435497">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435497">6</xref>]. The rejection rate has tended to increase over time, however, ranging from below 10% in the late 1980s to above 20% in the new millennium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435497">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435497">8</xref>]. This tendency may be seen as a consequence of long-term political efforts aimed at limiting the number of new beneficiaries and strengthening the so-called “work line” in the welfare politics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435497">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Admission to DP in Norway, like most other countries, requires a permanent medical condition as the main cause of income reduction. Social problems and unemployment are not accepted as causes, while complex medical conditions constitute a “grey zone” of difficult cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435497">9</xref>]. In spite of the intentionally sharp demarcation against mere unemployment as a path into DP, the Norwegian regulations do not contain any specific requirements regarding previous work history. In cases where this demarcation line is relevant, the applicant’s situation must be comprehensively assessed, with the use of professional discretion.</p>
<p>It is formally required that appropriate medical treatment and adequate work-related rehabilitation has been carried out, but also this aspect of an application is usually object to discretional consideration.</p>
<p>When all other options are exhausted, and the earnings capacity is still reduced by at least 50%, an application for DP may be filed to the National Insurance administration. Here, a body of processing officers, with guidance from medical experts, decide who are entitled to DP and who are not.</p>
<p>Studies in Norway have shown that women and younger applicants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435497">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435497">11</xref>] and persons with scarce economic resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435497">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435497">13</xref>], a weak affiliation to the labour market, and complex medical diagnoses more often are rejected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435497">14</xref>]. From a Swedish study it was reported that most rejected applicants were in fact in bad health, but their general life situation made DP entrance difficult, mostly due to unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435497">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435497">16</xref>]. A similar observation was made in the USA, where over 50% of rejected cases reported to be incapable of doing any work at all, and a comparison between rejected and granted applicants showed health differences to be small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811435497">17</xref>].</p>
<p>All in all these studies suggest that what we will label “marginalised” applicants run a greater risk of rejection. Marginalisation may be defined as being in an undesirable state of partial participation in one or more areas of society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435497">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435497">19</xref>]. To be marginalised, e.g. in the labour market, means being in an intermediate position between inclusion and full exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435497">20</xref>]. For marginalised persons, DP may be seen as a shelter from social insecurity – thus giving rise to potentially unjustified applications. On the other hand, marginalisation in itself may become a reason for rejection, as it provides the applicant with a possible credibility problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435497">21</xref>] and may be read as a signal that the applicant’s problems are chiefly non-medical.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494811435497">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>This article analyses variance in DP rejection risk in Norway according to both medical and non-medical factors. We focus especially on previous work history, socioeconomic status, and medical diagnoses. A new way of grouping diagnoses in social security research is tried out.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494811435497" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>“FD-Trygd” is a database from Statistics Norway containing basic demographic data linked with information from the National Insurance administration about all social security payouts from 1992 onwards, without missing cases. The database also contains data on rejected DP applications, which has not been much used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435497">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435497">13</xref>].</p>
<p>In Norway, DP is potentially available in the age range 18–67. Because of the right to old age pension from age 67, we excluded all persons that reached 67 during 1998. We then included all persons aged 18–66 years in 1998, living in the country during 1995–2004, and not receiving DP by 1/1/98. People who died or emigrated during the observation period were censored. Immigrants were also excluded, because the relationship between immigration and welfare usage is highly complex and would call for a more specific analysis.</p>
<p>We observed all first-time applications for DP between 1998 and 2004, and whether or not the application was rejected. Rejected applicants may appeal and get a second assessment, but in the present study we focus on first-time applications only, as our main goal was to establish how the outer gate of the control system works.</p>
<p>Two parallel analyses were then performed: one regarding the act of applying, the other regarding the risk of rejection. As dates of application were unsatisfactory, date of decision was used.</p>
<p>In addition to the variables listed below, both age (categorical) and year of decision were controlled for. The latter variable was excluded from the tables, to keep the presentation as simple as possible. In initial analyses we also included a variable for vocational rehabilitation, which is a formal requirement for DP. However, as we did not have such data for the whole period and because this variable did not produce any significant effect for selected years, we chose to exclude it from our final models.</p>
<sec id="section4-1403494811435497">
<title>Diagnoses</title>
<p>Primary diagnosis on the medical certificate was coded according to ICD-10 and grouped into “psychiatric”, “musculoskeletal”, and “others”. The first two categories were further divided into “complex” and “well-defined” conditions, according to a subtle line that we think exists in the minds of both politicians and National Insurance officers. This is the line between more or less “clear cut” or “proper” health problems and conditions that are characterized by less clarity with respect to both verifiability and description. We do not claim that this line actually exists in the real world, merely that it exists on a symbolic level and as such gives rise to potentially differential assessments regarding DP eligibility.</p>
<p>The classifications were done with a high degree of medical discretion. The special case of alcohol and drug disorders was singled out as a category of its own. We also included records with missing information on diagnosis, giving in total the following seven groups:</p>
<list id="list1-1403494811435497" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Well-defined psychiatric diagnoses are organic mental disorders, psychoses, mood affective disorders, mental retardation, disorders of psychological development, and some other related conditions (F00–F09; F20–F31; F33–F39; F50; F70–F98).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complex psychiatric diagnoses are depressive episodes, neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders, behavioural syndromes, and personality disorders and similar (F32; F40–F49; F51–F69; F99).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Drug and alcohol disorders are mental and somatic conditions related to alcohol abuse and all drug diagnoses (F10–F19).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Well-defined musculoskeletal diagnoses are arthropathies, systemic connective tissue disorders, dorsopathies, spondylopathies, osteopathies, and chondropathies (M00–M21; M30–M47; M49; M60–M61; M80–M94).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Complex musculoskeletal diagnoses are soft tissue disorders like myalgia, fibromyalgia, tenosynovitis, low back pain and similar, and some selected other disorders (M22–M25; M48; M50–M54; M62–M79; M95–M99).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other diagnoses are comprised of all other diagnoses, most of them regarded as well-defined conditions (A00–B99; C00–D48; D50–D89; E00–E90; G00–G99; H00–H59; H60–H95; I00–I99; J00–J99; K00–K93; L00–L99; N00–N99; O00–O08; P00–P96; Q00–Q99; R00–R99; S00–T98; V00–V99).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Missing records are records without diagnosis information.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494811435497">
<title>Education</title>
<p>Length of education obtained before 1 October 2000 was noted and grouped into four categories. A few cases with missing information were also included in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494811435497">
<title>Income</title>
<p>Data on all taxable income (including social security benefits, but not social assistance) was used. In the analysis of rejections, income was measured as all taxable income during the last 3 years prior to the year of decision. In the analysis of application rates, income from the years 1995–97 was used. In both cases, yearly amounts were summarised and quartilised. A fifth category was used for those with no taxable income, consisting potentially of people living off social assistance, personal savings, or some kind of private financial support (e.g. housewives).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494811435497">
<title>Work affiliation</title>
<p>This is our first index of marginalisation, in relation to the labour market. From a register of individual employment spells, an index was constructed based on total number of days in employment or self-employment during the last 6 years before the year of decision. Five categories were defined according to average yearly months in work during this period: (i) Stable: persons working at least 11 months a year throughout the period; (ii) weaker: persons working between 6 and 11 months a year; (iii) marginal: persons working less than 6 months yearly; (iv) none: persons with no work affiliation; and (v) missing records.</p>
<p>For the analysis of application rates, we used a similar index based on work records for the years 1992–97.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494811435497">
<title>Social assistance</title>
<p>This second index of marginalisation is based on previous social assistance (SA) receipt. SA is a means-tested income security programme, which in Norway constitutes a minimum safety net for people outside the workforce who are ineligible for other kinds of income security, e.g. unemployment benefits or DP.</p>
<p>This variable primarily measures economic marginalisation, but may also be regarded as a more general measure of marginalisation, as SA recipients are often multifariously disadvantaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435497">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435497">23</xref>].</p>
<p>The index was based on monthly SA payments during the last 7 years (84 months), including the year of decision. The categories were: (i) none; (ii) some receipt: having received SA in at least 1–36 months; (iii) frequent receipt: having received SA in more than 36 months. For the application analyses, this index drew on SA receipt in the years 1992–98.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494811435497">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Logistic regressions were used to estimate odds of application and odds of rejection, adjusted for socioeconomic variables and diagnostic groups. The analysis of rejection risk was performed in three models: model 1: only adjusted for age and year of decision; model 2: adjusting also for socioeconomic variables; and model 3: adjusting for diagnostic groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section11-1403494811435497">
<title>Bivariate associations</title>
<p>Of all 2,318,417 persons aged 18–66 years in 1998 and living in Norway from 1995 through 2004, 9.2% females and 6.8% males applied for a DP between 1998 and 2004 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435497">Table I</xref>). As expected, application rates increased with increasing age. The fact that the oldest age group does not have the highest application rate is likely due to our strategy of sample delineation, which gives the oldest persons in the sample (aged 66 in 1998) fewer potential years to apply.</p>

<p>Application rates varied considerably across level of education, with the lowest educated applying approximately 10 times as often as the highest educated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435497">Table I</xref>). The variation across different income categories and different levels of work affiliation was less clear, with the exception of the small groups of people with missing work information and men with no income. People having previously received SA was found to have a distinctively high application rate.</p>
<p>Of all applicants, 21.1% females and 18.2% males were rejected. Rejection rates were particularly high among applicants below the age of 50, those with low income, a weak affiliation to the labour market or previous SA receipt (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435497">Table I</xref>). Highly educated applicants were less often rejected than low educated, but this difference was not nearly as huge as the difference in application rates.</p>
<p>Musculoskeletal and psychiatric diagnoses accounted for a majority of applications for both women and men (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435497">Table II</xref>). Within both categories, complex conditions were more prevalent than well-defined ones. Women more often had musculoskeletal diagnoses of both kinds, and also more often complex psychiatric diagnoses than men. A small minority had drug-related diagnoses, mostly men. All remaining diagnoses (mostly well-defined somatic conditions) accounted for 32% of the applications for women and 44% for men.</p>

Odds of application were high for people above 50 years, low education, and social assistance recipients. Also, men with a weak affiliation to the labour market applied more often than others.</p>
<p>Nearly a fifth of all applicants were rejected. Rejection risk was higher for applicants below the age of 50, women with a weak affiliation to the labour marked and men and women who received social assistance. Applicants with complex musculoskeletal conditions stood out with a clearly higher rejection risk, while the well-defined conditions (within both the musculoskeletal and psychiatric group) were less often rejected.</p>
<sec id="section14-1403494811435497">
<title>Data and methods</title>
<p>The strengths of the present study are that it comprises all inhabitants in Norway and all applications for DP during the period 1998–2004. Reliability of the data is good. One weakness is lack of data on occupation, which is highly relevant to early exit from work. It would have been desirable to have more information about the applicant’s health than is available in diagnoses.</p>
<p>For a fuller understanding of the processes in question, a qualitative research design would probably be of great potential. Still we believe that a quantitative approach with exhaustive data like ours offers an important mapping of a field of research that has previously not been much looked into.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1403494811435497">
<title>Socioeconomic factors</title>
<p>The strong correlation between low education and probability of application agrees with previous research regarding DP determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811435497">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435497">26</xref>]. Still, we do not find any strong effect of education with respect to the rejection risk.</p>
<p>SA recipients stand out with very high odds of application. These persons by definition have problems earning a living, thus making DP a potentially attractive prospect. On the other hand this finding may be explicable by the fact that SA recipients have much poorer health than the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435497">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435497">23</xref>]. We also find higher application odds among men with marginal work affiliation. This may mean that they tend to have poor health or that they are highly motivated for a disability pension which gives far more money than social assistance. Since we lack health measures on the population level, we cannot estimate which is the main reason for this association.</p>
<p>Both indicators of marginalisation also have a bearing on the risk of rejection, though to a varying degree across gender. Male SA recipients are turned down more often than their female counterparts, while the opposite is true for applicants with weak work affiliation.</p>
<p>Control for diagnosis does not eliminate these associations, thus weakening the hypothesis that marginalised applicants have less “proper” diagnoses. Instead it may be that the state of being marginalised in itself weakens the chances of getting a DP, possibly due to suspiciousness directed towards such applicants. The effect of previous work affiliation on the rejection risk is admittedly not huge. However, it may reflect the presence of a challenging grey zone where the treatment of certain groups of applicants may in fact represent a subtle kind of discrimination. The same is even more likely to be true with SA recipients, who constitute a rather stigmatised group in society in the first place. At the same time, we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed effects of work affiliation and SA receipt are in fact mere manifestations of a more-or-less legitimate demarcation policy that has the aim of securing that DP is not granted to people on the wrong basis.</p>
<p>In the end, it should be stressed that a quantitative study of this kind cannot give final answers to such difficult questions that are brought up here. Rather we hope that our findings may give rise to new and complementary research on this subject. We would especially welcome qualitative studies to explore the grey zones here touched upon in a more thorough manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1403494811435497">
<title>Medical factors</title>
<p>Our separation between complex and well-defined diagnoses seems to grasp the expected variance in a fairly satisfactory way. We find huge differences in rejection risk between complex and well-defined musculoskeletal diagnoses, while the corresponding difference within the psychiatric group is smaller, though in the expected direction.</p>
<p>Men with alcohol or drug-related diagnoses had the highest rejection risk. This is no surprise as these conditions are often regarded as deviant behaviour rather than disease. Also applicants with complex musculoskeletal diagnoses face a high rejection risk. Such conditions are often due to repetitive manual work or psychosocial strain. While these patients may have as low functional abilities as e.g. rheumatoid patients (well defined), they are on average regarded as less incapable of working by the National Insurance administration. This may in principle be quite accurate, but there is also the possibility that some complex health problems are being discriminated against.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Contrary to what sometimes seems to be the message, not all applications for DP in Norway automatically get approved. One in five is rejected. Among these, applicants with complex musculoskeletal disorders appear as the largest group. It has repeatedly been claimed that every attempt should be done to rehabilitate such patients back to work but results are often disappointing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435497">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494811435497">29</xref>]. It is therefore quite probable that many of these people do not return to work – as is previously found to be true for rejected applicants in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435497">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435497">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435497">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The DP control system in Norway seems to defend the programme against certain marginalised groups of applicants. While there is nothing in the admission rules that justifies turning down applicants due to a weak work affiliation or SA receipt, we find that both factors weaken one’s chances of obtaining a DP. These findings seem to imply that marginality in one area breeds marginality in another. Being in a weak position in the labour market weakens one’s position in the welfare state.</p>
