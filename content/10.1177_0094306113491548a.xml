<p>John R. Hall has long held a well-deserved reputation as one of the world’s leading authorities on a domain of the social that is commonly thought to register an anomalous manifestation of the “asynchronous.” I am referring, of course, to the surprising persistence and recurrence of communal groups that order their existence through an embrace of millenarian expectations or utopian dreams of transcendence, in jarring opposition to the prevailing currents of high modernity. In an illuminating series of historical ethnographies and comparative projects—highlighted by close study of several of the more notorious instances when worldview incongruities culminated in mass ritual suicides (People’s Temple at Jonestown, Heaven’s Gate, Order of the Solar Temple) or in the killing and arrest of group members by public authorities (Branch Davidians, Aum Shinrikyo)—Hall has sought to identify the socio-historical processes that account for the emergence of these types of cult movements, and to render comprehensible their eventual conflicts with the larger societies they aspire to escape or overcome.</p>
<p>Analytically central in Hall’s sociological investigations has been a focus on the ways in which different temporal schemas of cosmic- or world-orientation provide the cognitive-emotive bases for collective identity-formation and corresponding patterns of social praxis. Engagingly reflexive in matters of theory and accomplished in a range of methodological approaches—from participant observation and interviewing to archival work and textual analysis—Hall has to date provided one of the richest lines of research on those startling occasions where the ground of the modern has been unsettled by eruptions emanating from deep substrata of the pre-modern.</p>
<p>The title of his new book announces Hall’s grand intention to achieve a clearer understanding of the tumults and mounting unease of our present situation by charting a genealogy of the apocalyptic imaginary, from its distant beginnings in the ancient Near East to the current global “War on Terror.” It is Hall’s contention that far from being a marginal factor in world history, carried mainly by fringe elements from among the discontented and desperate, apocalyptic sensibilities have risen to the fore during a number of turning-point moments and transformative periods, decisively influencing a series of developments instrumental in the long-run making of modernity.</p>
<p>To render discussion manageable, Hall sets aside the contested issue of millenarian analogues in the Orient, for which the Buddhist and Daoist traditions furnish the most convincing partial correspondences, in the form of movements and uprisings (the Yellow and Red Turbans, Celestial Masters, Maitreya “messianism,” White Lotus sects, Eight Trigrams, and other secret societies) inspired by expectations of divine or supernatural interventions that will usher in—but as a <italic>cyclical turn</italic> rather than <italic>linear telos</italic>—a “new era” of spiritual purity, peace, and bounteous well-being. Hall accordingly limits himself to only passing reference to several incidences of “apocalyptic diffusion” that attended the geo-political spread of Christianity and Islam, such as the cataclysmic Taiping Rebellion that nearly toppled the Qing dynasty in China, and various anti-colonial struggles in Africa and the Pacific. Detailed and sustained coverage is thus decidedly Occidental, and reserved for the following topics: (1) the genesis and early elaboration of apocalypticism in Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; (2) the role of apocalyptic expectations in the medieval Crusades and subsequently in the Protestant Reformation; (3) a secular “rechanneling” of apocalyptic aspirations in early modern revolutionary movements—the Jacobin ideologies of the French and later Russian revolutions most notably; and (4) the “clash of civilizations” presently unfolding in the increasingly violent confrontations between a globalized Jihad initiated by al-Qaida and largely American efforts at continued Western imperial dominance.</p>
<p>All in one book, you ask? Hall acknowledges at the outset that his effort to span millennia will be selective in its foci and dependent on the yield of specialist research for much of its empirical content on pre-modern developments. Three decades of preparatory investigation have given Hall an assured grasp of the relevant literatures, however, and the erudition on display—consistent across all chapters—cannot fail but instill confidence that this is an integrative work where scope has been obtained through cumulative diligence rather than hasty reconnaissance. In the course of presenting his arguments, Hall responsibly alerts readers to issues subject to scholarly disagreement, and the bibliography provides a refreshingly wide and diverse listing of historical and social scientific studies bearing on the themes considered.</p>
<p>Securing a reliable fundament of fact is both a laudable and an obligatory achievement; but that still leaves the daunting challenge of explication. Hall sounds an early cautionary note here as well, characterizing his ventured synthesis as “a highly exploratory and provisional inquiry” (p. xii). Though unduly modest for a mature study that comprehends and effectively integrates such an extended array of densely entangled historical episodes and developmental trends, the theoretical complexities involved in the processing are undeniably formidable—and all the more so given Hall’s stated objective of providing “a phenomenological history of the apocalyptic and modernity” (p. xi).</p>
<p>Consider first the weighty matter of definition and classification. Hall opts to define his key category in a broad manner, consisting of “beliefs, events, and social processes centered on cultural disjunctures concerned with ‘the end of the world’ and thereafter” (p. 2). This largely temporal characterization is reinforced, and opened wider still, by Hall’s insistence that apocalypticism arises most forcefully “when the <italic>present</italic> historical moment is experienced as the ending of the old order and the passage to a new beginning” (p. 2); or even more broadly, whenever previously “taken-for-granted understandings of ‘how things are’ break down” (p. 3). With this expansive rendering, Hall purposefully decouples apocalypticism from its primordial and conventional grounding in the religious domain, where the crucial consideration is not, I submit, the temporal <italic>per se</italic>, but the divine or supernatural manner through which the <italic>eschaton</italic> is to be realized, with its providentially differential dispensations for “the saved” and “the damned.” The apocalyptic temporal horizon, in other words, is fixated on—and takes its meaning from—a salvific outcome of redemption, for which any “experienced crisis” is registered as anticipatory prelude. <italic>Tempus</italic> is subordinated to <italic>telos</italic>.</p>
<p>Hall’s time-based, agency-neutral definition of apocalypticism does license his extension of the term to encompass a range of diverse secular phenomena—the French Revolution, anarchist violence, Russian and Chinese revolutionary communism, Cold War policies of mutually assured destruction, and even the counterculture and antiwar movements of the 1960s—but it is hard to suppress the thought that a category is being overworked here, blurring sociological distinctions of considerable import. Is our understanding appreciably advanced, or muddled, by assimilating Russian Bolsheviks and American Black Panthers to Christian Crusaders and English Puritans, through the notion of a “secular apocalyptic”? Is it accurate or sufficient to claim that the Jacobin “reign of Terror” was “apocalyptic in its logic” (p. 119), or that “All significant war is ‘apocalyptic’ in the broad sense that it involves strategic action in historical time directed toward ending a traumatic crisis through victory” (p. 198). Phenomenological considerations would seem to tell strongly against any classificatory capaciousness along these lines, for surely the “lifeworlds” and “lived experiences” of human agents inhabiting a sacred cosmology—sustained by credulous expectations of an imminent supernatural deliverance from the demonic powers that assail the faithful during their earthly tribulations—differ profoundly, not to say decisively, from those whose life-orientations are resolutely secular and this-worldly?</p>
<p>Questions might also be raised regarding the phenomenological cogency of Hall’s repeated nominative casing of “the apocalyptic” for referential purposes throughout his text, when a more consistent and precise adjectival specification of “apocalyptic” doctrines, texts, symbolism, thinking, imagery, agents, and movements would impart a greater concreteness to the inferences and interpretations proposed. The locutionary hazard here, of course, resides in the known conjuring capacity of the definite article to bestow reified powers upon its referents. Hall denies any such intent, but a number of his action-verb formulations appear to veer in that direction, as when we are told that “societies contended with the apocalyptic” (p. 67), that “the apocalyptic had become a hydra, regenerating with each effort to contain it” (p. 118), that “the apocalyptic brings the sacred into conjuncture with history” (p. 201), or that “the apocalyptic developed on various fronts” (p. 204). When Hall explicitly broaches the question of ontology, he reassuringly affirms that the “apocalypse is not a universal omnipresent reality or ‘thing’” (p. 202). But does it suffice to state that “the apocalyptic” is simply another social construction along the same order as “bureaucracy” or “community,” when the latter examples would seem to partake of a bit more identifiable material substance, in addition to their symbolic aspects?</p>
<p>Hall goes on to reject any proposal to treat “the apocalyptic” as “a variable” that is either “caused by” or “explains” other social phenomena (an ambiguous formulation that leaves all pertinent issues of cause and effect very much hanging), and then proceeds to invoke Weber’s famous railroad metaphor, wherein “the ‘world images’ created by ‘ideas’ have, like switchmen, determined the tracks along which action has been pushed by the dynamic of interest” (p. 202). This, alas, does little to clarify, for while Weber’s memorable line is instructive as a counter against cruder forms of reductionism, it surely cannot be pressed into service as an ontological specification, as any pursuant reflection on the metaphor will readily confirm. Hall’s own concluding gloss, that “temporalities of enactment—apocalyptic ones among them—do not ‘cause’ action: they set the alternative tracks of meaning along which action unfolds” (p. 202), is more of a restatement of the quandary than a resolution to the riddles of causation and agency.</p>
<p>After having tracked and analyzed the wending course of apocalypticism across the ancient, medieval, and early modern timescapes, Hall devotes the second half of his book to a multi-sided examination of its resurgent presence in the contemporary global world. There are many astute observations here that will reward close reading, including a particularly instructive discussion of how the mytho-historic “founding” of America as “God’s chosen nation” has continued to justify and encourage the invocation of apocalyptic imagery and rhetoric in both its religious and political realms. Deftly using the terrorist attacks launched by al-Qaida against the United States on “9/11” as a dramatic center and thematic hinge, Hall proceeds to sketch out a parallel account of the rise of militant Islam. Scriptural justifications for “holy war” and the blessings of sacred martyrdom provide the inspirational directives for the ideological program, as articulated by leading figures such as Sayyid Qubt and Osama bin Laden. Organizationally, Hall takes note of the decentralized networking that has enabled the small numbers of jihadists to carry out their operations on a global scale, all logistically facilitated by the science-based technologies that now make sophisticated financing arrangements and internet communications a simple matter of clicking a few buttons on a computer keyboard or cell phone. In the here and now, Hall ominously observes, age-old prophecies of a divinely ordained “day of reckoning” have been harnessed to decidedly modernist instrumentalities.</p>
<p>To comprehend this emerging and highly volatile epoch of crisis, Hall deems it necessary to introduce a new theoretical construct: the “Empire of Modernity” that is heralded in the book’s subtitle. The conceptual clamping of these two nouns is likely to be greeted by varying degrees of semantic puzzlement, seeing as “modernity” has long resisted agreement as to its intended temporal and sociological specifications, while usage of the term “empire” is normally reserved for the designation of political-military associations that extend their rule or dominance over territories inhabited by other social groups. How, one wonders, can a socio-temporal signifier like “modernity” be vested with powers of sovereignty and exploitative control?</p>
<p>Let us look to Hall’s working definitions, which draw upon and attempt to bridge Habermas’ theory of <italic>lifeworld colonization</italic> and Foucault’s notion of <italic>governmentality</italic>. Hall proposes that Modernity should be viewed as “a complex marked by multiple and hybrid temporalities,” the increasingly dominant modes of which are the “diachronic” and the “strategic” (pp. 120-21). The first and most pervasive of these paired temporalities is chiefly operative within the bureaucratically administered rounds of economic and political life, facilitating performance efficiencies through regimented and metrically quantifiable time-scheduling. The second is decisively regulative of the longer-term planning and contingent calculations that occur within the geo-political realm, as driven by inter-state competition and attending ambitions in hegemonic expansion. According to Hall, these two temporal trajectories—“the consolidation of administration of social life in diachronic time, and the imperialist quest that nation-states have pursued in strategic time”—have become so entrenched and amalgamated that they now “constitute an emergent hybrid ‘Empire of Modernity’” (p. 121). Through its historically distinctive “fusion of diachronic governmentality with the strategic exercise of violence,” this new geopolitical hybrid is effectively transcending the boundaries of nation-states, extending its powers diffusely across the globe in the service of sundry “modernizing projects” that impose the requisite disciplines and policing controls upon the colonized subjects and resistant “others” who fall within or beneath its sway. The generative locus of these aligned “governing projects and strategic military initiatives” is said to be centered in the West, with the United States serving as the military hegemon for an allied network of sovereign states, international agencies, and non-governmental organizations (pp. 126-31).</p>
<p>Such, then, is the emergent phenomenon Hall variously styles “modernity’s empire” or the “super-sovereign Empire of Modernity.” The sociological claims made on its behalf are undeniably thought-provoking, but also disquieting in the degree to which the theoretical argumentation tends to outpace efforts to ground the analysis in the concretizing detail of empirical illustration. Just how the “temporal regimes” of the diachronic and the strategic actually “constitute” this new geopolitical complex remains unclear as to process and agency, while the “modernizing projects” that purportedly drive the overall social trajectory appear to be impelled by imperatives or interests emanating not from identifiable groups, but from a de-centered “governmentality” lurking somewhere in the system’s hybridity. When the assessment of theoretical terminology and conceptualization is confronted by questions of ambiguity or underspecification, a turn to etymology often proves instructive. The analytically central category here, “empire,” traces back to the Latin verb <italic>imperare</italic>, “to command, order, or rule,” from which the word “imperial” also derives. Hall’s “Empire of Modernity” appears to dispense with this constitutive feature of “commanding” and “ruling” actions altogether, or locates this function at a level above or behind the human agents who implement its operations. But, as both etymology and sociological reason compel us to ask: can we properly speak of an empire without concurrent reference to the ruling class or governing stratum that commands it? Can we posit the existence of empire absent a specification of the instrumentalities of its rule, its modes of surplus extraction and expropriation? Has an actual working <italic>imperium</italic> been identified when its conquests and “the spoils thereof” have not been inventoried, so as to disclose its aggrandizing objectives and the tactical maneuvers and strategic pursuits that mark its ascendancy?</p>
<p>What lends salience to these concerns over Hall’s unconventional conceptualization of empire is that it stands in competition with other social scientific efforts to comprehend the globalizing processes underway. Like Hall, these approaches also advocate “thinking beyond” the nation-state, but generally proceed with greater attentiveness to traditional questions of how power is concentrated and wielded by identifiable social groups and actors. As pertinent examples, one might mention the important research that has been carried out on the formation and growing consolidation of a “transnational capitalist class” by the sociologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113491548">Leslie Sklair (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113491548">William I. Robinson (2004)</xref>; or the attempts to explicate the ascendancy of financial capital and its leading banking and investment representatives, as in recently published studies by the historical sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491548">Greta Krippner (2011)</xref> and the political economists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491548">Leo Panitch and Sam Ginden (2012)</xref>. Hall’s innovative and sometimes difficult reflections on “modernity’s empire” would have gained in both clarity and substance had he opted to articulate his positions in reference to alternative sociologies of globalism, whether in criticism or affirmation.</p>
<p>Important books are commonly lauded for their dual capacity to illuminate the topical domains they explore and to open up new vistas and challenges for future investigations. Hall’s latest contribution is such a book. If not the “last word” on the subject of prophesied anticipations of the “end of days”—and such was not its intention—<italic>Apocalypse</italic> has unquestionably succeeded in bringing greater awareness and comprehension to the momentously consequential role of apocalypticism in the making and breaking of worlds, past and present … and possibly future. Having garnered one major accolade already—the ASA 2010 Distinguished Book Award in the Religion Section—this learned and provocative study will long remain central in the discussions to follow.</p>
