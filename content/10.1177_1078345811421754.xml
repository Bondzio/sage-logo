<abstract>
<p>Odontogenic pain, or toothache, is highly prevalent in correctional facilities. When there is no dental sick call because the dental clinic is closed or the facility has no dental clinic, it is critical that midlevel providers and physicians triage and manage these patients until a dentist can resolve the problem. This article explores the etiology and diagnosis of toothache, presents the authors’ opinion of the standard of care for managing these patients, and makes three recommendations: (a) access to timely and definitive dental treatment should be available to all inmates experiencing dental pain, (b) antibiotic use should be limited to patients with frank infection, and (c) progress of patients awaiting a dental appointment should be monitored with frequency consistent with the differential diagnosis.</p>

<sec id="section1-1078345811421754">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Inmates have a higher prevalence of infectious and chronic diseases than the general population, primarily due to poverty and drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345811421754">Greifinger, Bick, &amp; Goldenson, 2007</xref>). The picture is no different for dental diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345811421754">Clare, 2002</xref>), and it is not surprising given the prevalence of risk factors associated with periodontal disease (tobacco use, poor oral hygiene) and caries (refined carbohydrate-rich diet, drug abuse).</p>
<p>This poses a particular problem for institutions such as jails that have a large number of admissions, since many inmates bring with them the result of years of dental neglect. Ironically, it is often not until they are incarcerated and are deprived of the drugs and alcohol that modified their threshold for pain that they become aware of their dental problems.</p>
<p>Odontogenic pain (acute dental pain or toothache) is a common complaint of inmates requesting an urgent appointment. In facilities that have a dental service, they are seen through an urgent care system usually labeled sick call or health call. This article presents our approach to the diagnosis and treatment of odontogenic pain by medical staff in a correctional environment.</p>
<p>Access to dental services varies widely in correctional facilities. This can be by intention in shorter-term facilities such as jails and detention centers or the result of staffing vacancies or shortages where dental clinics exist. Thus, it is important that all facilities have a triage protocol for use by nondental clinicians to separate patients who need expedited evaluation by a dentist from those who can be appointed on a routine basis after having been stabilized using analgesics and antibiotics, if appropriate.</p>
<sec id="section2-1078345811421754">
<title>Dentistry in the Correctional Environment</title>
<p>The focus of correctional dentistry is the control of acute and chronic dental pain, stabilization of dental pathology, and maintenance or restoration of function. The scope of care in a correctional institution is narrower than that in a private dental practice, and it is often dependent on the length of an inmate’s sentence and the facility mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421754">Makrides, Costa, Hickey, Woods, &amp; Bajuscak, 2006</xref>). Despite variations in the scope of care provided, the requirement to treat odontogenic pain is common to all facilities. Moreover, notwithstanding the limited scope of services, the standard for quality is that of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421754">Makrides et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345811421754">
<italic>Estelle v. Gamble</italic> (1976)</xref> held that health care demonstrating deliberate indifference to serious medical needs violates inmates’ rights under the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment, which prohibits “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.” Whether a particular condition is a “serious medical need” is fact-specific and courts consider (a) whether a reasonable clinician or patient would perceive it to require treatment, (b) whether it significantly affects daily activities, (c) the extent to which there is chronic and substantial pain, and (d) whether it is likely to worsen without treatment. While there is room to debate whether a particular dental condition is a serious medical need, many toothaches meet these general criteria.</p>

<sec id="section3-1078345811421754">
<title>Odontogenic Pain</title>
<p>Among the possible nontraumatic causes of tooth pain are (a) tooth fractures (often, a tooth that has been weakened splits in the course of normal chewing), (b) pulpitis, (c) caries (decay) extending through the enamel into dentin, (d) dental (periapical or periodontal) abscess, and (e) cellulitis (a diffuse inflammation of the connective tissue caused by a spreading bacterial infection just below the skin surface).</p>
<sec id="section4-1078345811421754">
<title>Etiology of Odontogenic Pain</title>
<p>Pulpitis is an inflammation of the living tissue within the tooth. Reversible pulpitis will resolve when the source of irritation is treated or removed. Typically, reversible pulpitis is attributed to minor tooth fractures, caries, and occlusal (bite) discrepancies and can be treated with analgesics and a dental procedure. These procedures may include removing decay and inserting a new or replacement filling, adjusting the bite, and applying desensitizing agents.</p>
<p>When the inflamed living tissue inside the tooth (the pulp) swells and circulation is compromised, the pulpitis becomes irreversible. A tooth with irreversible pulpitis has a partially vital pulp with inflammation and degeneration that is not expected to improve. Once pulp death (necrosis) occurs, the tissue is vulnerable to attack by bacteria, leading to infection at the apex of the tooth. Eventually this infection spreads by resorbing bone and supporting structures.</p>
<p>Tooth fractures involving the pulp will show symptoms of irreversible pulpitis. Probing the area around the tooth will indicate depth of fracture. If the fracture is below the level of the tissue attachment, it is likely the tooth will require extraction.</p>
<p>Periodontal (gum) infections can also cause a toothache. Acute periodontal infections include gingival abscess, periodontal abscess, necrotizing periodontal disease, herpetic gingivostomatitis, periocoronal abscess (pericoronitis), and combined periodontic–endodontic lesions. Resolution of these painful conditions requires physical removal of infectious material or necrotic tissue by a dentist. Antibiotics are not a substitute for this care but may be a component of the overall treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345811421754">American Academy of Periodontology, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment of Odontogenic Infections</title>
<sec id="section6-1078345811421754">
<title>Examination</title>
<p>Determining the cause of a toothache complaint begins with an examination of the patient by a clinician trained in assessment of oral lesions and infections. If a dentist is not present, the examining clinician must be able to gather and convey to a consulting dentist information necessary in determining a preliminary diagnosis and interim management of the pain until a dental procedure can be performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078345811421754">
<title>Documentation</title>
<p>The standard of care is to use a structured approach to document the oral examination. We recommend the use of the S.O.A.P. (subjective, objective, assessment, plan) format to document the patient’s chief complaint and the assessment leading to a diagnosis of the dental condition. The S.O.A.P. format is simple and widely used in medicine and dentistry, especially in urgent care settings.</p>
<p>For the subjective section, the examiner asks patient, “What kind of problem are you having?” The response should be recorded verbatim. It is important from a risk management perspective that if the patient mentions a specific tooth or area with swelling, to have the patient point to it and note this. It is important to have the patient describe the type of pain (sharp or throbbing; intermittent or constant).</p>
<p>The objective section contains the physical findings, pulp and percussion tests, examination, and radiographs taken. Tooth numbers of each tooth assessed with the results of tests for vitality, mobility, caries, discoloration, associated edema or exudate, and pain to percussion should be noted. Teeth adjacent and opposing the tooth or teeth indicated by the patient to be painful should also be tested and results noted.</p>
<p>The assessment section contains a list of likely differential diagnoses, and comprises the treatment plan, medications, follow-up, and patient education (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078345811421754">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1078345811421754">
<title>Nondentist clinician training</title>
<p>It is important that any nondentist clinician responsible for examining dental patients receive training by a dentist. This training should include recognition of common oral lesions and infections and methods to assess and isolate the source of the dental pain. A flowchart should be provided to assist the nondentist in pinpointing the physical signs and symptoms so the information can be conveyed to an off-site consulting dentist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1078345811421754">
<title>Differential diagnosis</title>
<p>Due to the multifactorial etiology of “toothache,” a clinician must isolate the cause to administer appropriate treatment. For example, a split tooth may cause severe pain; however, it is not the result of infection and is not infected. The first step toward accurate diagnosis is the history and examination. The examination should include (a) measuring vital signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421754">Makrides et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421754">Peterson, 2002</xref>); (b) inspecting and palpating lips and salivary glands, the floor of the mouth, and lymph nodes of the neck; (c) assessing the tooth for percussion tenderness and tooth mobility; and (d) evaluating patient for deep space infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421754">Friedman, 2003</xref>). Although an intraoral radiograph is the standard of care in a dental office, it is generally not available in a facility without a dental clinic or when the dental clinic is closed.</p>
<p>Patients with nondental conditions such as sinusitis, otitis media, pharyngitis, peritonsilar abscess, temporomandibular joint syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, vascular headache, herpes zoster, and cardiac ischemia may present with dental/jaw pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345811421754">Friedman, 2003</xref>). Sinusitis should be suspected if many or all maxillary posterior teeth on one side are sensitive to percussion or if the patient reports pain on bending over with the head down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345811421754">Murchison, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Often, a patient’s first examination is performed by a midlevel provider, such as a registered nurse or physician assistant, who performs an assessment. “… [I]n correctional settings, [registered] nurses must be able to assess teeth and gum conditions to evaluate abscesses, trauma, and cavity pain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345811421754">Burrow, Knox, &amp; Villanueva, 2006</xref>). Performing such an assessment is beyond the scope of practice of licensed practical nurses.</p>
<p>The importance of a proper examination for inmates presenting with odontogenic pain was recognized in a stipulated injunction settling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345811421754">

<title>Odontogenic infections</title>
<p>Odontogenic infections range from well-localized infections that are easily manageable to those of the fascial spaces that are life-threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421754">Makrides et al., 2006</xref>). These infections normally have two origins. The most common is the pulp of the tooth with a bacterial invasion of tissue surrounding the root tip, or apex, while the other is an infection arising from a periodontal pocket. Most odontogenic infections are mild and require minor therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421754">Peterson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Appropriate treatment for oral infections varies with the type of infection (chronic or acute), dissemination (localized or spreading), and immunocompetency of the patient (intact vs. compromised defense mechanisms due to underlying disease). In an immunocompetent patient or where a systemic disease is controlled by medication, a chronic or acute localized infection can, and should, be managed without the administration of antibiotics. Surgical treatment consisting of incision and drainage with tooth extraction or endodontic therapy are usually sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345811421754">Kuriyama et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Best practice for management of odontogenic infections is to remove the source of the infection, which is commonly a necrotic pulp or a deep periodontal pocket. Any successful therapy must include drainage of accumulated pus and necrotic debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421754">Peterson, 2002</xref>). Moreover, the source of the infection should be removed while the patient has a therapeutic blood level of an effective antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345811421754">Dirks &amp; Terezhalmy, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>If the tooth is to be salvaged, it should be opened and the pulp removed (establishing drainage through the tooth) and, on occasion, an incision and drainage procedure should be performed. Otherwise, the tooth should be extracted as soon as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421754">Peterson, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078345811421754">
<title>Use of antibiotics</title>
<p>Antibiotics given to a patient with an odontogenic infection do not resolve the underlying problem (i.e., the infected tooth). Consequently, “[a]ntibiotic therapy should be used as an adjunct to dental treatment and never used alone as a first line of care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421754">Swift &amp; Gulden, 2002</xref>). A clear indication for antibiotic use is the presence of fever or extraoral swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345811421754">Macleod, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421754">Makrides et al., 2006</xref>). However, dealing with the source of the infection (extraction or root canal therapy) should occur promptly.</p>
<p>Although antibiotics are indicated for the treatment of overt odontogenic infections, it is estimated that antibiotics are used inappropriately in 75% of cases involving dental conditions without signs of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345811421754">Brennan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421754">Peterson, 2002</xref>). In fact, antibiotics are not always indicated for a patient presenting dental pain. Antibiotics penetrate poorly or not at all into periapical abscesses or an infected root canal system because of reduced blood supply and necrotic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078345811421754">Slots &amp; Pallasch, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>“The patient’s condition should improve rapidly once the source of the infection is eliminated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421754">Swift &amp; Gulden, 2002</xref>). The use of antibiotics in the management of localized acute apical abscess, over and above establishing drainage of the abscess, is not recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345811421754">Makrides et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345811421754">Matthews, Sutherland, &amp; Basrani, 2003</xref>). “Routine use of antibacterial agents for the management of odontogenic infections has not shown to be effective and the practice should be considered inappropriate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345811421754">Dirks &amp; Terezhalmy, 2004</xref>). Extraction of the infected tooth or debridement of the necrotic root canal tissue is the only way to provide reliable stabilization of infection and symptoms. Therefore, antibiotic therapy should be reserved for individuals with spreading infections, cellulitis, a suppressed immune system, fever, malaise, or lymphadenopathy (swollen/enlarged lymph nodes).</p>
<p>The American Association of Endodontists’ guidance (2006) is that “a regimen of antibiotics is not indicated in an otherwise healthy patient for a small localized swelling without systemic signs and symptoms of infection or spread of infection.” Indications for antibiotic use include fever greater than 100 °F, malaise, lymphadenopathy, trismus (limited jaw opening), increased swelling, cellulitis, osteomyelitis (bone infection), and persistent infection.</p>
<p>Phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) is the gold standard for treating odontogenic infections with a typical adult regimen of 500 mg every 6 hours for a minimum of 7 days. The antibiotic therapy should last 3 days after the patient’s symptoms have resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421754">Swift &amp; Gulden, 2002</xref>). Where there is a benefit to medication that requires three daily doses (such as minimizing the need for pill call), amoxicillin 500 mg every 8 hours could be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421754">Swift &amp; Gulden, 2002</xref>). In serious infections, or where penicillin alone has not been effective, metronidazole, 500 mg every 6 hours for 10 days, can be added to the penicillin to ensure coverage against anaerobic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345811421754">Jacobsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421754">Swift &amp; Gulden, 2002</xref>). For patients with a history of penicillin allergy, clindamycin 300 mg every 6 hours for 10 days should be used. Macrolides such as erythromycin are not first-line therapy in treating odontogenic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345811421754">Swift &amp; Gulden, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Prescribing antibiotics unnecessarily is not a benign practice. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been clearly associated with exposure to antibiotics, the inappropriate use and the increased volume of which has elevated bacterial resistance to a major public health concern and has made an increasing number of infectious diseases difficult to treat. Although the problem has been recognized for many years, injudicious use of antibiotics continues to be a major public health problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345811421754">Huang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-1078345811421754">
<title>Standard of Care</title>
<p>The standard of care for treatment of odontogenic pain requires (a) a competent, well-documented examination of the mouth, (b) a diagnosis and treatment plan based on sufficient clinical data, (c) prompt referral to and treatment by a dentist, and (d) documented follow-up.</p>
<p>While palliative care is appropriate at the time of the initial complaint, the problem will not be resolved without treatment by a dentist. Absent evidence of a wider infection, the appropriate treatment consists of providing an analgesic and making a prompt referral to a dentist. Nondental clinicians should use decision rules to assist them in determining the cause of dental pain and communicate the findings to a consulting dentist. Antibiotic use must be circumspect and the practice of repeated courses of antibiotics should be avoided. Failure to remove the source of the infection promptly leaves the inmate with a chronic infection that can be a continual source of pain and recrudescence.</p>
<p>Patients who have been placed on antibiotics and return before their dental appointment should be seen by a clinician competent to perform an examination or assessment. At this point it is critical to determine whether the infection is progressing to a cellulitis or spreading to fascial spaces. Patients should be referred to an oral surgeon or a hospital if they are having difficulty in breathing or swallowing, cannot open their mouth more than 10 mm, have a fever greater than 101 °F, have an infection that is crossing the midline or is bilateral, or have an infection that is progressing rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345811421754">Peterson, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Non-dentist clinicians are useful first responders to complaints of dental pain and infection; however, their role is to gather information and triage these complaints so timely care can be provided by a dentist. A consulting dentist should be available to assist in the triage when necessary. Most valid complaints of odontogenic pain will be resolved only when a dental procedure is performed to remove the source of the problem. Thus, we conclude the following:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Patients complaining of a toothache should be examined by a midlevel provider, physician, or dentist within 24 hours of the complaint being received by prison staff.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Patients complaining of a toothache whose physical examination suggests no infection or a localized infection should not be given antibiotics.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Patients who have been started on antibiotics for an infection of odontogenic origin should be treated by a dentist while there is a therapeutic blood level of the antibiotic.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Patients who present after 2 days of antibiotic therapy complaining that their pain and/or swelling has not begun to resolve should be reevaluated immediately by a midlevel provider, physician, or dentist.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Patients whose pain, in the absence of signs of swelling, fever, drainage, or lymphadenopathy, cannot be controlled by NSAIDS should be reexamined by a dentist within 7 days to determine whether their complaint is related to an acute odontogenic infection.</p>
