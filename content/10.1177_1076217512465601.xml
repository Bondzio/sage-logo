<title>National Economics Challenge</title>
<p>The Council for Economic Education (CEE) focuses on the economic and financial education of kindergarten through high school students. The goal of the CEE has been to foster a real-world understanding of economics and personal finance for the past 60 years. This foundation of economic and financial literacy will enable today’s students to grow into successful and productive adults capable of making informed and responsible decisions in the future. To carry out its mission, the CEE provides professional development to teachers, teaching resources across the curriculum and nationally normed assessment tools through in-person local workshops, partner organizations, and online delivery of materials. In addition, the CEE partners with State Farm® to host an annual National Economics Challenge that encourages students to apply their economics knowledge and work in teams. Student teams will answer questions on microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, and current events. Competitions are held at the state, national semi-final, and national levels. At the national level, students complete rounds of testing, work in teams to solve case problems, and participate in a quick-paced oral quiz-bowl to compete for the title of National Champions. To participate in their state’s competition, students should contact their local coordinator. State coordinators will need to submit teacher and student registration forms to CEE for the champions in each division that advance to the National Semi-Finals. The 2013 National Economics Challenge will take place in New York City from May 17 to 20, 2013.

Examples include but are not limited to surgical devices; home health care devices; diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventative applications; rehabilitative and assistive technologies; or other innovations that will have a substantial impact on clinical care and patient outcomes. Entries will be judged on the following categories: (a) technical, economic, and regulatory feasibility; (b) contribution to human health and quality of life; (c) technological innovation; (d) potential for commercialization; and (e) general information. The categories for product designs may include the following: (a) surgery, (b) therapeutic applications, (c) diagnostic applications, (d) rehabilitative and assistive technologies, and (e) home health care. The alliance encourages multidisciplinary teams and interinstitutional teams to apply, as long as there is a faculty advisor from each institution. Each team must contain at least one engineering student. The first place team will receive US$10,000, second place will receive US$2,500, and the third place team will receive US$1,000.
