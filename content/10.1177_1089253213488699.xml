<p>The focus of the Congenital Cardiac Forum in this issue is hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). This constellation of underdeveloped left side heart structures is perhaps the most challenging congenital heart disease faced by health care providers and families, as well as presenting ethical challenges as the boundaries of what is possible constantly change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253213488699">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first article by Dr Kearney, “The Pathologic Spectrum of Left Ventricular Hypoplasia,” discusses the wide range of hypoplasia of the left ventricle and the associated underdevelopment of left side heart structures. Understanding the degree of left ventricle hypoplasia is essential for physicians to help parents make informed decisions. In the most severe forms of HLHS, there are 4 therapeutic options: early prenatal diagnosis and termination of the pregnancy, comfort care for the newborn child that will die when the ductus arteriousus closes, stage 1 Norwood surgery or hybrid procedure within the first week of life, or maintaining ductal patency while the infant waits for a heart transplantation. However, there is a group of infants with borderline left ventricular hypoplasia who may have other therapeutic options, including the possibility of biventricular repair. Understanding how the spectrum of left ventricular hypoplasia correlates with functional outcomes is essential for these children. What is currently the single ventricle repair of today may be the biventricular repair of tomorrow. The road map is constantly changing for children born with left ventricular hypoplasia as new surgical techniques are developed and it is therefore essential to obtain accurate information about the cardiac structures to help guide therapeutic decision making.</p>
<p>The second article by Dr Fonseca, “Perioperative Imaging in Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome” discusses the importance of perioperative imaging in providing the detailed information necessary to help guide which future road a child will travel. The choices of imaging modality for a patient with left ventricular hypoplasia is changing as our understanding of the functional capacity of the left ventricle evolve. For example, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may provide a more accurate measurement of left ventricle volumes, as it does not depend on geometric assumptions as echocardiographic techniques do. The accuracy of these measurements is perhaps more important today as surgical techniques push more aggressively toward biventricular repair. It is possible for a child with borderline left ventricle hypoplasia to change lanes from a single ventricle palliation road to a biventricular repair road, so-called “staged left ventricle recruitment.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253213488699">2</xref></sup> The importance of imaging in these children is crucial.</p>
<p>The third article by Dr Shillingford and colleagues and the fourth article by Dr Ing and colleague, discuss the surgical and anesthetic considerations for children with HLHS. There have been many advances in these areas, including the use of selective cerebral perfusion during circulatory arrest, the adoption of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit as an alternative to the modified Blalock Taussig shunt, monitoring the brain with oximetry techniques, and changes in the management of cardiopulmonary bypass. Improvements in the perioperative care of patients with HLHS over the past two decades has resulted in increased hospital survival, so that 80% of children are now expected to survive following stage 1 Norwood surgery. Increased survival has been associated with significant improvements in neurodevelopmental outcomes, but these children are still below the normal neurodevelopment of their peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1089253213488699">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1089253213488699">4</xref></sup> Survival associated with neurodevelopment deficits affects the long-term quality of life for these patients. The causes of neurological injury are multifactorial and include abnormal fetal brain development, the effects of anesthesia on the developing brain, and the risks of surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Although 80% of children survive beyond the stage 1 Norwood procedure there is additional interstage mortality between stage 1 and 2 operations of 5% to 10%. Identified risk factors for interstage mortality include the type of HLHS, with aortic stenosis and mitral atresia being the highest risk combination, and other risk factors such as discharge home on antiseizure medications and nasogastric feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1089253213488699">5</xref></sup> Surveillance programs, which educate parents on monitoring weight gain, fluid intake, and oxygen saturations, have been very successful in decreasing interstage mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1089253213488699">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>It requires a team of health care providers with significant experience to care for patients with HLHS. This “medical village” of health care providers should be located in tertiary referral centers so that single centers may maintain expertise in caring for these patients from the prenatal period through adulthood. The road map for these patients is continually changing. For example, fetal interventions may be attempted in an effort to improve brain and left ventricle development and adult survivors present with new issues, such as pregnancy with Fontan physiology. However, the road map is not the same in all countries. In India, for example, it is expected that 2000 babies could be born with HLHS every year and yet only 100 newborns per year present to major medical centers. Many of these presenting newborns do not carry a prenatal diagnosis and will be critically ill by the time they reach a major medical center. This further decreases the chances of a successful intervention in centers that have relatively little experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1089253213488699">7</xref></sup> The social, economic, and cultural factors in India have created a very different road map for newborns with complex congenital heart disease. The people and their elected governments can only change many of these factors. However, we must remember to build bridges with our colleagues in all countries and share our 2 decades of experience, so that eventually all parents may choose the best future road for their child with complex congenital heart disease.</p>
