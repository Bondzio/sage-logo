<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To describe the experience of general pediatricians in weaning bronchiolitis patients, treated as outpatients, from oxygen. <italic>Methods</italic>. The authors surveyed members of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Council on Community Pediatrics regarding management of outpatient oxygen for bronchiolitis. <italic>Results</italic>. The survey had 214 (28.4%) responses from pediatricians, of whom 172 (80.3%) practiced outpatient pediatrics. Among those, 27 (15.7%) cared for bronchiolitis patients discharged on oxygen. Pediatricians managing home oxygen practiced at higher altitude (5000 vs 339 ft, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). No clear weaning protocol was reported. Over half (61.5%) of the pediatricians managing home oxygen acknowledged difficulty in deciding when to stop oxygen. A median of 2 (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-2) outpatient visits and 6 (IQR = 4-7) outpatient days on home oxygen were needed prior to oxygen discontinuation. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Pediatricians are not routinely managing home oxygen for hypoxic bronchiolitis patients. Variable weaning process, difficulties in determining oxygen stoppage, multiple follow-up visits, and prolonged home oxygen usage highlight the need to evaluate the impact of this emerging practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of hospital admission for infants in the United States, accounting for significant health care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811430525">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811430525">5</xref></sup> Most studies testing the effectiveness of specific therapies have failed to show a significant reduction in rates of hospitalization or length of stay (LOS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811430525">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811430525">13</xref></sup> Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen is a key determinant in the decision to hospitalize infants with bronchiolitis and is a likely contributor to prolonged LOS for these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811430525">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811430525">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is growing evidence that home oxygen is a safe and acceptable method of avoiding hospitalization for outpatients with bronchiolitis and reducing LOS for inpatients with bronchiolitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811430525">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811430525">22</xref></sup> A recent update on bronchiolitis diagnosis and management alludes to this “novel” approach, encouraging more research in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811430525">23</xref></sup> While the potential of reducing LOS with home oxygen is appealing, the impact of this practice on general pediatricians is unknown. To our knowledge, there are no published guidelines for weaning home oxygen in the outpatient setting, whether for infants with chronic lung disease or for uncomplicated bronchiolitis with mild hypoxia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811430525">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811430525">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the past 5 years, the use of home oxygen in hypoxic bronchiolitis has gained increasing acceptance within certain regions of the United States (unpublished data, Denver, CO, and Salt Lake City, UT). In our own institution, 35% of all bronchiolitis hospital discharges were sent home on oxygen over the 2009-2010 winter respiratory season. As we expand this practice, we recognize the need to better understand the practice of general pediatricians in caring for these patients in the outpatient setting. We conducted this national survey to describe the experiences and attitudes of general pediatricians regarding home oxygen in bronchiolitis patients.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922811430525">
<title>Study Design and Methods</title>
<p>This was a descriptive, cross-sectional survey of 753 North American pediatricians who were members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Community Pediatrics. We developed the survey based on local experience with home oxygen in bronchiolitis patients and then trialed the survey with general pediatricians in a university-based general academic pediatric group. An electronic version of this survey was sent via email in May 2010 and June 2010. Those who did not respond to the email survey were sent a paper version of the survey through standard mail in October 2010. This study was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>The survey included items related to current practice setting and basic demographics. Respondents currently involved in outpatient pediatric care were asked about experience managing home oxygen in uncomplicated bronchiolitis patients with no underlying chronic conditions discharged from the hospital on home oxygen during the 2009-2010 winter respiratory season. Participants who had managed bronchiolitis patients on home oxygen in the outpatient setting were asked to describe weaning practices and problems they encountered with managing home oxygen. Participants were also provided the opportunity to free-text comments regarding the practice of using home oxygen for management of uncomplicated bronchiolitis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922811430525">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>Outcomes of interest for this study included the proportion of practicing general pediatricians who managed home oxygen in the outpatient setting during the 2009-2010 winter respiratory season as well as oxygen weaning practices and the clinical challenges faced by physicians managing these patients. We examined associations between practice and provider characteristics with management of home oxygen for bronchiolitis patients. Finally, we considered free-text responses of the respondents for insight into attitudes toward this emerging practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922811430525">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We compared survey respondents based on reported experience in management of home oxygen in hypoxic bronchiolitis. Because of the small sample size, we used Fisher’s exact statistics to compare dichotomous and categorical outcomes and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare continuous outcomes. We generated descriptive statistics to describe current practices and attitudes about home oxygen in uncomplicated bronchiolitis. Free-text responses were examined separately from the survey responses. Repeated comments noted in free-text responses were identified, with representative statements for each of these concepts presented as examples.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We received 214 survey responses (28.4%). Among these respondents, 172 (80.4%) practiced outpatient pediatric medicine during the 2009-2010 winter season. Of those practicing, only 27 (15.7%) managed home oxygen for hypoxic bronchiolitis patients in the outpatient setting. One of those providers did not include demographic information in his survey response.</p>
<p>Several practice and provider characteristics were associated with the management of home oxygen for bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811430525">Table 1</xref>). Pediatricians providing both inpatient and outpatient care (88.9% vs 61.4%, <italic>P</italic> = .007) and pediatricians working in a public health or Indian health setting (34.6% vs 3.4%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) were more likely to manage home oxygen for bronchiolitis. Home oxygen for bronchiolitis was also associated with residency training at higher altitudes (median altitude 700 vs 300 ft, <italic>P</italic> = .006) and current practice at higher altitudes (median altitude 5000 vs 339 ft, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Years in practice and the number of outpatient visits per week were not associated with management of home oxygen for bronchiolitis.</p>

<p>All respondents were given the opportunity to provide free-text responses/comments at the end of the survey. Fifty-four (25.1%) entered some free-text response to the survey. Seven respondents included positive reflections on using home oxygen for uncomplicated bronchiolitis, such as “It is a very useful modality.” Eleven expressed significant discomfort with home oxygen for bronchiolitis with comments such as “I don’t feel comfortable sending home a bronchiolitis patient on oxygen—that’s why they’re in the hospital” and “I don’t believe it is safe or meets standards of care.” Multiple respondents described practical barriers to the use of home oxygen. “It is difficult to get DME [durable medical equipment] for our Medicaid patients, and frankly easier to keep them inpatient for the couple days it takes to wean them off.” There were concerns about family acceptance of home oxygen and the need for appropriate family support with home health services (“I believe parents and families are too stressed and unprepared to deal with home oxygen therapy”). Finally, respondents expressed a need for improved guidelines for management of home oxygen before accepting this practice as a standard of care, stating that “parameters for sending infants home on oxygen would be very beneficial” and “it could be a nice adjunct to get patients out of the hospital earlier [but] need to have clear safety guidelines.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Though significant morbidity and mortality associated with bronchiolitis in otherwise healthy children is uncommon, the economic impact of this diagnosis on our health care system is considerable and may be increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811430525">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811430525">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811430525">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811430525">26</xref></sup> Although new research demonstrates the feasibility of managing hypoxic bronchiolitis patients with home oxygen as a means of both reducing rates of hospitalization and lowering LOS once admission occurs, our survey suggests that this remains an uncommon practice, with only 15.7% of the clinically practicing respondents managing these patients during the 2009-2010 winter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811430525">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811430525">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients with bronchiolitis can remain hypoxic well after resolution of clinically significant respiratory distress and feeding difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811430525">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811430525">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811430525">22</xref></sup> Our experience, and that of Denver’s, suggests that this effect may be amplified at higher altitude.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811430525">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811430525">22</xref></sup> In this context, the association between altitude and the use of home oxygen in bronchiolitis patients may not be surprising. Similarly, the relationship between higher training altitude and outpatient management of hypoxic bronchiolitis may reflect a comfort level with home oxygen gained during residency at higher altitude, where this practice is likely more common. Yet prolonged hypoxia in bronchiolitis is not a clinical challenge limited to high-altitude practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811430525">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811430525">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811430525">27</xref></sup> Home oxygen discharge for hospitalized bronchiolitis patients has been previously shown to reduce LOS at sea level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811430525">21</xref></sup> Further research to evaluate the outcomes and effectiveness of this practice at lower altitudes may be needed.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that our survey identified wide variability in oxygen weaning practices. There are no published guidelines for management of home oxygen in children, reflected in the range of oxygen monitoring strategies reported by our respondents. The clinical significance of mild, short-term hypoxia in healthy children with uncomplicated bronchiolitis remains unknown, contributing to the range of oxygen saturation thresholds cited by respondents for discontinuation of home oxygen.</p>
<p>Physicians managing home oxygen for bronchiolitis patients estimated that patients require a median of 2 outpatient visits and 6 days of home oxygen prior to discontinuing home oxygen. Given prior research identifying a mean LOS of 3.3 days for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, these results suggest that home oxygen may prolong use of supplemental oxygen in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811430525">1</xref></sup> Research examining the cost-effectiveness of shifting traditional inpatient care to the outpatient setting is needed to ensure that gains in the inpatient setting are not made at the expense of parents and physicians in the community.</p>
<p>Prior research evaluating the use of home oxygen in bronchiolitis has relied on the assumption that outpatient management of hypoxic bronchiolitis is preferable to inpatient management from both medical and social perspectives. Though home oxygen for uncomplicated bronchiolitis would appear to have advantages, our survey suggests that further research is needed. Unresolved questions important to the practice of using home oxygen in bronchiolitis include the definition of clinically significant hypoxia, the appropriate use of outpatient oximetry, timing of follow-up appointments, and weaning of home oxygen. Cost-effectiveness methods should be used to consider whether home oxygen for hypoxic bronchiolitis can reduce overall health care costs without adversely affecting health or quality of life outcomes.</p>
<p>Our results must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. We chose to survey a subgroup of general pediatricians with membership in the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Community Pediatrics, introducing the possibility of selection bias. This population likely overrepresents pediatricians involved in academic medicine and public health settings and may not be representative of the wider population of practicing general pediatricians in the United States. A low response rate introduces the possibility of response bias. Although we suspect that providers with experience managing home oxygen may have been more likely to respond to the survey, the true direction of this bias is unknown. Finally, this survey relies only on self-report of recalled practice during the preceding winter season. We do not know how accurately survey responses reflect true practice or whether the 2009-2010 winter season reflected the typical practice for our respondents. Despite these limitations, we believe that our results do reflect important gaps in our understanding of the impact of this emerging clinical practice on general pediatricians.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite recent studies showing the utility of home oxygen for stable hypoxic bronchiolitis patients, as well as practice guidelines supporting this management in high-altitude regions, this survey suggests that this is not yet a common practice among pediatricians. It is more common at higher altitude and with pediatricians who also practice in the inpatient setting. There was significant variability in weaning processes, and providers acknowledged difficulties in deciding when to discontinue oxygen. Finally, infants with bronchiolitis discharged with home oxygen may have a protracted outpatient course with supplemental oxygen and outpatient clinic visits. Given these findings, further studies must be done to evaluate the impact of this emerging practice on general pediatricians, as well as the overall impact on health care resource utilization and costs.</p>
