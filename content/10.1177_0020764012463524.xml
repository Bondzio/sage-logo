<p>Families are the cornerstone of any culture, even if the types of family and relationships within the family differ. Inevitably, in some cultures the burden of looking after a patient with mental illness will fall to the family, especially if statutory services are not easily accessible. In countries such as India, innovative practices ensure that patients are admitted with at least one family member who therefore ‘works’ as a nurse and co-therapist during the period of admission and acts as a liaison worker after discharge. It is to be expected that families will be interested in learning more about the illness and its management. Galynker has provided the information in four sections and 16 chapters. Not surprisingly, the major part of the book is devoted to specific psychiatric disorders. However, the first part will be of tremendous help to every clinician, as he describes key skills in communicating and gives practical advice on what is needed while talking to the family and yet ensuring that clinicians are aware that every family is different. The advice is practical and common sense. Galynker reminds us that not all families or even all members of the same family are willing providers of care, so different strategies are required. Reluctant and over-involved caregivers bring with them specific issues that have to be dealt with in a sensitive manner. There will be families who will become experts and may have more knowledge of the field than the clinician. Then there will be families who will have no knowledge of the illness or how to deal with the disturbed patient. The chapter on communication strategies is devoted to how to talk to different family members and what skills are required. Talking with parents about their ill children will, of course, differ from talking with adult children of mentally ill parents. Talking with spouses will indeed differ from talking with adolescent carers. Discussion of diagnosis and prognosis with families can be a critical time in engaging them. Understanding and explaining causative factors will take certain skills. Expressing uncertainty regarding diagnosis and comorbidity will require careful handling. This book provides pragmatic and sensible advice, using short vignettes in exploring various issues. There is plenty of good material here that clinicians at all stages of their career will find helpful when dealing with families of patients with mental illness.</p>
