<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nutrition education is a key element in promoting sustainable healthy eating behaviours and should start from the early stages of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422783">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911422783">2</xref></sup> Schools provide the most effective and efficient way to reach a large segment of the population, including young people, their families and the community in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911422783">3</xref></sup> Nutrition education needs to be complemented with food safety education because it includes procurement of safe foods in sufficient amounts to cover the nutritional requirements of the individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422783">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911422783">5</xref></sup> Education about these aspects to schoolchildren enhances their knowledge and skills required for them to understand contemporary food and nutrition issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911422783">6</xref></sup> Although, in our earlier studies, we observed that schoolchildren prefer to learn about food and nutrition in the classroom setting through the teacher,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422783">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911422783">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911422783">8</xref></sup> choosing to teach nutrition or food safety is not a clear-cut choice for teachers or schools if it is not part of the ‘core’ school curriculum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911422783">9</xref></sup> Hence, integrating food and nutrition education into curricula helps to resolve the problem of not having time to teach nutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422783">10</xref></sup> Development of innovative nutrition and food safety education components that can be effectively blended along with other science curricula is a continuous and demanding process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422783">11</xref></sup> Before developing such content, there is a need to examine and analyze the nutrition and food safety information in the current school science textbooks. Content analysis of curricula and textbooks can be the basis for improving nutrition education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422783">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911422783">13</xref></sup> Content analysis can be defined as a technique for making replicable and valid inferences from the text/data to their context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911422783">14</xref></sup> It is a method that is used to develop objective inferences about a subject of interest in any type of communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422783">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In India, there are three different streams of school education: (1) schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE); (2) schools affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination that gives the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) certification on completion of grade X; and (3) schools that follow the education patterns guided by the respective state school education boards. At present, there are 10,011 schools affiliated to the CBSE including some Indian schools in 21 countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422783">15</xref></sup> For the CBSE schools, the syllabus is prescribed by the board and the schools usually follow the textbooks published by the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT). However, the NCERT does not publish textbooks for primary grades (I–V); hence the schools follow textbooks published by private publishers for those grades.</p>
<p>The present study was carried out with an aim to assess the nutrition and food-safety component in the CBSE school curricula. The study protocol was approved by the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India. The specific objectives of the study were:</p>
<list id="list1-0017896911422783" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To assess the biological science content in the general science textbooks of all grades (I–X) from primary through high school.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To find out the proportion of space allocated for the nutrition and food safety component in relation to the other topics in biology in each of the textbooks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To analyze the nutrition and food safety components of these textbooks for their presentation and quality.</p></list-item>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>All science textbooks from grades I–X used by CBSE schools were selected for the study. For primary grades (I–V), textbooks published by Navneet Publishers were considered as they were used by most schools. NCERT textbooks were selected for the remaining grades (VI–X).</p>

<title>Methodology and analyses</title>
<p>The process of content analysis consists of coding raw messages according to a classification scheme that allows for easy identification, indexing and retrieval of content relevant to research questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911422783">16</xref></sup> For the purpose of the study, all the content related to physics, chemistry and environment (excluding sanitation, cleanliness and safety of water) was categorized under ‘physical and environmental sciences’ and content related to life sciences was categorized as ‘biology’. Under biology, the terms ‘nutrition’, ‘food safety’, ‘health’ and ‘others’ were operationally defined with inclusion and exclusion criteria before carrying out the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911422783">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantitative content analysis</title>
<p>The quantitative content analysis method included physical measurement of space (in terms of pages), number of illustrations and exercise questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911422783">17</xref></sup> The degree and emphasis of various variables for quantitative analysis were defined as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0017896911422783" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Chapters</italic>: While counting the total number of chapters, only those lessons which were completely dedicated to the subjects of interest (nutrition and food safety) were considered. Those chapters with only one sub-unit dedicated to the topics were not considered.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Space allocated (no. of pages)</italic>: While counting the number of pages allocated to each subject, irrespective of the theme of the chapter, if nutrition and food safety information was covered in more than a quarter page in terms of text, then it was counted under the relevant subject area. As the font sizes and page sizes of the textbooks were different, the space was reported as a percentage of the respective books’ space (total number of pages).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Illustrations</italic>: All the illustrations that were there in the science textbooks were categorized into physical and environmental science according to the chapters in which they occurred. Of the illustrations in the biology segment, the ones occurring under the lessons categorized as nutrition and food safety were counted under the respective themes. Of the others, all those illustrations which showed fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, eatables or activity of eating were counted under nutrition, whereas the visuals related to hand washing, cleanliness, hygiene, street foods, food vending, food in covered containers, etcetera, were considered under food safety.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0017896911422783">
<title>Coding</title>
<p>The chapters, content and illustrations were coded manually as per the aforementioned specifications to facilitate the use of quantitative and qualitative content analyses. The coding was initially done individually by two of the investigators (GMSR and TVP) using the aforementioned coding scheme. Inter-coder reliability was checked by taking codes prepared by these two investigators for five randomly-chosen textbooks using Cohen’s Kappa statistics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911422783">
<title>Qualitative analysis</title>
<p>The quality of narration, illustrations, and possible biases as well as other general elements like font, print, etcetera, were examined to analyze the latent meanings, which were first interpreted by the investigator and were later independently reviewed by a sociologist and an expert committee comprising of two nutritionists and two communication professionals. Only those interpretations that were commonly agreed by all have been included in the results.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0017896911422783" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the inter coder reliability indicated that overall kappa (KAPPA) was equal to 0.89 suggesting that there was a very high rate of agreement between the coders and thus validating the coding scheme. Quantitative content analysis showed that the biology component occupied relatively less space in relation to physical and environmental science in the NCERT textbooks in the higher grades. While at least one chapter was dedicated to nutrition from I to VII grades, there are no chapters on nutrition in the high school (grades VIII to X) science textbooks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0017896911422783">Table 2</xref>). Similarly there is hardly any chapter dedicated to food safety in these textbooks.</p>

<p>Physical counting revealed that, in the textbooks of grades I through V, the number of biology illustrations was more than half of all the illustrations. The number of illustrations related to nutrition was over 25% of all biology illustrations in the first two grades. However, the number of illustrations pertaining to biology vis-à-vis nutrition and food safety decreased in the subsequent grades. In the textbooks of grades VIII to X, the nutrition illustrations were nil, quite obviously because nutrition topics were not covered in these books. Food safety-related illustrations are almost nil in the textbooks of I through X grades, except in the grade IV textbook, wherein 6% of all biology illustrations pertained to food safety (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0017896911422783">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Qualitative content analysis revealed that the nutrition content in the first three grades is devoted to helping the children recognize various foods that are derived from plant and animal sources. In higher grades, the lessons were repetitive and dealt with topics like food groups, functions of foods and nutrition deficiency disorders in greater or lesser detail (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0017896911422783">Table 4</xref>). The data also indicated that the colour visuals and tables have been interspersed in the NCERT textbooks both for visual relief and easy understanding. In all grades, except in grades I and II, the nutrition lessons were relegated to the back pages. Some inconsistencies were found in presenting the units of measurement of nutrients, especially energy, which was represented in Kcal in some lessons and Joules in others. Similarly, in a lesson titled ‘our food’ in the grade VII textbook, an illustration depicting ‘basic functions of food and what it does to our body’ was incomprehensible not only to the investigators but also to the expert committee comprising nutritionists. In the same chapter, a table depicting ‘energy reduction by food substitution’ had many inconsistencies because the serving sizes or the portions for which substitutes were being suggested were not mentioned. The illustrations depicting good food habits, eating habits, cooking, etcetera, in the NCERT science textbooks of the primary grades seem to have urban bias with pictures of children consuming foods on a dining table using modern cutlery and crockery, which is not so common in many Indian homes. The food stuffs depicted as breakfast and lunch items are also not commonly consumed in many in Indian homes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0017896911422783">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Government plans and policies in India have time and again reiterated unequivocal commitment to incorporate nutrition into the school curriculum. For instance, the National Nutrition Policy of India (1993) and the National Plan of Action on Nutrition (NPAN; 1995) clearly emphasize that carrying out necessary modifications to the curriculum from time-to-time to incorporate ‘nutrition’ in school books is an important indirect policy measure to increase nutrition awareness among school going adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911422783">18</xref></sup> The National Policy of Education (1986 – modified in 1992) and National Curricular Frame Work (2005) also highlight the need and importance of nutrition and physical activity as part of health education in schools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422783">19</xref></sup> The present study reveals that nutrition component in the school curricula is abysmally low despite all the policy measures. This observation is in concurrence with an earlier review of school health programmes in 10 Indian states, which observed that there is no priority for health promotion in actual practice due to lack of commitment from education departments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422783">19</xref></sup> The present study also indicated that there are too many inconsistencies in the presentation of topics related to nutrition; this observation is in concurrence with an earlier study carried out in Delhi in 1996 to assess the micronutrient nutrition related-content in the school curricula, which also observed inconsistencies in presentation of those topics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911422783">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In their analysis of the nature of science and technology presentation in NCERT science textbooks for grades IV through X, Koul and Dana (1997)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911422783">21</xref></sup> found that there was ‘excessive’ physical science content with prime emphasis on established concepts, laws, and theories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911422783">21</xref></sup> Ramanathan and Siddiqi (1994) also made similar observations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911422783">22</xref></sup> In the current study, we too observed that the emphasis on physical sciences was increasing in grades VI through X allocating lesser proportion of space for the biology component, thereby limiting the scope for coverage of nutrition and food safety. Some researchers have suggested integration of nutrition into diverse curricular areas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422783">10</xref></sup> but in the present study, we found that integrating nutrition and food safety-related topics in subjects other than science – say in physical and environmental sciences – actually dilutes the importance of nutrition and food safety education because it gets masked under other topics. For instance, although nutrition (e.g. importance of regular but small meals) and food safety (e.g. importance of washing hands before eating) was covered in some primary grades in the lessons pertaining to ‘good habits’ along with aspects like ‘sitting in good posture’, ‘wearing washed clothes’, ‘combing hair’ etcetera, under moral sciences, this may not give adequate scope for the child to comprehend the scientific rationale or importance of inculcating the aforementioned nutritional or food safety habits.</p>
<p>Considering that India’s children are confronted with not only under-nutrition but also with problems associated with overweight and obesity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422783">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911422783">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911422783">25</xref></sup> the school system can be effectively used to educate children about these problems and their debilitating health effects; however, the science textbooks of grades beyond III only cover topics like food groups or nutrient deficiency disorders. There is hardly any mention of important deficiency disorders like anaemia and iodine deficiency disorders and steps to be taken to control them. Similarly, there is hardly any information on contributing factors to overweight and obesity like consumption of unhealthy/junk foods, lifestyle factors etcetera. Similarly, there is no mention of obesity and resultant chronic degenerative diseases like diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases when they are on the rise among adolescents in India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422783">23</xref></sup> This perhaps is the need of the hour as the influence of mass media, especially television advertising, on the food preferences of young children far outweigh the current capacity of the school curricula to offset the influence of these forces.</p>
<p>The multi-colour drawings and illustrations interspersed in NCERT textbooks are easily comprehensible. However, in our earlier study with textbooks of a South Indian state’s educational board, it was found that the text dominated in these books while visuals were simple black and white line drawings which, in most cases, were not easily comprehensible to the children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911422783">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The illustrations depicting good food habits show children consuming foods on a ‘dining table’ using modern cutlery and crockery, while in many Indian homes – more so in rural areas – food is consumed directly with hands from a metal plate or banana leaf sitting on the ground.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911422783">27</xref></sup> Similarly, foods like bread, jam, butter, etcetera, depicted in illustrations are rarely consumed in Indian homes for breakfast or lunch except in some urban, elite homes.</p>
<p>The need to take food safety-related education beyond safe handling, consumption and preservation of foods is time and again stressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422783">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911422783">28</xref></sup> In the present scenario, when there are shifts away from meals to snacks and from at-home to pre-packaged foods, children should be made aware of food additives and contaminants and they should also be taught to read and understand the food labels in order to help them make healthy food choices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422783">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911422783">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911422783">29</xref></sup> However, the present study indicates that food safety in whichever grade it appears deals mostly with cleanliness of surroundings and not consuming fly-swarming or insect-infested foods and sometimes with techniques of preservation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0017896911422783">
<title>Implications for policy</title>
<p>In the context that about half of the children in India suffer from under-nutrition, as many as 15% are overweight/obese even in rural areas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422783">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911422783">30</xref></sup> nutrition education could hold the key for building a human resource equipped with skills to understand the contemporary food and nutrition issues. Schools provide the best platform to reach a large segment of children and their families. Considering that many of our earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422783">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911422783">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911422783">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911422783">28</xref></sup> indicated that school-based nutrition education is preferred and is an effective mode of learning among children, the onus is on the teachers to impart them with nutrition education. However, they cannot take time out to teach topics outside the core curriculum. Hence, including nutrition in the core science textbooks becomes a continuous and demanding process. The results of this study could serve as a baseline for future revision of the textbooks in strengthening the nutrition and food safety components. It is recommended that many important topics such as nutrition and growth, link between childhood malnutrition and non-communicable diseases in adulthood, adolescent nutrition, nutrition for girl child, hidden hunger, lifestyle factors and obesity, nutrition during pregnancy and lactation, importance of breast feeding, unhealthy foods, fortification, etcetera, be covered in the curricula. These topics will help build necessary knowledge and skills among children not only to understand various food and nutrition issues but also to understand a link between nutrition and health. Similarly many topics related to food storage, preservation, safe food handling, food-borne diseases, reading food label information, etcetera, can be covered under food safety.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present study revealed that the space allocation for biology in relation to physical sciences is lesser in higher grades (VI to X). Nutrition topics are dealt with more at primary school level but very little at higher grades. Nutrition topics covered in textbooks of grades beyond IV repeat topics like food groups, micro and macronutrients or nutrient deficiency disorders. Similarly, food safety deals only with cleanliness of surroundings, and not consuming fly-swarming or insect-infested foods. There are too many inconsistencies in presentation of the nutrition content.</p>
