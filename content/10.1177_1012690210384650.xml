<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to analyze how the characteristics of different sports affect their respective labor market characteristics. To that end, we first classified Korean sports into the following four groups according to number of spectators and playing population (participation): Popular, Non-popular, Leisure, and Media. One sport was selected for each classification, and a survey was conducted of the people specializing in each sport. The resulting data were used to analyze employment characteristics such as firm size, wages and job security, career-building path, career goals, and job satisfaction in the labor market for each sport. We found significant differences between the sports with high and low spectatorship, whereas participation appeared to have almost no impact on labor market characteristics. Based on the results, we try to expand the meaning of Bourdieu’s social meaning of sports participation to apply it to spectator sports.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The sports industry is made up of different sports. As Bourdieu pointed out, ‘it is possible to consider the whole range of sporting activities and entertainments offered to social agents – rugby, football, swimming, athletics, tennis, golf, etc. – as a supply intended to meet a social demand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690210384650">Bourdieu, 1978</xref>: 820). The way ‘tastes’ regarding a particular sport are born and morph into demand for that sport changes over time. In the modern era, sports have become a huge industry, and there is a growing demand for their commercial use. From an industrial perspective, each sport can be seen as a product. Users’ tastes for a particular sport are expressed in the form of spectatorship and participation. For example, for the individual sport of soccer, demand translates into consumption in the form of publicly viewing the match (or service), either at the stadium or by watching TV, or participating in the match by using soccer facilities or equipment.</p>
<p>In a capitalist economy, the product market, where goods are produced and consumed, and the labor market, where labor is supplied and used, are interlinked. The price and quantity of a good determined by the demand and supply in the product market affect the price (wage) and quantity of labor in the labor market. The impact of the product market on the labor market is not only quantitative but also qualitative. The quality demanded in the product market also determines the quality of the workforce needed to meet that requirement.</p>
<p>In this context, we can expect that the characteristics (quantity, quality, and price) of labor involved in the production and distribution of goods and services in each sport are also affected by the demand and supply of goods and services related to that sport.</p>
<p>This study aims to explore the characteristics of each sport’s labor market. In particular, it focuses on how demand patterns for the goods and services associated with each sport affect the production method, and how the production method in turn affects the labor market structure of that sport. To that end, we first classified Korean sports according to the number of spectators and playing population (participation). According to our classification, soccer is a Popular sport and yachting Non-popular. Tennis is a Leisure sport with high participation but low spectatorship, and golf is a Media sport with low participation but high spectatorship.</p>
<p>After selecting the sports to be studied, we conducted the Labor Survey in the Sports Industry (hereafter referred to as Labor Survey). Sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Sports, the Labor Survey was held from July to October 2008, and included 2000 respondents who hold a variety of jobs in sports such as soccer, tennis, golf, and yachting. All of the respondents came from specialized jobs in or related to sports, such as competition, marketing, media, education, leisure, public administration, and associations/teams. The survey includes information on demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and educational level, and on the labor characteristics such as career, wages, work hours, and working conditions. Based on this data set, we analyzed how the characteristics of different sports affect their respective labor market characteristics. We focused on employment characteristics such as firm size, the distribution of wages, and social insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Studies on human resources in the sports industry so far have dealt mostly with teams, either professional or amateur (school), and have focused on individual issues such as wages based on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690210384650">Hall et al., 2002</xref>), gender discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690210384650">Yiamouyiannis and Moorman, 2008</xref>) and discrimination based on race and nationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690210384650">Berri and Simmons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690210384650">Kahn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690210384650">Pedace, 2008</xref>). Subjects of analysis were also mostly limited to those involved in competition such as pitchers, golfers or other players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690210384650">Bradbury, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690210384650">Callan and Thomas, 2007</xref>), and coaches. This article makes a new contribution in that it attempts to typify each sport, identifies the differences in the labor market of the sport selected under each type, and undertakes an overall analysis of the sports labor market including employment environment, career path, and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>In addition, this study aims to reinterpret how the advent of spectator sports has affected the labor market for each sport. One distinct feature of modern sports is the shift from ‘participation sports’ to ‘viewing sports’, or the rise of spectator sports. This development is closely related to the industrialization or commercialization of sports, where profits are sought through sports. Bourdieu highlighted the social meaning between sports participation and spectatorship by class. He argued that as the capitalist production and industrialization of sports deepen, and as spectator sports become the norm, the principles of capitalist production, or of profit-seeking, will have a significant impact on forming the social or class meaning of sports. Hence, this study expands the meaning of Bourdieu’s social meaning of sports participation to apply it to spectator sports.</p>
<p>This article is structured as follows. In section 2 we explain how the sports were classified. We hypothesize about how each sport’s type affects its labor market characteristics in section 3 and verify the hypotheses through empirical analysis in section 4. Section 5 is a discussion from Bourdieu’s perspective. In the last section we present our conclusions.</p>

<title>2. Classification of sports</title>
<sec id="section3-1012690210384650">
<title>2.1. Classification from the labor market perspective: Methodology</title>
<p>The various sports within the sports industry can be classified according to different criteria. In everyday life sports may be divided by the relevant instrument or place: ball games, throwing games, water sports, ice sports, or track and field. But for the sake of research, they tend to be classified as spectator sports or participation sports based on the type of consumer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690210384650">Burnett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690210384650">Casper and Menefee, 2008</xref>). The best example of a spectator sport would be auto racing, for which public participation is low but spectatorship is relatively high (through TV). Some sports, such as soccer, have both high spectatorship and high participation, and others, such as scuba diving, feature both low spectatorship and low participation. Of course, which sports fall under which types depends on the region and country.</p>
<p>In this article, sports are classified into four dimensions based on participation (x-axis) and spectatorship (y-axis), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690210384650">Figure 1</xref>. Sports high in both participation and spectatorship are considered Popular sports, those low in both are considered Non-popular (enthusiast) sports, those high in participation and low in spectatorship are considered Leisure sports, and those low in participation and high in spectatorship are considered Media sports.</p>

<caption><p>Sports classification by levels of spectatorship and participation.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1012690210384650-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Spectatorship is measured by the number of spectators or TV viewers, and participation can be measured through different guidelines such as the number of registered players (professional or corporate) or club members (amateur).</p>
<p>This type of classification is also a subjective concept that would yield different outcomes depending on the country and society. There are of course sports that will fall under the same type in most countries: soccer commands both participation and viewership in most countries, whereas curling, a relatively new sport in Korea, has a meager showing on both fronts. However, sports such as yachting are Non-popular in Korea and other parts of Asia, but Popular or Leisure in France where there are one million club members. Similarly, soccer is a Popular sport in South America but a recreational sport in the United States. And this typology is not permanent: Non-popular sports of today such as yachting may become Media or Leisure, or even Popular sports, as circumstances change over time. Based on this classification, it can be assumed that Popular sports are the most industrialized, whereas Media and Leisure sports are more industrialized than Non-popular sports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1012690210384650">
<title>2.2. Classification of sports: The case of Korea</title>
<p>In this article, the 54 sports registered under the Korea Sports Council were classified into Popular, Non-popular, Media, and Leisure types. Spectatorship was measured by the number of viewers of each sport (by household; average of 2005, 2006, and 2007), and participation was measured by the average number of club members in the same three years.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1012690210384650">Figure 2</xref> shows the distribution of Korean sports according to the two criteria. Soccer is noticeably higher in both number of spectators and number of players than are the other sports, whereas baseball is higher in spectators. Most other sports are crowded around the baseline as a result of both low spectatorship and low participation. Intersports differences are relatively unclear other than for the two Popular sports, but golf and boxing appear to be comparatively high in numbers of spectators, and tennis and bowling are high in terms of participation.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1012690210384650" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1012690210384650-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Because of the unclear representation of intersports differences owing to the dramatic gap in popular sports and others, log values were used for viewers and club members to enable easier comparison. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1012690210384650">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1012690210384650" position="float">

<caption><p>Distribution of spectatorship and participation in Korean sports (log values).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1012690210384650-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>There are a number of possible ways to select the targets for comparison from such a distribution. One method is to select the sports that are extremely low (or high) in both number of spectators and number of participants or that are extremely low (or high) in only one criterion. But if the number of people involved is too low, it would present challenges in conducting the Labor Survey and interviews that are the main source of data collection in this study. To ensure that sufficient data would be obtained through the survey and interviews, three sports with relatively high participation and viewership were selected (soccer, tennis, and golf) along with yachting, a recently growing sport in Korea. Soccer, which is high in both participation and viewership, is a Popular sport, yachting, low on both counts, is a Non-popular sport, tennis is a Leisure sport, and golf is a Media sport.</p>
<p>It is necessary to explain the social significance or image of these four sports in Korea. Soccer was and is considered the most popular sport. The popularity of soccer in Korea is overwhelming in terms of both spectatorship and participation, and despite its working-class image, it appears to enjoy a status that transcends class.</p>
<p>Tennis, until the 1970s, was associated with a ‘noble’ image, as a sport to be enjoyed by members of the middle-upper or higher classes. Purchasing the necessary equipment and uniforms was expensive, and having to take tennis lessons was considered a luxury in terms of both financial resources and time. But as the Korean economy grew and the middle class began to enjoy greater affluence, tennis quickly lost its noble image. The price of equipment relative to income fell considerably, and the sport’s strict dress code was greatly relaxed.</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, golf has taken on the mantle of noble sport in Korea. Because of the limited number of golf courses, memberships cost in the hundreds of thousands of Korean won, and a single day of golf costs from 100,000 to 200,000 won in fees alone (around 1/10 of the average monthly wage). Golf equipment and garments remain expensive relative to income, and the use of premium gear is considered representative of a player’s character and class. For example, in the United States where golf has become more popularized, casual golfers in jeans or shorts are commonly seen on public golf courses, whereas in Korea such attire is considered taboo. Furthermore, in Korea golf etiquette is greatly emphasized, and golf lessons require both time and money.</p>
<p>Although still associated with its high-class image, golf is becoming increasingly popularized in industrial terms. Affordable equipment and wear are now mass-produced, and expensive and time-consuming practice sessions on the golf course are increasingly being replaced by community golf practice fields and practice using videos. The popularization of golf also has had a considerable impact on Korea’s mass media. For example, golf is the only one of all sports in Korea to have two dedicated cable TV channels.</p>
<p>As golf continues to gain popular appeal, some classes have turned to other, seemingly higher-class sports, such as horseback riding and yachting. The initial investment in yachting, that is, the cost of buying a yacht, is so high that only members of the upper class can afford it. In addition, yachting also requires spare time, and hence is strongly associated with a noble image.</p>

<sec id="section5-1012690210384650">
<title>3. Characteristics by type: Theoretical hypotheses</title>
<p>We hypothesize that the labor market characteristics of each of the four selected sports are different. One can assume that Popular sports feature a labor market with many opportunities, high competition, and high diversity, offering more jobs of different types and attracting more job-seekers at the same time. They are more likely to have open hiring system, stable regular jobs, and higher wage gap between jobs. These characteristics may result in mixed job satisfaction among workers: high job security but low wage satisfaction (owing to the big wage gap). In Non-popular sports, there are likely to be fewer numbers and types of jobs and (assuming that their popularity remains almost the same) fewer job-seekers. Thus, hiring practices for such sports are likely to be more subjective (based on recommendations), and the wage gap is likely to be smaller. It is possible that job satisfaction is high in terms of wages but low in terms of working environment. In Leisure and Media sports, a mixture of the above characteristics would prevail. Based on the above hypotheses, the labor characteristics of each of the four sports can be derived as follows.</p>
<sec id="section6-1012690210384650">
<title>Soccer</title>
<p>As a Popular sport, soccer would offer many jobs of differing quality levels, would have many workers already in the industry, and would attract many job-seekers as well. We predict that it would thus have the highest numbers and levels of education programs for workers among all four sports. The significant gap in job quality would result in big wage gaps, leading to big gaps in overall job satisfaction and wage satisfaction. If job satisfaction is measured based on comparison, it could also be relatively low. Furthermore, the sport’s career-building paths may be concentrated in more industrialized areas such as marketing, media, and teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1012690210384650">
<title>Golf</title>
<p>As a typical Media sport, golf would offer jobs that are fewer in number but more even in quality, given that broadcasting and media jobs are relatively highly paid. There would be fewer workers in the industry but relatively greater numbers of job-seekers. Based on this assumption, we predict that the sport’s education programs would also be fewer in number but high in quality. The gap in job quality and wage would be somewhere in the middle among the four sports, whereas overall job satisfaction and wage satisfaction would also be in the middle in terms of both satisfaction level and wage gap. The career-building paths would be concentrated in media and broadcasting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1012690210384650">
<title>Tennis</title>
<p>As a Leisure sport, tennis is likely to offer many jobs of relatively even quality. It would already employ many workers but would not attract as many job-seekers. The number and quality of its education programs would be average, the gaps in job quality and wages would be low, and overall job satisfaction and wage satisfaction would be medium, without a big gap. The sport’s career-building path is likely to be focused on instructors and facilities necessary for leisure sports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1012690210384650">
<title>Yachting</title>
<p>In Korea, yachting remains a sport for a few enthusiasts, and is low in terms of both numbers of spectators and numbers of participants. Thus, the number and quality of jobs are likely to be low, but the quality is likely to be relatively even. There would be fewer people working in the industry and fewer job-seekers. The number and quality of the sport’s education programs would be low, resulting in a higher percentage of people working away from their educational background. The quality and compensation between the fewer jobs are likely to be more even. The overall job satisfaction and wage satisfaction would exhibit smaller gaps, and the level would be relatively high. The career-building path is likely to be concentrated in instructors and equipment necessary for enthusiasts.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-1012690210384650">
<title>4. Empirical analysis</title>
<sec id="section11-1012690210384650">
<title>4.1. Data</title>
<p>The data used in this article were gathered through the Labor Survey in the Sports Industry administered in 2008. It was conducted on workers in almost all job groups in the four sports being compared in this article. To ensure that the general characteristics of the labor market in each sport are compared, player groups or competition groups (coaches, referees, operational staff) are excluded from analysis, as they come with vastly different employment environments and job responsibilities. Thus, the areas of analysis are organizational management (teams, associations), school education, marketing, media, recreation, sports facilities, and sports equipment job groups in the four sports, for a total of 948 workers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690210384650">Table 1</xref> shows demographic information by sport. Over 80 percent of workers in soccer and yachting are males, and 79 percent in tennis. Golf has the lowest percentage of men (71.4%). By age, the highest percentage of workers are in their 30s (46%), followed by the 20s (35.9%). Those in their 20s and 30s combined make up 82 percent of the total. Very few workers are in their 50s or older, which suggests that workers in the sports industry are much younger than those in other industries. By sport, yachting shows a much higher average age compared with the others.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1012690210384650">Table 2</xref> shows the labor market characteristics of each sport. The average wage is the highest in soccer (585,000 Korean won/week<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690210384650">1</xref></sup>), and is similar in golf (575,000 KW/week).

In those sports in which the average wage is high, the wage gap is also large.</p>

<p>Social insurance coverage is one of the indicators of job quality;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690210384650">2</xref></sup> one social insurance plan in Korea is the national pension. National pension coverage is highest in soccer (79.6%), followed by golf (72.1%); it is relatively quite low in tennis (55.8%) and yachting (42.5%). Coverages are similar for health insurance, industrial accident compensation insurance, and unemployment insurance. The survey results show that workplaces with social insurance coverage offer all four major insurance schemes, whereas those that do not, offer none. Very few workplaces offered only part of the four major insurance programs. Thus, there is little difference in coverage among the four major programs.</p>
<p>The difference in social insurance coverage by sport has something to do with firm size. In soccer and golf, firm sizes are relatively big, whereas in yachting and tennis they are relatively small. For example, 89 percent of soccer and 63.1 percent of golf workplaces employ 10 or more people, whereas only 22.1 percent of yachting and 22 percent of tennis workplaces employ 10 or more people.</p>
<p>The workplaces are relatively large in soccer and golf, and feature higher social insurance coverage, higher average wages, and a bigger wage gap. In comparison, workplaces in yachting and tennis are relatively small, and feature lower social insurance coverage, lower average wages, and a smaller wage gap.</p>
<p>As such, there are similarities and relatively few differences between the soccer and golf sectors, and between yachting and tennis. Thus, soccer and golf could be assigned to one group, and yachting and tennis to another. Based on the analysis framework in the previous section, spectatorship (i.e. level of media exposure, or level of industrialization in relation to the media) affects the labor market characteristics of a particular sport more strongly. Higher spectatorship numbers correspond with a larger firm size, higher social insurance coverage and average wages, and a bigger wage distribution. In contrast, lower spectatorship numbers correspond with a smaller workplace, lower social coverage insurance, lower average wages, and a smaller wage gap. Participation, however, has little impact on labor market characteristics.</p>
<p>Aside from the conclusion that spectatorship affects the labor market characteristics of a sport, other possibilities can be explored. For example, individual characteristics such as age, education, college major, skill level, or experience could also result in wage gaps.</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we analyzed the number of years in service (or experience) by sport, and found that golf averaged 6.2 years of experience, tennis 6.0 years, yachting 5.3 years, and soccer 5.2 years. There is little difference in experience by sport, and experience seems to have no correlation with the labor market characteristics identified above.</p>
<p>In terms of education, the percentage of highly educated (college or higher, including graduate school) is as follows: soccer, 76.2 percent; yachting, 68.4 percent; golf, 59.6 percent; and tennis, 44.7 percent. The percentage is highest in soccer (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690210384650">Table 1</xref>). In terms of age, the percentage of workers in their 20s and 30s in soccer is 88.1 percent, in tennis is 80.2 percent, in golf is 77.2 percent, and in yachting is 71.4 percent. The age among soccer industry workers is very low. In terms of college major, the percentages of those who majored in non-sports studies (humanities, business management, social science, engineering, etc.) are as follows: soccer, 56.4 percent; tennis, 53.4 percent; golf, 37.7 percent; and yachting, 34.4 percent. There are many young, highly educated workers in soccer who did not major in sports. This is because soccer is a Popular sport. The relatively high average wage in the soccer market results from the combination of the sport’s industrialized level and workers’ individual characteristics. But such an association between labor market characteristics and demographic characteristics is not found in other sports.</p>
<p>Overall, spectatorship, more than demographic characteristics (age, education, experience) or participation, has a determining impact on labor market characteristics such as firm size, wages, and social insurance coverage.</p>
<p>That media industry characteristics (mainly related to the sports consumer behavior of spectatorship) have an impact on labor market characteristics is also supported by the participants’ response to a survey question that asked why they work in a particular sport. As seen <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1012690210384650">Figure 4</xref>, a much higher percentage of workers in soccer and golf responded that they entered their chosen field because it has a good prospect of developing as an industry.</p>

<p>First, sports marketing is the hallmark of a sport becoming industrialized, whose goals is attracting more spectators or members, selling sports-related goods or facilities and training programs, and otherwise trying to secure funding for sports organizations. Sports marketing is included as a main career goal in golf and soccer. As seen earlier, these two sports are characterized by high levels of spectatorship. In yachting and tennis, for which there are fewer spectators, the main career goal is online sports equipment seller. These results seem to reflect the difference in the level of industrialization, represented by the level of media involvement in spectatorship. In other words, the sports for which sports marketing is included as one of the main career goals have a higher level of industrialization than the sports for which online sports equipment selling is one of the main career goals.</p>
<p>Another frequently mentioned career goal is professional coaching. A professional coach is the leading position among sports instructors, who enhance players’ performance by delivering techniques and knowledge, analyzing players’ physical condition, and providing moral support. It is included in soccer and tennis as one of the main career goals. These sports share a high relative level of participation. In comparison, professional coaching is not included in golf and yachting, both of which feature low relative levels of participation.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1012690210384650">Table 5</xref> presents a breakdown of satisfaction levels by category. It shows that current objective working conditions such as wages, welfare and benefits, and job security have little correlation with subjective satisfaction level. For example, whereas in soccer satisfaction with working conditions and job security is highest, satisfaction with welfare and benefits is lowest. It is interesting that although yachting trails both soccer and golf in overall satisfaction, it leads in a few categories: learning, use of skills/capabilities, wages/compensation, welfare and benefits, and work environment. Unlike yachting, golf ranks second in overall and average satisfaction, and ranks first only in job security. Similarly, tennis ranks first in satisfaction with work hours. The satisfaction level is generally low in tennis, aside from work hours, and welfare and benefits. As observed earlier, wage/compensation satisfaction is highest in yachting, where the average wage is low, and is lowest in golf, where the average wage is relatively high.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>There are several possible explanations for these characteristics; however, a general explanation can apply here: because satisfaction is subjective, it can be different from objective indicators. Aside from this, it may also be that in a Popular sport such as soccer, there is greater differentiation in wages or working conditions, resulting in lower satisfaction among those in lower positions, which in turn lowers the sport’s overall average to a level similar to those of other sports.</p>
<p>Although there is only a weak correlation between objective labor market characteristics and subjective satisfaction, in some categories the correlation is stronger: the development potential of the field, the future potential of the job, fairness of HR management, and communication/interpersonal relations. For example, satisfaction with the development potential of the field and the future potential of the job is highest in soccer, followed by golf, yachting, and tennis, a pattern that matches the respective sports’ actual development potential as measured by level of spectatorship.</p>

<title>5. Discussion from Bourdieu’s perspective</title>
<p>This study has demonstrated so far that the way a particular sport is practiced socially, as either a spectator or a participation sport, largely determines the characteristics of those who are involved in producing that sport, or its labor market. Thus, we can ask why there are more or fewer spectators in a particular sport, or why there is more or less participation in a particular sport, as well as whether spectatorship has a bigger impact than participation on a sport’s labor market.</p>
<p>We can use Bourdieu’s argument on the practice of sports as the starting point for this discussion. Bourdieu emphasized that the taste and practice of a sport depend not only economic capital and spare time but also the social meaning of the sport practice:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the probability of taking up the different sports depended, within the limits defined by economic (and cultural) capital and spare time, on perception and assessment of the intrinsic and extrinsic profits of each sport in terms of the dispositions of the habitus, and more precisely, in terms of the relation to the body, which is one aspect of this. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690210384650">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>: 212)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The practice of a particular sport is determined by its associated costs and benefits, and the latter include not only the sport’s inherent characteristics but also the social meaning associated with the activity. That is, ‘to the ‘‘intrinsic’’ profits which are expected from sport for the body itself, one must add the social profits, those accruing from any distinctive practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690210384650">Bourdieu, 1978</xref>: 836).</p>
<p>The economic characteristics of each class determine participation in a sport, and they also play an important role in altering its social image. This is why there is a clear distinction between the sports favored by members of the upper class and those favored by members of the working class. As mentioned earlier, golf and yachting are mostly enjoyed by members of the upper class, and are strongly associated with the social image of noble sports. As demonstrated in this study, both golf and yachting enjoy very low popular participation. In other words, if we focus only on participation, Bourdieu’s argument can directly serve as the conclusion of this article.</p>
<p>But if spectatorship is added, the picture becomes more complex. Despite their vastly different images and participating classes, golf and soccer share much in terms of spectatorship. Why is it that golf, with its noble image, and soccer, with its popular, or working-class, image, both enjoy such high viewership? And why is it that yachting, with its noble image, receives such low viewership? Discussion regarding these questions is closely related to the characteristics of modern sports – and to the dominance of spectator sports.</p>
<p>The development of spectator sports appears to be the combination of a) the commercialization of sports (i.e. professional sports), and b) the marriage of mass media and sports. The commercialization of sports means that the supply, demand, and social meaning of sports are becoming increasingly dominated by the principles of production or of profit-seeking. Thus, it becomes readily apparent why a popular sport such as soccer, just like a popular mass-produced product, draws strong viewership. But looking for reasons why the noble sport of golf enjoys such high viewership is not as easy. Some experimental explanation is given as follows.</p>
<p>First, since most of the golfing population is still limited to members of the upper class, the main body of golf viewership is likely to be composed of the same class of people. Thus, the supply of golf as a spectator sport may be a trend in the industry to fulfill the demand of a small number of people with high purchasing power. But this explanation is not compelling enough, as the upper class cannot make up a majority.</p>
<p>The following explanation appears to be more compelling. Modern society has turned sports into a typified social institution that disseminates and delivers social values, and the advent of spectator sports, or the combination of sports and mass media, has reinforced this function. Although the practice of golf is limited mostly to members of the upper class, its joining forces with mass media strips away its exclusive social image. In fact, golf in Korea in the past was fodder for social denunciations, as it was seen as a sport of the few and often associated with wrongdoings among members of the upper class. But the mass media tried to bestow on golf a more popular appeal, portraying it as a ‘gentlemen’s sport’, or a ‘sport of mental discipline’. In the end, golf seems to have succeeded somewhat in shedding its antisocial image, acquiring a layer of popular appeal while retaining its high-class image.</p>
<p>The mass media transform what used to be a sport of the few into a popular sport. But the popularization of a sport is at once a widening of its presence and an altering or refining of its meaning. In the case of Korea, golf, carried through the mass media, did in fact become a more popular sport as it shed its negative image as a sport of the few, and as more people outside the upper class began to take up its practice. This is an inevitable result of golf’s joining with the mass media. The popularization of the sport (in terms of social image and practice) also means that its social meaning of differentiation, or distinction, has considerably weakened. As golf’s exclusivity wanes, some have turned their attention to horseback riding or yachting, activities with a stronger high-class image, which indicates that these sports have now taken the place of golf as emblems of a noble image.</p>
<p>The industrialization of sports, led by the rise in spectator sports, seems to either justify or weaken the differentiating role of participation sports. The main target of such justifying or weakening of the differentiation is the middle class semi-high class, especially in Marxist terminology, the petit bourgeoisie. The process of a sport’s popularization by becoming a spectator sport a) waters down the social criticism of the distinction factor in the sport, helping the upper class maintain its vested interests; and b) includes the middle class in the participating fold, expanding the basis of differentiation. On the other hand, the upper class attempts to recover the distinction factor weakened by popular-sport status through the creation of new participation sports, new viewing arrangements (premium seats, paid cable TV), or more high-end goods (expensive golf clubs, golf courses).</p>

<title>6. Conclusion</title>
<p>Comparison of employment characteristics, career goals, and job satisfaction in the four chosen sports reveals differences in their labor market characteristics. Thus, the hypotheses defined above are supported. Most noticeable are the differences between the high-spectator soccer/golf and the low-spectator tennis/yachting. In short, the level of spectatorship for a particular sport is a major determinant of its labor market characteristics. The same trend is commonly found in employment characteristics and career goals, and, although to a lesser extent, in the overall job satisfaction level. In terms of employment conditions, the Popular sport soccer and the Media sport golf are characterized by relatively larger businesses, higher social insurance coverage and average wages, and a bigger wage distribution. In comparison, the Non-popular sport yachting and the Leisure sport tennis are characterized by smaller businesses, lower social insurance coverage, lower average wages, and a smaller wage distribution. Overall, level of spectatorship has a bigger impact on employment characteristics such as business size, wage, and social insurance coverage than do demographic traits (age, education, and experience) or the level of participation.</p>
<p>As for career goals, there are large differences by sport. Sports marketing was a common main career goal in the Popular sport (soccer) and the Media sport (golf), online sports equipment seller was common to the Leisure sport (tennis) and the Non-popular sport (yachting), and professional coaching in a group sport was common to the Popular sport (soccer) and the Leisure sport (tennis). This shows that career goals tend to be similar in sports with a high level of spectatorship, in sports with a low level of spectatorship, and in sports with high level of participation.</p>
<p>Average satisfaction was higher in soccer and golf than in tennis and yachting, which indicates that workers in the high-spectator Popular sport and Media sport are more satisfied with their jobs than those in the Leisure sport and Non-popular sport. At the same time, wage satisfaction is the highest in yachting, where the average wage is low, and the lowest in golf, where the average wage is relatively high.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Bourdieu, whereas tastes in sports used to be expressed through the mechanism of participation, today (in Korea), they are expressed through the industrialized mechanism of spectatorship. At a time when the only link between sports and consumers was ‘participation’, tastes in a particular sport became visible through participation. But today, the rise of media such as television or the Internet enables tastes to be expressed through the act of viewing, an act that becomes embedded in the structure and becomes another source of differentiation. In other words, although the appearance has changed from participation to viewing, Bourdieu’s intuitive judgment remains valid more than 30 years later in Korea, in the labor market of the sports industry. That said, it is necessary to more thoroughly analyze the highly complex way through which the social meaning of a sport develops as capitalism’s profit-seeking principles overtake the supply-demand mechanism in sports.</p>
