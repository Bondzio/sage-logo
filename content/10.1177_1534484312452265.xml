<p>We explore opportunities for assessing and advancing Human Resource Development (HRD) research through an integrative literature review of scientometric theories and methods. Known as the “science of science,” scientometrics is concerned with the quantitative study of scholarly communications, disciplinary structure and assessment and measurement of research impact. The integrative review of scientometric literature showed importance in evaluating HRD research and publications, including citation analysis, citing behavior analysis, and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journal quality control process. We discuss three major implications for engaging HRD scholars in evaluating and assessing HRD research and scholarly communications for the quality control and self-regulation of HRD research.</p>

<body>
<p>With several decades’ continued efforts in theory building and research, Human Resource Development (HRD) has evolved into a system of integrated discipline. This system currently includes (a) a leading research association, the Academy of Human Resource Development (AHRD), (b) a suite of four journals, <italic>Advances in Developing Human Resources</italic> (<italic>ADHR</italic>), <italic>Human Resource Development International</italic> (<italic>HRDI</italic>), <italic>Human Resource Development Review</italic> (<italic>HRDR</italic>), and <italic>Human Resource Development Quarterly</italic> (<italic>HRDQ</italic>), (c) three international research conferences held annually in three continents, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, and (d) an increased number of universities offering HRD degrees around the world. Although research on evaluating HRD and training interventions in organizational settings has been a hot topic for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1534484312452265">Wang &amp; Spitzer, 2005</xref>), the assessment of HRD research quality and associated affect has yet to receive adequate attention in the literature. Recent advances in scientometrics and related technologies have made it possible for scholars to evaluate and assess HRD research. This article is an initial effort in promoting the assessment of HRD research and related communication by applying scientometrics for continuing strengthening HRD research. Scientometrics, known as the “science of science” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534484312452265">Moravcsik, 1984</xref>), is concerned with the quantitative study of scientific communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312452265">Geisler, 2005</xref>). Its basic tenet is that knowledge creation and control is amenable to, thus equally subject to, measurement and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312452265">Leydesdorff, 2001</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1534484312452265">
<title>Research Question and Significance</title>
<p>We seek to address the following research question: How HRD research may benefit from scientometric analysis? The purpose is to explore opportunities for assessing and advancing HRD research and engage scholars in the measurement and evaluation of HRD research activities for quality control and self-regulation. Applying scientometic analysis for HRD research is likely reshape HRD research in the following aspects.</p>
<p>First, it may improve our understanding on the state of HRD research. Through scientometric research, HRD knowledge structure, research topics and evolving fronts, as well as HRD journal quality, can be effectively identified and assessed. It is also an effective way to understand and determine the overall quality and maturity level of HRD research. Second, applying scientometrics to HRD research offers potential to guide future HRD research through analysis of scholarly communications between HRD and related disciplines. This may further develop HRD’s unique identity as a discipline while contributing to the overall knowledge base. Third, scientometrics has long been considered a self-regulated control mechanism for the quality of scholarly journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1534484312452265">Taborsky, 2007</xref>), particularly when the peer-reviewed process is considered “flawed” on multiple counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1534484312452265">Smith, 2006</xref>, p. 178). HRD journals may benefit from scientometric analysis for improvement. In short, applying scientometrics for HRD research may help answer the following questions: (a) How do we know HRD research has made an impact on scholarly communities? (b) What is the quality of HRD research in relation to other related disciplines?</p>
<p>Given the vast literature and wide range of methods covered in the scientometric research, it is necessary for the review to be selective. We thus focus on the literature that can be applied for the assessment and evaluation of HRD research. In what follows, we first review the evolution of scientometrics as an interdisciplinary field of study, followed by two major areas of research on citation analysis and citing behavior analysis. We further discuss the role of Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) as a mechanism for the quality and effect of journal performance and highlight the latest advances in scientometric methods and indices in relation to journal performance and scholarly research impact. Lastly, we discuss the implications and future research opportunities for HRD research.</p>

<title>Scientometrics: Evolution and Scope</title>
<p>Scientometrics was originated in the 1920s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312452265">Gross and Gross (1927)</xref> proposed that data about citation rates be used by librarians to make acquisition decisions on academic journals for libraries with limited budget. Concurrently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534484312452265">Lotka (1926)</xref> derived productivity distribution among scientists, and was later known as Lotka’s law. The “Law of Scattering” further described mathematically how literature on a particular subject was distributed in academic journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312452265">Bradford, 1950</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312452265">Garfield (1955)</xref> extended the research and pioneered a “citation index” as a “bibliographic system for science literature that can eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers” (p. 108). Proposing the concept of “impact factor” (p. 109), Garfield suggested that a citation count of publications be more efficient than counting the number of publications for scholars’ productivity.</p>
<p>Built on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312452265">Garfield’s (1955)</xref> work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312452265">Price (1965)</xref> made it possible for scientometrics to become a discipline through analyzing massive citation data. Through quantitative modeling, this study unveiled how scientific networks were connected through published articles in natural sciences. It also discovered that citation-based analysis was able to identify the “nature of the scientific research fronts” (p. 149) for any disciplines. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1534484312452265">Zipf’s (1972)</xref> law of word frequency was associated with the frequency distribution predicted by the Bradford’s law. Subsequently, the Pratt Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1534484312452265">Pratt, 1977</xref>) was developed to measure the degree to which research publications on a given subject were concentrated within a collection of journals, referred to as the Bradford-Zipf Distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312452265">Bulick, 1978</xref>). Price (1976) further proposed a unifying theory for all the statistical “laws” in scientometrics to explain diverse behaviors such as article scatter, the frequency of keyword use, and a particular journal’s accumulated citation count.</p>
<p>Over time, scientometrics has evolved into an established interdisciplinary field of research that can be applicable to all natural and social sciences disciplinary research. Its scope covers three major areas. First, it examines a discipline’s general system development, disciplinary structure and interrelations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312452265">Leydesdorff, 2001</xref>) and explores the research frontier dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312452265">Price, 1965</xref>). Second, it focuses on the process of knowledge production, including quantitative assessment of intellectual potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312452265">Braun, Glänzel, &amp; Schubert, 1985</xref>) and communications in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312452265">Geisler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312452265">Leydesdorff, 2001</xref>), research productivity, and evaluation of scholars or institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534484312452265">Narin, 1976</xref>), research collaboration, and the structure of research communities and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1534484312452265">Price, 1965</xref>). Third, it studies the macroenvironment of scientific research—science policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312452265">Garfield, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534484312452265">Moe, Burger, Frankfort, &amp; van Raan, 1985</xref>), innovation processes (Panne, 2007), and globalized knowledge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534484312452265">McMillan &amp; Hamilton, 2000</xref>). To this end, understanding and applying the three areas of scientometrics for HRD research may facilitate further development and maturity of the field.</p>

<sec id="section3-1534484312452265">
<title>Citation Analysis</title>
<p>Knowledge creation involves more than research. Without communications, previous findings would be lost, and scholars would have to reinvent the wheels. In practice, research must be communicated through peer-reviewed publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1534484312452265">Schoonhaert &amp; Roelants, 1996</xref>). Research publications disseminate new findings and invite peers to use or criticize. When scholars accept or reject a published result, they indicate it in their writings in the form of a citation.</p>
<p>By definition, a <italic>citation</italic> is the reference of a published work by a more recent work. The latter is the “citing” item, and the one receiving the citation is the “cited” item. In scientometric analysis, citation counts are used as raw data and considered “unobtrusive measures that do not require the cooperation of a respondent and do not themselves contaminate the response (i.e., they are non-reactive)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1534484312452265">Smith, 1981</xref>, p. 84). As such, citation analysis is a method of exploring the structure and the interrelationship of a discipline. It can be used to examine the following three phenomena: (a) direct citation, (b) citation coupling, and (c) cocitation. Because scientometrics originated from analyzing citation counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312452265">Gross &amp; Gross, 1927</xref>), research on direct citation has been a critical component for understanding who cite what and why. Citation coupling analysis is to study the sharing of one or more references by two or more later studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534484312452265">Small, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1534484312452265">Van den Besselaar &amp; Leydesdorff, 1996</xref>). Cocitation analysis is to examine the pattern in which two or more earlier items are jointly cited by the later literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534484312452265">Small, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1534484312452265">Tsai and Wu (2010)</xref> have provided a recent example of cocitation and coupling analyses for knowledge structure in management research. The analysis generally involves in counting the number of citations occur or co-occur, providing insights on author cocitation, journal cocitation, or keyword cocitation. Apparently, changes in coupling and cocitation patterns over time in a discipline can offer insight for understanding the process of research evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1534484312452265">Tsai &amp; Wu, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Citation analyses have been explored at different levels for various purposes, including assessing and evaluating national science policies and disciplinary development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1534484312452265">Oppenheim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1534484312452265">Tijssen, van Leeuwen, &amp; van Raan, 2002</xref>), departments and research laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312452265">Bayer &amp; Folger, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534484312452265">Narin, 1976</xref>), books and journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312452265">Garfield, 1972</xref>), and individual scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312452265">Cole &amp; Cole, 1973</xref>). In these studies, citations counts in peer-reviewed publications were used to measure the effect of the cited items on related research topics. The rationale is that the cited publications are likely to generate more responses from scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1534484312452265">van Raan, 2005</xref>). In the literature, citation analysis is often associated with two competing research paradigms: The normative theory and the social constructivist theory of citing behavior. Both are rooted in broader social theories of science.</p>
<sec id="section4-1534484312452265">
<title>The Normative Theory</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312452265">Merton’s (1988)</xref> sociology of science, normative theory states that scholars (should) acknowledge research contributions of their colleagues by citing their work. Hence, citations signify intellectual or cognitive influence of earlier scholarly work.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The reference serves both instrumental and symbolic functions in the transmission and enlargement of knowledge. Instrumentally, it tells us of work we may not have known before, some of which may hold further interest for us; symbolically, it registers in the enduring archives the intellectual property of the acknowledged source by providing a pellet of peer recognition of the knowledge claim, accepted or expressly rejected, that was made in that source. (p. 622)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, the cognitive symbol connecting citing scholars to an earlier work may be examined through content analysis in the citation context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534484312452265">Small, 1982</xref>). For a given set of citing publications, the percent uniformity, or the degree to which citing scholars demonstrate consensus on the nature of the cited concept, can be estimated to identify the ideas symbolized by the cited items. Studies have adopted this approach to characterize the concept symbolizing nature of cited works by exploring the content in the citation context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1534484312452265">Small, 1982</xref>). Because of the intellectual and cognitive influence that can be ascribed to a citation, the normative theory considers evaluative citation analysis appropriate for the assessment of research quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1534484312452265">van Raan, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534484312452265">
<title>The Social Constructivist Theory</title>
<p>The social constructivist orientation in citation analysis is to explain citing behavior based on the constructivist sociology of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312452265">Knorr-Cetina, 1981</xref>). It questions the normative theory and the validity of evaluative citation analysis and argues that the cognitive aspect of publications has little influence on how they are received. Scholarly knowledge is socially constructed under the influence of political and financial resources and the use of rhetorical devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312452265">Knorr-Cetina, 1981</xref>). Thus, citations cannot be adequately described unidimensionally through the intellectual content of the publication itself. Scholars have different motivations for citation under given intellectual and practical environment, which are socially constructed. Citing is an aid to convince the audience that the knowledge claims in a new research represent an advance in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312452265">Gilbert, 1977</xref>). For this purpose, scholars tend to cite published work that they assume the audience will regard as “authoritative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312452265">Moed &amp; Garfield, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312452265">Cole (1992)</xref> aligns the two theoretical orientations with two concepts: Local knowledge outcomes (LKOs) and communal knowledge outcomes (CKOs). A LKO is produced in a particular context and may be influenced by social processes. A CKO is the work that is accepted by the research community as important and correct; and it may be generalized as independent of social process and environment. At the microlevel, LKO-based research may be conducted in specific social context and through a series of social processes. In this sense, the content of science is socially constructed. At the macrolevel with CKO, in phases that “normal science” is conducted, the normative theory of science may prevail. As such, core knowledge may be characterized by virtually universal consensus, and scholars can accept this knowledge as given and take it as a starting point for the research on local knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312452265">Cole, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical studies have examined the two theoretical orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312452265">Baldi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1534484312452265">Stewart, 1983</xref>). Examining the normative and social constructivist processes in the allocation of citations with a network-analytic model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312452265">Baldi (1998)</xref> has identified significant positive effects of cited article cognitive content and cited article quality on the probability of citations. It has confirmed a normative interpretation of the allocation of citations in which citations reflect the acknowledgement of intellectual contributions. However, it does not support the social constructivist view that citations are rhetorical tools of persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312452265">Baldi, 1998</xref>). In reviewing and reflecting on the theoretical development of scientometrics, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312452265">Cronin (2005b)</xref> has concluded that<disp-quote>
<p>The weight of empirical evidence seems to suggest that scientists typically cite the works of their peers in a normatively guided manner, and that these signs (citations) perform a mutually intelligible communicative function. (p. 1508)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, citation counts are often considered to have predictive power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312452265">Garfield (1986)</xref> has found that the expected affect of Nobel Prize winners on the scientific community is reflected significantly in their citation records long before they receive the prizes. In recent years, citation rates are becoming increasingly important in judging the research quality of journals, institutions and departments, as well as individual faculty members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312452265">Klein &amp; Chiang, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Another related area is co-word analysis. This type of analysis assumes that an article’s keywords symbolize the core content of its research topic and represent its link with the research problems. One or more of concurrent keywords in articles constitutes a link among studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1534484312452265">Tsai &amp; Wu, 2010</xref>). The presence of many co-occurrences around the same keyword(s) points to a locus of strategic alliance within studies that may correspond to a research topic. Co-word analysis thus reveals patterns and trends in a discipline through the associated strengths in the disciplines. In other words, co-word analysis visualizes the intellectual structure of a discipline into maps of the conceptual space, thus a time series of maps produces a trace of changes in the intellectual domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312452265">Ding, Chowdhury, &amp; Foo, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Citing Behaviors Analysis</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1534484312452265">Smith (1981)</xref>, the use of citation counts as an indicator of research impact is appropriate only if the following premises hold: (a) A citation means that the citing author has used the cited item; (b) a citation reflects the quality of that item; and (c) citations are made to the best possible works. However, the central problem of citation counts for measuring research impact is that standards and conventions of citation are not precisely formalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312452265">Cronin, 1982</xref>). A citation itself cannot disclose sufficient understanding on why exactly an author cites a certain item; neither can it reflect what specific aspect the author actually refers to in the cited item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312452265">Brooks, 1986</xref>). Therefore, exploring citing behaviors and factors determining when and why scholars cite others has been an area of study. Scientometricians have examined different citing behaviors in various disciplines. We summarize three major representatives of taxonomy on citing behaviors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534484312452265">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The literature has also explored factors that influence citing behaviors in various disciplines from multiple dimensions, including (a) time, (b) disciplinary, (c) journal, (d) article, and (e) author/reader dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312452265">Bornmann &amp; Daniel, 2008</xref>). With the passage of time and increases in research output, citations become more frequent, and it is expected to see citations for more recent publications than to older ones because more research advances are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312452265">Cawkell, 1976</xref>). Also, the more frequently a publication is cited in the past, the more frequently it will be cited in the future. Research has shown that the expected number of future citations is a linear function of the current citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312452265">Burrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312452265">Cano &amp; Lind, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, studies have revealed that citing behaviors and practices vary among disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312452265">Braun, Glänzel, &amp; Grupp, 1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312452265">1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312452265">Hargens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312452265">Hurt, 1987</xref>) and even within different areas of a subdiscipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312452265">Klamer &amp; van Dalen, 2002</xref>). In some disciplines, scholars cite recent literature more often than in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1534484312452265">Peters &amp; van Raan, 1994</xref>). As the possibility of being cited is associated with the number of journals in a discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534484312452265">Moed, Burger, &amp; Frankfort, 1985</xref>), smaller disciplines would generate fewer citations than more general fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312452265">King, 1987</xref>). This is likely to be the case for HRD compared to psychology or management.</p>
<p>The citation of an article is found to be dependent on the frequency of publication of journals containing related articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1534484312452265">Stewart, 1983</xref>). The order of an article arranged in a journal issue also affects the citation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1534484312452265">Smart &amp; Waldfogel, 1996</xref>). A journal’s accessibility, visibility, and internationality as well as the quality or prestige influence the probability of citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312452265">Boyack &amp; Klavans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534484312452265">Moed et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1534484312452265">Yue &amp; Wilson, 2004</xref>). Methodology or conceptual and literature review pieces tend to attract more citations than empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312452265">Cano &amp; Lind, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312452265">MacRoberts &amp; MacRoberts, 1996</xref>). We perceive this is likely to be the case for <italic>HRDR</italic> given its editorial policy on conceptual and review articles.</p>
<p>Positive correlations have been identified between citation frequency and the number of coauthors, the length of an article, and the references listed in an article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312452265">Baldi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312452265">Boyack &amp; Klavans, 2005</xref>). The article dimension is linked to the author/reader dimension. As citations are often affected by social networks, authors tend to cite works by those with whom they are personally acquainted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1534484312452265">White &amp; McCain, 1998</xref>). This results in greater reciprocal exchange of citations over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312452265">Cronin, 2005a</xref>). In the HRD literature, although these phenomena can be observed, empirical investigation may help understand the sociology of HRD research network and its relationship with knowledge production.</p>

<title>Problems in Citing Behavior and Citation Analysis</title>
<p>An important assumption for citation analysis is that scholars will cite sources that influence their research, and they ensure that cited items are of better and higher quality among all citables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312452265">Borgman &amp; Furner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312452265">Cronin, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1534484312452265">Smith, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1534484312452265">Van Raan, 2005</xref>). Yet, the literature has found that the assumption does not always hold in reality because of the complexity of, and unregulated, citing behaviors that can make analysis problematic or even distort citation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312452265">MacRoberts &amp; MacRoberts, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312452265">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1534484312452265">Radicchi &amp; Castellano, 2012</xref>). Of the problems identified, we highlight those likely to be encountered in HRD research and publications.</p>
<p>First, because of the oversight or lack of awareness, scholars may not cite most influential and relevant items in their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312452265">Garfield, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312452265">MacRoberts &amp; MacRoberts, 1996</xref>). Second, biased citing is frequently found in published items. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312452265">MacRoberts and MacRoberts (1987)</xref> uncovered that only 37% of 13 facts were cited correctly in 93 citations in a study of the history of genetics, and the citing was highly biased. Notably, an important cause of citing bias revealed in the same study is secondary source citations. Of the citations analyzed,<disp-quote>
<p>38% were to secondary sources; that is, over one-third of the “credit” given was taken from the discoverer and allotted to someone who had nothing to do with the discovery. (p. 344)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A third problem is perceived excessive self-citing. It was estimated this type of citations varying from 10% to 30% of the overall citations depending on disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312452265">MacRoberts &amp; MacRoberts, 1996</xref>). Through text analysis and expert interview, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312452265">Hyland (2003)</xref> has found that self-citing “reflect(s) both the promotional strategies of individuals and the epistemological practices of their disciplines” (p. 251). More recently, in scrutinizing four psychological journals published in 2006 and 2007, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312452265">Brysbaert and Smyth (2011)</xref> have reported 0% to 45% of self-citation and concluded that it is “a self-serving bias motivated by self-enhancement and self-promotion” (p.129).</p>
<p>All three problems may exist in the HRD research. The first problem sometimes may be addressed through peer-review process. The second problem, especially crediting to a wrong source through secondary referencing can be observed. The self-citing in HRD is also not uncommon. Studies exploring these issues in the HRD publications may enhance our awareness of the status and severity for conscientious research rigor.</p>
<sec id="section8-1534484312452265">
<title>The issue of multiple authorship</title>
<p>How to allocate appropriate credit among multiple coauthors affects the accuracy and credibility of citation analysis on scholarly impact. Traditional practices have been (a) exclusive counting—giving the full credit to the first author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312452265">MacRoberts &amp; MacRoberts, 1996</xref>), (b) inflationary counting—distributing the full credit repeatedly to all coauthors, or (c) equalizing counting—dividing the credit among all coauthors with equal fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312452265">Eggert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312452265">Hagen, 2008</xref>). Given its importance on research ethics and scholarly performance, the literature has been exploring solutions in two areas. One is to advocate changing “authorship” to “contributorship” for “disclosing to the reader of every participant’s contribution to the work and to the manuscript” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1534484312452265">Rennie, Yank, &amp; Emanuel, 1997</xref>, p. 582). Guidelines have been proposed to make the contributions of coauthors more specific and transparent in addition to coauthor ranking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312452265">Eggert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534484312452265">Frazzetto, 2004</xref>). However, these guidelines are not widely known and the practices have been rare. The second area is to develop analytical tools for allocating credit of coauthorship. Recently, a <italic>p</italic>-index has been proposed to give credit according to authorship rank and number of coauthors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1534484312452265">Prathap, 2011</xref>). It is to “combine fractional credit simultaneously on a paper and citation basis for each paper to compute the fractional value” for each coauthor (p.240). The <italic>p</italic>-index measure is still based on the assumption of “contributorship” and has not been empirically tested nor widely adopted.</p>

<title>The Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)</title>
<p>To be listed by the SSCI has become a synonym of quality for all social science journals, particularly when citation-based SSCI journals become a key measure for institutional decisions about appointments, promotions, salaries, resources, and awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312452265">Klein &amp; Chiang, 2004</xref>). A similar trend is also emerging in the HRD community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1534484312452265">Russ-Eft, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534484312452265">2010</xref>). Whether a journal can be included in SSCI depends on the following: (a) Meeting its own publication schedule; (b) Maintaining international editorial conventions. “These conventions include informative journal titles, fully descriptive article titles and abstracts, complete bibliographic information for all cited references, and full address information for every author” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312452265">Testa 2008</xref>, p. 72). (c) Being peer reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534484312452265">Garfield 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312452265">Testa 2008</xref>). (d) Having broad geographic representation among the authors of the journal and of the articles cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534484312452265">Garfield 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312452265">Testa 2008</xref>); and (e) Circularity in terms of citation by other SSCI journals (Garfield 1979, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534484312452265">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1534484312452265">Testa 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note an unfortunate historical fact from a science policy perspective. During the earlier years, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) missed an opportunity that might have made (Social) Science Citation Index [(S)SCI] a public service. From 1954 to 1960, failing to foresee the strategic importance of scientometrics in evaluating and assessing research, NSF rejected Garfield’s funding proposal requesting US$5,900 for a period of two years. The proposal was to conduct further research and create a publically accessible citation index (Lederberg, 2001). The rejections had forced Garfield to commercialize the idea that created the SCI and the SSCI in the 1960s. As such, it may not be necessary to question why academic communities should follow the “policing” of a for-profit corporation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312452265">Klein &amp; Chiang, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the literature has expressed concerns on SSCI’s practice in the following areas: (a) Selection criteria: It is observed that (S)SCI does not apply the criteria across all journals consistently. For example, a list of nonpeer reviewed magazines is included in SSCI, such as the <italic>Nation, New Republic, Commentary</italic>, and <italic>Fortune</italic> magazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312452265">Klein &amp; Chiang, 2004</xref>). (b) Disciplinary biases: Due to differences in citation practices and citing convention, citations in different disciplines may cause biased measure for the impact factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312452265">MacRoberts &amp; MacRoberts, 2010</xref>). (c) Authorship merit: SSCI gives equal credit to citations of coauthors. Although the cited articles in SSCI are listed by first author only, this does not prevent citation analysis from accrediting these citation counts to all coauthors. This has encouraged increasing numbers of publications with multiple co-authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1534484312452265">Schoonbaert &amp; Roelants, 1996</xref>). (d) Length of articles: Emphasis on citations caused authors to reduce the length of content into the least publishable unit for the purpose of driving up citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312452265">Maddox, 1989</xref>). (e) Self-citation: It is accepted, up to a limit, that self-citation can be justified (e.g., demonstrating a track record, or authority of, research). But when it surpasses the acceptable limit, it should be discounted. Yet, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) has not specified the “acceptable limit” and sometimes used 20% as a loose measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1534484312452265">Taubes, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, (S)SCI has gained popularity and an authoritative position on indexing quality journals and has been generally regarded as the “gold standard for databases offering indexing in the social sciences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312452265">Bedeian, Van Fleet, &amp; Hyman, 2009</xref>; p. 216). It has received praises widely as represented by the following quote:<disp-quote>
<p>The development of the Science Citation Index represented a fundamental breakthrough in scientific information retrieval. What began as a commercial product … has evolved into a sophisticated set of conceptual tools for understanding the dynamics of science. The concept of citation analysis today forms the basis of much of what is known variously as scientometrics, bibliometrics, infometrics, cybermetrics, and webometrics. Garfield’s invention continues to have a profound impact on the way we think about and study scholarly communication.

<sec id="section10-1534484312452265">
<title>Journal Quality and the Impact Factor (IF)</title>
<p>Journal quality is conventionally measured by a citation-based journal impact factor (JIF). The standard JIF is derived based on a period of two year. It may also be derived for any time period. There are two elements included in the computation: (a) the numerator, the number of cites in a given period to any items published by the journal; and (b) the denominator, the number of substantive articles published in the same period. <italic>Journal Citation Report (JCR)</italic> publishes annual JIFs to give more weight to rapidly changing fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312452265">Garfield, 1997</xref>). For example, a yearly JIF is calculated by dividing the number of current year citations (e.g., 2011) to a journal’s articles published in the previous two years (e.g., 2009 and 2010) by the combined total of these articles. The design of JIF includes a component of measuring editorial performance and judgment. For the denominator, it only includes peer-reviewed articles defined as substantive items and excludes nonsubstantive items such as editorials, interviews, book reviews etc. Yet, among the nonsubstantives, editorials often cite items published in the journals, and attract citations. These citations are added to the numerator for the JIF. Thus, the more an editorial cites its own articles or produces citations, all other things being equal, the greater the resulting JIF.</p>
<p>In relation to the JIF, a number of other metrics is also used to measure journal performance by SSCI, including citation density and half-life. Citation density is the average number of references cited per article. The half-life index is the number of journal publication years, going back from the current, which account for 50% of the total number of citations received by the cited journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312452265">Garfield, 2006</xref>). The half-1ife index is an indicator of the rate at which a journal’s articles become obsolete. This, in turn, may reflect the rate of obsolescence of knowledge in a journal’s subject area. For example, if a journal has a half-life of 4. It means that half of the citations the journal receives in a given year is to articles published during the previous four years. The remaining years’ citations to the journal are dispersed among all the articles it publishes since the journal is founded. Research has found that these metrics are disciplinary specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312452265">Garfield, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the many controversies about the JIF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534484312452265">Hoeffel (1998)</xref> explained the reason for its popularity:<disp-quote>
<p>Experience has shown that in each specialty the best journals are those in which it is most difficult to have an article accepted, and these are the journals that have a high impact factor. Most of these journals existed long before the impact factor was devised. The use of impact factor as a measure of quality is widespread because it fits well with the opinion we have in each field of the best journals in our specialty. (p. 1225)</p>

<title>Recent Advances and Trends in Scientometrics</title>
<p>With the advancement of research and technology, more content and information resources are available online and more connections exist among publications. Scientometrics presents unprecedented opportunities to be applied in new ways and address new research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312452265">Bornmann &amp; Furner, 2002</xref>). Traditionally, the main source for citation analysis has been ISI’s database. The new developments make ISI no longer the only game in town. Lately, new citation databases such as Scopus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.scopus.com">www.scopus.com</ext-link>), Google Scholar, and CiteSeer (citeseer.ist.psu.edu) have emerged. This opens up new opportunities for research and related measurement and can be readily adopted for HRD research.</p>
<sec id="section12-1534484312452265">
<title>Developments in Research Performance Measures</title>
<p>Scientometrics has witnessed a number of breakthroughs on measuring research performance during the past few years as represented by an influential metric, <italic>h</italic>-index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312452265">Hirsch, 2005</xref>). A scholar or a journal has an index <italic>h</italic> if <italic>h</italic> of the overall published articles, denoted as <italic>Np</italic>, has at least <italic>h</italic> citations each and the remaining (<italic>Np</italic>—<italic>h</italic>) articles have fewer than or equal to <italic>h</italic> citations each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312452265">Hirsch, 2005</xref>). For instance, an <italic>h</italic>-index of 6 means that 6 of the unit’s (person or journal’s) overall publications have been cited at least 6 times each. The advantage of <italic>h</italic>-index is that it incorporates both quantity, the number of publications, and quality, the citations received, into one single indicator. While developed by a physicist, <italic>h</italic>-index has quickly been accepted by all disciplines applying scientometric for research performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312452265">Braun, Glänzel, &amp; Schubert 2006</xref>). However, the disadvantage of <italic>h</italic>-index was also noted as not being sensitive to one or more highly cited publications of the unit, thus likely to underestimate a journal or a scholar’s contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312452265">Egghe, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312452265">Egghe (2006)</xref> derives a <italic>g</italic>-index that offers “an improvement of the <italic>h</italic>-index to measure the global citation performance of a set of articles” (p. 131). The <italic>g</italic>-index is defined as, given a set of articles ranked in decreasing order of citations that a journal or a scholar receives, it is the unique largest number such that the top <italic>g</italic> articles received together at least <italic>g</italic><sup>2</sup> citations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312452265">Egghe, 2006</xref>). The <italic>g</italic>-index has gained popularity in the literature because of its obvious advantage. Also, to complement <italic>h</italic>-index’s lacking of consideration on time-related factor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1534484312452265">Sidiropoulos, Katsaros, and Manolopoulos (2007)</xref> derived a Contemporary <italic>h</italic>-index (<italic>hc</italic>-index). Retaining the advantages of original <italic>h</italic>-index, the <italic>hc</italic>-index adds an age-related weight to each cited article, giving less weight to older articles.</p>
<p>Most recently, a new complement, <italic>e</italic>-index was offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1534484312452265">Zhang (2009)</xref> to address the following weakness of the <italic>h</italic>-index. In its current form <italic>h</italic>-index cannot account for excess citations beyond the resulting needed <italic>h</italic>-score for different scholars or journals. This means that using <italic>h</italic>-index for a group of researchers or journals, they may either obtain an identical <italic>h</italic>-index with different citation counts. Or it is likely that a scholar or a journal may have received more citations distributed among multiple publications, but obtaining a lower <italic>h</italic>-score than others. The <italic>e</italic>-index assumes the unit under study has at least <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup> citations, but uses those excess citations that have not been used for the <italic>e</italic>-index calculation. The <italic>e</italic>-index has received acceptance in the matter of months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312452265">Dodson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, a measure known as eigenfactor, has been introduced to exclusively and comprehensively assess journal performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312452265">Bergstrom, 2007</xref>). Through a mathematical algorithm, eigenfactor uses an iterative ranking scheme to identify and rank journals, which are cited by other high ranking ones. It ranks journals by measuring “the total influence of a journal on the scholarly literature or, comparably, the total value provided by all of the articles published in that journal in a year” (p. 315). Eigenfactor creates immediate effect on scientometrics research and has been incorporated into <italic>JCR</italic> since 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312452265">Fersht, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>New Tools and Data Sources</title>
<p>Recent development in information technology has provided unrestricted access to new data sources for scientometrics analysis in almost all aspects for all disciplines. As SSCI used to be the only citation database tracking SSCI-indexed journal, the new alternatives allow scholars to analyze journals not included in SSCI. Such analysis may help editors gauge the timing for SSCI application or prepare for supporting documents. For example, a new open-access software, Publish or Perish (PoP), designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312452265">Harzing (2010)</xref> is available to worldwide research communities. This software incorporates most recent advances in metrics of citation analysis discussed above. It extracts citation data through Google Scholar’s (GS) advanced search function and produces all relevant indices and allows users to perform both journal and individual scholar research impact analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312452265">Harzing &amp; van der Wal, 2008</xref>). The software is well received by the worldwide scholarly communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312452265">Harzing. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The advances in assessing and evaluating research and the improved convenience in data sources and tools provide opportunities for HRD scholars for research and assessment. We discuss the implications and future research in HRD in relation to potential applications.</p>

<title>Implications and Future Research in HRD</title>
<p>Thus far, the HRD literature has hardly incorporated scientometric approaches in evaluating research communications with only a few exceptions. The absence of scientometric analysis in HRD may be caused by the following factors. First, as an emerging field, HRD research has been in an evolving process of identifying its theoretical and empirical bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1534484312452265">Swanson, 1999</xref>). The size of citation raw data for such analysis has been in an accumulating process. Second, the AHRD community has limited exposure to scientometric research and methods in the past. Recently, the AHRD leadership has emphasized the importance of research quality and related analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1534484312452265">Russ-Eft, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1534484312452265">2010</xref>). Third, it may be caused by a lack of awareness on the importance of self-regulation and assessment regarding the quality and rigor of HRD research. Some may consider that peer-reviewed publications imply the acceptance of the research quality thus there is no need for additional evaluative analysis.</p>
<p>Scientometrics can be naturally linked to improve HRD research. First, our review showed an imperative need for applying scientometric analysis for HRD research. HRD literature has accumulated sufficient citations for an in-depth understanding of the disciplinary interactions and the process of knowledge creation. It is also at an appropriate stage for HRD journal impact analysis on the role of HRD journals in knowledge dissemination and related impact. This is particularly important when a number of HRD journals are pursuing SSCI status with the recent success of <italic>HRDQ</italic> after its 20 years of pursuit. In fact, such effort has emerged in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534484312452265">Jo, Jeung, Park, and Yoon (2009)</xref> analyzed the citation network among the four HRD publications from 1990 to 2007. Recently, through a citation and content analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312452265">Jeung, Yoon, Park, and Jo (2011)</xref> identified top 20 most cited HRD articles by journals outside the AHRD community, revealing three key themes that have contributed to the overall knowledge base: (a) training transfer and evaluation, (b) learning in organizations, and (c) knowledge sharing and knowledge creation.</p>
<p>Second, as shown by other disciplines, applying scientometrics for HRD research can help understand HRD research development and maturity status. Through analyzing citation network, keywords co-occurrences, and related patterns around research topics, we may identify existing HRD knowledge structure and evolving fronts. A recent study offers a relevant example on management learning and education (MLE) scholarship, a shared research area with HRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1534484312452265">Wang, Rothwell, &amp; Sun, 2009</xref>). In exploring the legitimacy of MLE scholarship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1534484312452265">Rynes and Brown (2011)</xref> examined four MLE journals’ contribution to the current state of MLE research with multiple indicators of scholarly legitimacy. Particularly, the study used citation data from Google Scholar to measure the consequential legitimacy, and used editorial board members’ citation rates and <italic>h</italic>-index for the leadership legitimacy. The study have derived important future directions for MLE scholars and editors to advance the legitimacy of MLE scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1534484312452265">Rynes &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Future research may further explore the interactions of HRD research topics and knowledge structure. For example, literature has debated on what constitutes a foundation of HRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1534484312452265">Swanson, 1999</xref>). Yet it has not been clear about the acceptance of the three legged stool versus. the centipede model. With a citation and/or co-word analysis, one may identify the relevancy and the influence of the models. The outcome of such studies is likely to derive new theoretical perspectives. Similar research may also be conducted on HRD definitional research and other critical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1534484312452265">Wang &amp; Sun, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Last but not the least, understanding scientometric analysis is essential for HRD scholars conducting relevant, rigorous, and productive research. As citations are to give credit to the cited items, scholars are required to cite carefully based on the content, context, and the relevance of cited studies and avoid citing secondary references to credit wrong sources. Yet, it is not uncommon that some HRD articles cite literature out of the context and relevance to justify an argument. Self-regulated citing practice can not only contribute to the quality of research, but also add to the citation raw data for meaningful scientometric analysis at a later time.</p>
<p>Performing regular self-assessment of citation analysis has been proved to be an effective strategy for individual scholars’ career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312452265">Dodson, 2009</xref>). For HRD scholars, self-citation analysis and related <italic>h, e</italic>, and <italic>g</italic> scores can indicate one’s research impact beyond the number of publications. It can offer a quantifiable support for career development, such as tenure, promotion, or annual performance reviews. It may also provide insight and guidance for effectively allocating personal resources. For example, if one finds that a published work has not been cited for an extended period of time, it may indicate a time to develop a new research topic unless one has confidence that it will become a late citation buster know as sleeping beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312452265">Garfield, 1996</xref>). For doctoral students or junior scholars, general citation analysis may also offer insight during the process of developing one’s research agenda and priority.</p>
