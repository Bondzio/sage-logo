<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of maternal type 1 diabetes on the structure and function of the embryonic and neonatal mouse heart.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Type 1 diabetes was induced in female C57BL6/J mice using streptozotocin. Embryonic (n = 105) and neonatal hearts (n = 46) were examined using high-frequency ultrasound (US) and a cohort of E18.5 (n = 34) and 1-day-old pup hearts (n = 27) underwent histological examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Global cardiac hypertrophy in late gestation (E18.5) was evident on US in the diabetic group compared to controls with increased interventricular septal (IVS) thickness (0.44 ± 0.08 mm vs 0.36 ± 0.08 mm, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and increased left ventricular wall thickness (0.38 ± 0.04 mm vs 0.29 mm ± 0.05, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Isovolumetric relaxation time was initially prolonged in the diabetic group but resolved by E18.5 to control values. Histological examination at E18.5 demonstrated increased transverse measurements (2.42 ± 0.72 mm/g vs 1.86 ± 0.55 mm/g, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and increased IVS thickness (0.64 ± 0.20 mm/g vs 0.43 ± 0.15 mm/g, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) in diabetic embryos compared to control embryos.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Maternal hyperglycemia has severe effects on offspring with evidence of cardiac impairment and cardiac hypertrophy in the embryo. These effects persisted in the 1-day old but attenuated in the 1-week old suggesting cardiac remodeling after the hyperglycemic milieu of pregnancy is removed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetes is considered to be a major risk factor in pregnancy and maternal diabetes is well known to have teratogenic effects on the fetal heart.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112466298">1</xref>
</sup> Many studies have shown that maternal hyperglycemia has an adverse effect on the developing fetus, and it is thought that the dysmorphogenesis induced by diabetes occurs during organogenesis, prior to 8 weeks of gestation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112466298">2</xref>
</sup> The molecular mechanisms of diabetes-induced cardiac damage in the fetus and the implications for later life are still being explored. Although there is an increased risk of cesarean section<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112466298">3</xref>
</sup> and perinatal death<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112466298">4</xref>
</sup> with diabetic pregnancy compared to the background population, there is also a reported increased risk of a reversible cardiac complication known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112466298">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112466298">6</xref>
</sup> which affects up to 30% of the infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112466298">7</xref>
</sup> Studies of the cardiac effects of pregestational diabetes on the offspring report septal hypertrophy in the diabetic group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112466298">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112466298">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112466298"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112466298">10</xref>
</sup> Cardiac hypertrophy in IDMs is usually transient in nature and generally resolves itself within 6 months of postnatal life. Ventricular hypertrophy with outflow tract obstruction is detected in up to 30% of the IDMs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112466298">11</xref>
</sup> Thus, echocardiography examination of the developing fetus and newborn are of utmost clinical importance especially where symptoms of hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and cardiac compromise exist. Echocardiography findings of cardiomyopathy in fetuses of diabetic mothers from mid-late gestation have been described in human studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112466298">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112466298">10</xref>
</sup> The literature, however, is lacking data on experimental studies on the characterization of cardiomyopathy found in embryos and newborn offspring of diabetic mothers (ODMs). Clinical studies on fetal and neonatal cardiac hypertrophy and its correlation with third trimester glycosylated hemoglobin levels have varied in their conclusions. Some studies have shown a positive correlation with maternal hyperglycemia in the third trimester and neonatal septal hypertrophy<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112466298">12</xref>
</sup> whereas others have shown no such correlation.<sup>

<p>We sought to study the effects of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on cardiac function and structure in the mouse embryo and neonate. To do this we used the well-established streptozotocin-induced T1DM model in female C57BL/6J mice prior to mating.</p>

<sec id="section3-1933719112466298">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>Institutional ethical approval and Irish government licensing were obtained for all procedures. For all experiments the “Principles of laboratory animal care” (NIH publication no. 85-23, revised 1985) were followed. Male and female C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks of age) were purchased from Charles River, United Kingdom. Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages, with 12 hours light/darkness cycle and were given continuous access to food (2018 expanded irradiated Harlin lab diet) and water. Food was removed 4 hours prior to streptozotocin (STZ) injections and 6 hours prior to fasting blood glucose (FBG) measurements. A total of 68 female C57BL/6J mice were included in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719112466298">
<title>Streptozotocin-Induced T1DM</title>
<p>The Website “Animal Models of Diabetic Complications Consortium” was used in these experiments (http://www.diacomp.org). Mice were weighed prior to injection and STZ dosage was calculated. Streptozotocin (Sigma-Aldrich Co, Wicklow, Ireland) was dissolved in 0.1 mol/L of sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5 and used within 10 minutes of formulation. Drinking water supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) was provided to mice 24 hours postinjection. Of all, 54 mice received intraperitoneal injections of STZ (10 received 50 mg/kg STZ over 5 consecutive days and 44 received 75 mg/kg over 3 consecutive days). In all, 4 mice were given a sham intraperitoneal injection of sodium citrate buffer and 10 received no intraperitoneal injection. In order to establish a glycemic profile of each animal, FBG measurements were taken over 2 consecutive days. Diabetes was diagnosed once fasting glucose readings were ≥11.0 mmol/L over 2 consecutive days. Female C57BL/6J mice were time-mated with nondiabetic male C57BL/6J mice after a minimum period of 2 weeks from the date of the final STZ injection to allow for adequate wash out time for STZ. The FBG measurements were recorded on the day prior to mating and then on gestation days E8.5, E12.5 and E16.5, and in between pregnancies. Blood was obtained via tail venopuncture and measured using an Accu-Chek Compact Plus system (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Dublin, Ireland). The day of detection of a vaginal plug was designated as E0.5; then, females were placed in an individual cage for the remainder of the pregnancy. Newborn pups remained with the mother; cross-fostering was not used in this study. If the gestation age of the pregnant mouse was not precisely known the data were omitted from the study; this occurred when a vaginal plug was not identified and the mouse became pregnant. In the interest of the animal’s welfare, insulin (1 IU/100 g Caninsulin, Merck &amp; Co, Inc, Dublin, Ireland) was administered to mice daily over a course of 3 days once FBG levels were &gt;25 mmol/L on any occasion. In the absence of signs of deteriorating health (continuing weight loss, decreased movement, hunched back, etc), these animals remained in the study. In this study, 13 of the 36 mice from the diabetic group and 1 of the 18 from the prediabetic group received insulin therapy. Extra bedding for the cage and continuous replenishment of water were given to hyperglycemic mice that became polyuric. A bolus of saline was given subcutaneously to any mouse that experienced weight loss &gt;10% from a preinjection baseline.</p>

<title>High-Frequency Ultrasound Imaging</title>
<p>Pregnant mice were examined using the Vevo 770 Biomicroscope Ultrasound System (Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada), on days E10.5, E12.5, E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, and at 1 week of postnatal age. For ultrasound (US) evaluation of the embryos, the mother was anesthetized using isoflurane gas (initially 4% followed by 1%-1.5% maintenance) as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112466298">15</xref>
</sup> Hair over the maternal abdomen was removed using a chemical hair remover, Veet (Reckitt Benckiser, Slough, United Kingdom). Prewarmed US gel (Aquasonics, New Jersey) was placed on the abdomen and with a 55-MHz real-time microvisualization probe, embryos close to the maternal skin were visualized through the maternal abdomen. Approximately 4 to 5 embryos could be seen clearly with each US examination; embryos lying posteriorly were not included. Doppler measurements were acquired only when the US beam could be aligned parallel to the direction of blood flow. Similarly, m-mode measurements were recorded when the beam could be aligned perpendicular to the structure in question; therefore, not all measurements could be obtained in every embryo. Maternal physiologic homeostasis was carefully maintained; body temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and maintained at 36°C to 38°C. Electrocardiogram and respiratory rate were monitored continuously during all the scans. Mice were scanned at approximately the same time of day. Each pregnant mouse was scanned 5 times during pregnancy. All mice tolerated the examination extremely well; no mice were lost during or after the US examination and all recovered within 2 minutes from general anesthesia. Temperature control was crucial to maintaining a normal maternal heart rate. Imaging time was kept to a minimum (15-20 minutes for pregnant mice and 7-10 minutes for 1-week olds). Only data from pregnancies where the exact gestation age of the embryos was known were included in this study. In the control group containing 10 mice, 3 had more than 1 pregnancy (maximum 2 pregnancy for each mouse), giving a total of 13 control pregnancies. In the diabetic and prediabetic groups, a total of 3 mice also had more than 1 pregnancy (maximum 2 pregnancies for each mouse).</p>
<p>Functional cardiac parameters in control embryos were recorded as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112466298">15</xref>
</sup> Diastolic function was assessed by measuring early/late (E/A) wave ratio and the isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT). Systolic function was assessed by measuring isovolumetric contraction time (ICT), peak aortic systolic velocity, and ventricular ejection fraction. Global cardiac function was assessed by calculation of the myocardial performance index (MPI). This measurement takes into account systolic and diastolic function and is independent of heart rate and cardiac morphology and is previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112466298">15</xref>
</sup> Pulsatility index of the umbilical artery and heart rate were also measured. Structural cardiac parameters—such as interventricular septal (IVS) thickness, left ventricular posterior wall, and left ventricular cavity diameter in diastole—were measured. Each US measurement taken was a mean of 3 consecutive measurements. Both IVRT and ICT are expressed as a fraction of the length of 1 cardiac cycle (RR). The scanning time was on average of 15 to 20 minutes and analysis was carried out off-line. Recovery took 1 to 2 minutes post US examination.</p>
<p>Neonatal cardiac function and structure were assessed in 1-week-old offspring. Mice were sedated using 3% isoflurane. Anesthesia was maintained at 1% to 1.5% isoflurane. Hair removal was not required in a pup of this age. Scanning time was typically 7 to 9 minutes; measurements, as detailed above, were taken off-line to keep imaging time to a minimum.</p>

<sec id="section6-1933719112466298">
<title>Histology and Morphometric Analysis</title>
<p>On day E18.5 of gestation, a cohort of mothers were sacrificed using cervical dislocation while under anesthesia (3% isoflurane). Embryos were excised from their amniotic sacs and, once death was confirmed, were placed in 10% formalin for a minimum of 24 hours. Body weights were recorded and samples were labeled so that each embryo could be traced to a particular mother. The left upper limb was removed from the animal prior to fixation, to aid in orientation. Hearts remained encased in the torso to improve accuracy of the orientation when obtaining tissue sections and increase ease of sample handling. Following fixation in 10% formalin, heart tissue was dehydrated using the Leica 2000 system, programme 4. Tissue samples were dehydrated by submersion in increasing concentrations of ethanol. Tissue was submerged in 50% (vol/vol) ethanol for 15 minutes, washed twice with 70% (vol/vol) ethanol for 15 minutes, followed by 2 washes with 90% (vol/vol) ethanol for 15 minutes and 3 washes with 100% (vol/vol) ethanol for 15 minutes. Samples were then submerged in 100% (vol/vol) ethanol overnight at 4°C. Samples were placed in 100% wax at 65°C for 2 hours, after which they were placed in a plastic mold using a tweezers. Samples were submerged in wax and allowed to set on an ice tray. Sections were trimmed at 20 µm then cut at 6 µm using a microtome (Finesse 325, Thermo Shandon, Inc, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.). The tissue slices were floated on 2% (vol/vol) ethanol to aid uncurling. Sections were then lifted from the ethanol and floated briefly in a water bath (45°C) and were then lifted from the water using a microfrost slide and allowed to dry in an oven at 65°C for 90 minutes. Tissue samples were then stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin using a Leica Autostainer.</p>
<p>A Nikon 50i microscope with 20x lens was used for all histological measurements, which were carried out in millimeters (mm) to 1 decimal point. In order to ensure sections were taken in the same plane, measurements were taken from sections cut in a transverse plane. Five different measurements of the fixed heart were taken, transverse, apical, right ventricle, left ventricle, and the interventricular septum. Measurements were taken from a transverse section of the heart, once the right and left ventricle and interventricular septum were all clearly visualized in between the mitral valve and papillary muscle level and in the direction of apex to atria. Measurement of the transverse dimension of the heart was recorded along the apex to aortic valve where a 4-chamber view was available. The transverse measurements were taken from the outer aspect of the ventricular wall to the outer aspect of the opposite ventricular wall. The apical measurement was from the outer aspect of the ventricle wall to the base of the aortic valve leaflets. Compact myocardium was only measured. Areas with noncompaction or prominent trabeculations were not selected for the measurement of ventricle wall thickness. Of the 61 cases, 10 showed a single ventricle only. This may represent a congenital heart defect or cases where the heart has been not correctly oriented in the paraffin block or inadequately sectioned for histological assessment. A transverse diameter was measured in these cases only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1933719112466298">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Variables measured at the different gestation stages were compared using a 1-way analysis of variance. Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were then carried out as a post hoc test. Unpaired 2-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test was also used where appropriate. The mean values are expressed as ±standard deviations (SDs). The proportion testing was carried out to calculate statistical differences between 2 proportions at a 90% confidence level, using the Pearson chi-squared algorithm. Using published mean (SD) values for MPI<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112466298">15</xref>
</sup> at E18.5 in normal mouse embryos, recruitment of 23 embryos of type 1 diabetic pregnancy and 24 controls was allowed, with an 80% power at the 5% level and detection of a 20% (1 SD) difference in MPI.</p>

<title>Induction of T1DM With STZ</title>
<p>Female C57BL/6J mice were initially resistant to a single round of STZ injections at either a low dose (50 mg/kg per 5 days) or a high dose (75 mg/kg per 3 days). A second round of STZ injections (75 mg/kg per 3 days) induced a moderate increase in FBG. Consecutive fasting glucose readings of 11.0 mmol/L were used as a level above which the mouse was considered diabetic (n = 36). Mice were deemed prediabetic (n = 18) when 2 or more consecutive fasting glucose readings were consistently between 7.9 and 11.0 mmol/L. This allowed us to differentiate the effect of hyperglycemia on the cardiac function and the structure in offspring from diabetic and prediabetic mothers. Control data were taken from mothers (n = 10) who received no injection. All mice that were prediabetic at conception went on to develop hyperglycemia in the diabetic range (&gt;11 mmol/L) by the end of pregnancy, with a mean fasting glucose of 9.9 ± 1.0 mmol/L at mating day, increasing to 21.7 ± 6.3 mmol/L at E16.5, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001. There was also an increase in fasting glucose levels with gestation in already diabetic females (16.9 ± 4.9 mmol/L at mating day to 28.0 ± 4.0 mmol/L at E16.5, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Pregnancy in nondiabetic, control females did not alter the blood glucose (5.4 ± 0.8 mmol/L at mating day to 5.3 ± 2.0 mmol/L at E16.5.</p>

<title>Diabetes Lowers Embryo Survival and Body Weight</title>
<p>Pregestational diabetes dramatically affected the survival rates and body weights of mouse embryos and neonatal offspring. The difference in survival beyond 24 hours between the ODMs and the offspring of prediabetic mothers was 19 (39%) of 49 versus 12 (52%) of 23, nonsignificant (NS). These rates were significantly lower than those from control pregnancies (91%, <italic>P </italic>&lt; .05). The average litter size in the diabetic group was lower than the prediabetic group (3.7 ± 2.4 pups vs 4.6 ± 2.3 pups). This compares to an average litter size of 8.1 ± 2.3 pups among the nondiabetic, control mothers. The body weights of offspring (0-1-day old) from the diabetic group were lower than the prediabetic group and nondiabetic controls (diabetic, 0.97± 0.22 g [n = 24] vs prediabetic, 1.2 ± 0.007 g [n = 2] vs nondiabetic 1.4 ± 0.12 g [n = 8]. Similarly, embryos from animals harvested at E18.5 from the diabetic group weighed significantly less than the prediabetic group and nondiabetic controls (0.70 ± 0.13 g [n = 16] vs 1.1 ± 0.07 g [n = 23] vs 1.2 ± 0.19 g [n = 34], <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Offspring born and embryos retrieved at E18.5 were inspected for gross anomalies. Defects, such as neural tube defects and anencephaly, were noted in 12 of the 44 ODMs; none were noted neither in the prediabetic group (0 of 49) nor in the control group (0 of 99).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have demonstrated US findings of impaired diastolic function and global cardiac hypertrophy in embryos of diabetic mothers. Histology shows evidence of cardiac hypertrophy at E18.5 and at 1 day of age. These findings extend our knowledge of the effects of diabetic pregnancy on offspring cardiac structure and function.</p>
<p>The US examination showed evidence of diastolic dysfunction during early to midgestation as evidenced by prolonged IVRTs on days E12.5 to E16.5. Prolonged IVRT suggests impaired relaxation and is often seen in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Although statistically significant differences were seen in IVRT at E12.5 and at E16.5, the difference at E14.5 calculated at (0.17 ms/ms vs 0.15 ms/ms) did not reach significance. The trend, however, of prolonged IVRT in the diabetic group persisted from E12.5 to E16.5. No differences were noted between groups at E18.5 or 1-week-old pups. These functional adaptations preceded structural changes that occurred toward the end of gestation, namely increased wall thickness with potential obstruction of the outflow tract causing an increased flow through the ventricular outflow tract.</p>
<p>These findings of early functional changes with late structural adaptation are similar to the findings in a clinical study from our group who carried out first, second, and third trimester echocardiograms on mothers with T1DM.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112466298">5</xref>
</sup> In the clinical study prolonged IVRT in the first trimester preceded increased interventricular thickness in the third trimester in the diabetic cohort.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112466298">5</xref>
</sup> In this current diabetic mouse study, there was no evidence of systolic dysfunction nor global cardiac functional impairment. There was increased velocity of blood flow through the ventricular outflow tract in both our diabetic and prediabetic groups from E16.5 to E18.5. This suggests increased ventricular pressure from obstruction to the outflow tract due to increased thickening of the interventricular septum. Increased peak systolic velocities through the left ventricular outflow tract combined with increased IVS dimensions has also been shown in type 1 diabetic women during mid- to late gestation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112466298">16</xref>
</sup> Among the diabetic embryos, there was evidence of global cardiac hypertrophy with increased IVS and posterior wall thickness in the embryo during late gestation. However, the difference between IVS and left ventricular posterior wall measurements in the diabetic and control group was insignificant in the neonate (1-week old) group, suggesting resolution in the first week of life. Unexpectedly, the IVS in the prediabetic 1-week-old offspring group were greater than that of the control group. However, the body weights of these prediabetic offsprings were greater than the age-matched controls and this may explain this finding. Significantly, when both diabetic groups were pooled at 1 week no difference in the IVS measurements was noted compared to the controls. Evidence of this transient cardiomyopathy in offspring of mothers with diabetes has been demonstrated in animal studies<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112466298">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112466298">19</xref>
</sup> Fetal death<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112466298">20</xref>
</sup> and infant death<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112466298">21</xref>
</sup> due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been reported.</p>
<p>The underlying molecular mechanism behind cardiomyopathy is yet to be clearly delineated. Hyperinsulinemia in the fetus from maternal hyperglycemia is thought to trigger hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the embryonic myocardial cells by increasing fat and protein synthesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112466298">22</xref>
</sup> Fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia can independently cause chronic hypoxia in the fetus and can lead to fetal death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112466298">23</xref>
</sup> Teramo et al showed that amniotic erythropoietin (EPO) levels were significantly associated with adverse fetal and neonatal outcome in type 1 diabetic pregnancies. In their study of 156 newborn infants delivered by caesarean section of mothers with T1DM, median amniotic EPO levels were significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) in diabetic pregnancies (14.0 mU/mL) compared to control pregnancies (6.3 mU/mL). This group observed an association between high amniotic EPO levels and neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in newborn IDMs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112466298">24</xref>
</sup> Hagemann and Zielinsky have shown an association between ventricular septal thickness and insulin levels in IDMs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112466298">25</xref>
</sup> In a later study, the same group found that spontaneous regression of this hypertrophy occurred during the first 6 months and that the association between regression of the septal hypertrophy and the decrease of insulin levels occurred up to the age of 1 month. They also reported significantly higher insulin levels in IDMs compared to controls when measured at 1 and 3 months.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112466298">26</xref>
</sup> Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) plays a major role in both fetal growth<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112466298">27</xref>
</sup> and may have a role in the development of neonatal ventricular hypertrophy. Elevated maternal serum IGF-1 levels have been correlated to incidences of ventricular hypertrophy in IDMs. Hayati et al showed that mothers (n = 50) with diabetes had significantly increased levels of serum IGF-1 at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation compared to the controls (n = 50). Diabetic mothers who gave birth to infants (n = 6) with neonatal septal hypertrophy had significantly (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .01) higher IGF-1 levels than mean levels of control mothers (n = 0 infants with septal hypertrophy) and also greater mean levels than that of all pooled diabetic mothers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112466298">28</xref>
</sup> Evidence of diastolic impairment in the form of prolonged relaxation time of the myocardium prior to mitral valve opening was detected in our diabetic cohort during early to midgestation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112466298">Figure 1</xref>), which may imply increased passive stiffness of the myocardium. Passive stiffness is determined by 2 components: collagen-based stiffness of the extracellular matrix and titin-based stiffness of the microfilaments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112466298">29</xref>
</sup> Reinking et al hypothesized that the cardiac remodeling which takes place with transient cardiomyopathy in newborns of diabetic rat mothers is associated with activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and elevated levels of proapoptotic markers such as active caspase 3 and 8.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112466298">17</xref>
</sup> Serum markers of cardiovascular dysfunction measured in cord blood are elevated in newborns of diabetic mothers, especially those with cardiomyopathy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112466298">30</xref>
</sup> The B-type natiuretic peptide which is released by cardiac myocytes in response to excessive stretching is elevated in umbilical blood samples from newborn offspring of T1DM mothers, with a positive correlation between it and the IVS thickness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112466298">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Clinical data show that maternal diabetes is associated with macrosomia in the infant. This macrosomia has been thought to be as a result of fetal hyperinsulinemia and the influx of maternal glucose via the placenta. In human participants with severe maternal diabetes complicated by vasculopathy and nephropathy, intrauterine growth restriction can occur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719112466298">31</xref>
</sup> In our animal model, we found that indeed the offspring from the severely diabetic group had profound growth restriction compared to controls. Other animal studies have shown similar findings, where the body weight of E17 embryos of mild hyperglycemic dams was greater than those of moderate to severe hyperglycemic dams.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112466298">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In this longitudinal study, we have shown US data from pregnancies complicated with pregestational T1DM. Long-term human and animal studies suggest that the offsprings have increased risk of hypertension<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112466298">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719112466298">34</xref>
</sup> and cardiovascular dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719112466298">35</xref>
</sup> The finding of significant cardiac functional and structural in utero in this study may explain the predisposition to cardiovascular disease in later life. Certain limitations of the study do exist. No congenital cardiac malformations were detected. Incidences of congenital malformations may have been missed due to absorption during early gestation or the mother ingesting the malformed pup during the very early neonatal period, prior to inspection. Animals were checked in the early morning and afternoon, but the most common time for birthing in mice was from midnight to 4 <sc>am</sc>. Standardized techniques<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112466298">36</xref>
</sup> were used to dissect the hearts while still encased in torsos macroscopically; however, the plane of section was difficult to replicate in every case due to the small heart sizes. In some cases a complete transverse slice, showing both sides of the heart may not have been achieved; thus, a single chamber view was seen microscopically. Sample size for our histological study was small in some groups.</p>
<p>Only 4 to 5 embryos were assessed using US in pregnancy at each time point due to their position within the uterus and proximity to surface of the maternal abdomen. The small size of the embryonic heart precluded detailed structural assessment. It is likely that those with cardiac defects did not survive in the neonatal period and contributed to the rate of neonatal deaths among the prediabetic and diabetic groups.</p>
<p>There is a paucity of data on experimental studies on fetal cardiomyopathy using pregestational animal models. Rat models of gestational diabetes have shown a transient form of cardiomyopathy in the offspring.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112466298">17</xref>
</sup> However, there is limited data on fetal cardiomyopathy using the experimental diabetic mouse model. We are the first to our knowledge to demonstrate altered cardiac diastolic function in early pregnancy in a diabetic mouse model and to document the intracardiac changes throughout gestation in diabetic mouse pregnancy. Our findings of cardiac functional and structural alterations in the embryonic heart as a result of a hyperglyemic environment may explain the documented predisposition that ODMs may have to future cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Maternal hyperglycemia has severe effects on the offspring with evidence of cardiac impairment and cardiac hypertrophy in the embryo. These effects persisted in the 1-day old but attenuated in the 1-week old suggesting cardiac remodeling after the hyperglycemic milieu of pregnancy is removed.</p>
