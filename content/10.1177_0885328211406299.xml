<abstract>
<p>In this study, we evaluated a porous and single-layer skin polyethersulfone (PES) membrane as a material for use in hybrid bioartificial liver support systems. The PES membrane has been characterized as a single-layer skin structure, with a rough porous surface. Specifically, we studied the ability of the human hepatoblastoma cell lines (HepG2) to adhere, grow, and spread on the PES membrane. Furthermore, we examined albumin secretion, low-density lipoprotein uptake, and CYP450 activity of HepG2 cells that grew on the membrane. HepG2 cells readily adhered onto the outer surfaces of PES membranes. Over time, HepG2 cells proliferated actively, and confluent monolayer of cells covered the available surface area of the membrane, eventually forming cell clusters and three-dimensional aggregates. Furthermore, HepG2 cells grown on PES membranes maintained highly specific functions, including uptake capability, biosynthesis and biotransformation. These results indicate that PES membranes are potential substrates for the growth of human liver cells and may be useful in the construction of hollow fiber bioreactors. Porous and single-layer skin PES membranes and HepG2 cells may be potential biomaterials for the development of biohybrid liver devices.</p>

<p>Several bioartificial liver (BAL) devices have been developed to bridge patients with acute liver failure to transplantation or to allow for the regeneration of their own hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211406299">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211406299"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211406299"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211406299"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211406299">5</xref></sup> The main functions of BAL devices are to remove toxins, synthesize products, and to reverse the inflammatory processes in the liver. In a similar way to extracorporeal whole liver perfusion systems, BAL devices replace the function of the failing liver through the actions of hepatocytes on a patient's plasma or blood in a bioreactor module. The bioreactor provides an environment for the expression of the functions of differentiated hepatocytes and allows the interaction between the hepatocytes and the blood of patients with liver failure. Thus, the bioreactor plays an important role in BAL support systems.</p>
<p>Many types of bioreactors for liver support systems have been studied, but the semi-permeable hollow fiber membrane bioreactors are most often used in clinical evaluations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211406299">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211406299"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211406299">8</xref></sup> Usually made of synthetic polymers, these hollow fiber membranes have been widely used in hemopurification therapy. Because of their high level of permeability, the hollow membranes can remove toxins from the blood via simple mechanical separation or adsorption. However, many synthetic polymers used in hollow fiber membranes of bioreactors are not optimal surfaces for the culture of functional hepatocytes. Hepatocytes are anchorage-dependent cells; therefore, maintaining their functions in the bioreactor environment depends on their ability to adhere to and grow on a suitable membrane surface. In culture, the biochemical functions of primary hepatocytes are often unstable, and cells lose enzymic activities over time and die.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211406299">9</xref></sup> Thus, the development of membranes that support the attachment, function, and viability of hepatocytes would significantly improve the expression of highly differentiated metabolic function for the expected duration of the clinical treatment using the bioreactor. Much attention has been focused on the design and development of functional hollow fiber membranes for BAL or extracorporeal BAL support systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211406299">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the use of a polyethersulfone (PES) semi-permeable membrane, which has a porous and single-layer skin structure, as a biomaterial in BALs. We studied the ability of the PES membrane to support the growth of a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) at various time points by using laser confocal scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, we assessed several important functions, such as albumin secretion, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) activities, in HepG2 cells grown on PES membranes.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211406299"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>HepG2 cells (a human hepatoblastoma cell line) and LX2 cells (a human hepatic stellate cell line, ATCC, USA), were maintained in Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle's Medium (Invitrogen, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (all from Invitrogen Corporation, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211406299"><title>Materials and preparation of PES membranes</title>
<p>The PES (MW = 5.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>) powder was purchased from the BASF China Co., Shandong, China. Flat PES membranes were prepared by a phase inversion process from a solution of PES (18%, w/w), polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP, 10%, w/w), and dimethyl-carbinol (4%, w/w) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After stirring the solution for 4 h at 80°C, it was degassed by a negative pressure pump at 60°C and the solution cast as a thin film onto a flat glass plate. After cooling the solution film to room temperature it was treated with a coagulation liquid in a ratio of 4:1 (water:DMSO) for 15 min on ice, and then was post-treated for 30 min at 80°C. Finally, the membrane was washed five times with distilled water and stored until use in 20% (w/w) glycerin.</p>
<p>The membranes were prepared for culture of HepG2 cells by cutting larger PES pieces into small round ones (3.5 cm in diameter). The membranes were sterilized by placing them in 70% ethanol for 15 min and then they were rinsed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). A membrane was placed into each well of a six-well plate, and HepG2 cells were added to the rough porous surface of the membranes at 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. After incubating the plates for 6 h at 37°C, the PES pieces from the wells were removed and placed into new wells with fresh medium. PES pieces with cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and the medium was replaced every 2 days. HepG2 cells cultured onto commercial cellulose acetate (CA) membrane (Shenghe membrane centre, China) pieces, which is generally applicable for BAL bioreactor, were used as controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211406299"><title>The characteristic of PES membranes</title>
<p>The characteristics of the flat PES membrane, such as the molecular cut-off, water permeability, and the ability to adsorb protein were determined by routine methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211406299">11</xref></sup> The obtained PES membranes were fractured inliquid nitrogen and coated with a gold/palladium (80/20) layer. The morphologies of the PES membrane and cross-section were observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Amray, USA) after gold coating with an ion coater.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211406299"><title>Initial cell attachment</title>
<p>In this study, 5.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well were incubated for 2, 4, 6, and 8 h in 24-well tissue culture plates containing the membranes. After the incubation, the supernatants were removed and the number of non-attached cells was counted in a cell counting instrument (BD Biosciences, USA) and compared with the number of cells seeded. The percentage of adhering cells was calculated from three experiments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211406299"><title>Cell proliferation determination</title>
<p>The proliferation of HepG2 cells was determined by the3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based cytotoxicity test after 8 h, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days of incubation, since HepG2 cells lose their metabolic functions when cultured for long periods. The MTT assay was obtained from Sigma and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The optical density (OD) of the samples was determined using an ELISA plate reader at 490 nm. In order to eliminate the effect of the different adhesion rates, population doubling of HepG2 cells was calculated by dividing the average OD value for time-point into the average OD value at cell adhesion after 8 h of incubation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211406299"><title>Visualization of cell growth</title>
<p>At various time points after addition of cells, PES membranes were removed from the six-well plate and placed into medium containing 0.1 mM Calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (AM) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, USA) and incubated for 20–30 min at 37°C. Calcein-AM fluoresces when taken up by viable cells, and the fluorescence spreads throughout the cell. Stained PES pieces were placed on a microscope slide and examined by confocal microscopy (IX 71; Olympus).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211406299">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>After culturing for 6 days, PES membranes with HepG2 cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 12 h, dehydrated in a series of ethanol, and immersed overnight in 100% ethanol. The samples were dried and coated with an ultrathin layer of gold in a coating apparatus. SEM (Amray, USA) was used to examine the samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328211406299"><title>Determination of albumin</title>
<p>Samples of culture medium from HepG2 cells grown on PES membranes were collected every 48 h and stored at−20°C until use. The amount of albumin secreted into the medium was measured by using a human albumin ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0885328211406299"><title>Uptake of LDL</title>
<p>For analysis of LDL uptake, HepG2 cells grown on PES membranes were incubated with 20 µg/mL Dil-Ac-LDL (Biomedical Technologies, USA) for 4 h at 37°C. The cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The uptake of fluorochrome-labeled LDL into cells was visualized by confocal microscopy. Similarly treated LX2 cells were used as negative controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0885328211406299"><title>CYP activity assay</title>
<p>To assess CYP activity, HepG2 cells grown on PES membranes were incubated with 10 µmol/L pentoxyresorufin (Sigma–Aldrich, USA) for 30 min at 37°C. Pentoxyresorufin changes from a nonfluorescent compound into a fluorescent compound, resorufin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211406299">13</xref></sup> after being O-dealkylated by CYP; therefore, fluorescence intensity caused by pentoxyresorufin metabolism estimates CYP activity. Confocal microscopy was used to assess and detect resorufin <italic>in situ</italic>. Similarly treated LX2 cells served as negative controls.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211406299">Figure 1</xref> shows the morphology of the porous and single-layer skin PES membrane as characterized by SEM. The PES membrane has a typical asymmetric morphology with a thin, dense skin layer, and a highly porous supporting layer visible in the cross-section. Moreover, the cross-section showed a decrease in pore size from the outer to the inner surface. As showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211406299">Figure 1</xref>, the outer surfaces of the PES membrane were rough and highly porous, and therefore highly suitable for cell culture. Each cm<sup>2</sup> of membrane contained approximately 3000 pores with diameters ranging from 10 to 50 µm in diameter by counting under light microscope. The molecular cut-off of the PES membrane was 8.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>, which allows for relatively easy albumin transport from the outer to the inner surface. Moreover, the water permeability of the PES membrane was about 200 L/h/m<sup>2</sup>/100 kPa. The protein adsorbation characteristics as estimated by the albumin adsorbation test resulted in an average albumin adsorbing value of 0.28 ± 0.07 mg/24 h/cm<sup>2</sup>.

<sec id="sec14-0885328211406299"><title>Cell culture on the PES membrane</title>
<p>HepG2 cells were seeded on the membranes and the number of non-attached cells was examined at different time points. The calculated values of cell adhesion (in percentage) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211406299">Figure 2</xref>. HepG2 cells attached quickly onto the PES membranes and reached about 90% attachment after 4 h of incubation. The rate of cell adhesion on the PES membranes was significantly higher than that observed for the CA membranes during the initial 8 h incubation. The proliferation and growth of HepG2 cells on the PES and CA membranes were investigated over a period of 8 days using population doubling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211406299">Figure 3</xref>). A significant difference of population doubling was found between the PES and CA membranes over the entire culture period which confirmed that the number of cells growing on the PES membranes increased markedly. In contrast, the number of HepG2 cells increased slowly on CA membranes.

<p>To observe the proliferation of cells on PES membranes more clearly, we stained the cells with Calcein-AM and examined them at different time points during the culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211406299">Figure 4</xref>). Our confocal microscopy studies showed excellent and uniform adherence of HepG2 cells to the outer surface of the PES membranes. Adhesion properties of HepG2 cells to PES membranes were similar to those seen in HepG2 cells cultured in six-well plastic plates without PES and CA membranes. Initially, single cells attached to the outer surfaces of the membrane and spread along the membrane. These attached, spreading cells gradually coalesced to grow into multilayers. Over a longer period of time, larger aggregates of cells formed on the PES membrane and these showed three-dimensional cell growth and proliferation. During the culture, more three-dimensional aggregates of HepG2 cells were seen on the PES membrane than seen in cells grown on the CA membranes.

<p>SEM studies showed similar results of HepG2 cell attachment, spreading and proliferation on the PES membranes confirming the results seen with Calcein-AM staining and confocal microscopy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211406299">Figure 5</xref> show that HepG2 cells grew to confluence on the outer surface of PES membranes and formed a tight association of individual cells with the outer surface. Three-dimensional aggregates of HepG2 cells growing on the PES membrane were observed after 6 days of culture. In some cases, cultured cells not only covered the pores of membranes, but were also anchored in the membrane pores. These results indicate that the porous outer surface of the PES membranes supports the adherence and growth of HepG2 cells.

</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0885328211406299"><title>Cell functions on the PES membranes</title>
<p>To indicate the functional capacity of HepG2 cells, we used an ELISA to measure the amount of human albumin secreted into the culture medium. The amount of albumin secreted by HepG2 cells both grown on PES and CA membranes increased gradually during the 8-day culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211406299">Figure 6</xref>). However, albumin secretion was significantly higher in PES-cultured HepG2 cells than in HepG2 cells grown on CA membranes. Using DiI-Ac-LDL staining, we assessed the uptake of LDL by HepG2 cultured with PES membranes. Confocal microscopy studies showed that HepG2 cells grown on PES membranes, as well as on CA membranes, incorporated LDL during the 8-day culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211406299">Figure 7</xref>(b) and (c)). We used a pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) assay in HepG2 cells to show CYP450 activity, which is an important measure of the function of liver cells. In the assay, CYP450 changes pentoxyresorufin into resorufin, which emits a red fluorescence. No PROD activity was seen in LX2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211406299">Figure 7</xref>(d)), and minimal PROD activity was seen in HepG2 cells cultured on CA membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211406299">Figure 7</xref>(e)). More fluorescence was emitted from HepG2 cells cultured on PES membranes at day 8 of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885328211406299">Figure 7</xref>(f)).

<p>Developing a biomaterial that maintains both cell function and a high level of permeability is important in the construction of hollow fiber membranes for bioreacters in BAL systems. Many semi-permeable hollow fiber membranes, such as polysulfone, CA, and PES membranes, that have been widely used in hemodialysis and hemofiltration are now being tested in hepatocyte culture <italic>in vitro</italic> for BAL systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211406299">11</xref></sup> Among these membranes, flat PES membranes and their derivative polysulfone have been demonstrated to be more suitable for hepatocyte culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211406299">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211406299">15</xref></sup> Kinasiewicz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211406299">16</xref></sup> indicated that spongy PES membranes can be used in BAL systems developed for <italic>in vitro</italic> cell cultivation at high density and subsequently for clinical use in patients suffering from acute or acute-on-chronic liver failure. However, the porous PES membrane described here, with its single-layer skin structure, may also be useful in BAL devices. First, the PES membrane has a homogenous, open-porous design with interconnecting pores and a rough outer surface. This quality promotes the attachment and growth of cells and allows the transport of nutrients and the removal of metabolites for cells growing on the surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211406299">17</xref></sup> Second, the PES membrane has a thin, dense layer near the smooth inner surface that is important not only for the permeability properties, but also for the hemocompatibility of the membrane with the blood passing through it.</p>
<p>In this study, we have shown that the porous and single-layer skin structure of the PES membrane provides a rough porous surface. A rough surfaces are generally for cell attachment, growth and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211406299">18</xref></sup> With the use of confocal microscopy studies, we noted several differences in proliferation of cells on PES and CA membranes. The increase in cell numbers was greater on PES than on CA membranes, which is consistent with the cell proliferation rate found on the same membranes during the 8 days of culture. In addition, HepG2 cells formed cell clusters and aggregated more efficiently on PES rather than on CA membranes, or on six-well plastic plates. Many large cell aggregations were observed on PES membranes after 4–5 days of culture, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211406299">Figure 4</xref>(a). The possible explanation for the increased clusters and aggregations of HepG2 cells cultured on PES membranes may be the membrane surface structure characteristic. Unlike when cells are cultured on plastic plates or flat membranes, the rough surface with pores ranging from 10 µm to about 50 µm in diameter may well be disadvantageous to cell spreading. The rough and porous surface could be more favorable to the formation of three-dimensional aggregations and the establishment of cell-cell contacts. Since, hepatocytes cultures in bioreactor showing higher activity and density are essential for its liver supporting effect, the increased efficiency of cell cluster and aggregation formation on porous PES membrane may well be beneficial in biohybrid liver systems.</p>
<p>It is well-known that the three-dimensional organization of hepatocytes is important in maintaining the specific functions of liver cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211406299">19</xref></sup> The tissue architecture and cell morphology are crucial for the proper functioning of cells within the organ <italic>in situ</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211406299">20</xref></sup> <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that hepatocytes cultured in a three-dimensional system in both batch and flow conditions maintained stable levels of albumin and drug metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211406299">21</xref></sup> Our analysis of the culture medium showed that HepG2 cells grown on PES membranes secreted considerable amounts of albumin. The albumin production by HepG2 cells was markedly higher on the porous PES membranes than on the flat CA membranes. In addition, our confocal microscopy studies showed that cells cultured on PES membranes demonstrated better LDL uptake and CYP450 activity than HepG2 cells cultured on CA membranes. These results, together with our studies on cell morphology, indicate that PES membranes not only support the attachment and growth of HepG2 cells, but also maintain the biosynthesis and biotransformation functions of HepG2 cells. Furthermore, growth on PES membranes may even improve specific liver functions in HepG2 cells. These properties are important in selecting semi-permeable membranes for hollow fiber bioreactors of BAL systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211406299">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our studies of the growth and function of HepG2 cells on PES membranes indicate that this medium shows promise for use in BAL devices. Nevertheless, the clinical use of PES membranes in the construction of a hollow fiber bioreactor requires investigation of mass transfer, blood compatibility, and possible adverse inflammatory reactions of the PES fiber. However, the HepG2 cell line used in our study, with its highly differentiated liver functions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211406299">22</xref></sup> has less ability to replace normal liver function than do normal hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211406299">23</xref></sup> Thus, the attachment and growth of primary hepatocytes on PES fibers must be evaluated. In addition, new liver cell lines that maintain more specific hepatic functions must be established. In fact, gene modification of HepG2 cells has been conducted to enhance their cell functions, including the ability to eliminate ammonia and enhance drug metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211406299">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, we have shown the usefulness of a porous and single-layer skin structure PES membrane for the culture of human hepatoblastoma cell lines. HepG2 cells grew well on the porous outer surfaces of PES membrane, and cultured HepG2 cells maintain biosynthesis and biotransformation functions. Thus, the porous and single-layer skin structure PES membrane may be a useful, semi-permeable membrane for a hollow fiber reactor. In addition, the PES membrane, together with HepG2 cells, could be used as a potential functional bioreactor material for a BAL support system.</p>
