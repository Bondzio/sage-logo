<p>Crisis discourse dominates public debate around multiculturalism in Australia, as elsewhere; there has been a tendency to focus on ‘panicked multiculturalism’ – those spaces which have been subject to social anxieties because of perceived conflicts around ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1357034X12474477">Noble, 2009a</xref>). In research there has been a parallel tendency to foreground issues of racism and exclusion at the expense of the nuances of intercultural relations. Scholarship typically focuses on the conflicts, but rarely gives attention to the skilled, cooperative work of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1357034X12474477">Sennett (2012</xref>: 221) calls the ‘everyday diplomacy’ of civility. While we need to avoid the simplistic rhetoric of cultural harmony and community cohesion which have shaped the advocacy of multiculturalism, we also need to examine the ‘convivial’ dimensions of diversity, and especially how these are acquired.</p>
<p>This article attempts to address the habitual ways cultural differences are transacted and reconciled in the daily conduct of people in culturally diverse settings. While there has long been analysis of national identity as habituated within everyday routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1357034X12474477">Edensor, 2002</xref>), and although habit has been a central category for understanding racial prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474477">Sullivan, 2006</xref>), it has rarely impacted on an understanding of the practices and capacities which people develop for living with difference, the routinised ‘civic virtues’ of intercultural life. Cosmopolitanism and habit have become significant tools in framing this enquiry, though not without problems. The issue for this article is whether these terms are <italic>methodologically</italic> useful for the analysis of these ‘civic virtues’. This article, drawing on the everyday interactions in and around school, argues that we need to conceptualise cosmopolitanism as an object of empirical research. This requires that we think about habit as a pedagogical process, and the temporal and spatial elements through which ‘cosmopolitan’ behaviours are habituated.</p>

<title>From Habits of Racism to Cosmopolitan Habits</title>
<p>Since the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X12474477">Allport’s <italic>The Nature of Prejudice</italic> (1979 [1954])</xref>, ‘habit’ has played a key if undeveloped role in our understanding of racism. Allport emphasised the learned but ingrained dimensions of prejudice, arguing that membership of an ethnically or racially defined group constituted a ‘web of habits’: an encounter with an ‘outsider’ ‘breaks my habits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1357034X12474477">1979 [1954]</xref>: 46). The threat this poses often produces responses which are ‘automatic’ but acquired in the course of living within this web. The habitual nature of prejudice has been a theme in scholarship, but racism is typically reduced to the status of a ‘bad habit’ which has to be broken and replaced with good habits which inhibit prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1357034X12474477">Devine, 2005</xref>). This psychologistic frame limits our capacity, however, to analyse intercultural practices. Despite Allport’s emphasis on the social contexts in which bad and good habits develop, the resulting literature has focused on the unconscious dimensions that constitute judgements of others. There has been a lack of development of habit as an analytical tool for making sense of these processes: it figures as a descriptive marking of complex social and cognitive operations.</p>
<p>This has been challenged by work which theorises habit as a social mechanism of racial and ethnic inequality. Drawing on the pragmatist tradition of Dewey to explore the unconscious nature of white privilege, this work stresses the need to see how racial habits are embodied and social because they operate as dispositions for transacting the world and orienting humans in social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474477">Sullivan, 2006</xref>: 2–4). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1357034X12474477">MacMullan (2009</xref>: 20) lists these ‘habits of whiteness’ as antipathy to the strange, a sense of entitlement and feelings of guilt. There is some discussion of the need to inculcate habits of ‘civic virtue’, but these are seen more as a moral corrective to prejudice. Sullivan points out that ‘we are composed of habits born out of experiences that are a mix of joy and suffering, privilege and disadvantage, ecstasy and agony’; but she does little more than urge us to develop ‘habits of resistance’ to racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1357034X12474477">2006</xref>: 196). MacMullan is more hopeful about humans’ capacities to develop non-discriminatory practices, but also frames this in terms of the need to replace the ‘old’ habits of whiteness with ‘new’ habits that inculcate shame, compassion and remembrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1357034X12474477">2009</xref>: 182, 194ff.).</p>
<p>What we need, however, is a consideration of the formation of habits of intercultural civility not as an ‘antidote’ to racism but in terms of how people develop capacities for living together amidst diversity. This is a pressing question in a world that is increasingly anxious about ‘social integration’ and where incivility has become a focal concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1357034X12474477">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1357034X12474477">Sandercock (2006</xref>: 42) suggests, ‘participation and negotiation in the interests of peaceful co-existence requires something like daily habits of quite banal intercultural interaction in order to establish a basis for dialogue’. Similarly, Amin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12474477">2010</xref>: 5) argues that:
<disp-quote>
<p>habits of urban living – including social response to diversity and difference – are largely pre-cognitive, based on daily reflexes of urban negotiation that require little thought and deliberation. This is how the potentially bewildering experience of urban multiplicity and variety is tamed and domesticated, how humans adapt to being among strangers, in crowded or large spaces.… These reflexes … are the product of both habituated human practice and the orderings of urban material culture – how the assembly of humans, things, symbols, technologies, matter and nature in particular ways in different urban contexts guides individual and collective behaviour.</p>
</disp-quote> Habitual contact is no guarantee of cultural exchange because it can entrench animosities: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12474477">Amin (2002</xref>: 969) acknowledges that housing estates, for example, ‘fall short of inculcating inter-ethnic understanding because they are not structured as spaces of interdependence and habitual engagement’, whereas sites such as schools and sports clubs offer more opportunity for sustained association. This is not a utopian process free of conflict, but requires the management of the ‘situated multiplicity’ of public spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12474477">Amin, 2008</xref>: 10). Such intercultural spaces, with their attendant materialities, regulations and affects, entail ‘passing propinquities’ in which bodily orientations have to articulate with the reciprocities of communal life, fostering a ‘tolerated multiplicity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1357034X12474477">Wilson, 2011</xref>). Amin is interested in ‘the negotiation of difference within local micropublics of everyday intercultural interaction’ which enhances the ‘local liveability’ of neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1357034X12474477">2002</xref>: 959–60), and schools are particularly good sites for considering these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1357034X12474477">Ho, 2011</xref>). Amin draws on the work of James who, like Dewey, engages with the habitual nature of life to argue that ethical practices in public spaces are formed ‘reflexively’ rather than consciously, guided by routines of response and practice; ‘civic virtue’ emerges not simply from an act of will but from socio-spatial arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12474477">Amin, 2008</xref>: 11). It is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12474477">James (1899</xref>: 64) who reminds us that, ‘our virtues are habits as much as our vices’.</p>
<p>Habits of ‘civic virtue’ have been framed by notions of ‘cosmopolitanism’ which typically emphasise a sense of global humanity beyond national identities, and an openness to cultural difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1357034X12474477">Vertovec and Cohen, 2002</xref>). However, cosmopolitanism has usually been associated with (often global) elites who, in contrast with ‘locals’, are seen to inhabit a metacultural position from which they move in and out of exotic cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1357034X12474477">Hannerz, 1992</xref>: 252). This says little about ordinary intercultural practices in complex societies. In contrast, there has been a recent turn to ‘vernacular’ cosmopolitanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X12474477">Robbins, 1998</xref>) which reorient the focus towards an ethics of cohabitation in complex mileux. In a globalised world, a ‘banal’ cosmopolitanism provides a practical orientation in which engaging with people and goods from other cultures in daily practice allows people to open themselves to a broader humanity beyond local, racial or national affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1357034X12474477">Beck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1357034X12474477">Szerszynski and Urry, 2002</xref>). This is not markedly different from Dewey’s insight into the shared habits of ‘amicable cooperation’ which underlie a wider democratic community because it produces an orientation that extends beyond immediate community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X12474477">1976 [1939]</xref>: 228), but suggests that we need to examine this process in view of the cultural complexity of contemporary societies.</p>
<p>It is important not to romanticise cosmopolitanism. While it is preferable to the ‘everyday racism’ which punctuates the lives of minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1357034X12474477">Essed, 1991</xref>), the two should not be seen as opposites nor as the attributes of individuals. However, such a cosmopolitanism might be seen as politically ‘virtuous’ in the context of a historical moment in which moral panics around refugees, terrorism and ethnic gangs have produced an intensification of racial vilification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X12474477">Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1357034X12474477">Gilroy (2004</xref>: xv) has characterised the solidarities born of habitual interaction in multicultural, working-class localities as ‘conviviality’: what he defines as ‘the process of cohabitation and interaction which have made multiculture an ordinary feature of social life’. This definition seeks to focus on a pragmatic notion of conviviality that returns to its Latin meaning of ‘living together’ and doesn’t load it up with sentiment – as Gilroy suggests, this idea of conviviality is not meant to imply that racism no longer exists or that tolerance rules. I don’t want to romanticise this conviviality: the ‘everyday virtue of living with difference’ is neither automatic nor guaranteed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12474477">Amin, 2008</xref>: 18) – spaces of cultural diversity can also be marked by conflict and ambiguity, so we need to examine how these capacities are produced through shared practices and spaces.</p>
<p>‘Cosmopolitan virtue’ has been characterised in terms of irony, reflexivity, scepticism, nomadism, a ‘cool’ and ‘thin’ sense of belonging but an ethic of care and a commitment to dialogue with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1357034X12474477">Turner and Rojek, 2001</xref>: 221–5). Yet while this notion provides insight into a particular sensibility, it reproduces the idea of a cosmopolitan <italic>type</italic>, rather than exploring how these capacities are acquired in ensembles of social practices and relations. Analysing these ensembles allows us to explore how cultural complexity is transacted in daily processes. An emphasis on these banal processes shifts the emphasis to forms of practice which emerge to deal with the range of experiences in a globalised world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1357034X12474477">Beck, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1357034X12474477">Urry’s (2003)</xref> conceptualisation of cosmopolitanism as a <italic>disposition</italic> of intellectual and aesthetic openness to people, places and experiences, which involves mobility, curiosity, self-reflexivity and cultural literacies, foregrounds the collective orientations which shape the ways we interact with ‘others’ as habitual action. Yet these authors don’t enquire deeply enough into how these dispositions are formed, nor do they ground them in empirical analysis.</p>
<p>If cosmopolitanism has at its heart the conduct of people engaging in culturally complex societies, then this raises the question of how people are driven to act in these ways. A number of scholars focus on the global flows of people, goods and information as significant regarding the emergence of cosmopolitan habits, but these are typically invoked rather than explored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1357034X12474477">Anderson’s (2004)</xref> depiction of the market place as a ‘cosmopolitan canopy’ foregrounds the routinised dynamics of neighbourhood life but shrouds it in a romantic version of Allport’s contact hypothesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12474477">Nava (2007</xref>) more convincingly explores the ‘normalisation’ of difference but her focus is on the formation of consumer culture in the 20th century. We can agree that ‘certain places or things’ might afford a cosmopolitan sensibility but ‘the proliferation of global flows and mobilities as a context for the uptake of some aspects of the cosmopolitan disposition’ is a weak argument, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X12474477">Kendall et al. (2009</xref>: 101, 104–7) maintain, because ‘it fails to identify the cultural location and capacities of cosmopolitan subjectivities’. They identify an ensemble of feelings, attitudes and practices, not a simple set of attributes, as underlying a disposition to cosmopolitan openness to otherness. While there is some sense of the forms of cosmopolitan conduct that emerge in an increasingly diverse, globalised world, and some sense of the spaces in which these operate, it is still not clear what such habits look like, nor how and where people acquire the propensity for such conduct.</p>
<p>Cosmopolitanism offers a way into reorienting debates about the formation of dispositions that are conducive to convivial intercultural relations, but its use is highly abstract. These questions are important not just because thinking about habit is an engaging exercise for gaining insight into the analysis of human conduct, but because it informs our interventions into education, social policy, urban planning and welfare. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1357034X12474477">Amin (2004)</xref> suggests, the reading of ‘the everyday’ shapes local politics and policy all the time, but this is usually predicated on common-sense understandings of ethnicity and community, nation and locality, not analysis of the ‘habits of urban living’. These social-but-subconscious responses to difference are born of the ‘daily reflexes of urban negotiation’, the product of habituated practice and urban space. It is only by exploring these ‘reflexes’ that we can make useful claims about intercultural relations. Yet the study of cosmopolitan habits throws up methodological challenges: cosmopolitanism – like habit – is a powerful tool for conceptual analysis, but difficult to operationalise in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1357034X12474477">Skey, 2012</xref>). This is not just because both terms are hard to define and subject to conflicting conceptualisations, but because the things they describe are hard to explore empirically. However, the difficult nature of these concepts and their methodological usefulness offers a productive problematic for research.</p>
<p>In the first instance, what I have characterised as ‘cosmopolitan habits’ – as a ‘web’ or assemblage of feelings, attitudes and practices that coalesce as a disposition – is difficult to identify as an object. Cosmopolitanism as a set of attributes is framed in conceptual terms, but what do they look like? A sense of global humanity and an openness to otherness are hard to observe and not reducible to a taste for cultural exotica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X12474477">Kendall et al., 2009</xref>: 102). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1357034X12474477">Hage (1998</xref>) famously critiqued ‘cosmo-multiculturalism’ as the taste for the exotic otherness of some cultures as an act of distinction, but this specific take implies a different set of methodological questions. This kind of distinction implies a cosmopolitanism of mastery, whereby individuals ‘possess’ the value of difference; the ‘ordinary’ cosmopolitanism I am interested in is evinced more by an ethic of engagement, in which the admission of limitations might evince a more pragmatic ‘openness’ and thus be central to the formation of sustainable intercultural relations. Kendall et al. conceptualise cosmopolitanism as a ‘repertoire’ of ways of acting to deal with experiences, objects and people in varied social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X12474477">2009</xref>: 107–8). Yet we are still left with the vexatious question of how we might go about researching these. Would it be any different from, for example, just being courteous?</p>
<p>Some attempt has been made to put cosmopolitanism to methodological use, with mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1357034X12474477">Mau et al. (2008</xref>) examine the idea that transnationalisation fosters three dimensions of cosmopolitan attitudes: the recognition of the interconnectedness of political communities; an understanding that overlapping collective fortunes require collective solutions locally, regionally and globally; and the celebration of difference, diversity and hybridity, and the ability to reason from the point of view of others. We might challenge these criteria, but they represent a step beyond work which treated lifestyles, consumption and mobility as indicators of cosmopolitanisation. Drawing on survey data, Mau et al. claim that people with border-crossing experiences were more likely to adopt cosmopolitan attitudes in relation to cultural difference and global governance. Yet reading cosmopolitanism off survey data is deeply problematic: not just because there is never a simple relation between the attitudes people express and the conduct they follow, but because, if cosmopolitanism is a subconscious disposition, then answers to attitudes surveys may not capture the habituated responses to specific circumstances that would characterise such a disposition.</p>

<title>Enacting Cosmopolitanism</title>
<p>If we can characterise the forms of intercultural civility that emerge in culturally diverse settings as cosmopolitanism habits, then we need to analyse the situated conduct of humans. Like Kendall et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X12474477">2009</xref>: 103–4), I argue for a ‘performative’ definition of cosmopolitanism and an observational methodology which attempts to capture the nuances of such situated performances. I draw on an ethnography study set in a handful of middle-class suburbs in the north-western region of Sydney, part of which was centred in a number of schools in the area. I want to begin to consider these issues through examining a moment in which, it could be argued, some kind of cosmopolitan disposition was in evidence: indeed, it was this event which gave form to the questions I began asking about cosmopolitanism as habituated behaviour. The event in question was the annual performance night at one of the primary schools, when each class presented songs, skits and dance. It is one of several occasions during the year when all parents are invited to the school. The performances themselves don’t foreground ethnic identities; unlike the multicultural day, the school here is not self-consciously celebrating its multiculturality. Rather, the cultural diversity of the school makes it a significant case study for thinking about the routinisation of intercultural relations.</p>
<p>This school resides in a suburb that was once an overwhelmingly ‘Anglo’ middle-class area but has been transformed by increasing numbers of migrants from east and south Asia and elsewhere in the last two decades. Almost 80 percent of the students at this school now come from about 40 different language backgrounds other than English. The school, like many other schools, has policy and informal conventions designed to manage conduct around intercultural relations, foregrounding values of respect. The ‘mission statement’ declares it to be ‘a multicultural school dedicated to educational excellence. We promote and advance the intellectual, social, physical and moral development of all students to become responsible, contributing citizens.’ This ethos is not just about students, of course, but is intended to shape relations across the school community.</p>
<p>As part of an interest in how students, parents and teachers negotiate cultural differences in daily life in and around school, I decided to focus on the moments prior to and following the performance, when people had to wend their way through a crowd which consisted of intimates, acquaintances and strangers from diverse national, ethnic, religious and linguistic backgrounds. I was interested because these were moments when I anticipated that forms of ‘intercultural civility’ might come into play as participants negotiated movement, familiarity and difference. They did, but the exchanges reflected the typical mix of courtesy rituals of civil inattention granted to strangers and presentation rituals – salutations and so on – offered to acquaintances that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X12474477">Goffman (1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X12474477">1971</xref>) analysed. These actions evinced habitual patterns of civility, but did not explicitly entail negotiations of cultural difference, despite the ethnic mix among parents, teachers and students. This was interesting, but did not offer much for analysis.</p>
<p>During the performances there was a much more interesting moment, however, when one act transformed the benign mood of a school musical night. It was a parody by Year 6 students of the television show <italic>Australian Idol</italic>, a competition in which various young singers hope to be ‘discovered’ by performing in front of a panel of judges and a live audience. In this parody, the students mimicked famous pop stars, the male hosts were played by two girls, and the judges – key figures in the entertainment industry – were performed by students of Indian, Kenyan and Chinese-Malay ancestries. This set-up was, in itself, an interesting inversion of the whiteness of Australia’s media, and raised laughs among the audience – but is not the thing which interested me most.</p>
<p>The act had been going well but unspectacularly when, as the hosts were in the middle of announcing the next performer, another ‘contestant’ rushed onto the stage, dancing and shaking maracas, seemingly disrupting the order of events. This act is Peter Allen, the famous Australian performer who made it big in the US, known as ‘the boy from Oz’. Allen is performed by Leo, a tall Nigerian boy, who takes over the stage and sings the star’s famous hit ‘Rio’. There is something significant about this moment, and it is not just the quality of the performance nor the gentle playing around with gender and ethnic roles. When the music stops Leo keeps dancing and the audience starts clapping and hooting. The hosts try to stop him – one calls for ‘security’, and a small white boy tries to chase Leo off the stage, but fails – Leo’s head then body appears, and he returns to the crowd’s cheering. After hearing the judges’ verdict, he continues performing: he goes down on his knees and throws his arms in the air, he rolls and thrusts his hips at a judge while the audience bursts into sustained applause and cheers.</p>
<p>I have elsewhere explored the significance of this moment: as an expression of a kind of joyous sense of intercultural self-reflection which comes at the end of long period of national anxiety under John Howard’s leadership, based on moral panics around refugees, Islamic terrorism and ethnic gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1357034X12474477">Noble, 2011</xref>). The inversions at work in the performance offer a commentary on social fears about intercultural relations, national identity and border security. It is a moment of collective self-mockery, when national bravado and the policing of national and ethnic boundaries are parodied. It is a moment of ironic self-recognition in which the identification is <italic>with</italic> otherness, not against it.</p>
<p>But it is the response of the audience that is the focus of my attention here; it entailed an exuberance which extended into the rituals of parting as the crowd dispersed and when conventional civilities are interspersed with enthusiastic exchanges about this particular moment in the performance, and it extended over the next few days, as people recalled the performance. The enthusiasm goes beyond the benign parental pleasure seen on such evenings and captures a moment, I suggest, of intercultural ‘communitas’, marked by intense but spontaneous feelings of social ‘togetherness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1357034X12474477">Turner, 1969</xref>). There may be other readings to be had here, and of course this moment should not be read as symbolic of an unproblematic intercultural harmony across the school community, but I see this as a moment which may signify what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X12474477">Amin (2008</xref>: 16) has referred to as ‘solidarity in a minor key’, a ‘commitment to the margin’, to ‘the temporary settlements of public culture’ against a self-important and exclusive national identity.</p>
<p>This response is close to the kind of cosmopolitan disposition I am interested in – the effusive reaction (wild applause, cheers and laughter) exhibits both the twin emphases on global consciousness beyond the nation and the appreciation of otherness, and it exhibits something of the ‘virtues’ of a cosmopolitan ethos. It also asks us something about the relation between cosmopolitanism and habit. We can’t, of course, characterise this moment as habit in itself – unlike the greetings I had intended to observe, it doesn’t meet the idea of routine regularity. Such large-scale performances happen annually. Yet it irrupts <italic>because</italic>of a process whereby certain capacities are produced as dispositions.</p>
<p>The spontaneous intensification of mood suggests something of the unconscious nature of habit. It resembles the involuntary ‘reflexes of urban negotiation’ that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1357034X12474477">Amin (2010</xref>) suggests work to tame the bewildering experience of urban multiplicity. This kind of reflex – and not just the daily reflexes Amin foregrounds – is the product of habituated human practice. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X12474477">Dewey (2007 [1922]</xref>: 42) argues, repetition is not necessarily the ‘essence of habit’; the ‘essence’ rather, is an acquired predisposition to a mode of response rather than the ‘bare recurrence of specific acts’. Therefore, a narrow focus on unconscious, routine habit per se may not be the best way to explore the improvisational generativity of <italic>habituation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X12474477">Noble and Watkins, 2003</xref>), which may be realised through irregular occurrence. This is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1357034X12474477">Ravaisson’s (2008 [1838]</xref>: 55) insight that habit is not simply mechanical but involves the transformation through repetition and accommodation of potentiality to tendency and action as a creative capacity or ‘virtue’. Such habituation becomes important not just in routinised behaviour, but in those moments of indeterminacy in which the habituated response reveals something of the capacities for forms of conduct. If habits are crucial to the formation of a cosmopolitan disposition, they need to be examined not just in terms of routine and iteration, but in terms of the ‘happenstance’ of ‘bumping into alterity’ in places marked by the ‘thrown-togetherness’ of culturally diverse settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X12474477">Massey, 2005</xref>: 94). In other words, it is about the <italic>consequence</italic> of habituation as well as the <italic>regularity</italic> of habit; it is about the productive capacities formed through habituation rather than habit as a reiteration of experience.</p>
<p>Yet the conceptualisation of habit as the formation of productive capacities begs the question of exactly <italic>what</italic> capacities are embedded. The psychological literature on habits is more comfortable with routinised, mechanical, physical habits. Philosophers don’t fare much better: Ravaisson, for example, is silent on the capacities habit brings into effect, except in so far as it produces ‘intelligence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1357034X12474477">2008 [1838]</xref>: 39). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X12474477">Dewey (2007 [1922]</xref>) refers to many types of habit, which entail different types of desires, ‘working capacities’ and ‘technical abilities’; and that capacities can be both passive ‘receptivities’ and active ‘powers’. Yet apart from listing different habits that could be seen as capacities in themselves (walking, playing an instrument, typewriting, playing chess), and his reference to schooling in the acquisition of skills, habitual ‘capacity’ is abstract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X12474477">Dewey, 1988 [1928]</xref>: 64, 360). We need a greater specificity of habit and its forms of capacitation. The moment of the performance allows us to flesh out what are otherwise rhetorically employed as the ‘virtues’ of cosmopolitanism: capacities for irony, self-reflexivity, scepticism towards nationalist sentiment, diverse cultural literacies and a commitment to dialogue with others, intellectual and aesthetic openness, ability to identify with others and so on. These are observable, embodied and cognitive capacities that function as productive ‘powers’ in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>Yet this response does not tell us <italic>how</italic> and <italic>where</italic>these capacities were acquired.</p>

<title>How Do You Study Habits?</title>
<p>The literature on habit is relatively limited in terms of how it has deployed the notion in guiding qualitative research. The psychological and health literature is an exception, but because it understands habit in terms of physiological responses or addiction there is none of the conceptual sophistication that marks the debates in the humanities and social sciences. This is a problem; it is hard enough to reconcile the psychological and scientific assessment of particular kinds of ‘bad’ habits with the broader idea of habit in relation to actions such as walking, or rising and going to bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1357034X12474477">James, 1899</xref>: 67), let alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X12474477">Dewey’s (1976 [1939]</xref>) claims about habits of community, morality and democracy. Yet even within the psychological tradition the methodological issues are complex: habit is usually ‘measured’ by evaluating the frequency of a behaviour, relying on laboratory experiments of physiological response that lack ‘real-world’ significance or using self-reporting indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X12474477">Lally et al., 2010</xref>) that eliminate the subconscious nature of habit.</p>
<p>Turning their backs on such methods has meant that theorists of habit refrain from dealing with it in anything but philosophical terms. This literature has spent a lot of time examining the conceptual nuances in the ways habit has been used – a productive and necessary activity – but less time thinking how to put habit to work in research. What, for example, would we be looking for in seeking to establish whether people had developed habits? What distinguishes a habit from any other practice? Do we look for its regularity or involuntariness? How do we know that any observed or reported behaviour is routine? How do we capture regularity? How do we ascertain whether behaviours are automatic? Does the type of the habit alter what we are looking for? Smoking a cigarette or voting, for example, are not involuntary or unconscious in the way that giving way to someone on the street can be, yet could be described as habits; similarly, racist abuse in the heat of a game is not necessarily routine in the way walking is, though it may well be a ‘habit of race’. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X12474477">Dewey (1988 [1928]</xref>: 27) argues, habit:
<disp-quote>
<p>goes deeper than the ordinary conception of a habit as <italic>a</italic> more or less fixed way of doing things, although it includes the latter as one of its special cases. It covers the formation of attitudes, attitudes that are emotional and intellectual; it covers our basic sensitivities and ways of meeting and responding to all the conditions which we meet in living.</p>
</disp-quote> Such a distinction means that we need to decide whether we are talking about different things or whether they exist on a continuum of complexity, physicality, consciousness and routine. There is a deeper question at stake here regarding the kinds of research we need to analyse the habitual nature of conduct. This issue is significant because, as theorists and psychologists agree, the temporal and cumulative dimensions of habit-formation are crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1357034X12474477">Wood and Neal, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X12474477">Dewey (1988 [1928]</xref>: 27) argues that continuity is fundamental to the growth of habit:
<disp-quote>
<p>the principle of continuity of experience means that every experience both takes up something from those which have gone before and modifies in some way the quality of those which come after.</p>
</disp-quote> Yet it is not just temporal routine that fosters habits, it is also what Dewey describes as the forms of interaction with others and objects in concrete situations as ‘environing conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X12474477">1988 [1928]</xref>: 41). Indeed, some psychologists would argue that habits are ‘triggered’ by context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1357034X12474477">Wood and Neal, 2007</xref>: 843). But if this is so, then we need to distinguish between routine habits – such as making coffee every morning – and behaviour in irregular contexts which is habituated but not routine. This might mean distinguishing between the habit-forming (pedagogical) processes through which a behaviour is inscribed – that is, the iterative processes which accumulate – and moments in which a habituated behaviour might emerge as a response to an <italic>unexpected</italic> situation, or what habituation capacitates people to do. It is not that these aren’t developmentally related, but that they aren’t the same thing, and demand different methodologies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X12474477">Lally et al. (2010</xref>) explore the formation of habits by asking people to learn a mundane activity over a period of time and undertake self-reporting to establish how long it took to become automatic; apart from begging the question of the subconscious nature of habit, this procedure can only deal with simple and routine physical behaviours.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, locating specific capacities in an observable context allows us to think about how we might begin to conceptualise both the pedagogy (how) and emplacement (where) of habit. Ravaisson’s depiction of the move from potentiality to tendency to action is a neat framing of the ontological development of habit, but lacks empirical grounding and nuance; Dewey’s emphasis on the forms of interaction with others and objects in concrete situations is not matched by analyses of those situations. Psychological studies of habit emphasise the routine nature of habit-formation and thus characterise the pedagogy of habit as little more than mimicry and repetition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1357034X12474477">Wood and Neal (2007</xref>: 843) argue that habits are ‘learned dispositions to repeat past responses’, but this seems a thin understanding of the pedagogy and nature of habit and flies in the face of the philosophical rejection of the equation of habit with repetition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X12474477">Dewey, 2007 [1922]</xref>: 42). The psychological focus on reiteration makes the mistake of assuming that habit has a kind of linearity, that it comes only from the repetition of the same act in the same way in the same context: the kind of linearity implied in Lally et al.’s model of automaticity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X12474477">Dewey (2007 [1922]</xref>: 97, 103) rightly insists that simple habits are only effective when met with the same conditions, they cannot adapt to the ‘unusual and the novel’, and that the plasticity of habit is much more aligned with creativity, exploration, adjustment and initiation.</p>
<p>The parental response at the school performance suggests we need something more complex to assess the pedagogical dimensions of habit, because the event itself cannot account for the temporal recurrence crucial to habit and nor can the simple insistence on the temporality of reiteration explain the irruption of a reflex that I take to reflect cosmopolitan dispositions. This focus on the pedagogy of habit allows us to link repetition and plasticity as a developmental issue of <italic>accumulation</italic> across time and place. Routine is, of course, rarely unadulterated repetition, but is regular, incrementally adjusted actions through which capacities are adapted to or modify situated (material and social) contexts. That which makes routine effective is its constant, cumulative augmentation and accommodation so that it can work <italic>across</italic> circumstances.</p>
<p>A crucial element of this complexity is the spatial dimension of habit-formation, for it is not just temporal routine that fosters habits, but their emplacements, the forms of interaction with others and objects in specific ‘environing conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1357034X12474477">Dewey, 1988 [1928]</xref>: 41). This spatiality much more emphatically points towards the multiplicity of sources of (any given) habit. Habits don’t accrue only in one place, nor in one kind of place: they can’t, because this variation is crucial to the plasticity of habit. The ‘environing conditions’ that Dewey refers to are, in fact, a plural ‘habitat’ of spaces and contexts, yet little research has explored this multiplicity. Goffman, one of the analysts of the routines of daily life, comes closest to capturing this habitat, not in his examination of situated action but in his terminological complexity of place. Across his work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1357034X12474477">Goffman (1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1357034X12474477">1971</xref>) has multiple terms for differing ‘conditions’ of social interaction: he talks of encounters, occasions, settings, routines, institutions, social organisation, social order and interaction orders. The technical definitions of these are less significant than the differences in the scale, temporality, materiality and ordering in these terms. Where Goffman doesn’t recognise the functionality of these differences we can see that these spaces exist in entangled relations of interdependence – what I’ve called a habitat. If we take the school performance as an ‘occasion’, it sits in relation to an institution (the school) within a social organisation (the neighbourhood) as part of a larger social order, but in which particular kinds of encounters, routines and settings occur, shaped by diverse orders of interaction. The traces of each of these can be seen in the ‘occasion’, but it can’t be reduced to any one of them, because it is both the situatedness of action <italic>and</italic> the plurality of the network, I would argue, which sustains the development of forms of social interaction and thus licenses the augmentation of habit.</p>
<p>Crucial to Goffman’s analysis is his notion of the interaction order as systems of enabling conventions that order situated exchanges but in ways that are not reducible to larger categories of social power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12474477">Goffman (1983</xref>: 5) describes these conventions as ‘the ground rules for a game’ which allow social events to be accomplished. Goffman stresses that these are not scripted roles because settings are not simply pre-given. This poses the problem of how to examine the ‘ambulatory movement’ of people within encounters which require ‘accommodative’ mechanisms in the coordination of adjacent activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1357034X12474477">1983</xref>: 7). It is the movements between spaces, not just repetitive actions within them, which are formative of the plasticity of habit. Also crucial to the cumulative nature of habit is its affective character. The enthusiasm of the communal moment acts as ‘pedagogic affect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1357034X12474477">Watkins, 2006</xref>), a kind of ‘charge’ which reinforces the formation of sensuous, embodied capacity as force or power of acting. The ‘joy’ experienced by the audience is reprised in the rituals of parting on the night, and then again in the ensuing days as locals recounted and reaffirmed its sense of cosmopolitan conviviality.</p>
<p>The ‘environing conditions’ of the cosmopolitan disposition evidenced in the audience response, therefore, consist in the multiple encounters, settings, orders, flows and networks in and around the school and its neighbourhood, and the forms of intercultural exchange, affects, connectivity and belonging that sustain them. I can’t do justice to an analysis of this site, or the diverse interaction orders in operation, but I want to indicate several aspects that elaborate the issue of cosmopolitan habits. As I have indicated, over three-quarters of the students at this school come from backgrounds where English is not the main language. The social and cultural organisation of the area has been transformed by the increase of migrants, largely from east and south Asia. The school is thus a key site where cultural diversity shapes local civic relations. The school, like many similar institutions, has both policies and routine practices designed to foster good social relations, including intercultural relations. The linking of a multicultural ethos to both citizenship and development is not unique to this school; most schools espouse this ethos and most primary schools are places where this ethos forms a dominant ordering of inter-ethnic encounter in the playground and the classroom. But it is not only in the classrooms that cosmopolitan habits take shape, and this process includes not just students, but teachers and parents.</p>
<p>The area around the school is a hive of activity both before and after the school day. The school is on a mildly busy suburban road, with a pedestrian crossing immediately outside the main gate. These before and after times consist of situated encounters in which people negotiate intercultural relations and urban complexity through relations of inter-affective reciprocity. Some of this is highly ordered and follows a specific <italic>ethics</italic> of shared space: the teachers manage the movement of students out of classrooms and school buildings, while the school crossing supervisor manages the orderly conduct of children and adults across the road. Parents and grandparents of various ethnicities organise the movement of their children while undertaking their own involvement in interpersonal relations. Some of it is highly routine: movements across playgrounds, through gates, across roads, to cars and buses and along footpaths are regular, despite the chaotic quality of after-school release. Some of it is much less organised, but coalesces around spontaneous forms of intermingling that result from ‘happenstance’. Multiple flows of people – parents, grandparents and siblings – produce multiple possibilities of connection, avoidance and exchange over time, connecting the formal school domain and the spaces of suburban life.</p>
<p>The temporality of these flows is rhythmic but improvisational as people move, stop, congregate and diverge. They connect and disconnect along multiple vectors, according to whether they come across friends and acquaintances, or have to negotiate school and social events, the reciprocities of childcare responsibilities, exchanges of information and gossip. At one point a group of Indian-background women (of various generations) stop and talk in Hindi while their children run around in much more complicated and fluid groupings; within this group there are women who come from both north and south India. Alongside them a group of ‘Anglo’ women catch up. Then one woman from the first group breaks away to chat with a woman from the second, negotiating a weekend playtime. A second Indian woman moves over to talk with a teacher. Another woman joins two of the Anglo women. Women from each group acknowledge those from the other.</p>
<p>We see here the mix of salutations, invitations and civil inattention that Goffman discusses, and which embed expressions of recognition and respect, but with two observable differences from the greetings on display at the performance night. The first is the time given over to many encounters within this process, against the rush of the musical evening: time which allows for the elaboration of interaction beyond formal acknowledgement. The second is that these exchanges often occur within and across ethnic, cultural and religious sameness, and the length of encounter meant that these often involve <italic>negotiations</italic> across differences: elaboration of relationship, clarification of connections, translations of understandings and exchanges of information. Within these exchanges, difference is sometimes a principle of group formation, then becomes the basis of ‘bridging’ activity or transversal exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X12474477">Wise, 2010</xref>), in which ordering happens on the basis of friendship, utility or some other logic. These flows and exchanges require pragmatic habits of social and intercultural civility that navigate the politics of propinquity on local streets, public transport and shops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1357034X12474477">Wilson, 2011</xref>). Its ethos is pragmatic and banal because it gets things done on a daily basis but is not a utopian landscape of intercultural harmony: this cosmopolitanism is fundamentally about the possibility of living with others in a ‘routine world of strangers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1357034X12474477">Lofland, 1973</xref>: 177).</p>
<p>Within these habitual exchanges, in which the logic of difference ebbs and flows, there is a routine ordering around a common identity created by shared activity, producing a corporate identity and habituation to forms of civic life. It is in these moments that difference is normalised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X12474477">Nava, 2007</xref>), woven into the fabric of civic life, not an extra element. This normalisation of difference does not mean the exaggeration of difference nor its flattening, but a situated choreography of foregrounding and backgrounding, requiring a collective understanding and negotiation. The school working bee is a case in point. In these events, held several times a year, parents come together to clean up the school and undertake some shared goal, like establishing a garden. Framed by the corporate identity of the ‘school community’, and focused on a shared, purposeful activity, the negotiation of differences – linguistic, among others – is a necessary determinant of whether the event is productive. A list is drawn up of tasks and areas of the school where people are assigned, but as people roll up they inevitably seek clarification from others as to what they need to do, where they get equipment from and so on. The initial talk is largely instrumental, but marked by acknowledgements and pleasantries. As the day progresses, a number of extended exchanges occur. A Chinese mother and an elderly grandmother, whose English is almost non-existent, seek guidance from one of the organisers, an Anglo woman. Through hand gestures, truncated sentences and translations through the younger Chinese woman, a set of tasks is set. As each task is accomplished, another similar exchange occurs to confirm the next. These are accompanied by occasional laughter at their clumsiness. Later in the morning, the Anglo woman and the grandmother have their own exchanges – about flowers and then children. Again, the same mixture of gestures, words or phrases (in English and Mandarin) and laughter provide a rhythm to the tasks. Children provide a central theme for many exchanges between adults, but they are especially significant in negotiating intercultural exchanges among unfamiliars because they offer a sense of common experience and the basis for legitimate enquiry. At the end of the working bee, the two women farewell each other warmly.</p>
<p>The point about these moments in the ordinary spaces of this suburban school is not to romanticise a notion of intercultural harmony, but to recognise that a lot of work gets done around diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1357034X12474477">Noble, 2009b</xref>) which relies on habituated capacities of recognition, enquiry, negotiation, exchange and translation, and on a habituated familiarity with difference as part of the local scene to which people belong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1357034X12474477">Ho, 2011</xref>). These transactions produce what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X12474477">Wise (2011</xref>) calls commensality, a common living based on a sharing of resources and spaces which produces a ‘normalisation of difference’. There may be conflicts, ambivalences and compromises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1357034X12474477">Karner and Parker, 2011</xref>) – but work gets done. Scholarship typically focuses on racial conflict, but rarely gives weight to the skilled, collaborative work of ‘everyday diplomacy’. It is an understanding of the accumulation of practices of habituation that allows us to comprehend these accomplishments.</p>

<title>Towards an Ethnography of Cosmopolitanism</title>
<p>The point of this article is not to offer a sustained ethnography of a particular site, but to use it to consider the methodological and conceptual issues around the habituation of cosmopolitan dispositions. This sketch can only offer a glimpse of the environing conditions of these habits, but it offers some insights into the routinisation of difference in a culturally diverse world which entails forms of intercultural reciprocity and intercultural belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X12474477">Wise, 2010</xref>). This article has attempted to develop a way into this by stressing the role of habit in a pedagogic process of forming capacities of shared living across multiple spaces of ‘habitat’ and their temporalities and flows. Habits are not simple routines, but complex forms of conduct located in ensembles of relations and spaces.</p>
<p>In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1357034X12474477">Skey (2012</xref>), I think that the stress on the methodological problems of analysing cosmopolitanism and habit points us to the necessity of an ethnography of routine and improvisational forms of intercultural negotiation amid urban complexity. This is not to fetishise ethnography as getting to the truth of the matter, but rather insisting that such research provides rich, complex data that better capture the temporality and spatiality of habituated cosmopolitanism. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X12474477">Kendall et al. (2009</xref>: 107) suggest, we need a processual view of cosmopolitanism that is located across spatial and social contexts, and produces a flexible orientation to differences. This sketchy account of several moments in the life of a culturally diverse school does not stand for such an ethnography: its focus on specific habitual practices draws attention to the temporal and spatial elements of a cosmopolitan disposition but leaves for the future the difficult question of how we can trace the complex network of practices which produce this disposition.</p>
<p>Such ethnography would employ observational methods to map flows of people and goods in spaces marked by cultural diversity, chart networks of association, analyse moments of intercultural exchange and track forms of civility which enable these flows. It would aim to engage with the practices of belonging which forge local, national and global attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1357034X12474477">Savage et al., 2005</xref>). This sense of locale is marked not by stasis but by mobility, which offers the possibilities of new connections, new networks of cohabitation. Such a focus will shed light on how the capacities for living amid these are acquired and become ‘second nature’, not just through the iteration of practices, but through the pedagogies of routine, exchange, adaption and reciprocity which fashion cosmopolitan dispositions and intercultural conviviality.</p>
<p>It may be that habit remains an elusive concept for the ethnographer as well – perhaps the best we can hope for is a mapping of the routinised but improvisational ethics of multicultural neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1357034X12474477">Appiah, 2005</xref>), ethics here understood not as a shared moral discourse of right and wrong but as the kinds of procedures or protocols for negotiating differences, developing obligations and reciprocities that facilitate an ongoing intercultural dialogue fundamental to this conviviality. But grappling with this ethics will aim to make sense of how people make themselves ‘at home’ with others amid the complex flows of people, goods and information in contemporary societies.</p>
