<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Repair of a posterior root tear of the medial meniscus (MRT) decreases peak contact pressure by restoring hoop tension and is expected to prevent progression to osteoarthritis.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purposes of this study were (1) to report the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results of arthroscopic pull-out repair of the MRT and (2) to identify prognostic factors of poor outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-one patients (47 women, 4 men) who underwent arthroscopic pull-out repair of the MRT by a single surgeon were enrolled. Mean follow-up after surgery was 33 months (range, 24-44 months). To identify factors affecting final outcome, patient-specific factors, such as gender, age, body mass index, meniscus extrusion, extrusion increase, subchondral edema, degree of varus alignment (&lt;5° or &gt;5°), and cartilage status in the medial compartment (Outerbridge grade 1 or 2 lesion vs grade 3 or 4 lesion), were investigated. Final clinical outcomes were determined using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and patient satisfaction scores, American Knee Society (AKS) scores, and Lysholm scores, and MRI outcomes were determined by evaluating meniscus extrusion and articular cartilage status. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify variables that independently affected clinical and MRI-determined outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> All clinical outcome measures significantly improved after surgery. Patients with Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 chondral lesions had poorer results than those with grade 1 or 2 lesions in terms of AKS function and Lysholm scores. Patients with varus alignment of &gt;5° had poorer results than those with varus alignment of &lt;5° in terms of VAS satisfaction, AKS function, and Lysholm scores. Mean meniscus extrusion increased from 3.6 mm preoperatively to 5.0 mm postoperatively. Chondral lesions progressed in 3 (9.7%) of 31 patients. Preoperative meniscus extrusion was found to be positively correlated with final extrusion.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> At a mean follow-up of 33 months after pull-out repair, extrusion of the meniscus was found to have progressed. Nevertheless, this technique provided patients with a clinical benefit. Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 chondral lesions and varus alignment of &gt;5° were found to independently predict an inferior clinical outcome.</p>

<body>
<p>The posterior root of the medial meniscus maintains hoop tension and prevents meniscus extrusion. Radial tears of the posterior root of the medial meniscus (MRT) cause loss of hoop tension and eventually lead to osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511435622">14</xref></sup> Partial meniscectomy has been the conventional treatment for this condition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511435622">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511435622">15</xref></sup> but biomechanical studies have shown that the consequences of MRT are similar to those of total meniscectomy and that repair restores peak contact pressure to normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511435622">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511435622">18</xref></sup> Symptomatic relief but progression of a radiographic grade of osteoarthritis after partial meniscectomy of MRT have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511435622">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511435622">15</xref></sup> Therefore, increasing attention is being paid to MRT repair, and as a result, various techniques have been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511435622">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435622">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511435622">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511435622">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511435622">16</xref></sup> Recently, clinical studies on arthroscopic pull-out repair of the MRT have reported favorable clinical and radiographic results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435622">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511435622">13</xref></sup> In particular, the chondroprotective effect of repair appears to be encouraging. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435622">11</xref></sup> reported that MRT repair provided significantly better clinical and radiological results than partial meniscectomy and that medial meniscus extrusion decreased after repair, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, it is difficult to obtain definitive information on clinical and MRI results after MRT repair because of the few studies conducted on the subject. Furthermore, the prognostic factors of repair have not been determined. Accordingly, we undertook to document the clinical and MRI results of arthroscopic pull-out MRT repair and to identify the factors associated with poor prognosis.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546511435622" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The records of 77 patients who underwent arthroscopic pull-out MRT repair by a single surgeon between 2008 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with focal Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 cartilage lesions on the weightbearing portion of the medial compartment were considered for surgery. High tibial osteotomy or other cartilage restoration procedures with or without root repair were recommended for patients with large grade 3 or 4 cartilage lesions. Twenty-six patients were excluded for the following reasons: loss of follow-up before 24 months postoperatively (12 patients), concurrent autogenous osteochondral transplantations or microfracture (5 patients), and concurrent correctional tibial osteotomy (9 patients). Accordingly, 51 patients constituted the study cohort. There were 47 female and 4 male patients of an overall mean age of 59 years (range, 45-72 years). Mean follow-up after surgery was 33 months (range, 24-44 months). Final clinical outcomes were measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and patient satisfaction scores, American Knee Society (AKS) knee and function scores, and Lysholm scores. Thirty-one patients (30 women and 1 man) underwent MRI at least 2 years after surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on affected knees using a 1.5-T system (Achieva 1.5-T, Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands). Sequences consisted of sagittal turbo spin-echo intermediate-weighted images (repetition time [TR]/echo time [TE] of 4500/25; 3.0-mm slice thickness; 0.35-mm gap; matrix of 292 × 288; number of excitations [NEX] = 2), coronal turbo spin-echo intermediate-weighted images (TR/TE of 3400/30; 3.0-mm slice thickness; 0.4-mm gap; matrix of 332 × 233; NEX = 3), and axial fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted images (TR/TE of 2800/25; 3.0-mm slice thickness; 0.4-mm gap; matrix of 276 × 260; NEX = 2). Final meniscus extrusion (postExt) and status of articular cartilage were determined by MRI and compared with preoperative findings. Meniscus extrusions were measured on coronal images showing maximum extrusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511435622">8</xref></sup> Good repair healing was defined as confirmed continuity of repair in all 3 (sagittal, coronal, and axial) MRI views, whereas partial healing was defined as loss of continuity in 1 of the 3 views.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435622">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>To identify prognostic factors of final outcome, patient-specific factors, such as gender, age, body mass index (BMI), meniscus extrusion width (preExt), extrusion increase, subchondral edema in the medial compartment, degree of varus alignment, and cartilage status in the medial compartment, were investigated. The study population was dichotomized to determine the effects of subchondral edema, varus alignment, and cartilage status according to the Outerbridge classification. Twenty-five patients had subchondral edema, and 26 patients did not; 33 patients had varus alignment of &lt;5°, and 18 had varus alignment of &gt;5°; and 26 patients had Outerbridge grade 1 or 2, and 25 had focal Outerbridge grade 3 or 4. Five degrees of varus alignment was employed as a cut-off value in the present study because it was found to be the minimum value that had a significant adverse effect on clinical outcome in the preliminary analysis.</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511435622">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Surgery was performed with the anterior arthroscopic approach using medial collateral ligament (MCL) “pie-crusting” release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511435622">16</xref></sup> A routine arthroscopic examination was performed using the anterolateral portal and a low anteromedial portal to confirm the presence of MRT. After the root tear was confirmed, the posterior part of the deep MCL was released to expand the medial joint space. Gentle valgus and external rotational force was applied by the assistant while maintaining the knee joint at 30° of flexion. The deep MCL fiber was severed just above the joint line by repeated puncture with an 18-gauge needle, and this procedure was extended posteriorly and anteriorly until adequate expansion of the joint space was achieved. Once satisfactory widening of the medial joint space was achieved, subsequent procedures were performed in the conventional manner. The torn edge of the meniscus was debrided with a motorized shaver, and the footprint at the attachment area was prepared by removing the cartilage and decorticating with a curved curette through the anteromedial portal. An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) guide (set at 50°) was then introduced through the anteromedial portal and its tip placed in the footprint. Two anteromedial transtibial tunnels were then made in the anterior-to-posterior orientation in the footprint. These 2 points should be separated by more than 5 mm to offer sufficient contact area between the root and footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511435622">Figure 1</xref>). The viewing portal was then switched to the anteromedial portal, and a suture hook (Linvatec, Largo, Florida) loaded with No. 2-0 PDS was inserted through the anterolateral portal. Two PDS sutures were then passed from the femoral surface to the tibial surface of the meniscus in the red-red zone approximately 5 mm medial to the torn margin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511435622">Figure 2</xref>). The sutures of the femoral surface were retrieved via the anterolateral portal and those of the tibial surface via the anteromedial portal. The posterior guide pin was then removed and a wire loop advanced through the posterior tibial tunnel into the joint. The wire loop and sutures of the tibial surface were retrieved through a 5-mm-diameter metal sheath inserted through the anteromedial portal. The sutures were passed through the wire loop and pulled out through the posterior tibial tunnel to the anteromedial tibial cortex. In a similar manner, the sutures of the femoral surface were pulled out through the anterior tibial tunnel to the anteromedial tibial cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511435622">Figure 3</xref>). Each end of the sutures was fixed to the tibial cortex by a sliding knot with the knee in an extended, neutral position. Finally, repair stability was checked by probing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511435622">Figure 4</xref>). After surgery, a cylinder splint was applied for 2 weeks with the knee in extension, and during this period, only partial weightbearing with toe touching was permitted. After the splint was discarded, gentle motion exercise combined with physical therapy was encouraged up to 90° flexion. Full weightbearing was allowed at 6 weeks postoperatively and full flexion and squatting at 12 weeks postoperatively.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois), and statistical significance was accepted for <italic>P</italic> values of &lt;.05. The paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine whether there was a significant improvement in clinical outcome measures after surgery and to compare preExt and postExt values. Univariate analyses were used to identify preoperative factors that significantly affected outcome measures. Relationships between outcome measures and continuous variables, such as age, BMI, preExt, and extrusion increase, were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to determine the effects of gender on outcome measures. The independent 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine the effects of nominal variables (the presence of subchondral edema, varus alignment, cartilage status) on outcome measures. Gender, age, BMI, preExt, the presence of subchondral edema, varus alignment, and cartilage status were subjected to multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of outcome; the computation was performed using the stepwise method.</p>

<p>On MRI, mean medial meniscus extrusion increased from 3.6 ± 1.2 mm to 5.0 ± 1.7 mm (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Meniscus extrusion increased in 20 of 31 patients, decreased in 8, and stayed the same in 3. Good healing status was observed in 28 (90.3%) of the 31 patients who underwent MRI. Chondral lesions progressed in 3 (9.7%) of 31 patients.</p>
<p>Patients with varus alignment of &gt;5° achieved poorer outcomes than those with varus alignment of &lt;5° in terms of VAS patient satisfaction scores and AKS function scores. Furthermore, patients with a cartilage status of grade 3 or 4 achieved poorer outcomes than those with grade 1 or 2 in terms of AKS knee, AKS function, and Lysholm scores. Other variables had no significant effect on final clinical outcome. Body mass index, preExt, and extrusion increase were found to be significantly and positively correlated with postExt. Patients with cartilage grade 3 or 4 had a larger postExt than patients with grade 1 or 2, but other variables were found to have no significant effect on postExt. Final cartilage status was not used as an outcome variable because of a few arthrosis progressions. The results of univariate analysis are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511435622">Table 2</xref>. Multiple regression analysis showed that varus alignment of &gt;5° was a poor prognostic factor in terms of patient satisfaction, AKS function, and Lysholm scores. In addition, an Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 chondral lesion was a poor prognostic factor in terms of AKS function and Lysholm scores. Finally, preExt was a poor prognostic factor in terms of increased postExt.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Arthroscopic MRT repair is a widely accepted method of restoring hoop tension and preventing progression to osteoarthritis, but reports on clinical outcomes are limited. Therefore, we asked whether clinical outcomes are improved after repair, how meniscus extrusion and cartilage status alter, and which factors adversely affect clinical and MRI results. The incidence of MRT has been reported to range from 10.1% to 27.8% among all medial meniscal tears in studies conducted in non-Western countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511435622">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511435622">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511435622">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511435622">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511435622">15</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest follow-up study of arthroscopic MRT repair reported to date. Furthermore, we believe that the cultural requirement to sit with knees hyperflexed contributes to the high prevalence of MRT.</p>
<p>The improvements in clinical outcome measures observed in this study compared favorably with those reported in the literature. In the present study, the mean Lysholm score increased from 48.3 preoperatively to 83.2 postoperatively. Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435622">11</xref></sup> reported that the Lysholm score improved significantly from 56.8 to 85.1, and Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511435622">13</xref></sup> reported that the mean Lysholm knee score improved from 57.0 to 93.1.</p>
<p>However, the present study demonstrates that MRT repair failed to prevent the progression of meniscus extrusion. Meniscus extrusion increased in 20 of 31 patients, decreased in 8, and stayed the same in 3. Mean extrusion increased from 3.6 mm to 5.0 mm, whereas it decreased from 3.13 mm to 2.94 mm in a study by Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435622">11</xref></sup> We suppose that this disagreement was caused by their inclusion of an unknown proportion of patients with combined correctional high tibial osteotomy, whereas we excluded those patients to avoid confounders. Incomplete healing of the repaired root may be another reason for this increased extrusion in our series. In a second-look arthroscopic study after pull-out repair of the MRT, it was found that all 10 menisci repaired healed completely without any additional chondral lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511435622">13</xref></sup> In contrast, Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435622">11</xref></sup> stated that 9 of 14 second-look cases had a normal fixation strength and that 17 of 30 (56.7%) showed complete healing of the meniscus by MRI. Seo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511435622">17</xref></sup> also reported a lack of complete healing in second-look cases and that lax or scar tissue healing occurred in most cases. Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511435622">13</xref></sup> found that MRI was unsatisfactory for assessing bone to meniscus healing and emphasized the importance of second-look arthroscopy for estimating healing. Therefore, we suppose, although a good healing status was observed by MRI in 90.3% of our series, that repairs were lax enough to permit further extrusion, especially when the medial compartment was not unloaded by high tibial osteotomy. Nevertheless, the results of the present study show that the progression of extrusion had no detrimental effect on clinical outcomes. Arthrosis by MRI progressed in 3 (9.7%) of our 31 patients, whereas 6 (20%) of 30 patients showed progression in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435622">11</xref></sup> The longer mean follow-up period of this previous study (48.5 vs 33 months) was the probable cause of this difference.</p>
<p>Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that varus alignment of &gt;5° and Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 chondral lesions were independent risk factors of poor clinical outcome after MRT repair. For example, patients with varus alignment of &gt;5° had a lower mean AKS function score (−14.271) as compared with patients with varus alignment of &lt;5°, and patients with Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 had a lower mean AKS function score (−12.533) than patients with grade 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511435622">Table 3</xref>). Our findings agree with those of Han et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511435622">9</xref></sup> who noted a significant negative correlation between chondral wear at arthroscopy and clinical outcome after partial meniscectomy for an MRT. Therefore, we suppose patients with varus alignment of &gt;5° with or without a grade 3 or 4 cartilage lesion in the medial compartment receive additional clinical benefits from correctional tibial osteotomy. Concurrent correctional osteotomy with MRT repair was performed in only 9 patients in our series because many patients were unwilling to use crutches and to undergo restricted weightbearing for a longer period. Those with combined procedures were excluded because the objective of the present study concerned prognostic factors of isolated arthroscopic MRT repair. Nevertheless, this study highlights that MRT patients with &gt;5° of varus alignment or a grade 3 or 4 cartilage lesion should be informed preoperatively of the likelihood of an inferior clinical outcome and recommended for correctional osteotomy. Although Seo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511435622">17</xref></sup> also recommended root repair with concurrent high tibial osteotomy for root tears with &gt;3° of varus alignment and high-grade cartilage degeneration in the medial compartment, no direct evidence supporting combined correctional osteotomy and root repair is available in the literature. Therefore, a future comparative study of arthroscopic MRT repair with or without correctional osteotomy is required. In the present study, preExt was the only independent risk factor found to be positively correlated with postExt. Patients with Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 chondral lesions and high BMI were also found to be more likely to have an elevated preExt, although these are not mentioned in the article. These findings suggest that meniscus extrusion can predispose cartilage degeneration and that obesity may play a role in the development and progression of MRT. Several studies corroborate this finding. Furthermore, a significant association was found between elevated BMI and a meniscal tear leading to surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511435622">7</xref></sup> In fact, Ozkoc et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511435622">15</xref></sup> suggested that this type of meniscal tear is closely related to obesity. Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511435622">4</xref></sup> also demonstrated that considerable extrusion (≥3 mm) can be associated with MRT and a concomitant chondral lesion of the medial femoral condyle. In a subsequent study, these authors found that MRT was associated with older age, female gender, and obesity and strongly associated with an increased incidence and severity of cartilage degeneration as compared with horizontal tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511435622">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The strengths of the current study are that all operations were performed by one surgeon and that prognostic factors were identified after adjusting for possible preoperative confounders by multivariate analyses. Nevertheless, some limitations need to be considered. First, second-look arthroscopy was not performed in the present study, and thus, the real healing statuses of repairs were not determined. Second, the follow-up was comparatively short, and thus, long-term chondroprotective effects and repair integrities were not determined. Third, no data were obtained that allowed partial MRT meniscectomy and MRT repair plus high tibial osteotomy to be compared. However, the present study adds to the limited information available on the prognostic factors of arthroscopic MRT repair.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the present study, meniscus extrusion was found to have progressed after a mean follow-up of 33 months after pull-out MRT repair. Nevertheless, this technique provided clinical benefits. Furthermore, an Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 chondral lesion and varus alignment of &gt;5° were found to independently predict an inferior clinical outcome.</p>
