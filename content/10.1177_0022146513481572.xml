<p><bold>Manuscript Submission</bold></p>
<p>Manuscripts must be submitted electronically to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jhsb">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jhsb</ext-link>. Submitting authors are required to set up an online account on the SAGE Track system, powered by Scholar One.</p>
<p>A <bold>$25 manuscript processing</bold> fee payable through the SAGE Track system is required. No fee is required for submissions by ASA student members.</p>
<p>Editorial Office: <italic>Journal of Health and Social Behavior</italic>, Population Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station G1800, Austin, TX 78712; phone: (512) 232–1711; fax: (512) 471-4886; e-mail: <email>JHSB@austin.utexas.edu</email>.</p>
<p><bold>Manuscript Preparation</bold></p>
<p>Manuscripts submitted to the <italic>Journal of Health and Social Behavior</italic> should not exceed 10,000 words in length, including:</p>
<p>title page, (2) abstract, (3) text, (4) notes, (5) references, (6) tables, and (7) figures. Please keep in mind that if your tables are lengthy and/or you have horizontal tables, this will affect the page count and you may be asked to reduce the length of your manuscript. All pages must be typed and double-spaced (including notes and references). Margins must be at least 1 inch (i.e., line length must not exceed 6–1/2 inches). Please use Times New Roman font, 12-point type size. The object is to provide reviewers and editors with easy-to-read text and space for notes. It is the responsibility of authors to submit manuscripts in the proper <italic>JHSB</italic> format (see below). Manuscripts not submitted in adherence to the length requirements or to <italic>JHSB</italic> format will be returned for revision. Additional details on preparing and submitting manuscripts to <italic>JHSB</italic> are published in the <italic>American Sociological Association Style Guide, Fourth Edition</italic> (ISBN 0–912764–31–3), available from the ASA Bookstore (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.asanet.org/bookstore">http://www.asanet.org/bookstore</ext-link>).</p>
<list id="list1-0022146513481572" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. For all new submissions and revisions, the first page of the manuscript should be a blinded title page (author(s) names, affiliations, acknowledgments, credits, and/or grant numbers should be removed). Include title, total word count (include all text, notes, and references; do not include word counts for tables or figures), number of tables, number of figures, and running head (short title, fewer than 55 characters with spaces). If the manuscript is conditionally accepted or accepted for publication, please include the authors’ names and institutions (listed vertically if there is more than one author) on the title page. Use an asterisk (*) at the end of the title for the title footnote at the bottom of the title page. The title footnote includes the name and address of the corresponding author, acknowledgments, credits, and/or grant numbers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2. The <bold>abstract</bold> must be fewer than 150 words. The abstract should include the sample size, study design (e.g. survey, in-depth interviews), and the source of the data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3. The <bold>text</bold> of the manuscript should begin on a new page headed by the full title. Notes, references, tables, figures, and appendices appear in separate sections following the text, in that order. Since manuscripts are evaluated through an anonymous peer review process, authors must remove identifying references or material. When citing your own work, please write “Smith (1992) concluded…,” but do not write “I concluded (Smith 1992)…” Please either blind or remove citations of working papers or papers in progress.</p></list-item></list>
<list id="list2-0022146513481572" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p><italic>Headings and subheadings</italic> in the text indicate the organization of content. Major headings should include: Background, Data and Methods, Results or Findings, Discussion, References; no heading for introduction. Generally, three heading levels are sufficient. See recent issues for examples.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Citations</italic> in the text should provide the last name of the author(s) and the year of publication. Include page numbers for direct quotes or specific passages. Cite only those works needed to provide evidence for your assertions and to refer to important sources on the topic. In the following examples of text citations, ellipses (…) indicate manuscript text:
<list id="list3-0022146513481572" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If author’s name is in the text, follow it with the year in parentheses: “Duncan (1959)…”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If author’s name is not in the text, enclose the last name and year in parentheses: “… (Gouldner 1963).”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pages cited follow the year of publication after a colon: “… (Ramirez and Weiss 1979:239–40).”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide last names for joint authors: “…(Martin and Bailey 1988).”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For three authors, list all three last names in the first citation in the text: “…(Carr, Smith, and Jones 1962).” For all subsequent citations use “et al.” throughout: “…(Carr et al. 1962).” For works with four or more authors, use “et al.” throughout.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For institutional authorship, supply minimum identification from the complete citation: “…(U.S. Bureau of the Census 1963:117).”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>List a series of citations in alphabetical order or date order separated by semicolons: “… (Burgess 1968; Marwell et al. 1971).” Use consistent ordering throughout the manuscript.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use “forthcoming” to cite sources scheduled for publication. For dissertations and unpublished papers, cite the date. If no date, use “n.d.” in place of the date: “…Smith (forthcoming) and Oropesa (n.d.).”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For machine-readable data files, cite authorship and date: “…(Institute for Survey Research 1976).”</p></list-item></list></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Notes</italic> should be numbered in the text consecutively using superscript Arabic numerals. If referring to a note earlier or later in the text, use a parenthetical note: “…(see note 3).”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Equations</italic> in text must be typed. Use consecutive Arabic numerals in parentheses at the right margin to identify important equations.</p></list-item></list>
<list id="list4-0022146513481572" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. <bold>Notes</bold> should be typed or printed, double-spaced, in a separate “NOTES” section and should appear after the text but before the references. Begin each note with the Arabic numeral to which it is keyed in the text. <bold>Authors should not use the “note” function in Word.</bold> Notes can (a) explain or amplify text, (b) cite materials of limited availability, or (c) append information presented in a table. Avoid long notes. Consider (a) stating in the text that information is available from the author, (b) depositing the information in a national retrieval center and inserting an appropriate note, or (c) adding an appendix.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5. <bold>References</bold> follow the text in a separate section headed “REFERENCES.” All references cited in the text must be listed in the reference section, and vice versa. Publication information for each must be complete and correct. It is authors’ responsibility to make sure that all information provided in the reference section is complete and correct. List the references in alphabetical order by authors’ last names; include first names and middle initials for all authors. If there are two or more items by the same author(s), list them in order of year of publication. For repeated authors or editors, give the author's (or editor's) full name in all subsequent references. If the cited material is unpublished but has been accepted for publication, use “Forthcoming” in place of the date, and give the name of the journal or publishing house. For dissertations and unpublished papers, cite the date and place the paper was presented and/or where it is available. If no date is available, use “N.d.” in place of the date. If two or more works are by the same author(s) within the same year, list them in alphabetical order by title and distinguish them by adding the letters a, b, c, and so on, to the year (or to “Forthcoming” or “N.d.”). For works with multiple authors, only the name of the first author is inverted (e.g., “Jones, Arthur B., Colin D. Smith, and James Petersen.”). List all authors; using “et al.” in the reference section is not acceptable. A few examples follow. Refer to the <italic>American Sociological Association Style Guide</italic> and recent issues of <italic>JHSB</italic> for additional examples:
