<abstract>
<p>Little is known about African American men’s beliefs about mental illness. A descriptive qualitative study, using the common sense model (CSM), examined African American men’s beliefs about mental illness, perceptions of stigma associated with mental illness, and barriers to help-seeking. A total of 17 community-dwelling African American men participated in individual interviews. Dimensional analysis guided by the CSM showed most of the men identified mental illness causal factors consistent with the biopsychosocial model of mental disorders. They believed mental illness is a chronic disorder having negative consequences and reported experiencing barriers to help seeking. In contrast with previous studies, most men in the present study did not perceive stigma associated with mental illness and did not identify stigma as a barrier to help seeking. They were open to help seeking, were optimistic about professional treatment, encouraged others to seek treatment, and expressed strong interest in mental health research. Implications for counseling psychology research and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>A founding value of counseling psychology is the importance of cultural diversity and inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0011000012447824">Wrenn, 1962</xref>). More recently, with the increasing cultural diversity of the U.S. population, counseling psychologists have been on the front line calling attention to addressing the needs of culturally diverse groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012447824">Heppner, Casas, Carter, &amp; Stone, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000012447824">Packard, 2009</xref>). In particular, counseling psychologists were instrumental in developing multicultural guidelines and competencies to improve the quality of care provided to culturally diverse groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012447824">Arredondo et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Mental illness is a health condition that should be of importance in the area of cultural diversity and inclusion because no one is exempt from mental illness, regardless of nationality, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or age. In the United States, an estimated 57.7 million Americans ages 18 and older have a diagnosable mental disorder in any given year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012447824">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>), and African Americans make up 7.5 million of that mentally ill population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012447824">Davis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Depression, one of the most common mental disorders, has a devastating impact on African Americans. Although the 12-month prevalence of depression among African Americans and Caucasians is similar, 5.9% and 6.9%, respectively, African Americans (56.5%) report more severe symptoms and associated disability than do Caucasians (38.6%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0011000012447824">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, although the prevalence of depression among African American men (7%) is lower than that among White men (16%), African American men tend to have more severe symptoms and disability, whereby disability is defined as whether depression interferes with functioning in home management, work, relationships with others, and social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0011000012447824">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, inadequate treatment of depression among African Americans is a concern for the profession. According to a recent national psychiatric epidemiology survey, African Americans received adequate mental health care, defined as a minimum of four visits with a mental health clinician, only 14% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012447824">Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>). These results regarding the adequacy of four visits are alarming because results of several clinical trials examining adequate treatment for depression recommend a minimum of eight visits as adequate care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011000012447824">Wang, Demler, &amp; Kessler, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The unmet mental health needs of African American men raise two questions: How are they coping, and what are their help-seeking behaviors? Research in this area is scarce. However, a recent national survey found rates of outpatient service use among African American men is low compared with those of other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012447824">Neighbors et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, within the past 12 months, only 7.4% of African American men used any type of mental health services in response to problems with emotions, nerves, mental health, or drug or alcohol abuse compared to 12.2% of African American women, 11.3% of Caribbean American men, and 8.5% of Caribbean American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000012447824">Neighbors et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Because African American men evidence low use of mental health services, a key question is what factors might be impeding their use of mental health services. Research clearly documents that poor access to mental health services, for example, lack of health insurance, is a barrier to help seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2001</xref>). However, the question remains, are there barriers specific to African American men? For instance, what are their beliefs or attitudes toward mental illness? Could their beliefs serve as a barrier to help seeking? Might they have concerns about being stigmatized regarding mental illness? Are they using effective alternative coping behaviors, thus eliminating the need to seek professional help? Current research does not address these significant questions.</p>
<p>Understanding individuals’ beliefs about illnesses is important because their ideas ultimately shape beliefs about treatment and help seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012447824">Leventhal, Meyer, &amp; Nerenz, 1980</xref>). For example, stigmatized beliefs about mental illness have been documented as a deterrent to help seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012447824">Anglin, Link, &amp; Phelan, 2006</xref>; Gary, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000012447824">Rao, Feinglass, &amp; Corrigan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011000012447824">Ward &amp; Collins, 2010</xref>). However, African American men’s beliefs about mental illness and their impact on coping are unknown, as most of the previous research examining African Americans’ beliefs about mental illness have focused on women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012447824">Matthews, Corrigan, Smith, &amp; Aranda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward, Clark, &amp; Heidrich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward &amp; Heidrich, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012447824">Matthews et al. (2006)</xref> utilized focus groups to examine community-dwelling African American women’s attitudes toward mental illness. Participants described the causes of mental illness as psychological (e.g., trauma or stress), biological (e.g., having a chemical imbalance), sociological (e.g., oppression or racism), spiritual (e.g., not having a good relationship with God), and supernatural (e.g., demon possession). Although these findings add to the sparse literature regarding African American women’s beliefs about mental illness, the degree to which the aforementioned beliefs are consistent with those of African American men remains unclear.</p>
<p>In the only study we could identify that focused on African American men’s beliefs about mental illness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0011000012447824">Watkins and Neighbors (2007)</xref> found participants believed the negative portrayal of African American men in the media can intensify the stigma of a mental illness. One participant stated, “We feel like we are already at the bottom because we’re Black and showing everyone that you may not be stable in your mind is out of the question. . . . You got many things against you because you’re a Black man” (p. 278). These findings suggest the experience of being an African American male may negatively influence attitudes toward mental illness.</p>
<p>Given the limited literature about African American men’s beliefs about mental illness and help seeking, further exploration should be conducted with use of qualitative designed studies and a comprehensive theoretical framework. Such an approach has the potential to give voice to African American men, a historically underserved group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000012447824">Moodley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>). For this study, we employed the common sense model (CSM) and used a qualitative design to examine African American men’s beliefs about mental illness, perceptions of stigma associated with mental illness and help seeking, and barriers to help seeking.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012447824">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<sec id="section2-0011000012447824">
<title>Common Sense Model</title>
<p>The CSM was developed by prominent health psychologist Howard Leventhal, PhD, and is based on his self-regulation theory, which suggest that illness representations, an individual’s beliefs and expectations about an illness, determine his or her appraisal of an illness situation and health behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012447824">Diefenbach &amp; Leventhal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012447824">Leventhal, Nerenz, &amp; Steele, 1984</xref>). The CSM postulates individuals have commonsense beliefs or lay models, that is, representations, about health and illnesses. These beliefs or lay models are based on ideas, thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs informed by experience, cultural traditions, formal education, or stories from family and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012447824">Diefenbach &amp; Leventhal, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012447824">Donovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0011000012447824">S. E. Ward, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Although lay models or beliefs may or may not be medically accurate, these beliefs guide the manner in which individuals cope with health and illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012447824">Petrie, Jago, &amp; Devcich, 2007</xref>). Coping strategies are typically employed in a manner consistent with the individual’s beliefs or lay model of the illness. For example, among African Americans religious beliefs and religious practices such as reading the Bible, prayer, and going to church are ingrained in the culture and are often used to cope with health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012447824">Dessio et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, an African American male or female experiencing a physical or mental health condition and believe it is caused by disobedience to God might consult with their pastor or church leader to get spiritual help for a health condition.</p>
<p>The CSM postulates that illness representations or lay models comprise seven attributes: identity, cause, timeline, consequences, cure or controllability, illness coherence, and emotional representation. <italic>Identity</italic> focuses on beliefs about labeling illness symptoms. <italic>Cause</italic> refers to beliefs about factors that cause the illness (hereditary, infection, etc). <italic>Timeline</italic> relates to beliefs about time trajectory (whether an illness is acute, chronic, or cyclic). <italic>Consequence</italic> refers to beliefs about outcomes of the illness (minor or major/negative). <italic>Cure or control</italic> includes beliefs about whether something can be done to control the illness, whereas <italic>illness coherence</italic> involves what the individual thinks about the illness or the meaning of the illness. <italic>Emotional representation</italic> refers to the emotional impact or emotional response to the illness. Below is an explanation of how these attributes construct an illness representation or lay model using depression as an example.</p>
<p>The beginning symptoms are excessive crying, negative thinking, sadness, and suicidal ideation, which the individual might identify as depression (identity or label). The initial depression label determines that it is an acute condition (timeline), with major consequences, potentially caused by a number of factors (hereditary, marital issues, unemployment), and can usually be treated (control/cure). During this process, the individual may experience emotional reactions that could include fear and anxiety (emotional response) and have thoughts about what it means to have depression (illness coherence). Taken together, these attributes of the illness representation make up the “depression profile” that may lead the individual to engage in commonsense health behaviors such as trying to figure out how to cope or get help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012447824">Diefenbach, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The CSM is a good fit with counseling psychology research and practice in a number of ways. First, the CSM has been used to examine perceptions of illness and how people cope with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression, and eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012447824">Fortune, Smith, &amp; Garvey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012447824">Holliday, Wall, Treasure, &amp; Weinman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012447824">Lobban &amp; Barrowclough, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward et al., 2009</xref>). Results of these studies have supported relationships between illness representations and symptom reporting, help seeking, behavior change, and adherence to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000012447824">MacInnes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000012447824">Petrie et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, use of the CSM has the potential to extend knowledge of health beliefs among racial and ethnic minorities, and counseling psychologists are well positioned to examine these issues to inform provision of culturally competent care. Second, because counseling psychologists are committed to diversity, multicultural inclusion, social justice work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000012447824">Miville et al., 2009</xref>), and acknowledgment of clients’ cultural values and norms within a counseling context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012447824">Forrest, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012447824">Fouad et al., 2004</xref>), a theoretical framework like the CSM, which gives voice to participants, can be useful. Furthermore, because counseling psychologists have been at the forefront in developing multicultural guidelines and competencies to improve the quality of care provided to culturally diverse groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012447824">Arredondo et al., 1996</xref>), use of the CSM in counseling psychology research and practice can help provide better understanding of the health beliefs of minority groups to further inform multicultural guidelines and competencies.</p>
<p>Only one published qualitative study reports the use of the CSM with African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward et al., 2009</xref>). That study examined 15 African American women’s lay representations of mental illness, their perceptions of stigma, and their coping behaviors in response to mental illness. Findings revealed the women believed that culturally specific and age-related factors such as racism, discrimination, retirement, and limited social activity because of aging can cause mental illness. They also believed mental illness is chronic, with multiple negative health outcomes. The women endorsed prayer and use of counseling as coping strategies but were ambivalent about use of medications. Given that only women were studied, it is unknown whether these lay beliefs are shared by African American men. Therefore, the present study replicates the prior study, with the goal of using the CSM to identify African American men’s beliefs or lay models of mental illness.</p>
<p>The following research questions were examined: (a) “What are African American men’s beliefs or lay model about mental illness?” (b) “What are African American men’s perceptions of stigma associated with mental illness and help seeking?” and (c) “What barriers do African American men experience in help seeking?” This line of inquiry was geared to provide more insight into African American men’s subjective perspectives about mental illness, which has the potential to guide counseling psychologists in developing interventions tailored to the unique needs of African American men.</p>

<sec id="section4-0011000012447824">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>An exploratory, descriptive, qualitative study design was used. This design was selected for a number of reasons. Given the limited mental health research focusing specifically on African American men’s beliefs about mental illness and coping, use of an exploratory design allowed for more flexibility in developing the interview questions to gain insight into the men’s subjective perspective on these issues, thus giving them “voice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011000012447824">Trimble, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward, 2005</xref>). In addition, use of qualitative methodology is well suited for doing research with culturally diverse groups because it allows the researcher to work in partnership with participants, which minimizes the power relationships that can exist between researchers and research participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000012447824">Suzuki, Ahluwalia, Kwong Arora, &amp; Mattis, 2007</xref>). Such partnerships between researchers and research participants provide the researcher entry into participants’ worlds to learn about their experiences as they perceive it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012447824">Ponterotto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward, 2005</xref>). In addition, qualitative research is highly recommended for research into understudied issues and groups whose “voices have been silenced” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>, p. 40). The authors recognized the paucity of research focusing on mental illness and African American men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0011000012447824">Watkins &amp; Neighbors, 2007</xref>) and their low participation rates in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012447824">BeLue, Taylor-Richardson, Lin, Rivera, &amp; Grandison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012447824">Wendler et al., 2006</xref>), and thus the present study’s use of qualitative design makes a significant contribution to the counseling psychology literature.</p>
<p>An exploratory, qualitative approach in the present study offered the best opportunity to obtain a complex, detailed understanding of African American men’s beliefs about mental illness as they perceive and describe it. In addition, recognizing that African American men have been underrepresented in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012447824">BeLue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012447824">Wendler et al., 2006</xref>), use of an exploratory qualitative approach allowed for increasing this group’s comfort and sense of trust in the research process by giving them more flexibility in the interview questions, more control in the interview to share their stories, and a chance to have their voices heard, by minimizing the power relationship that often exists between researchers and study participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011000012447824">
<title>Sampling Procedures and Sample</title>
<p>Sample inclusion criteria were designed to maximize recruitment and obtain a representative sample of African American men. Inclusion criteria were (a) male, (b) 25 years old or older, and (c) self-identification as African American. In addition, the men were eligible regardless of whether or not they had been diagnosed with mental illness or ever sought treatment for a mental illness, as we were interested in their beliefs regardless of their personal experience with mental illness. Broad inclusion criteria were used, as poor access to care results in substantial populations of African American men who are affected by mental illness directly or indirectly, yet are not formally diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012447824">Davis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of the CSM guided decisions about the study sample. As this study was designed to examine African American men’s commonsense beliefs about mental illness, perceptions of stigma, and help-seeking behaviors, the use of purposeful sampling was appropriate. Purposeful sampling involves selecting individuals because they can provide information to facilitate understanding of the central issue being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Purposeful sampling allows flexibility in decisions about who should be sampled, what form sampling will take, and how many people should be sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Thus, purposeful sampling allowed recruitment of only African American men for this study. It also accommodates snowball sampling, which involves participants’ invitation of others with ideas about the issue being studied and is useful for study populations with low research participation, such as African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012447824">BeLue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012447824">Wendler et al., 2006</xref>). Purposeful sampling also facilitated broadening the inclusion criteria to include men who did not have a mental illness, which was important as we were interested in the men’s views whether or not they had ever been diagnosed with a mental illness or sought treatment. Using purposeful sampling, 17 African American men, ages 24 to 75, were recruited to participate in the current study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011000012447824">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Pre-recruitment strategies included connecting with community partners (pastors, directors of community agencies, and members of community advisory boards) to review the recruitment flyer for the study and get community feedback regarding the use of the flyer and how to ensure the flyer had relevant information and was culturally appropriate to reach the African American community.</p>
<p>Recruitment strategies included (a) advertisements published in a local African American magazine, (b) flyers strategically posted in local neighborhoods and businesses including local African American churches, barber shops, apartment complexes, and community centers, and (c) meetings with pastors of local churches and directors of community agencies to build community support and promote the study. Since the inclusion criteria were broad, all 17 participants who expressed interest in the study were included. Participants were allowed to choose the interview location to enhance comfort level and trust. Some participants were interviewed in their homes and others in a research office. The study site was a suburban city in the Midwest with a small African American population (6%). This study was approved by the human participants institutional review board (IRB) of a large university in the Midwest. Because our sample was drawn from a small community of African Americans and there were concerns about stigma associated with mental illness in this community, an effort was made to protect participants’ privacy and confidentially. As a result, the IRB prohibited us from providing detailed demographic information about our sample as well as potentially identifiable descriptive data in the results. All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study, and to protect our participants’ confidentiality and privacy, their informed consent was separated from other data collected. On completion of the interview, all participants received a $10 gift card to thank them for their participation.</p>
<sec id="section7-0011000012447824">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>All respondents participated in a 60- to 75-minute, semistructured, individual, face-to-face interview designed to elicit candid beliefs, attitudes, and opinions. The interview questions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000012447824">Table 1</xref>) were based on the seven CSM attributes. All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed.</p>

<p>Interviews were conducted by a male graduate student with supervision by the first author, an experienced researcher and licensed counseling psychologist. Use of a single interviewer ensured adherence to the study protocol and reduced bias attributable to interviewer variability. The interviewer was African American to facilitate entry into the participants’ worlds, provide a deeper understanding of their perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward, 2005</xref>), and enhance rapport and participant trust—all important issues when high levels of cultural mistrust may be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012447824">Hamilton et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Demographic questionnaire</title>
<p>A brief demographic questionnaire collected respondents’ age, marital status, level of education, socioeconomic status, and income. Additional questions addressed any previous diagnosis with mental illness. A list of prevalent mental illnesses was provided in a checklist format to aid responses. Participants completed the demographic questionnaire at the end of the interview.</p>

<title>Debriefing session</title>
<p>After completing the interview and demographic questionnaire, participants were invited to participate in a debriefing session, an opportunity to process any emotional reactions to the interview, share any concerns about their participation, and receive referrals for mental health counseling if needed. None of the participants expressed interest in the debriefing session.</p>

<title>Data Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using dimensional analysis to identify participants’ beliefs consistent with the seven conceptual dimensions of the CSM and other dimensions generated by the participants. In dimensional analysis, the objective is to address the question, “What all is involved here?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012447824">Schatzman, 1991</xref>, p. 310). The key process in the analysis is to construct and understand the components of a complex, multidimensional social object from the participant’s perspective. This analytical process involves conducting line-by-line analysis of transcripts to facilitate open coding, memo writing, constant comparative analysis, saturation of emerging dimensions, and integration of emerging dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012447824">Charmaz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012447824">Kools, McCarthy, Durham, &amp; Robrecht, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012447824">Schatzman, 1991</xref>), which are discussed in detail below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0011000012447824">
<title>Coders</title>
<p>Data analysis was conducted by the first author (E.C.W., a licensed psychologist and assistant professor) and the second author (D.D.B., a counseling psychology graduate student), both of whom self-identify as Black women. E.C.W. has been doing research and clinical practice in the African American community for the past 12 years and D.D.B. for the past 5 years. In the process of data analysis, E.C.W. and D.D.B. conducted open coding independently, followed by meetings to address discrepancies in coding. Differences were resolved by consensus. Thereafter, they met weekly to review memos, conduct constant comparative analysis, and integrate data. Below is a description of data analysis procedures.</p>
<sec id="section12-0011000012447824">
<title>Scientific rigor</title>
<p>Scientific rigor refers to research procedures involved in ensuring the quality of the research, which are described below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000012447824">Morse, Barrett, Mayan, Olson, &amp; Spiers, 2002</xref>). Before conducting data analysis, the coders–authors engaged in critical self-analysis to identify attitudes, beliefs, and assumptions that could affect data analysis. For example, E.C.W., recognized her extensive clinical work with African Americans and knowledge of African American culture could introduce bias to the analysis process, whereby certain participant data might be taken for granted and not subjected to in-depth analysis. Also, D.D.B. recognized her bias regarding culturally informed assumptions about gender roles within the Black community. To limit the impact of these assumptions during the data analysis process, E.C.W. and D.D.B. worked closely and continually challenged each other to stay grounded in the data.</p>
<p>During data analysis, rigor was established through the use of bracketing, in which the researchers were mindful of their preconceived notions and actively tried to set them aside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Memoing was used to track analysis, which helped reduce introduction of preconceived notions in the data analysis and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012447824">Charmaz, 2000</xref>). To further establish rigor, the researchers independently conducted open coding of each transcript, then met jointly to (a) address discrepancies in coding, which were resolved by consensus, (b) review memos, (c) conduct constant comparative analysis, and (d) integrate the data. To increase trustworthiness of study results, a colleague with expertise in qualitative research served as an auditor to review data analysis and study results midway through data analysis and at the end of data analysis. The auditor also reviewed the final manuscript. Also, a written report of study results was provided to two randomly selected participants for their review, a process known as member checking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012447824">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>). Both participants reported their experiences were captured in the results, agreed with the results, and did not recommend any changes or addition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0011000012447824">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Before conducting data analysis, all transcripts were uploaded into NVIVO, a qualitative computer data management software program that facilitates data coding, rapid retrieval and comparison of codes, and data management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000012447824">Richards, 2006</xref>). Phase 1 consisted of open coding to identify salient emerging dimensions as described by participants. Salience was determined by participants’ language and emotional expression such as phrasing, repetition, descriptions of meaningful actions and events, and sharing of emotions. Dimensions were based on the CSM (e.g., identity, cause, consequences, etc.) and other dimensions participants identified as important to their experiences.</p>
<p>Phase 2 involved memo writing to record stages of the analysis. Memos were used to decipher and expand dimensions to identify properties and conditions and also to identify interrelations among dimensions, properties, and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012447824">Charmaz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012447824">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). Properties are descriptors of the dimensions (e.g., stress or heredity), as related to the cause dimension. Conditions influence an action (e.g., barriers were identified as conditions). One memo, for example, focused on the consequence dimension and identified three properties or descriptors participants believed were associated with having a mental illness: (a) restrictive placements such as in psychiatric hospitals and correctional institutions, (b) negative impact on functioning, and (c) behavioral problems.</p>
<p>Phase 3 was constant comparative analyses. Dimensions identified in Phases 1 and 2 were compared across individual participants and as a group to understand individual dimensions as well as similarities, differences, and interrelations among dimensions across participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012447824">Bowers, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012447824">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). In Phase 4, analyses continued until saturation of the data set, or the “point in which the researcher cannot discover new dimensions in the dataset” (Bowers, 1989, p. 48), was achieved. In Phase 5, data were integrated by combining the dimensions, properties, and conditions into a whole to understand “what is all involved here” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000012447824">Schatzman, 1991</xref>, p. 310).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Descriptive analysis showed the mean age of participants was 54 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.79, range = 24–75). The median level of education was 2 years of college or technical school. Annual income ranged from $0 to $50,000, with a mode of $10,001 to $20,000 (71%). Five participants reported never being married, four were divorced, three were married, three were separated, one was living with a partner, and one was widowed. The mean number of children was 4 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.5, range = 1–9). Six men (36%) reported a prior diagnosis of a mental illness. The most frequently reported mental illness diagnosis was depression (<italic>n</italic> = 4, 24%), followed by posttraumatic stress disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 2, 12%).</p>
<p>The results are presented using the following rubric of descriptors: “all” refers to responses from the total sample of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 17), “majority” or “most” refers to responses from 12 or more participants, “some” or “several” refers to responses from 5 to 11 participants, and “few” refers to responses from 4 or fewer participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000012447824">Rhodes, Hill, Thompson, Elliot, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000012447824">Sperber Richie, Fassinger, &amp; Prosser, 1997</xref>). Single cases are not included in the results. In addition, results are presented using thick description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000012447824">Ponterotto &amp; Grieger, 2007</xref>). In qualitative research, thick description involves presenting detail, context, emotions, and social relationships to establish the significance of the experience or phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000012447824">Patton, 2002</xref>). In the present study, participants’ verbatim narratives (quotes) are used to provide thick description of the results. Also, study results are presented specifically regarding each research question.</p>
<sec id="section15-0011000012447824">
<title>Question 1: African American Men’s Representations and Beliefs About Mental Illness</title>
<p>All participants responded to questions regarding the seven attributes of illness representation addressed in this study. These attributes are presented along with properties (descriptors) to provide more context regarding participants’ beliefs about mental illness (thick description).</p>
<sec id="section16-0011000012447824">
<title>Identity (symptoms)</title>
<p>All participants described a range of symptoms they believed were associated with mental illness. Further analysis of these symptoms revealed four descriptors of symptoms: behavioral, cognitive, affective, and intrapersonal. Behavioral symptoms included abnormal and psychotic-like behaviors such as engaging in self-harm, violence, feeling out of touch with reality, and hearing voices. Cognitive symptoms were predominantly described as difficulties in concentrating, learning, and communicating with others. Affective symptoms included excessive worrying and feeling overwhelmed and stressed, whereas intrapersonal symptoms were primarily low self-esteem and sense of insecurity. From the participants’ perspective, these symptoms can occur independently or simultaneously. Below are four quotes from participants illustrating how they believed these symptoms were associated with mental illness.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Behavioral</italic>: That’s right, abnormal behavior. It’s really, like someone start acting abnormal, you know when something is not right. Something ain’t right, So I know a white guy, he was barking like a dog, and he was on a truck with me and then he went around up the building and started getting on it and he’s barking like a dog. People start worrying about it you know, and they called security and everything. I said he can get back on this truck, but they take him to a lock up ward.</p>
<p><italic>Cognitive</italic>: Well, depending on which mental illness is it, somebody’s learning capability can be slow, their behavior, their speech, you know, their thinking patterns. It can even go so far as the nature of the conversation you know.</p>
<p><italic>Affective</italic>: Well, [you] start doing a lot of worrying on different things you know, you’re not getting it together. That’s a lot of stress, too. Then sometimes it depends on what kind of illness, I mean sickness. It bothers you and all that brings more stress on you, you know. It starts to mess your mind up, like nothing’s ever going to be right again. That’s the way I see it.</p>
<p><italic>Interpersonal</italic>: Yeah, I mean just kind of being withdrawn from people, friends and family, things like that and not doing anything, not being able to get out of bed, things like that, and really just not wanting to interact with other people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0011000012447824">
<title>Cause</title>
<p>All participants believed that mental illness can be caused by several factors (descriptors) including genetics, heredity, trauma, and social stressors. For instance, they indicated that people can inherit mental illness if it “runs” in their family. They also believed that the experience of trauma from physical and sexual abuse and domestic violence could cause mental illness. They believed that many social stressors could cause mental illness. Some of the social stressors they discussed included growing up in a “rough neighborhood and hanging out with the wrong people,” stress related to unemployment and poverty, and stress related to having a low level of education, which they believed limited one’s ability to find “decent paying jobs”; thus, the only option was minimum-wage jobs.</p>
<p>Most of the men believed an individual could experience several casual factors at the same time, so that one individual could have a family history of mental illness (hereditary), experience trauma (sexual or physical abuse), and be stressed by a minimum-wage job. The men’s beliefs about these causal factors and the relationship among them appeared to be consistent with the biopsychosocial model. The biopsychosocial model postulates that mental disorders reflect a dynamic and reciprocal relationship among biological, psychological, and social factors and the current context. These variables then have an additive influence on health, symptom presentation, and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012447824">Kaslow et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Below is a quote that vividly captures a participant’s belief about how genetics, trauma, and social stressors can cause mental illness.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[It can be] some type of thing you could be born with. . . . I’ve actually been reading a lot about slavery lately and about how those types of conditions can cause mental health problems. There are things like losing family members, being abused, being sexually abused, things like that can lead to some issues with mental health.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0011000012447824">
<title>Timeline</title>
<p>Most participants perceived mental illness as chronic and recurrent, such that mental illness can persist over an extended period of time and relapse of mental illness can occur if the individual does not receive appropriate care. One participant stated, “[I]f you are not careful you will fall right back into it.” They also believed the course of mental illness could be controlled. Specifically, they believed that mental illness can be “contained” and individuals could be functional with appropriate professional treatment such as medication and psychotherapy and support from family and loved ones. Two participants shared their beliefs about the timeline of mental illness, saying,
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Chronic and recurrent</italic>: It’s good to have people that care enough for you and to do things for you when you’re in that situation. I’ve been through that and I know how it was. If you don’t be careful you’ll fall back into it. Because anything can kind of set you off, get you upset, you know what I’m saying? You just fall back (snaps fingers) into that deep mental illness.</p>
<p><italic>Contained</italic>: I think it’s something that could certainly be contained, . . . I think it’s more, containing or controlling the person’s thoughts, feelings, as opposed to eradicating it or, the person just not having that. It would always, I think, be there, the prospect of it being that you never know what could spark it or what would set it off, but at the same time I think through medication and therapy that there is probably hope that a disease like that could be contained.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0011000012447824">
<title>Consequences</title>
<p>Although the question querying consequences of having a mental illness was asked in a neutral manner, only negative consequences were described by all the participants. Further analysis showed some of the men believed having a mental illness that was undiagnosed or untreated could result in several negative consequences including restrictive placement, impaired functioning, and behavioral problems. Restrictive placements of particular concern included involuntary admission to psychiatric hospitals and being sent to correctional institutions. It is interesting that inpatient psychiatric hospitalization was not perceived as helpful for individuals with severe mental illness; instead, it was perceived as restrictive and being “locked down,” similar to being in jail or prison.</p>
<p>All of the men were also concerned about how having a mental illness can affect an individual’s social, psychological, and economic functioning. In particular, they believed that having a mental illness could negatively affect one’s social interactions, including the ability to communicate and interact with others. It could also negatively affect psychological functioning such that an individual may not have the mental capability to “take care of himself” and thus may not be able to live independently. In addition, because of social and psychological limitations, an individual’s economic situation would be affected because he would not be able to find and maintain employment. A few of the men also believed there were behavioral problems resulting from having mental illness. Specifically, they believed that individuals with mental illness were at risk both for self-harm such as suicidal behaviors and for physically hurting others. One participant explained some of these negative behavioral consequences, saying,
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Behavioral problems</italic>: They could kill themselves or they could kill somebody that they love or kill a perfect stranger and go to jail for life. Not being treated for a mental illness and they can’t function with it anymore, so they lose control you know.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0011000012447824">
<title>Cure or control</title>
<p>All participants appeared to believe that mental illness can be controlled by professional treatment. They also seemed to be open and optimistic about seeking outpatient mental health treatment, including use of mental health counseling and medication. However, combining professional treatment with community support from family and friends and spiritual support derived from religious beliefs and practices such as praying and taking concerns to God were preferred by all participants. Thus, for this group having a support network including both professional and informal components was believed to best control or “contain” mental illness. Below, a participant talks about his optimism about treatment and use of a support network:
<disp-quote>
<p>You need somebody to lead you out of this type of situation [counselor or psychologist] or some kind of medication. They got medication to get yourself together. You have to have some help. That’s the reason it’s good today, you have good doctors that help a lot of people. So being connected to the various services that provide support, and services that provide both social support as well medical support to that individual. Also, family support has to be there, and community support has to be there too.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0011000012447824">
<title>Illness coherence</title>
<p>Analysis of participants’ understanding of mental illness (illness coherence) revealed they all believed mental illness is a disorder or sickness with visible symptoms. They appeared to conceptualize mental illness as a medical condition in the form of a disorder or sickness that affected the brain, which in turn affected one’s behavior and ability to function in the community. They also believed that mental illness has a number of visible symptoms, so that you can “see” that someone has a mental illness. Some of those symptoms include abnormal behaviors such as talking to oneself and “doing strange things,” cognitive impairment such as difficulty comprehending information, and physical and mental disability such that the individual is “unable to function on his own and cannot do anything for himself.” The men’s belief that mental illness is a sickness is illustrated in the following quote from a participant:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, you know, it’s a sickness. It’s something a person can’t help. And it sometimes [depends] on how deep it is, it takes patience with those people. Some react and some don’t at a certain time. [They need] medicine and stuff.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0011000012447824">
<title>Emotional representation</title>
<p>Regarding emotional response (emotional representation), all of the men reported experiencing the following descriptors: feelings of sadness, compassion, and a desire to help on seeing someone with visible signs of a mental illness. These participants’ emotional response seemed to be connected to empathy, so that they seemed to understand and feel the challenges associated with having a mental illness, which in turn motivated them to want to help in whatever way they could to ease the burden (negative consequences) associated with mental illness. The quote below vividly captures the emotional response of a participant:
<disp-quote>
<p>I kind of feel bad, they can’t have a normal life like me and you, and they probably never even had any kids and is never going to have a normal relationship you know, stuff like that. So, I see somebody with a mental illness and I feel kind of bad. I had a couple of people I tried to help them. I take time to talk to them you know and try to see if they have tried to get any help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, all participants responded to questions regarding the seven attributes of illness from the CSM, and the CSM was a useful framework in capturing the men’s beliefs about mental illness. In particular, all participants held beliefs about symptoms (identity), causes, duration (timeline), consequences, and controllability of mental illness. In addition, they understood (illness coherence) mental illness to be a sickness or medical condition that could improve with treatment. They were also emotionally affected (emotional representation) by mental illness and desired to help others struggling with mental illness. These findings provide more insight into African American men’s beliefs (lay model) about mental illness.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0011000012447824">
<title>Question 2: African American Men’s Perceptions of Stigma Associated With Mental Illness and Seeking Mental Health Services</title>
<p>Most of the men did not endorse stigma associated with mental illness or with seeking mental health services. Although most of the men believed mental illness is a disorder or sickness, and they encouraged others to get help, some of them also appeared to think of mental illness as a “normal” and “every day” occurrence, suggesting it was part of their daily lives. It appears that for some participants, their perception of mental illness as a normal type of illness and part of their daily lives likely plays a role in this group’s failure to endorse stigma associated with having either mental illness or seeking professional treatment. The essence of these men’s indifference to stigma is captured by one participant in the quote below:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I’ve been around a lot of people that are mentally ill but I never thought anything about it. You know, like symptoms and what they had to do and things like that. Yeah I just take it as it comes, you know. That’s nothing new. Just, a day-by-day thing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0011000012447824">
<title>Question 3: Barriers Experienced by African American Men When Seeking Mental Health Services</title>
<p>Data analysis revealed all participants reported concerns that could be dichotomized into both system-level and individual-level (intrapersonal) barriers. It is interesting that system-level barriers reported by all of the men were consistent with current literature and included limited access to mental health services arising from lack of health insurance, low availability of mental health services, and concerns about misdiagnosis. One salient individual-level barrier all participants reported experiencing was limited knowledge of mental illness in general and limited knowledge about specific medications used to treat mental illness. In discussing individual-level barriers, all of the men appeared to be referring specifically to the African American community. In particular, they discussed how in the African American community mental illness is not discussed openly, which serves to limit information and knowledge about mental illness. All of the men also reported a lack of awareness of mental illness in the African American community. One participant stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Who knows, we don’t hear anything about it and that’s why I was glad to participate in this survey and I’m sure one would determine I have very limited knowledge and so does a lot of other African Americans who have limited knowledge and lack of information as to what mental illness is about, what are the symptoms, how you go about detecting it. We just don’t have that information in the black community.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0011000012447824">
<title>Interest in Research and Encouraging Help Seeking</title>
<p>In-depth analysis identified two additional issues outside of the CSM and not part of the original set of research questions. Because of the frequency of these issues in the data, we felt these issues were important to report. The first issue was participants’ interest and support of research. Nearly half (8) the participants expressed strong interest in mental health research. In particular, some of the men expressed a genuine interest in the present study and discussed the need for more research focusing on African American men. A participant expressed his interest in the present study by saying,
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m grateful to be a part of this study and I would like to have a report of it or at least a summary of how this all came out so I could do more myself. I think we all should be obligated to do a little something in the mental illness area, if nothing else at least to increase awareness and I see this study as one that is serving that function as well. So, excellent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second issue involved the men’s report of encouraging others to seek professional help to cope with mental health issues. All of the men reported encouraging other African American men to seek professional help such as outpatient counseling and medication. A participant explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>First thing I tell them is to seek help. Because there’s always a possibility that you’re going to get better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of the men had ideas about what professional help should entail. They conceptualized professional help as “getting the right kind of help.” The right kind of help included the following: (a) seeing a professional who specialized in mental health and practiced at an outpatient mental health clinic, (b) seeing a professional who is understanding, is willing to listen, spends time with patients, and is empathic, and (c) using talk therapy (counseling), medication, or both. A participant described the right kind of help as,
<disp-quote>
<p>A specialist, somebody specialized in mental illness. Somebody that is understanding, he’ll sit down and talk with you, speak with you and don’t get you upset, you know. A lot of people go to the wrong people, they speaking the wrong way, it hurts their feelings, and they’ll never go again.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, some of the participants were very interested in participating in mental health research, and all participants encouraged others to seek outpatient mental health services. Since all the men expressed a desire to help people with mental illness, it is possible that they viewed their participation in the present study as a way to help people with mental illness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research focusing on mental illness among African American men is scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0011000012447824">Watkins et al., 2006</xref>). To our knowledge, this study is the first to use qualitative methodology combined with CSM to examine African American men’s underlying representation and beliefs about mental illness, perceived stigma associated with mental illness and seeking treatment, and barriers to seeking treatment. The CSM was effective in gaining more insight into African American men’s underlying beliefs about mental illness. In particular, all participants responded to questions regarding the seven attributes of illness addressed in this study. In addition, study findings are informative about participants’ perceptions of stigma and barriers to seeking mental health services.</p>

<p>The men’s beliefs about causal factors, symptoms (identity), and understanding of mental illness (illness coherence) were consistent with the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition, text revision, and the biopsychosocial model of mental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012447824">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012447824">Kaslow et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting their beliefs were consistent with currently accepted views of mental illnesses by mental health professionals. Examining the men’s beliefs about causal factors from the context of the biopsychosocial model suggests they believed mental illness is a disorder or sickness that can be caused by biological, psychological, and social factors independently as well as by interactions among these factors. The biopsychosocial model also postulates that these variables can have an additive influence on health, symptom presentation, and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012447824">Kaslow et al., 2007</xref>), which seemed evident in the men’s belief that having a mental illness can result in negative outcomes including social, psychological, and financial problems. This is in contrast to previous research indicating misperceptions about mental illness among African Americans, that is, mental illness caused by germs, demon possession, or a poor relationship with God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000012447824">Matthews et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward &amp; Heidrich, 2009</xref>). It is possible that the difference in the present study may be the result of the fact that 36% of the men were diagnosed with a mental illness and therefore had contact with mental health professionals who may have provided psychoeducation.</p>
<p>The men’s belief that mental illness is chronic and can result in negative consequences is supported in recent national survey, which found that African Americans are more likely to report their depression as chronic and debilitating compared to Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0011000012447824">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). Of particular concern in the present study is the belief that African Americans with a mental illness are likely to be placed in prison or inpatient psychiatric care. Unfortunately, this finding was also found in our previous work examining African American women’s beliefs about mental illness. Women in that study believed having a mental illness can result in negative consequences such as inpatient admission or jail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward et al., 2009</xref>). These perceptions of negative consequences may be attributed to the city where the study was conducted, in which African Americans are overrepresented in the inpatient care and legal systems. For example, African American men in this city are twice as likely than White men to be placed in inpatient care for major depressive disorder men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012447824">Chen, 2009</xref>). In addition, African American men account for 48% of the prison population, whereas they only make up 6% of the overall state population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0011000012447824">Wilayto, 2000</xref>). Thus, these men’s concerns about the consequences associated with having a mental illness have a basis in fact.</p>
<p>Participants’ optimism about professional treatment (cure/control) including use of medication and encouraging others to seek professional treatment was surprising in light of present study results indicating participants believed one of the negative consequences of having a mental illness is placement in inpatient psychiatric care. However, it appears that although the men have negative perceptions about inpatient psychiatric care, they are more optimistic about outpatient mental health counseling and use of psychotropic medication. One explanation for the preference of outpatient care may be the element of choice with outpatient care, whereas inpatient care is often involuntary. These participants’ receptiveness to outpatient treatment is noteworthy in light of the documented low use of outpatient care by African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Our participants reported high levels of emotional representation or impact (compassion, sadness, and a desire to help) on seeing someone with visible signs of mental illness. This finding was consistent with a recent study that explored young African American men’s understanding of mental health and comfort discussing mental health issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0011000012447824">Watkins and Neighbors (2007)</xref> found young African American men were encouraging and supportive of other men with mental health problems, especially depression. Those results and ours provide evidence suggesting some African American men may be emotionally affected by a desire to help others experiencing mental illness. Given African American men’s high rate of inpatient psychiatric care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000012447824">Snowden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0011000012447824">Wisconsin Minority Health Program, 2004</xref>), future counseling psychology research might examine use and effectiveness of African American men in peer counseling to promote timely treatment seeking and reduce rates of inpatient care.</p>

<sec id="section28-0011000012447824">
<title>Perceived Stigma</title>
<p>In the present study, most of the African American male participants did not endorse the stigma associated with mental illness and seeking professional treatment. In fact, they were optimistic about seeking professional treatment and encouraged others to seek professional treatment. The men’s perception of mental illness as a normal type of illness and part of their daily lives is supported in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012447824">Kendrick, Anderson, and Moore (2007</xref>, p. 69), where they found that African American men perceived depression as “fact of life.” In addition, the belief of the men in the present study that mental illness is a normal sickness or disorder may be synonymous with thinking of mental illness as similar to chronic physical illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension. Our finding is encouraging because it may show a shift in perceptions of stigma, at least in our sample of African American men. The shift is important in light of previous research documenting the high prevalence of stigma in the African American community and how stigma negatively affects treatment-seeking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward &amp; Heidrich, 2009</xref>). To our knowledge, our study is the first to document lack of stigma associated with mental illness and help seeking among our sample of African American men. However, additional research is needed to draw more definitive conclusions.</p>

<sec id="section29-0011000012447824">
<title>Barriers</title>
<p>System-level barriers identified by our study group centered on limited access including lack of health insurance, low availability of mental health services, and concerns about misdiagnosis. Such concerns are consistent with current literature; in particular, the report titled <italic>Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>) vividly conveys access-related issues experienced by this group. An important individual barrier was limited knowledge of mental illness, which participants reported was disconcerting in the African American community. This finding is consistent with results of a study examining African Americans’ perceptions of psychotherapy and psychotherapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000012447824">Thompson-Sanders, Bazile, &amp; Akbar, 2004</xref>), which found that even educated participants lacked sufficient knowledge of the signs and symptoms of mental illness. In discussing system-level and individual barriers, participants appeared to be talking not only about their own experiences but also about their perceptions of the barriers experienced by the African American community as a whole and their concerns for the African American community in light of these barriers. The findings of the present study, along with seminal report <italic>Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000012447824">Thompson-Sanders et al. (2004)</xref>, suggest the need to address and eliminate both systemic and individual barriers facing this group in seeking mental health services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0011000012447824">
<title>Encouraging Others to Seek Professional Treatment</title>
<p>With current literature documenting African Americans’ low use of mental health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>), it was particularly surprisingly to find that all the men reported encouraging other African American men to seek professional help. It was equally interesting to learn that the men were knowledgeable about educational qualifications and clinical skills needed to provide high-quality care, including specialization in mental health, strong listening skills, ability to demonstrate empathy, and treatment approaches using medication, counseling, or a combination of both. Although we did not analyze the data to identify differences between individuals who had a mental illness and those without a mental illness, it is possible that the findings indicating knowledge and qualifications important in providing clinical care may be influenced by the fact that 36% of our sample had been diagnosed with a mental illness and had experience with the mental health system. Furthermore, an earlier study examining African Americans’ experiences in counseling showed study participants of both sexes were able to convey their experiences in counseling and were knowledgeable in particular about what effective counseling should entail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000012447824">E. C. Ward, 2005</xref>). The results of this earlier study and the current study speak to the importance of gaining more understanding of perceptions of counseling among African Americans with a diagnosed mental illness, their experiences in counseling, and their general perceptions of mental health services. Such research can be informative in providing client-centered, culturally sensitive mental health care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0011000012447824">
<title>Interest in Research</title>
<p>Racial and ethnic minorities, including African American men, have historically had low participation rates and have been underrepresented in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012447824">BeLue et al., 2006</xref>). This has led to the belief that racial and ethnic minorities are not interested in research participation. The results of the present study indicate some of our study participants were very interested in research. Consistent with our findings, a recent study conducted by researchers from the National Institutes of Health found racial and ethnic minorities are as willing as Whites to participate in health research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012447824">Wendler et al., 2006</xref>). They concluded that efforts to increase racial and ethnic minorities’ participation in health research should focus more on increasing access to health research and less on changing attitudes, as minorities already have positive attitudes toward research. Given our similar findings, efforts to increase access to research will likely lead to increased participation by African American men.</p>
<p>Our finding of some participants’ interest in research might be attributed to our study methodology, including the use of a qualitative approach; recruitment efforts that included use of community partnerships such as reviewing the flyer to ensure that it was culturally appropriate, publicizing the study in the African American community, and building community support for the study with pastors of Black church and directors of community agencies in the Black community; and collecting data using interviews that allowed participants more control to share their stories and to have their voices be heard. Thus, it is possible that the methodology used in the present study facilitated increased access to our African American male participants, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012447824">Wendler et al. (2006)</xref> indicated is critical in increasing racial and ethnic minority groups’ participation in research.</p>

<title>Implications for Counseling Psychology Research and Clinical Practice</title>
<p>Although the CSM provided an effective theoretical framework for our study and informed our interview questions and data analysis, it may have limited the range and content of interview questions and emergent themes and dimensions in data analysis. In particular, all of the interview questions examining beliefs about mental illness focused solely on the seven dimensions of the CSM. Despite this, participants raised additional issues beyond the CSM including their interest in research. It is possible that additional issues might have been identified if the interview questions had not been constrained by the CSM. In addition, questions about stigma were not directly asked, which may have affected our findings of low stigma. Future research could combine CSM with more general questions regarding beliefs about mental illness and stigma.</p>
<p>Given the focus of this study on African American men, study results may have limited generalizability to African American women and other ethnic or minority groups. Nevertheless, we expect results of this study to inform future research designed to examine perceptions of mental illness among other underserved groups.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of mental illness was not required for inclusion in the study because we were broadly interested in participants’ perceptions regardless of diagnosis. However, on the demographic questionnaire, 36% of the sample reported being diagnosed with a mental illness. In the interview participants were not directly asked to share their mental health diagnosis to protect their confidentiality. Also, to protect participants’ privacy and confidentiality, data analysis was not separated by diagnosis, whereby the data from the demographic questionnaire with the percentage of participants with a mental illness were not included in the qualitative analysis. Thus, it is unclear whether there are differences in beliefs because of a diagnosis of mental illness. It is important to note that no mental illness measures were used in this study; thus, we are unable to objectively determine which participants might have been actively experiencing a mental illness. Future research could examine beliefs specific to individuals diagnosed with various types of mental disorders and previous counseling experiences. Also, participants did not distinguish between types of mental illness and instead talked about it as a homogeneous term, which the researchers used in an effort to stay true to the data and maintain the voices of the participants. However, future research could further investigate what the term <italic>mental illness</italic> means to African Americans, with the goal of identifying types of mental illness as perceived by this group.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, there is a need to develop and test counseling psychology interventions designed specifically for African American men. For example, our participants preferred coping mechanisms that included the use of community support from family and friends and spiritual support derived from religious beliefs and practices such as praying and taking concerns to God. Thus, counseling psychology clinical interventions could include opportunities for family counseling (with family broadly defined to include friends), consultation with clients’ religious leaders as requested by clients, and provision of services in community settings to facilitate easy access and early help seeking. Our findings also suggest the need for outreach programs using a psychoeducational format to educate African American men about mental illness, treatment options, and community resources. As mentioned above, these outreach efforts should be inclusive of family, friends, and religious leaders in the African American community. With rigorous research, such outreach programs and counseling psychology clinical interventions have the potential to make a significant contribution to increasing timely help seeking while reducing disparities in mental health care and mental health outcomes for this group.</p>
<p>Given our participants’ interest in research, counseling psychologists should explore opportunities to partner with relevant community leaders and community advisory boards in advance of conducting research. Fostering such partnerships early or prior to the research will allow collaboration with community leaders and boards to identify community needs and research options to address those needs. Such collaborations can potentially increase community interest in research, access to the research, and recruitment. In addition, use of qualitative approaches with face-to-face individual interviews as data collection measures can help to honor the voices of underserved groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Such an approach can be instrumental in minimizing the power differential between researchers and participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012447824">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000012447824">Ponterotto, 2002</xref>), which can help to foster trust for groups that historically have had low participation in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012447824">BeLue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0011000012447824">Wendler et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific to counseling psychology practice, access-related barriers identified in the present study are consistent with those in the current literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000012447824">Thompson-Sanders et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>). Counseling psychologists should consider partnering with community mental health clinics and agencies to explore how services can be designed and delivered to better meet the needs of this and other underserved populations. With continued concerns about quality of care and misdiagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012447824">Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000012447824">USDHHS, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0011000012447824">Whaley, 2011</xref>), it is critical that counseling psychologists implement cultural competence training for clinicians with the goal of improving quality of care provided to African American clients and other culturally diverse groups.</p>
<p>Our participants believed having a mental illness can result in imprisonment, which may be a valid concern given the high proportion of African American men in prison. In the United States, African Americans make up approximately 46% of the prison population, yet they make up only 13% of the U.S. population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011000012447824">Uggen, Manza, &amp; Thompson, 2006</xref>). “On any given day, nearly one-third of Black men in their twenties are under the supervision of the criminal justice system either behind bars, on probation, or on parole” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000012447824">Roberts, 2004</xref>, p. 1272). In addition, mental illness in the prison system is quite prevalent, with rates as high as 56% of state prisoners and 45% of federal prisoners having symptoms or a recent history of mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012447824">Human Rights Watch, 2009</xref>). Given the large percentage of African American men in the prison system across the United States, the high prevalence of mental illness in the U.S. prison system, and findings from the present study suggesting our participants were concerned that having a mental illness results in imprisonment, there is a critical need to address mental illness among this population. Given counseling psychologists’ focus on social justice, they can serve a critical role in providing education, prevention, and intervention with African American men involved in the legal and prison systems to ensure that the mental health needs of such individuals are being addressed. They can also work with the justice system and policy makers to ensure that individuals with mental illness are diverted to treatment rather than prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011000012447824">Tyuse, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, participants in our study held beliefs about causal factors and symptoms consistent with the currently accepted views of mental illness. In addition, they were knowledgeable about what quality mental health care should entail, encouraged other men to seek services, and had compassion for people with mental illness. Therefore, involving such men in peer counseling may be beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012447824">Harris &amp; Larsen, 2007</xref>). With counseling psychologists’ focus on prevention, wellness, and strengths of individuals, they can make a significant contribution in the area of peer counseling, an area that is understudied specific to African American men.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study is the first effective use of qualitative methodology combined with the CSM theoretical framework to examine African American men’s underlying beliefs about mental illness. The findings from our participants can provide a framework to better understand this group’s conceptualization of mental illness, perceptions of stigma, barriers to treatment seeking, openness to treatment seeking, and interest in mental health research. These findings can guide future counseling psychology research, in particular the use of research methodologies that can potentially be more effective in increasing interest in research and access to research for African American men. These findings can also inform counseling psychology practice, especially the importance of cultural competence training, potential benefits of peer counseling to clients, and development of outreach and clinical interventions to increase awareness of mental illness and help seeking among African American men.</p>
