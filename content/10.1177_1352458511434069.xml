<p>A provocative statement but chosen for a reason. The nature of debate is around the definition or concept of epidemiology. August Hirsch in the 19<sup>th</sup> century described it as the science of geographical and historical pathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434069">1</xref></sup> My mid-20<sup>th</sup> century view of epidemiology was formed from influences such as Dean and Kurtzke and their major contributions to our understanding of the geographical distribution of MS and the role of the environment. The (my) misperception of epidemiology as primarily an observational (passive) discipline should be replaced by the concept of a hypothesis-driven (interventional) field. Now epidemiologists, as well as encompassing “the study of health-event, health-characteristic, or health-determinant patterns in a population” (Wikipedia), are involved in intervention in the form of randomized controlled trials. Helen Tremlett, a modern neuroepidemiologist, says the science of epidemiology has moved on, its scope has widened and the hospital based neurologist needs to recognize that.</p>
<p>However Martin Duddy has a point; navel gazing must stop. The definitive natural history observational studies have been done; the published works of the London, Ontario (Ebers), Lyon (Confavreux), Rennes (Edan), Gothenburg (Andersen) and British Columbia (Tremlett, Paty) cohorts have accurately delineated outcomes in relation to the early course of MS.</p>
<p>But do epidemiologists answer the call to intervention? An example of the problem relates to vitamin D. Epidemiological studies have told us that vitamin D deficiency is probably the one most important adjustable environmental factor in relation to MS susceptibility. Yet there are only eleven vitamin D/MS studies listed in clinical trials.gov; none of them address the question adequately. Of course it is not only epidemiologists who are at fault, both neurologists and MS societies have been slow to confront the important question of prevention of MS by high dose vitamin D.</p>
<p>One reason of course is that much energy has been devoted to industry promoted studies; the number of academic investigator-lead intervention studies per capita (outside of Denmark) in MS is derisory. Why is there not a definitive study double blind RCT underway to prove or disprove the hypothesis that high dose vitamin D prevents multiple sclerosis? Why cannot academic neurologists and MS societies act concertedly to meet such a clear need? In the last year we have seen considerable research money and activity to prove or disprove the ridiculous CCSVI hypothesis as to the pathogenesis of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434069">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a need for the MS research community to tackle the uncertainties raised by the well-established important observations of classical epidemiology. One such experiment would be an examination of the effects of low, medium and high dose vitamin D versus placebo on the clinically isolated syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511434069">3</xref></sup> Another longer study, given the importance of early disease course shown by natural history studies, would be a head to head comparison of the three highly effective immunomodulatory therapies on longer-term disability.</p>
<p>A role for a clinical trials unit established and funded by ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS?</p>
