<p><italic>Performing the Gospel</italic> is a Festschrift dedicated to Werner Kelber. The book contains a brief introduction by Richard Horsley and 10 essays concerning orality, cultural memory and Mark’s Gospel, which are grouped into three parts. Part 1 includes three essays exploring the linkage between literacy and orality. Hearon surveys major New Testament studies on orality, performance and their relationship to written texts. Jaffee links negative views on Gentiles, Jews ignorant of rabbinic tradition, and the women associated with such Jews among rabbinical circles to the phenomenon of converting oral tradition into Torah in the Mouth, that is, an entity with revelatory nature (p. 23). Draper supplies a case study on the Prophecies of George Khambule and his South African community, suggesting the relevance of such case study for appreciating the interaction between orality and literacy in earliest Jesus movement(s).</p>
<p>Part 2 presents four essays investigating cultural memory in relation to the issues of orality and literacy. Jan Assmann discusses cultural forms in connection to cultural memory. Foley examines the linkage between cultural memory and oral performance in various societies, from ancient Greece, through early medieval England, to twentieth-century Bosnia. Aitken considers the portrait of Jesus as an interpreter-performer of scriptures in Luke 24 and the Letter to the Hebrews, with the background of Hellenistic hero cult in mind. In dealing with the procedure of the formation of the New Testament Canon, Schröter proposes that ‘[e]arly Christianity and the early church understood the Jesus tradition from the beginning to be a free and living tradition’ and, relatedly, that ‘there was no fundamental difference in the first centuries of Christianity between oral and written tradition’ (p. 120).</p>
<p>Part 3 connects the discussions on orality and memory to a particular New Testament text, Mark’s Gospel. Robbins explores the integration of orality and literacy in Mark’s story from a viewpoint of rhetorical criticism. Shiner explores rhetorical culture of the first-century Roman world and subsequently suggests how memory technology such as architectural memory device could possibly be utilized in the composition-performance of Mark’s Gospel. Horsley considers a way to combine the interests in orality, memory and performance, together with historical and socio-political approaches, especially for understanding Mark and its community. He appreciates Mark’s story in view of Israelite cultural memory (e.g., Moses or Elijah traditions), which consists of both elite, textual streams as well as popular, oral streams.</p>
<p>This wide-ranging volume presents the engaging contributions of leading scholars and their varied areas of expertise. The result is a plethora of information and a number of insights on the relationship between orality, cultural memory and literacy. While including various essays that discuss orality, memory and literacy and their interaction with one other from different angles, the book as a whole appears to lack coherence to some degree. In addition, in light of the lack of scholarly consensus concerning the definition of the terms such as ‘orality’ and ‘memory,’ it would have been helpful to designate a separate chapter that defines these key terms more precisely—probably immediately following Horsley’s introduction. Overall, however, <italic>Performing the Gospel</italic> is a helpful resource for understanding recent discussions in New Testament scholarship concerning the issues of orality, cultural memory and their relationship to written texts. Some portions of the book appear to be (semi-)technical. Thus, postgraduate students and scholars will benefit more from this volume than general readers.</p>
