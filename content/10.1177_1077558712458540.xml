<abstract>
<p>Risk adjustment of managed care organization (MCO) payments is essential to avoid creating financial incentives for MCOs adopting enrollee selection strategies. However, all risk-adjustment methods have an inherent structural flaw that rewards preventable deterioration in enrollee health status and improved coding of disease burden. We propose a payment adjustment to offset this flaw. We use a database of 1,237,528 continuously enrolled beneficiaries to quantify the payment impact of change in enrollee health status over time for enrollees with two common chronic illnesses, hypertension and diabetes. The payment impact caused by the change in enrollee health status across MCOs ranged from +3.67% to −7.27% for enrollees with diabetes and from +5.25% to −7.69% for enrollees with hypertension. The MCO payment impact for diabetes and hypertension ranged from +0.19% to −0.31%. This difference can be used as the basis for creating payment incentives for MCOs to reduce the long-term costs of chronically ill enrollees.</p>

<body>
<p>A major attraction of managed care is having a single entity willing to coordinate care for, and intercede on the behalf of, enrollees. In return for capitated allowances, managed care organizations (MCOs) assume payment responsibility for enrollee health costs, thereby creating strong incentives for the MCO to lower those costs. Theoretically, MCOs seeking to extract maximum value from health spending will invest in programs that reduce costly preventable health events, such as hospitalizations, by maintaining or improving enrollee health. MCOs have become the mainstays of Medicaid program spending with between 65% and 70% of all Medicaid enrollees assigned to an MCO or Primary Care Case Management program, and only three states (Wyoming, New Hampshire, and Alaska) not incorporating MCOs as part of their Medicaid strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712458540">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712458540">Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2012</xref>). Significant cost advantages are claimed on behalf of MCOs, chiefly attributed to improved care coordination and patient education to reduce preventable care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712458540">America’s Health Insurance Plans, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712458540">Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712458540">The Lewin Group, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Medicare Managed Care final rule (42 CFR 438.6), issued by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in August 2002, requires Medicaid managed care rates to be certified as actuarially sound but permits states to vary the ways in which those rates are calculated. There are five principal criteria to address when certifying soundness: (a) eligibility category, (b) age, (c) gender, (d) locality/region, and (e) risk adjustment based on diagnosis or health status (referred to henceforth simply as risk adjustment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712458540">American Academy of Actuaries Medicaid Work Group, 2005</xref>). In this article, we focus on the dynamic relationship between capitation rates and risk adjustment.</p>
<p>The use of risk adjustment to set capitation rates can be generalized through the well-documented example of the Medicare Advantage (MA) program. In the MA program, the CMS-HCC (Hierarchical Condition Category) risk-adjustment model assigns each enrollee an individual risk score based on the individual weights, calculated through statistical regression, associated with the components of the HCC grouping algorithm. The prior year’s submitted enrollee data, supplied by the health plan, is used to calculate a predictive enrollee risk score for the performance period. If the average risk score for enrollees within a plan increases then the HCC weight for the MA plan increases and the payment per enrollee made to the plan increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712458540">Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Consider an enrollee whose health status declines over the course of a year resulting in a hospitalization. The enrollee becomes less profitable for the plan due to the hospitalization, but assuming sensitivity of risk adjustment to changes in enrollee disease burden and continuous enrollment, the enrollee’s risk score will increase relative to the previous year. Under the lagged model for calculating plan payments, the MCO’s payments will increase to offset the prior year’s loss, thereby restoring profitability. Moreover, the plan will have the incentive to actively report diagnoses that reflect the elevated risk of the enrollee within the risk-adjustment model. This sequence is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712458540">Figure 1</xref>. Activities that seek to maintain enrollee health over an extended period are therefore valued financially only to the extent that future profits are discounted or that the risk-adjustment model is insensitive to variation in disease burden.</p>

<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>This article proposes the creation of a payment adjustment for MCOs tied to longitudinal changes in enrollee health measured by the risk-adjustment model. It is designed as an adjunct to the underlying risk-adjustment model, which would continue to serve as the basis to determine plan payment differentials. The proposed adjustment is described in detail for two conditions, diabetes and hypertension, and uses indirect rate standardization to generate a performance norm for MCOs. Risk-adjusted MCO payments will increase if the health of the enrolled population deteriorates or the MCO aggressively codes the disease burden of its enrollees. If the deterioration of health status of the enrolled population is due to poor care management then the payment increase is not justified. Similarly, if the apparent change in disease burden is due solely to more aggressive coding, the payment increase is not justified. The MCO payment adjustment proposed in this article is intended to offset the inherent structural flaw in all risk-adjustment models that provides financial rewards for avoidable deterioration in population health status or overcoding of disease burden.</p>

<title>Analytical Framework</title>
<p>The New York State Department of Health (NYS DoH), the second largest Medicaid MCO contractor in the nation, provided an administrative claims database with an enrollee identifier suitable for linking claims data over time. NYS DoH has risk-adjusted MCO payments using Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs) since April 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712458540">New York State Department of Health, 2009</xref>). CRGs are a claims-based classification system that assigns each enrollee to a single, mutually exclusive risk category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712458540">Hughes et al., 2004</xref>). There are 1,076 unique CRG groups composed of a base CRG divided into a maximum of six severity levels. Base CRGs are assigned within a hierarchy of nine health status categories, shown below, reflective of the condition(s) identified within enrollee claims data submitted by plans.</p>
<p>Each enrollee is assigned to a single CRG with the associated health status category ordered from least (Status 1) to most (Status 9) complex:</p>
<list id="list1-1077558712458540" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Healthy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Significant acute</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Single minor chronic</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multiple minor chronic</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Single dominant or moderate chronic</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dominant or moderate chronic pairs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dominant or moderate chronic triplets</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Metastatic malignancies</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Catastrophic conditions</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>CRGs evaluate ICD-9-CM codes, pharmacy utilization patterns, and functional health status to assign Episode Diagnostic Categories (EDCs) to enrollees who provide a summary means of describing an enrollee’s disease history. EDCs are organized hierarchically within 37 Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs). EDCs are ranked within an MDC according to clinical significance. The EDC representing the most significant chronic disease under active treatment, referred to as the Primary Chronic Disease (PCD), is identified for each MDC using the clinical significance ranking. The PCD from each MDC is assigned a severity of illness level that describes the extent and progression of the disease selected as the PCD. The combination of PCDs and severity levels from each MDC determines the assignment of the final base CRG and severity level.</p>
<p>The structure of CRGs allowed a base category and severity level to be assigned for an initial time period, Year 1 (Y1), and then assign a second time using additional data from a subsequent time period, Year 2 (Y2). The additional claims data contains diagnoses that may indicate worsening of the condition or conditions previously identified in the initial CRG assignment. A worsening of an enrollee’s condition will cause the CRG of the enrollee to be reassigned to a more clinically significant base CRG or a higher severity level.</p>
<p>For example, an enrollee’s claims data may contain an ICD-9-CM code of 250.62 (Diabetes with neurological manifestations; Type II, uncontrolled) in Y1. This code causes EDC 432 (Diabetic Neuropathy) to be assigned with PCD 424 (Diabetes) with a severity level of 3 assigned to the enrollee. If no other PCD is identified from the claims data, the final CRG assignment would be 54243 (Health Status 5: Single dominant or moderate chronic disease; Base CRG 424 Diabetes; Severity level 3). In Y2, the enrollee has a claim containing an ICD-9-CM code of 250.32 (Diabetes mellitus with other coma; Type II or Unspecified Type, uncontrolled). EDC 429 (Diabetic Coma) is assigned, with PCD 424 (Diabetes) Severity Level 4. Once again assuming no other PCD is identified, the final CRG assignment would be 54244 (Health Status 5: Single dominant or moderate chronic disease; Base CRG 424 Diabetes; Severity Level 4). The enrollee would be identified as transitioning to a higher severity level (deteriorating health) in Y2 due to the occurrence of the diabetic coma.</p>
<p>In our analysis, health status change was examined within a subset of enrollees with CRG assignments within two common chronic conditions, diabetes and hypertension. Diabetes and hypertension were selected as they are known to consume a large proportion of the total managed care budget for the chronically ill and have been routinely identified, with varying success, as targets for disease and case management programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712458540">McDonald, Hertz, Unger, &amp; Lustik, 2009</xref>). Enrollees were included in the analysis if the claims data showed both continuous enrollment and ongoing reporting of the primary chronic conditions such that the enrollees could be targeted recipients of ongoing MCO efforts to manage care.</p>
<p>When describing the predictor of enrollee costliness in the Medicare Advantage framework, we used the standard term of <italic>risk score</italic> and defined that as a summation for each enrollee of the component weights, derived through regression, of the risk-adjustment model. When describing the predictor used in a clinical categorical model, such as CRGs, that assigns enrollees to a single discrete category and severity level, in keeping with the widely used terminology of diagnosis-related groups, we refer to the relative costliness of the disease categories as a relative weight since each enrollee is assigned only one. Henceforth, we use the term <italic>relative weight</italic> to describe the similar function to a risk score performed within CRGs.</p>
<p>An increase in enrollee relative weight between the 2 years equates to increasing average MCO payments to the MCOs attributable to those enrollees. Some increase in the average relative weight for these enrollees would be expected for Y2 as a result of chronic disease progression. We therefore seek to measure the relative performance of MCO (m) in minimizing the transition of enrollees to more severe CRGs adjusting for their Y1 mix of enrollees. To do this the sum of Y2 enrollee relative weights is compared with the prospective (expected) Y2 relative weights for all enrollees in the analysis database having the same Y1 CRG assignment.</p>
<p>Using the NYS DoH claims data, each enrollee <italic>i</italic>, was assigned a CRG <italic>g</italic><sub>1,<italic>i</italic></sub> for Y1 and <italic>g</italic><sub>2,<italic>i</italic></sub> for Y2. We use the CRG relative weights (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>), calculated by NYS DoH for use in adjusting MCO payments, to assign relative weights to <italic>g</italic><sub>1,<italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>g</italic><sub>2,<italic>i</italic></sub> for each enrollee. The <italic>g</italic><sub>1,<italic>i</italic></sub> relative weight corresponds to the enrollee’s contribution to MCO payment in Y1 while the <italic>g</italic><sub>2,<italic>i</italic></sub> relative weight corresponds to the enrollee’s contribution to MCO payment in Y2.</p>
<p>A second set of relative weights was constructed that reflects the mean relative costliness of an enrollee in the subsequent year. This second set of “expected” CRG relative weights (<italic>e</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) was constructed by calculating the mean of the relative weights assigned for Y2 across all enrollees assigned to CRG <italic>g</italic> in Y1:</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Three years of Medicaid claims data from 2005 through 2007 was obtained from NYS DoH. The data set contained all provider claims for enrollees including inpatient, outpatient, physician offices, and pharmaceuticals. Data were included in the analysis database for enrollees having a minimum of 9 months enrollment in each of the 3 years and at least 30 months across the 3 years. This criterion was used to identify enrollees with whom MCOs have ongoing contact. The resulting data set contained 1,237,528 unique enrollees, each assigned to one of 27 MCOs active in New York as of January 1, 2006.</p>
<p>The 1,237,528 enrollees were assigned two CRGs. The first using claims data for 2005 (Y1) and the second using additional data for 2006 (Y2). The CRG assignments were distributed across the 1,076 base CRGs as previously described. The cohort of enrollees included in this analysis was restricted to those enrollees for whom the diabetes or hypertension PCD was the only chronic disease identified using Y1 data. This resulted in 4,566 enrollees identified within the diabetes cohort and 19,962 enrollees identified within the hypertension cohort.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 4,566 enrollees in the diabetes cohort and 19,962 enrollees in the hypertension cohort were distributed across four levels of CRG severity using the first year of data. After incorporating the second year of data, enrollees may be assigned to the same CRG and severity level, a different severity level, or, if new chronic diseases were identified, to a different health status (e.g., Status 6, dominant or moderate chronic pair). The presence of additional conditions does not result in other PCDs being excluded; instead, it results in an adjustment to the CRG status and severity level. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712458540">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712458540">2</xref> describe enrollee movement between CRG and severity levels resulting from the addition of Y2 data.</p>

The description of “single dominant or moderate chronic” references either hypertension or diabetes. While CRGs differentiate between diabetes and hypertension, NYS DoH computes MCO risk scores from CRG relative weights calculated at the aggregated levels shown in the tables. Hence, for <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712458540">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712458540">2</xref> the reported CRG relative weights (<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) are identical.

In Y2, 5,710 of these enrollees were redistributed across 21 other CRG and severity levels with 9,639 enrollees remaining unchanged. The table shows that 3,690 (65%) of the 5,710 redistributed enrollees were identified as having an additional chronic disease in Y2 causing them to move up the base CRG hierarchy. The remaining 2,020 enrollees increased in severity within the base CRG.

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712458540">Table 3</xref>, the 2,185 Severity Level 1 diabetics with a Y1 weight of 0.791 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712458540">Table 2</xref>, row 1), are shown in the first row under the subheading “Diabetes.” The mean Y2 relative weight for these enrollees is calculated from the redistribution shown in column 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712458540">Table 2</xref>. The expected Y2 relative weight (<italic>e</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) for an enrollee assigned to the Severity Level 1 diabetes CRG is shown in column 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712458540">Table 3</xref> to be 1.787 and indicates that the mean relative weight for an enrollee assigned to a Level 1 Diabetes CRG in Y1 is 226% greater in Y2. The increase in the enrollee’s relative weight occurs because a subset of the Severity Level 1 diabetics is identified with more serious diagnoses in Y2, thereby being assigned to higher weighted CRGs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712458540">Table 3</xref> summarizes the results of this calculation for each of the four severity levels for both diabetes and hypertension.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712458540">Table 4</xref> reports MCO A has having 554 diabetic enrollees identified within the analysis (row 3) with observed Y2 relative weights summing to 1,305 (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>; row 4, column 2). The expected sum of Y2 relative weights (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) for these enrollees is calculated to be 1,259, resulting in a difference (<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) of 46.2 (row 6). This difference equates to an increase in relative weight of 3.67% for MCO A’s diabetic enrollees compared with other MCOs with enrollees assigned to the same mix of CRGs in Y1 (row 7). The effect of this subset of enrollees on total MCO payments, which includes payments for enrollees outside the diabetes and hypertension cohorts, is to increase the total payments made to MCO A by 0.04% (row 8) relative to the other plans.</p>
<p>The final row of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712458540">Table 4</xref> (<italic>CV</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>) combines the impact of diabetic and hypertensive enrollees on total payments and, for MCO A, shows that there is a higher rate of transition for the enrollees to more costly CRGs. For MCO A, the combined differences indicate that enrollee relative weights in total, and thereby MCO payments in total, are 0.19% higher than those for the mean performance of MCOs. In contrast, MCO D has a lower rate of transition resulting in a better than expected performance equal to 0.31% of total plan payments.</p>

<sec id="section5-1077558712458540">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When discussing risk adjustment for payments to MCOs, attention is generally paid to the effects of the risk-adjustment model on enrollee selection. An MCO that can adopt practices to actively select enrollees that consume fewer services than the average with similar risk scores will increase profitability. Thus, a clear incentive is created to both reduce utilization and avoid enrolling individuals who are routinely more costly than the amount reflected in their contribution to MCO payments. A robust risk-adjustment model reflecting differences in enrollee costliness is therefore essential to focus MCOs on reducing utilization rather than selection strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712458540">Stafford, Li, Davis, &amp; Iezzoni, 2004</xref>). Conversely, recent studies have demonstrated that the intensity of coding (code creep) increases when MCOs are subjected to risk adjustment that is based on submission of diagnostic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712458540">Government Accountability Office, 2012</xref>). The same risk adjustment that is required to be sensitive to differences in disease burden to mitigate selection pays more both for reporting that burden and when that burden increases. Neither code creep nor rapid transition to higher severity illness are desirable targets for increased health spending.</p>
<p>The proposal laid out here is to create an offsetting incentive to the underlying risk-adjustment model. While the basic MCO payments would be structured per the existing methodology, the rate of transition of the severity of illness for individuals with chronic illness would be used to create an additional adjustment. The results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077558712458540">Table 4</xref> could be used as the basis of a payment adjustment to increase total payments to MCO A by 0.19% and reduce total payments to MCO D by 0.31%. The basis for the total payment adjustment is the large variation, between +4% and −7% for both the small, expensive, subsets of enrollees within the diabetes and hypertension cohorts. Adjustments of this magnitude are substantial given that Medicaid MCO margins are estimated to average less than 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712458540">McCue &amp; Bailit, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis was restricted to a subset of low severity of illness level diabetic and hypertensive enrollees, two diseases which are often clinically related and which MCOs have routinely targeted for disease management. The approach can be extended to more complex enrollees by creating expected CRG weights (<italic>e</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) for every Y1 CRG and then measuring the relative transition for each of the 1,237,528 continuous enrollees. By confining the analysis to these diseases, we seek to demonstrate a proof of concept.</p>
<p>This study has limitations of which the major limitation is data quality. We excluded enrollees who had no mention of diabetes or hypertension in the claims history for <italic>both</italic> years of data. This restriction was applied to ensure that enrollees were under active treatment for diabetes or hypertension. Fifty percent of enrollees reporting either diabetes or hypertension in the initial year had no claims reporting treatment for these diseases in the subsequent year. The apparent lack of active treatment may either represent incomplete reporting or that the enrollee had stopped seeking care. The absence of claims to indicate active care for chronic conditions may indicate a care management problem. A payment policy incentivizing MCOs to better manage long-term health outcomes by maintaining enrollee health status can therefore be seen as a critical reform to remedy this deficiency. Alternatively, if accurate reporting is the issue, then tying payment to changes in enrollee health status will likely improve the quality of data submissions. It is therefore expected that inconsistencies that resulted in enrollees being dropped from this analysis will abate on introduction of a payment reform similar to that proposed here. Regardless of whether the data limitations provided a complete measure of MCO performance, MCO payments move in accordance with the reported changes, hence the need to both improve understanding of these changes and to create payment incentives to stabilize them.</p>
<p>While data quality may reduce the accuracy of measuring <italic>true</italic> difference between MCOs, the degree to which enrollees enter and exit managed care programs may reduce the applicability of creating a longitudinal incentive. In our analysis, we determine the underlying rate of transition within plans by including only those enrollees who have 30 months Medicaid enrollment over 3 years. While this mitigates the effect of enrollees dropping in and out of Medicaid, it does not address enrollees migrating across plans or changes in plan ownership. Bias that may be introduced by these issues is however lessened by the calculation of the transition adjustment as a rate across all plan enrollees relative to other plans, all of which would be expected to face similar problems that would even out over time.</p>
<p>There is no perfect answer to the issue of churn, but the structure of this proposal helps for two reasons. First, the payment adjustment while capable of being extended to all enrollees is primarily focused on enrollees with chronic conditions, which are less subject to churning. It is designed to look at cohorts and then aggregate results relative to total plan payments rather than review an MCO in aggregate. Second, the proposal is to adjust the basic method for calculating payment rates rather than to replace it. Enrollees who enter an MCO without preexisting diagnostic information will be assigned relative weights and impact MCO payments just as they did previously.</p>
<p>This proposal neither requires a solution to churning nor exacerbates the problem. As enrollees accrue information through continuous enrollment, they can be transitioned into the calculation of the health status change adjustment. Similarly, those exiting the MCO can be handled as previously for basic payment and excluded from the calculation of the adjustment. Since MCOs face greater selection risk from new enrollees, as the MCO has no history for the enrollee through which to assess whether they will be profitable relative to the risk-adjustment model, it is likely that more attention will be paid to improving care than attempting to disenroll those who are observed to transition at more volatile rates.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we believe that while not solving the issue of churn, the proposed payment adjustment is not damaged by its existence. Moreover, it should be clear that the purpose of the adjustment is to create a dynamic incentive to maintain enrollee health over time and to reward those who appear to be doing so rather than as a way to cap MCO payments based on a statistically derived performance comparison. We would therefore suggest that any adjustment mechanism would redistribute payments across MCOs, with underlying PMPM rates untouched, and be recalculated annually to allow random statistical variation and changes in relative MCO performance to wash out over time.</p>
<p>There is concern that MCOs that are publicly recognized as providing superior quality by investing in programs for a subset of enrollees (e.g., diabetics) will incur greater costs to care for that population while simultaneously attracting more of those enrollees compounding the additional cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712458540">Beaulieu, Cutler, Ho, Horrigan, &amp; Isham, 2003</xref>). To counteract this perception, it is important both to reward the management of complex patients through adequate risk adjustment and to routinely recognize the benefits of MCOs that provide these superior services in proportion to their efficacy. This is in keeping with a broader context in which MCOs are beginning to face outcomes-related targets with capitation fees becoming tied to potentially preventable events rather than Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set or Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712458540">State of Texas, 2011</xref>). Our proposal would increase payments to MCOs that better maintain health status, thereby adding to a wider health reform agenda seeking to tie payment to outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077558712458540">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this proposal, we discuss the structural tension between the necessity of risk adjustment to reduce adverse selection and the unwanted companion of dulling incentives for MCOs to maintain the lowest possible severity of illness for chronically ill patients. We demonstrate how a direct adjustment may be made to offset the unwanted incentive while maintaining the necessary risk adjustment by tracking changes in health status over a 2-year period within disease cohorts. The link between MCO payments and changes in health status is made by comparing the average change in health status for a similar mix of enrollees. The payment adjustment being proposed is based on changes in aggregate relative payment weights for MCO enrollees avoiding the need to tie results to individual enrollees.</p>
<p>The proposal is in keeping with both the transfer of financial risk to MCOs by public payers and wider pay for performance goals, while extending responsibility for enrollee health over a longer time horizon. The payment adjustment would correct for the current situation whereby MCOs are at risk for the short-term treatment costs of enrollees but not the longer term inflationary costs associated with health status change. While the proposed payment reform does not attempt to make MCOs accountable for all long-term costs, the creation of a simple incentive, as outlined, could act as a starting point to evolve a more comprehensive system of capitation looking over ever-lengthening time horizons.</p>
