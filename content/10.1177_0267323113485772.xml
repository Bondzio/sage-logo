<p>Most of us who work in media education will have come across students claiming in their assignments that the media <italic>en bloc</italic> are responsible for a certain set of circumstances, or the cause of a certain set of results. It is as if ‘the media’ are one huge, homogeneous entity operating in concert, with a constancy of purpose and resolve as ‘it’, ‘the media’, realizes some absolute institutional will. This tendency is not just a matter of massive generalization, and it cannot simply be countered by a reminder that ‘media’ is a plural noun. There is something more deeply embedded here, and it is of course not just students who are prone to this tendency; the easy fatuity it involves is far more widespread, and most of us succumb to it at certain moments in what we say. Thinking in terms of ‘the media’ as such, and discursively formulating processes of cultural production in this way, not only encourages but also permits and gives credence to the tendency, especially when we want to emphasize the power of global corporate enterprises or the influence of pervasive forms of cultural output. ‘The media’ comes readily to our aid in this because it is a totalizing concept. There is a reverse tendency to be found in the silo-based approach where monopoly of attention is given to one specific medium, as in ‘radio studies’ or ‘television studies’. One of the benefits of this lies in forestalling the sweeping assertions of the first tendency, and historically differentiating between the relative power and position of various media in and across time. Yet in the broader scale, it has the effect of fragmenting the field, making it harder to make connections between different media and their cultural influences. It may also be that this reverse tendency is becoming increasingly outmoded as the forces and consequences of convergence expand.</p>
<p>The authors of this book urge us to move beyond both of these tendencies in media education in order to return more fully and fruitfully to the study of culture in everyday life. They argue that in order to achieve this we should forget the media. Their polemical intent in this is that there should be greater recognition of the need for our focus to be far wider, on everyday social life and the ways in which various cultural products are interwoven with it, mediate it and in certain ways connect with it. Media studies itself, and especially in its more textualist modes, is too narrow, too circumscribed by simply taking ‘the media’ as its object(s) of study. Some of us understand this problem as media-centrism, which is why we study popular culture from a broader perspective, such as sociology or history, attempting to bring in a wider range of issues and concerns than media studies itself can muster. This is only partly what Bennett, Kendall and McDougall are arguing, for in addition to this they see ‘media’ as an artificial construct, similar to canonical literature in English studies, endorsing a normative discourse which insulates attention to the media text from the theorizing of everyday life and obstructs thinking about culture and identity in new ways. What they mean by ‘after’ in the title of their book is therefore not a temporal shift, heralded by some putative ‘prosumer’, for of course media continue to exist; and what they seek to provoke is not a paradigm shift, as if a whole new way of seeing is required. What they are <italic>after</italic> is refusal to separate media off from everything else, refusal to see ‘the media’ as monolithic or all-powerful, and refusal to pander to text-centrism.</p>
<p>Appropriately, then, their initial chapters discuss power, genre and representation, and then move on to re-examine the concepts of ideology and identity with the intention of disrupting the grand narrative of media studies. They point us to the blogosphere and an increasingly participatory media culture, and suggest that media education should cease legitimating itself as an ideal counter to how ‘the media’ represent gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social class. They argue that we need to move away from a view of representation as produced by one group of people and consumed by another, upon whom it has an inevitable impact. This has been a key tenet of audience studies from the 1980s onwards, but on the back of it they propose what they call a pedagogy of the inexpert. They claim that such a pedagogy would take us out of the text-centred world of the media studies class and into the meaning-making practices of the world outside. Eschewing the model of teacher-as-expert and developing instead a co-constructivist model of ‘finding out’ has a certain provocative edge to it, which is fine, but it can easily be pushed too far. Their alternative model is a worthy one, but one that works best in coordination with other pedagogical approaches rather than as a separate strategy. Clearly there are times when students might benefit from extensive engagement with the expertise acquired from extensive engagement in media research and analysis. What has been learned from this is something they might find valuable, and what it means is that sometimes the teacher is, quite legitimately, an expert in her or his professional field.</p>
<p>Provocation, as a clarion call urging us to radically rethink settled positions and established practices in media studies, is perhaps the main point of this book. There are a number of lines in what it argues that we would be wise to adopt, though some have already been more widely adopted than the authors appear to recognize. At times it is appropriate to focus only on specifically media concerns, but more generally the field of media studies would become greatly impoverished if it confined itself to them. This is widely recognized, and some of the best media studies work occurs in combination with other fields, or as a consequence of starting from the issues raised by broader academic disciplines. But of course, now that so much has changed and is changing, it is fitting that we heed the call being made here and re-examine how we do what we do and why.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bennett, Kendall and McDougall undermine their purpose by relying excessively and uncritically on existing cultural theory, particularly that informed by poststructuralism, without properly showing its relevance. Somewhat paradoxically, they fly in the face of their pedagogy of the inexpert by interlarding their text with so many knowing references and quotations that are not adequately integrated into their own discussion. There are also inconsistencies and contradictions, as for example when they claim to oppose epochalist thinking but then declare with confidence that ‘we are heading into a new era’ (p. 98), which might lead the reader to think they have acquired the ultimate expertise, that of knowing the future. Added to this, although perhaps because of having been written in part by different hands, certain points of argumentation in the book are not pursued with sufficient force, clarity or rigour. The impression at times is of false trails rather than firm tracks. This is a shame because we do need to challenge ourselves and be open to new ways of conceiving the educational purpose and pedagogical value of media studies – or whatever it may come to be called. Bennett, Kendall and McDougall are to be commended for seeing this and initiating the process.</p>
