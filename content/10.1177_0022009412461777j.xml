<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777j"><title>Bernd Schafer, <italic>The East German State and the Catholic Church, 1945–1989</italic>, Studies in German History, Vol. 11, Providence, RI: Berghahn Books, 2010; xiii + 303 pp.; £53.00; ISBN 9781845457372</title>
<p>The German Historical Institute, Washington, D.C. and Berghahn Books are to be applauded for providing a translation of Schaefer’s decade-old work whose overall findings have not been superseded. Schaefer argues that two contradictory developments characterized the Catholic Church in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). First, the laity and parish clergy created an alternative public sphere to that of the regime. Second, church leaders had only a limited view of freedom in relation to their own authority (280–1). One of the most disturbing threads of Schaefer’s account is the way in which church leaders learned to use the state’s repressive systems to discipline clergy and faithful, especially in the years immediately following the Second Vatican Council.</p>
<p>Schaefer demonstrates the central role played by the bishop of Berlin, who assumed de facto leadership of Catholics in the Soviet zone of occupation and then the GDR. Some Berlin bishops made their rejection of the regime clear and minimized contacts with the regime’s representatives. Others such as Wilhelm Weskamm and especially the long-serving Cardinal Alfred Bengsch developed a <italic>modus vivendi</italic> to achieve tangible improvements for the church and its faithful. While the <italic>Staatssicherheitsdienst</italic>, the secret police, found it difficult to penetrate the Catholic milieu, the church’s desire to avoid repressive reactions by the regime led to a situation in which church leaders kept the secret police well-informed until the 1980s, when the church resumed a more confrontational course.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of this work is Schaefer’s’ ability to place church-state relations in the context of the regime’s own goals. The regime tried to use the Catholic Church’s supranational nature to improve the state’s diplomatic standing. It desired an adjustment of pre-war diocesan structures to postwar political realities and almost succeeded. Most importantly the regime exploited the church’s Western contacts to gain hard currency needed to support the faltering economy. The church leveraged the government’s needs to defend its own interests. Both the regime’s desire for accommodation from the Holy See and its need for western financial aid protected the Church and, as Schaefer notes, made it the least repressed Catholic Church in Cold War Eastern Europe. According to Schaefer, the Church ‘paid in cash rather than in ideological concessions’ (122).</p>
<p>Schaefer devotes most of the work to the 1960s and 1970s, the years in which Cardinal Bengsch led the Berlin diocese. Bengsch pursued a policy of ‘political abstinence’ by refraining from both public support and public criticism of the regime. Instead, he focused on the pastoral needs of the faithful, which required some cooperation with the regime. For the regime, political abstinence was only slightly more desirable than open opposition. On several occasions, however, when the regime’s measures did violate important church teachings, the bishops of the GDR spoke out. The bishops condemned <italic>Jugendweihe</italic>, the Communist substitute for Christian confirmation, mandatory military service, the liberalization of abortion, state interference in parental rights to religious formation of their children and the introduction of military training in high schools.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, under the leadership of Cardinal Joachim Meisner, bishop of Berlin and now archbishop of Cologne, the Catholic hierarchy took a more confrontational course against the regime. For example, when the state banned the reading of a pastoral letter on <italic>Jugendweihe</italic>, the bishops read it anyway, but kept quiet the state ban in order to spare the regime further embarrassment. In 1983, the bishops issued a pastoral letter for world peace day in which they criticized regime policies. By 1987, the bishops announced a GDR-wide convention of Catholics without even consulting the regime. Schaefer attributes some of this more confrontational course to the hierarchy’s need to respond to increasingly active lay groups and the faithful in general.</p>
<p>By arguing that the increasing numbers of East Germans applying for exit visas was a theological question with a political solution (223–4), Schaefer identifies a fundamental problem the church faced. If one is to be consistent in faith, eventually conflicts with the political realm must arise. One wishes Schaefer had addressed the moral dimension of his subject matter. When after the death of Cardinal Bengsch his representatives to the regime disavowed their new more critical Bishop Meisner, one has to wonder if that must not have been the nearly inevitable result of Bengsch’s political abstinence? Schaefer acknowledges that Catholics in the GDR never identified with the regime, and that they understood living there was their particular challenge in faith, but what did that mean in practice? (221) Comparisons with the behavior of Catholic Church leaders during the Nazi era would have offered a broader framework to analyze church-state relations in the GDR.</p>
<p>A final criticism is that Schaefer, whose research interests have shifted, did not update the work beyond acknowledging more recent research in the introduction and the bibliography. The latest research has shown how to avoid the pitfalls of perfect hindsight that seem to fuel an implicit moral outrage in Schaefer’s work. Also, a more recent summary of the research would show that Catholic life in the GDR remains a fruitful research field. Nonetheless, Schaefer’s work remains the standard work to which all students of both GDR history and Catholic history after 1945 should refer.</p>
