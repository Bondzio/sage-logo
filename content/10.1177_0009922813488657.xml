<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A 21-year-old Asian woman presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of muscle cramps and weakness. She was also experiencing dyspnea on exertion, nausea, fatigue, and tremors in her extremities. She had not been sick recently, and her past medical history was negative. She denied any drug or alcohol use. Her medications included an oral contraceptive and an herbal colon cleanser called “Multi-cleanse” that she had been taking daily for the past month. Her last menstrual period began the day before presentation.</p>
<p>On physical exam, she was in mild distress but was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. She was afrebrile (36.9°C), her heart rate was 94 beats per minute, and her respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. She had a blood pressure of 137/95 mm Hg and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Her height was 162.6 cm and weight was 60.4 kg (body mass index of 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Her skin was dry and a tremor was observed at rest. The remainder of her physical examination was within normal limits. Laboratory evaluations are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813488657">Table 1</xref> and were significant for a creatinine (Cr) of 11.42 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 49 mg/dL; metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte abnormalities, including a potassium of 2.1 mmol/L; and a creatine kinase (CK) of 16 796 unit/L. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with rightward axis, prolonged QT interval, and T wave abnormality. Chest radiograph was within normal limits.</p>

<p>Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.010 and pH of 8.0. Large blood and trace protein were found. It was negative for glucose, ketones, bilirubin, leukocytes, and nitrites. Microscopic analysis showed rare white blood cells and 0 to 3 red blood cells per high-power field. Urine toxicology screen was negative. A retroperitoneal ultrasound showed mild increase in echogenicity of the kidneys, blurring of the cortical medullary differentiation, and mild dilation of the bilateral collecting systems. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mildly increased wall thickness of the left ventricle and mild regurgitation of the mitral valve but was otherwise normal with an ejection fraction of 60% to 65%.</p>

<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. She received intravenous hydration and oral potassium replacement. Labs were obtained every 4 hours for the first 24 hours and then spaced to every 12 hours. CK, BUN, and Cr trended down throughout her admission. After 72 hours, the patient’s BUN was 35 mg/dL, and her Cr was 4.21 mg/dL. She did not need dialysis during the hospitalization. A repeat electrocardiogram was within normal limits.</p>
<p>Rhabdomyolysis was the suspected cause of the patient’s acute renal failure. Her CK was extremely high, and her urinalysis was positive for blood with no red blood cells seen on microscopy, which could be explained by myoglobinuria. Given the lack of trauma or evidence of drug abuse, the likely causes of her rhabdomyolysis were exertion, infection, and electrolyte abnormalities. With a potassium level of 2.1 mmol/L on presentation, hypokalemia with dehydration was the likely etiology. Additional history revealed that the patient’s recent diet included eating only a piece of cake in the past week and vomiting afterward. She then admitted to a history of purging and laxative abuse. It was suspected that she had a previously undiagnosed eating disorder. Psychiatry saw the patient during her hospitalization, and outpatient multidisciplinary follow-up was arranged for her after discharge. Once her significant laboratory abnormalities had improved, she was discharged home on oral potassium replacement.</p>

<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Bulimia nervosa, purging subtype, complicated by rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813488657" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors. The episodes feature eating a significant amount of food in a discrete period of time and experiencing lack of control. The compensatory behaviors are aimed at the prevention of weight gain and include self-induced vomiting; the use of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, and other medications; fasting; and excessive exercise. There is also an associated preoccupation with body weight and shape. According to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, 4th edition, the episodes of binging and purging must occur at least twice a week for 3 months for the patient to be diagnosed with bulimia nervosa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813488657">1</xref></sup> Patients with bulimia nervosa can remain undiagnosed for long periods of time because they are usually of normal weight and often try to hide their behaviors. Risk factors for developing an eating disorder include being female, positive family history, perfectionism, difficulty in expressing negative emotions, difficulty with resolving conflict, and low self-esteem. Disordered eating can be triggered by maturation fears, menarche, independence and autonomy struggles, identity conflicts, and physical or sexual abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813488657">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two other case reports have described patients with bulimia nervosa developing rhabdomyolysis. In one case (García-Gómez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813488657">3</xref></sup>), the patient had a history of bulimia nervosa and drug abuse. The rhabdomyolysis was attributed mostly to the drug abuse. The other report (Sondike<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813488657">4</xref></sup>) describes an adolescent previously diagnosed with nonpurging-type bulimia nervosa developing rhabdomyolysis, a complication not previously identified with this condition. Her renal function remained normal throughout her hospitalization. Our case involves a young woman whose disordered eating led to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. The case is further unusual because this patient was undiagnosed, and this was her initial presentation for care.</p>
<p>Complications resulting from bulimia nervosa are related to the frequency and mode of purging. Self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, and diuretic abuse all result in fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Hypokalemia is often the most serious complication in bulimic patients. It usually occurs in lower-weight patients who use self-induced vomiting or laxatives. The incidence of hypokalemia in these patients is only 4.6%. In patients that vomit, hypokalemia results from direct loss from the stomach and from the metabolic alkalosis that occurs after losing gastric acid. Hypokalemia occurs with laxative abuse from direct loss in the stool. These patients develop a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis because they lose bicarbonate in the stool as well. Some diuretics result in hypokalemia as a result of renal wasting of potassium. Any of these purging methods can lead to volume depletion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These hormones cause the kidneys to retain sodium and excrete potassium and hydrogen in the urine. Again, this leads to a metabolic alkalosis and worsening hypokalemia. Complications of hypokalemia include cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, muscle weakness, hypokalemic cardiomyopathy, and tetany.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813488657">2</xref></sup> Other electrolyte abnormalities seen in bulimic patients include alkalosis, hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. Severe metabolic alkalosis (serum bicarbonate above 40 mmol/L), as seen with this patient, is almost always caused by self-induced vomiting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813488657">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trauma, exertion, muscle hypoxia, genetic defects, infections, changes in body temperature, drugs, toxin exposure, and electrolyte abnormalities are all possible etiologies of rhabdomyolysis. In addition to hypokalemia as mentioned above, other metabolic disturbances include hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, nonketotic hyperosmotic conditions, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Rhabdomyolysis is the destruction of skeletal muscle and the leakage of muscle cell content into the bloodstream. The mechanism of destruction is either by direct sarcolemmic injury or depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the myocyte. Depletion of ATP impairs the function of intracellular pumps that regulate sarcoplasmic calcium. The resulting increase in sarcoplasmic calcium ultimately leads to myocyte destruction through persistent contraction, energy depletion, and activation of proteases and phospholipases. Myoglobin is released into the bloodstream by destroyed muscle cells and is filtered by the kidneys. Severe rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury as a result of this myoglobinuria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813488657">6</xref></sup> Myoglobin precipitates in the tubules and forms obstructive casts. The heme center of the myoglobin initiates lipid peroxidation and renal injury. When this intratubular myoglobin degrades, free iron is released, which leads to free radical formation and further damage of the tubules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813488657">7</xref></sup> In addition, chronic volume depletion in eating disorder patients exacerbates any kidney injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813488657">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The patient described in this case report used vomiting, laxatives, and fasting as compensatory mechanisms. It was likely a combination of dehydration, recent increased calorie restriction, and laxative abuse that caused her to develop hypokalemia-induced rhabdomyolysis and subsequent acute renal failure. Laxative abuse is not an effective method for weight loss because most caloric absorption occurs earlier in the gastrointestinal tract than where the laxatives act. Although the composition of the patient’s “Multi-Cleanse” supplement was unknown, stimulant laxatives are the most used and associated with the most medical complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813488657">5</xref></sup> They may contain phenolphthalein, cascara, bisacodyl, or anthraquinone. These compounds work by stimulating colonic motility resulting in a large amount of watery diarrhea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813488657">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients may engage in bulimic behaviors for different reasons, and treatment may be more effective if it is targeted at these particular reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813488657">10</xref></sup> Laxative dependence can be difficult to treat. Patients should be counseled about ineffectiveness of stimulant laxatives, and restoration of bowel function may take several weeks. This can be facilitated by encouraging ample hydration, a high-fiber diet, and if not clinically contraindicated, moderate amounts of exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813488657">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This patient’s prognosis at this point largely depends on the success of psychotherapy for her eating disorder. Renal dysfunction in patients with anorexia nervosa can be corrected with weight gain. In patients who habitually binge and purge, however, renal dysfunction tends to be more refractory to treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813488657">8</xref></sup> Most patients with eating disorders have normal renal function throughout their life. Only sporadic cases have kidney insufficiency severe enough to need hemodialysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813488657">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This case report describes a previously undiagnosed patient with bulimia nervosa who presents to the emergency department with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. This is an extremely unusual presentation of bulimia nervosa. Only 2 other cases of patients with bulimia nervosa developing rhabdomyolysis have been reported. Primary care physicians need to be aware that although rare, undiagnosed eating disorders can present with such severe complications.</p>
