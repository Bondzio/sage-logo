<sec id="sec1-0040571X12443662"><title>Ellen T. Charry, <italic>God and the Art of Happiness</italic>, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2010; 320 pp.: 9780802860323, £23.99/$35.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The nub of Ellen Charry’s argument is that ‘Salvation is a slow, therapeutic process because learning to love perfectly is a healing of, not a deliverance from, our nature’ (p. 262). Elaborating on Aquinas, Charry treats sin as an illness: ‘[t]he human ability to obey the divine will is considerably weakened after the Fall, but reparable by grace. Original sin is damaging but not lethal to our ability to comply with divine commands’ (p. 176). Seen thus, ‘the art of happiness’ is the realization in a human life of God’s healing of the effects of the fall that comes about by shaping one’s life according to God’s desire for one’s flourishing. Charry proposes to reclaim a Christian doctrine of happiness. Classical thinkers made happiness the goal of philosophy but Western theology became ‘skittish’ as it came increasingly to construe happiness ‘in terms of eschatology’ (p. ix).</p>
<p>The book is in two parts. The first retrieves a forgotten Christian tradition that treated temporal happiness less or more seriously. Predictably Augustine looms large, but his cautious acknowledgment of temporal happiness is overshadowed by his view that perfect happiness is only attainable by the faithful eschatologically. Less predictably, Butler figures as a last Western advocate of earthly happiness, which he describes in terms of ‘self-love’, a love of self in the light of enlightened conscience. Butler is an odd choice here, reasoning but oddly joyless in comparison with his contemporaries, the Welsey brothers, whose evangelical joy in the practice of perfect love doesn’t fit the historical arc on happiness as Charry construes it. Aquinas figures as the ‘zenith’ of the therapeutic model of Christian salvation visible in temporal happiness. Luther figures as the nadir, characterized (or should that be caricatured) as one who replaced the pursuit of temporal happiness with relief from the anxiety of damnation, and a therapeutic model of salvation with a one-off forensic atonement theory.</p>
<p>Part 2 unfolds a constructive proposal for <italic>asherism</italic> – from the Hebrew <italic>asher</italic>, often translated ‘happy’ or ‘blessed’. In dialogue with the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the book of Proverbs, Charry finds a coherent ‘Older’ Testament account of happiness as ‘enjoyment of ourselves, others, and the earth in obedience to God’s call’ (p. 229). This asherist vision is transformed but sustained, she contends, in a passionate and beautiful chapter, in the Gospel of John. Paul is virtually written out. Oddly, given that a progressive account of human development is offered, the Holy Spirit makes only a passing appearance at the end of the argument, as if tagged on in response to a peer reviewer’s report.</p>
<p>Never less than readable, <italic>God and the Art of Happiness</italic> is a provocative attempt to retrieve and remake for contemporary Christianity a tradition that fosters temporal happiness as human life flourishing according to God’s intention for it. It is admirable because it engages with a subject of clear importance. But is it really the case that one must choose between a progressive therapeutic account of salvation and an account of salvation achieved once-for-all on Calvary? Are not justification and sanctification complementary? The book can seem like a soundtrack of the Christian tradition in which one speaker of the stereophonic system has been disconnected.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0040571X12443662"><title>Matthew Levering, <italic>Predestination: Biblical and Theological Paths</italic>, Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2011; 240 pp.: 9780199604524, £60.00/$110.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>In <italic>Predestination</italic>, Professor Matthew Levering has written a fresh and insightful work on a challenging theological topic. A significant figure in Roman Catholic theology today, Levering is Professor of Theology at the University of Dayton in Ohio and many of his works (including this one) are rich in ecumenical implications. In this substantial yet accessible work, scholars, students and armchair theologians will find a direct and clear presentation of a constructive proposal on predestination which is deeply informed by biblical and historical sources.</p>
<p>As his introduction makes clear, Levering is well aware of the challenges in addressing this controversial doctrine: is it a necessary doctrine that testifies to God’s love in Christ, or is it a dangerous and rationalistic doctrine that distorts biblical teaching and impugns God’s innocence? In the Introduction and first chapter, Levering makes his position clear: Predestination is a biblical doctrine – the paradoxes related to divine sovereignty and free will were not the creation of later theologians but paradoxes in the biblical witness itself. While certain formulations are to be avoided – such as Calvin’s claim that God actively causes the fall, which threatens God’s innocence – ultimately Christians need to embrace doxologically two affirmations: that ‘God’s eternal love for each and every rational creature has no deficiency or stinginess, and God from eternity predestines some to union with him and permits others to rebel permanently’ (p. 11). How is it possible to hold these two affirmations together? By recognizing that both are affirmations of the biblical witness, and that seeking to merge the two affirmations into one – on this side of the eschaton – inevitably distorts biblical revelation.</p>
<p>In the three chapters Levering devotes to a historical survey on the doctrine of election, he explores how many theologians tend to emphasize one affirmation or the other. This imbalance often unduly diminishes God’s saving power, or compromises their account of God’s great love for each and every creature. Readers should be advised that this historical sketch is valuable for Levering’s constructive purpose, but they will need to consult other sources for more comprehensive treatments of the figures he examines. While he retrieves from Augustine and Thomas Aquinas on key points, he highlights the theology of Catherine of Siena and Francis de Sales as particularly exemplary in the way in which they hold these two affirmations together. Levering ends with a refreshingly clear chapter presenting the doxological paradox of the two affirmations.</p>
<p>There are certain ecumenical aspects of the book which could be developed more clearly. For example, Levering’s critique of Calvin focuses upon his rejection of the distinction between God’s active and passive will – but that is a point on which Calvin is simply not representative of the Reformed tradition. Reformed confessions such as the Canons of Dort utilize that distinction, in contrast to Calvin. But overall, Levering has given a clear and engaging book on a difficult topic which should be useful to Christians in a variety of traditions.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0040571X12443662"><title>J. Denny Weaver, <italic>The Nonviolent Atonement</italic>, 2nd edn, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2011; 368 pp.: 9780802864376, $28.00 (pbk)</title>
<p>A decade on from the original, this second edition is a welcome contribution to a continuing theological debate. Weaver maintains and builds upon a key strength of the original edition’s structure: laying out a clear overall line of argument while also providing a schematic engagement with a selection of theological material. This makes the book a worthy successor to the original in its usefulness for undergraduate teaching, and the student will find key waypoints in the debate identified early on (e.g. Gorringe on atonement, crime and violence, mentioned in the introduction), in-depth engagement with classic material (Anselm, Abelard, Aulen) and an easily navigable array of theological positions organized under headings by category and subheadings by author. This is almost as readily adaptable into a reference work as it is into a defence of a thesis.</p>
<p>The first section of the book is dedicated to laying out the position of ‘Narrative Christus Victor’ which Weaver has developed. While key concepts in soteriology are explained, the emphases fall into three categories: historical context, biblical fit and ethical superiority in respect of non-violence. There follows a compact (just under a hundred pages) excursus through black, feminist and womanist contextual theologies, demonstrating both contributions from, and differences between, key theologians in each category, and drawing out important insights that both augment and interact with the ‘Narrative Christus Victor’ model. In line with the book’s concerns, many of these elements concentrate on the theological impact of considerations of violence (broadly construed) inflicted on various subsets of humanity and the importance of non-violent ethics in sculpting a responsible atonement theology.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of the book (another hundred pages), an area of substantial expansion in the second edition, is dedicated to dialogue with both defenders and critics of broadly Anselmian positions on atonement. It is here that a second edition is most welcome, and Weaver does not disappoint in his consideration of sixteen or so authors, as compared with the first edition’s ‘case-study’ of Miroslav Volf. A majority of the new material builds dialogue with publications from the past decade and this makes the book a helpful resource in compiling bibliographies and charting the development of debates, as well as allowing Weaver the opportunity to clarify his position.</p>
<p>The influence of Wink and Yoder is marked, and will allow readers to trace the contours of Weaver’s thought in relation to a range of theologians and ethicists. This is important, because there are some gaps in Weaver’s engagement, on account both of his theological loyalties and of the orientation of the book against proponents of Anselmian views. I would recommend augmenting Weaver’s work with that of James K. Bielby and Paul R. Eddy (eds), <italic>The Nature of Atonement: Four Views</italic> (Downers Grove: InterVarsity, 2006). Also, the relevant works of Richard Swinburne and Eleonore Stump provide more philosophical treatments and, in the case of Stump, a distinctively Catholic/Thomist perspective. Another, less heavily tradition-related, alternative viewpoint would be Anastasia Scrutton’s argument for the reconsideration of a revelatory soteriology employing the Gospel of John (‘“The truth will set you free”: Salvation as Revelation’, in R. Bauckham and C. Mosser (eds), <italic>The Gospel of John and Christian Theology</italic> (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2008), pp. 359–68).</p>

<sec id="sec4-0040571X12443662"><title>A. N. Williams, <italic>The Architecture of Theology: Structure, System, Ratio</italic>, Oxford University Press: NewYork, 2011; 240 pp.: 9780199236367, $110.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Christian theology is, and must be, systematic. Critiques of theological system are either ill-thought-out or based on a misunderstanding. This is the initially surprising but highly plausible thesis of Anna Williams’s book. The systematic character of theology – its coherence and order, its structure and <italic>ratio</italic> – derives, Williams argues, from its subject matter. If theology is about God and all things as they relate to God, relationship, coherence and (ultimately) unity is built into theological discourse. This does not – Williams is careful to say – mean that all theology as such <italic>participates</italic> in God’s own unity, or that the mere presence of ‘structure, system and <italic>ratio</italic>’ proves that any particular theology is good theology. It means, more modestly but still importantly, that theologians need to think in terms of systematic coherence in order to do Christian theology at all.</p>
<p>There is, as Williams notes early on, a puzzle here. Most important theology from Christian tradition is not written as ‘systems’, and even some theological texts that have subsequently been labelled as ‘systematics’ look, when closely examined, highly unsystematic. The point is that theology’s systematic character is not a matter of genre but rather a matter of the theologian understanding each subject in the light of its relationship to the divine <italic>ratio</italic> – the orderliness of God and of all things as they relate to God.</p>
<p>Does the call for theology to be systematic, and to exhibit <italic>ratio,</italic> overvalue human reason? It is important for Williams that she is not claiming to use unaided ‘reason’ as a source of theology – as she rightly says, this has very rarely been done, and would not take us very far. Rather, reason is, as it were, the mode in which we approach theology’s interrelated and complex ‘sources’ in Scripture, tradition and the lives of believers. Williams describes theology’s structure and order in terms of a ‘double <italic>mimesis</italic>’ – it is, always and inevitably, a reflection both of divine <italic>ratio</italic> and of a particular human <italic>ratio</italic> (which is itself, as created and sanctified, capable of a creaturely reflection of divine <italic>ratio</italic>). In the book’s central chapter, she works through this insight in relation to examples of theological texts from throughout Christian history – reading them in ways that attend closely to the particularities of context and genre, and showing how they both recognize and embody the ‘divine and human origin’ of theology (p. 138). Theology, Williams suggests in dialogue with this tradition, is intimately related to sanctification – the restoration of humanity’s imaging of God’s <italic>ratio</italic>. As she puts it in a striking phrase towards the end of the book, theological discourse and argument let us ‘inch, even reluctantly, ever closer towards truth’ (p. 224) – it is part of how our individual and shared reason is made holy.</p>
<p>Williams works through the implications of her central insight in dialogue with recent and contemporary debates in epistemology. She argues that theology’s proper, and traditional, attitude to knowledge, truth and justified belief reflects the provisionality of knowledge and belief-justification that inevitably results from current philosophical impasses – without theologians needing to nail their colours to a specific philosophical mast (she gently critiques several recent theologians who have done just that).</p>
<p>This book is not a light read, but it is a rewarding and thought-provoking read. It reflects a kind of scholarship of which theology needs frequent doses – the kind that does not leave a slogan or a throwaway line unanalysed, that tirelessly searches out and scrutinizes careless assumptions, and that is not afraid to state the obvious when everyone else seems to have forgotten it. Moreover, the book to a large extent performs what it describes: it persuades by its order and coherence – its rational beauty – as well as by its careful attention to theological tradition.</p>
<p>One substantive question that the book opens up for exploration, without discussing it at length, concerns the relationship between theology’s ‘structure, system and <italic>ratio</italic>’ and the structures, systems and <italic>ratio</italic> of non-theological knowledge pursued in what Williams (in, arguably, an unfortunate phrase) calls ‘the secular world’ (p. 221). How and to what extent should theologians read non-theological disciplines as themselves ways in which people might ‘inch, even reluctantly, ever closer towards truth’ – even, like theology, as possible preludes to the contemplation of God? Williams’s book provides a valuable starting point for thinking through this and other key issues of theological substance and method.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0040571X12443662"><title>Kenneth Wilson, <italic>Methodist Theology</italic>, T&amp;T Clark: London, 2011; 208 pp.: 9780567644985, £14.95 (pbk)</title>
<p><italic>Methodist Theology</italic> is the latest volume in the on-going Doing Theology series published by Continuum Publishing under the T&amp;T Clark imprint. In <italic>Methodist Theology,</italic> Kenneth Wilson draws from his wealth of experience as a theologian, theological educator, writer and minister. When Wilson’s book is placed alongside the new scholarship that has emerged in Methodism over the last decade, it clearly makes its mark as an introduction and encourages the reader to explore further.</p>
<p>The book is written in a lively style that reflects serious scholarship, yet its language is accessible to a wide range of readers. The book will be useful to clergy and laity within Methodism who want to deepen their understanding of Methodist history and theology. One can easily imagine groups within churches and educational institutions using the book to guide them in a study of their own tradition. At the same time, those with no background in Methodism will find the volume a helpful introduction as it allows them to see the roots of Methodist theology, as well as how the varieties of Methodism continue to engage their different cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Throughout, Wilson highlights the contributions of theologians who have emerged in the Methodist tradition. From John and Charles Wesley’s commitment to Arminianism in the eighteenth century, to Richard Watson’s explication of basic points of doctrine in the nineteenth century, to Jose Bonino’s contributions to a Protestant understanding of Liberation Theology in the late twentieth century, Wilson shows that Methodists have consistently engaged with and contributed to the major streams of theology in their time. Moreover, Wilson himself discusses the ideas of significant ancient and modern theologians as he explains various points of Methodist belief. The book then becomes an example of how an individual scholar from the Methodist tradition constructs theology in dialogue with the thought of Augustine, Tillich, Barth, Rahner, McGrath and others.</p>
<p>Wilson’s discussion of the Methodist concern for justice is also a significant contribution of the work. Setting his discussion in the context of the Methodist understanding of both Trinitarian theology and Christology, Wilson demonstrates that Methodist work on behalf of social justice, education and reconciliation reveals a theology that is relational and incarnational. Christ came to reconcile the relationship between the creation and its creator. Through the work of each Person of the Trinity, individuals are reconciled to God through the freely received gift of God’s grace. As Christians grow in grace and in the love of God, they become active participants in Christ’s work of reconciliation and justice. Such work necessarily demands that Christians be in relationship with their neighbour, in all of the places and situations that neighbours might inhabit. This is the essence of holiness in the Methodist tradition. Christ is made present through Christians who, because their lives are being changed by the grace of Jesus Christ, minister to the world in Christ’s name.</p>
<p>As an introduction to Methodism, Wilson has crafted a book that will be helpful to a broad range of readers. His enthusiasm for his topic is evident, but the work never becomes a Methodist apologetic. Instead, it is a well-balanced, reasonably objective and thought-provoking primer. I would recommend that those interested in Methodism read <italic>Methodist Theology</italic> before they move on to more specialized works such as Randy Maddox’s <italic>Reasonable Grace</italic>.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0040571X12443662"><title>Craig Hovey, <italic>Bearing True Witness: Truthfulness in Christian Practice</italic>, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2011; 272 pp.: 9780802865816, £17.99 (pbk)</title>
<p>This is a book about truth and discipleship. Craig Hovey, a North American theologian, writes in a manner that is spiritually profound and, at times, poetic. In dialogue with such thinkers and writers as the philosopher Richard Rorty, the ethicist Alasdair MacIntyre, and the theologians Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer considerable attention is also paid to biblical texts, often with illuminating results.</p>
<p>The guiding question of the book is how Christians bear true witness. Christians bear true witness, the claim is repeatedly made, by virtue of being disciples. There is a magnetic relationship between following Jesus and truth and this is so only because Jesus <italic>is</italic> the truth. In other words, the truth of Christian witness follows from the truthful reality of Jesus. Hovey understands by witness the following: ‘the work of the church for declaring to the world that salvation is in Christ, that the world belongs to him, and that his works are good’ (p. 3). In the light of this definition it is unsurprising that throughout there is an emphasis on the oral nature of witness. The confession ‘Jesus is risen’ is self-involving, telling a story not just about Jesus but also about the community that voices this confession.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts: Seeing, Coming Forward, and Testifying. Part I is concerned with how witnesses <italic>see</italic> Jesus. Witnesses are non-possessive followers – they follow after Jesus in a manner that does not seek to control or grasp him. To see Jesus as Lord is to see him as free, risen and irreducible to categories previously constructed. To see Jesus, in short, is to follow, which is a mode of knowing clearly very different from the detached observer. Part II explores the Christian boldness in speaking truth in a world of deceit and half-lies, a boldness which is the gift of the Holy Spirit. With attention to the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault and the Mennonite theologian and pacifist, John Howard Yoder, Hovey investigates the character of the truth-teller. The truth-teller is one who speaks truth to power and does not seek to ‘possess’ the truth. There is a strong emphasis here on the nature of the Church as the true politics – only the Church that resists the lure of the ruler can speak truth to power. Part III pursues what it means to say that the proclamation of the gospel is truth speaking for itself. In a circular construction which Hovey uses elsewhere telling the gospel ‘is intrinsic to its status as true’ (p. 185).</p>
<p>Some readers may find Hovey’s style hard going, but this is a book that repays patient reading. Although <italic>Bearing True Witness</italic> will mainly be appreciated by academics concerned with philosophical theology, ethics and political theology, there is much (especially the opening chapter) in here that would enrich the preacher and surely embolden their ministry.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0040571X12443662"><title>Lydia Schumacher, <italic>Divine Illumination: The History and Future of Augustine’s Theory of Knowledge</italic>, Wiley-Blackwell: Chichester, 2011; 256 pp.: 9780470657423, £75.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>What Lydia Schumacher desires is the recovery of a faith-based theory of knowledge expressed in contemporary terms. In this important book she lays down the historical groundwork for a theological account of knowledge resembling the spirit of Augustine’s theory of divine illumination. She adopts a theological method of inquiry as she first of all looks at what Augustine himself meant by his theory of divine illumination and then how his theory was interpreted and received in the medieval period. By using this novel approach she challenges many long-standing scholarly assumptions and understandings in the area. The worst mistake she discovers that scholars have persistently made is to decontextualize; failing to read a passage in the context of the work as a whole and failing to read an author’s work in the context of his whole corpus of work. When these mistakes are rectified, the most important discoveries she makes are that Augustine and his heirs – Anselm and Aquinas – are not proponents of natural theology (that is, reason unaided by faith and revelation). On the contrary, what, in the case of each, has been taken as a rational proof of the existence of God is actually an exercise designed to be undertaken by a person so that they can acquire the habit of faith-based reasoning which will lead them to understanding. The modern attitude that reason and faith are mutually exclusive can instead, she discovers, be traced back to the Franciscan, Duns Scotus. The other important discovery she makes, using her theological method, is that it is Aquinas, not Bonaventure, as is commonly thought, who was the faithful interpreter of Augustine’s theory of divine illumination. The misunderstanding has arisen because although Aquinas adopted the same theological assumptions as Augustine, he couched them in Aristotelian language to appeal to his audience. In contrast, Bonaventure used Augustinian language to disguise a completely new theological system based on Avicenna’s philosophical thought. This was a significant discovery for Schumacher because it means that the theory of divine illumination which was criticized and fell out of favour in the late medieval period was Bonaventure’s not Augustine’s. This paves the way for a restoration of Augustine’s theory of divine illumination in the future and the challenge is how to express this faith-based theory in a contemporary idiom.</p>
<p>There is a real sense of a unifying of disciplines in this book – theological, philosophical and spiritual; of an approach adopted with the mind in the heart. This is a very erudite and intellectual book by virtue of its subject matter and would appeal primarily to philosophers and medieval historians. But it is so clearly argued and the arguments helpfully rehearsed several times that it is also accessible to the general reader. In fact I found it spiritually uplifting to and I conclude with an Amen.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0040571X12443662"><title>Denys Turner, <italic>Julian of Norwich, Theologian</italic>, Yale University Press: London, 2011; 304 pp.: 9780300163919, £28.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Before skipping down to the next review, having read enough books on a saint of whom little is known and who herself published only one work in two versions, take a moment to consider this work. As its author reminds us, we live in times of theological fragmentation but this work, much like Julian’s own, offers a great deal for all manner of theologians. It is written principally for students and so provides an excellent introduction to some of the themes of medieval mystical theology; returning readers of Denys Turner’s work will recognize his repeated correction of experientialist readings and of the complexities and paradoxes of metaphor in religious language. But, overall, this book is not so much an examination of Julian’s work, or of medieval theology, as a conversation with her, addressing such primary theological concepts as sin, prayer, freedom and divine love.</p>
<p>Throughout the work, Turner’s perceptive engagement with Julian’s theology is deployed with great art to difficult areas of debate. He quickly shows up the weakness of the free-will defence position and engages creatively and spiritedly in a discussion of sin, evil and the relationship between providence and freedom. What he demonstrates time and again is a scrupulousness that is able to distinguish between paradox and incoherence, but he also has the rarer skill among theologians to communicate subtle technicalities with exceptional clarity, both through thoughtful illustration and reference to a wide range of literary and theological sources. As with Julian, Turner also possesses a proper theological humility that makes clear its own limits: ‘to know what we can know in the light of what we know we cannot know’ (p. 67). The shining characteristic of this work, however, is that the rigorousness of the argument is matched with an honesty in addressing our own preconceptions and experience. By refusing abstraction, by remaining personally engaged, this work is more than convincing; it exudes the character of wisdom. Turner’s description of prayer as ‘a practice of interpreting human desire’ (p. 168) makes no attempt to sidestep the philosophical, psychological or pastoral difficulties, and offers the most lucid and enlightening account of prayer I have encountered. Equally, his refusal of dualism as a mark of fallen experience finds orthodox grounds for a ‘transcendent inclusivism’ (p. 199).</p>
<p>It is difficult to convey both the scope and the depth of this book. It is a book that ostensibly expounds the work of a single theologian, and yet your enjoyment and understanding of the book would not be any the less had you not read a single word of hers. It unlocks the fundamental questions of Christianity: why God became flesh and why there is sin; how we reconcile the primary realities of sin and the divine love, of time and eternity. Turner brings these questions to light with rigorous honesty, intellectual precision and genuinely moving writing, and resurrects the living/dead anchorite Julian as a first-rate theologian.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0040571X12443662"><title>Richard Elliott Friedman and Shawna Dolansky, <italic>The Bible Now</italic>, Oxford University Press: New York, 2011; 224 pp.: 9780195311631, £16.99/$27.95 (hbk)</title>
<p>The Preface to this book states, ‘This book is about what the Bible has to say about five major issues of our time’ (p. xi). It isn't. It makes reference only to the Hebrew Bible and not at all to the New Testament. This renders the title itself misleading – not the best introduction to a book about ethical dilemmas.</p>
<p>However, the problems do not stop there. The book is written by two American scholars. We know this because they keep telling us that they are scholars. They also keep name-checking their friends who are also scholars. Apart, that is, from their teachers who are generally ‘pre-eminent' scholars and teachers. This makes the style of the writing frequently unnecessarily self-referential. In this respect the style detracts from engagement with the content.</p>
<p>The content has the potential to be quite interesting. The authors take a look at five contemporary contentious ethical issues and ask what the (Hebrew) Bible really has to say about them. The five issues are: homosexuality, abortion, women's status, capital punishment and the earth. Each is taken in turn, particular texts being treated to some detailed etymological and semantic scrutiny. And this offers some interesting perspectives on how particular texts might be read.</p>
<p>The framework for doing so is to examine texts through three lenses: prose, poetry and laws. Whereas this provides a helpful way into identifying the parameters for understanding words and texts, it also emphasizes the need to take seriously the genre of literature being read and the limits of potential readings that the particular genre allows. This, at least, compels a certain caution in not misusing texts for purposes for which they were not intended and to which they should not be applied. The authors are right to reject category errors when it comes to applying ancient texts to contemporary phenomena that they do not recognize (e.g., ‘homosexual marriage’).</p>
<p>Despite a categorical protestation at the beginning of the book that ‘we may have positions, but they have no business in our scholarship’ (p. xiii), however, it becomes clear that they do have ‘positions’ (not a problem – it is absurd to pretend that a ‘scholar’ does not) and that those positions demand a radical rereading of many texts. Many of the critical observations are illuminating: abortion in the ancient Near East, pregnancy and law, patriarchs and matriarchs, to mention just three. They articulate well the surprising way in which, in a patriarchal culture and narrative, women are depicted as powerful shapers of events and even providence.</p>
<p>As far as it goes it makes for some interesting reading and careful study within a Hebrew biblical context. But, any Christian approach to the ethical questions it addresses will need to take account of New Testament texts. The book delivers less than it promises.</p>

<p>I have often thought that, despite its ancient provenance, the story of Joseph, which weaves its way through the final twenty chapters of Genesis, is one of the most deeply ‘psychological’ accounts in the Bible. The depiction of human relationships, motives and emotions is astonishing in its detail and continues to be persuasive for millions after its first telling. Yet God is rarely absent from the narrative. At first, events are attributed (a very psychological notion) to the divine plan: finally, God reveals himself directly to Jacob in Genesis 46.</p>
<p>Sara Savage, a psychologist, seems to agree. She describes how she originally saw the story of Joseph as a potentially fruitful framework for exploring how insights from psychology can help in living out the Christian life. But ‘Then Joseph’s story took over’ (p. ix). And so it should. I think this is what I most valued about her book; its respect for the divine–human story as given us in the biblical text. Each chapter begins with a retelling of an aspect of the story, largely in chronological order, though organized around psychological themes such as grief and forgiveness. These retellings of the story incorporate vivid details culled from the author’s trips to Egypt and research in museums, but are also full of psychological detail that is rarely strained. They are beautifully written. The section in the opening chapter on the experience of early childhood, and the emergence of a differentiated sense of self in relation to the primary caregiver is superb.</p>
<p>Woven into each of these mini narratives in each chapter, or sometimes following on from them, are more analytic sections in which insights from psychological theories are applied to the biblical material. Perhaps it is my overfamiliarity with psychology that made these sections a less compelling read for me. The theories were always explained clearly and accurately, but there were so many of them that a reader unfamiliar with psychology could feel somewhat overwhelmed, and might be advised to pick one theme and reflect on that in depth, rather than trying to digest the whole range of psychological approaches presented. Psychological and theological concepts are woven together in these sections in a way that is generally helpful, but sometimes questionable.</p>
<p>The second half of the book uses the chapters as the basis for a group study course (the author rightly emphasizes that this is <italic>not</italic> a group therapy course). The material here is presented clearly and in a coherent fashion. I particularly liked the format of ‘About Joseph’, ‘About me’, ‘About Jesus’. The guidelines for course facilitators are very full, with helpful directions for further reading or accessing professional advice where major psychological issues emerge (which is quite likely in view of the nature of the material).</p>
<p>In all, this is a brave and fascinating book, which I would highly recommend, especially for those wishing to rediscover one of the great narratives of the Hebrew Bible.</p>

<p>I was intrigued by the title of this book, immensely impressed as I read it, and somewhat perplexed at the end. Intrigued, because I wondered how it was possible to treat as Christian a chapter which pictures the destruction of the cities of Moab in turn and utters a curse on the one who keeps back the sword from bloodshed. Impressed, because this book originated in a first-class thesis and has become an extremely rich book. And perplexed because I was left with more questions.</p>
<p>The quality of the book is unmistakable. It is outstanding both in little things, such as the extreme accuracy of the Hebrew printing, and in major features, notably the clear and well-presented arguments which make it easy to follow the thought and the beautifully lucid English which made it a pleasure to read. The tables greatly assist the reader, particularly the first in which the <sc>mt</sc> (Masoretic Text) and the <sc>lxx</sc> (Septuagint) are printed in boxes side by side together with the <sc>nrsv</sc> and the New English Translation of the Septuagint, though more literal translations might have been preferable.</p>
<p>After a general survey of Jeremiah’s Oracles against the Nations, Woods compares the <sc>mt</sc> with the <sc>lxx</sc> to discover ‘how <sc>lxx</sc> illumines <sc>mt</sc>’ and examines the relation of Isaiah 1—16 to this chapter. This is picked up later in a discussion of the omission of the promise of restoration for Moab in verse 47 by the <sc>lxx</sc>, and three ways of treating the two canons are discussed. Woods then turns to the interpretations of five avowedly Christian scholars, three American (Terence Fretheim, Patrick D. Miller and Walter Brueggemann) and two British (Douglas Jones and Ronald Clements), and assesses them with many pertinent comments. An interlude considers the curse in verse 10, and then her own Christian reading of the chapter provides in effect a further commentary on it. The expositions consider in turn the ‘tone’ of the prophecy, the extent of Yahweh’s involvement, the prophet’s message and purpose, and the ways in which the chapter can become Scripture for today. Her own approach is ‘figurative’, and we find many references to the New Testament. What is particularly striking is the way many of the features of the chapter are expounded to yield Christian thought, and not only the more obvious ones of the suffering of God and the final promise of restoration.</p>
<p>Why then was I perplexed at the end? For three reasons. I was not sure how Woods understood ‘Christian’, given that she has ‘no denominational affiliation or loyalties’ (p. 219). I wondered why every word of the Bible has to be equally Christian Scripture and whether it might not be better to say ‘No’ to some passages. And I wished that more might have been said about the significance of the fact that for some 400 years the <sc>lxx</sc>, not the Hebrew, was the Bible of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>Here is a rather fresh approach to study of the four Gospels, and an accessible and inviting route into some quite deep and sophisticated insights. The method was initially developed with students at King’s College, London, but it has been road-tested on church people too, and the author’s clarity, learning and enthusiasm deserve to reach a wide readership.</p>
<p>Adams handles the Gospels as biographies (his colleague, Richard Burridge, has shown how well they fit within this ancient genre). He underlines their very substantial similarities: through four lenses we see a recognizably singular Jesus. Yet the bulk of this book attends to the distinctive ways in which the evangelists tell their common story, and to the particular aspects of the good news opened up by their varied approaches.</p>
<p>The principal method used is narrative analysis, rather than the more customary academic avenues of form- and redaction-criticism. So Adams looks at how each of the four Gospels works as a story, with its own set of narrative features – plot and character, space and time, technique and style. These help to shape the reader’s experience, frame the presentation of Jesus that is offered, and highlight particular themes in the good news.</p>
<p>Adams sets his work out in three sections. The first (forty pages) introduces the Gospels and gives an orientation to the methods that will be used. The second (eighty pages) includes four self-contained chapters on the four Gospels, tracing in each case the flow of the plot, the style of the storytelling, and the themes that emerge. Then the third (sixty pages) has six shorter chapters, looking at parallel accounts of some important incidents in the story: Jesus’ baptism, feeding of the five thousand, walking on water, transfiguration, death and resurrection. By comparing the texts we see both ‘the shared story’ that is common to them all, and the different emphases of the individual accounts.</p>
<p>So, for example, the transfiguration texts ‘reveal … Mark’s interest in secrecy and his tendency to cast the disciples in a more negative light; Matthew’s special interest in Jesus as a new Moses; Luke’s interest in prayer’ (p. 163). When we come to the passion, Mark is strongly Christological: he ‘highlights the connection between Jesus’ death and his divine sonship’ (p. 174). Matthew has a more apocalyptic character, with ‘signs and portents in the heavens and on earth’ (p. 174). Luke is typically pastoral: he ‘shows Jesus dying as a righteous sufferer’ (p. 174). And John the theologian ‘emphasizes Jesus’ completion of the task that the Father sent him to do’ (p. 174).</p>
<p>This book could introduce the Gospels in various settings. First-year university students, for example – with or without a biblical background – could use it as a course book. Some church groups would enjoy working through the second or third section – as long as members were keen to do some homework. Or you could read it alone, for Adams is a lively writer. His work is helpfully set out and signposted, and is both concise and refreshingly clear. Many a reader will gain new confidence in dealing with the four Gospels, and will appreciate more fully both their variety and their unity.</p>

<p>Paula Gooder is one of the most imaginative and accessible communicators of high-quality biblical scholarship to scholars and non-scholars alike. Her works include volumes on hermeneutics (<italic>Searching for Meaning</italic>, SPCK, 2008), spirituality (<italic>A Way through the Wilderness</italic>, Church House Publishing, 2009) and biblical languages (<italic>Exploring New Testament Greek</italic>, with Peter Kevern, SCM Press, 2004). With the present volume, she returns to familiar territory, having considered biblical views of heaven as part of her doctoral work at Oxford and in her monograph on 2 Corinthians 12 (<italic>Only the Third Heaven?</italic>, T&amp;T Clark, 2006).</p>
<p><italic>Heaven</italic> introduces readers to some of the complexities attached to thinking about heaven in the Bible. Gooder begins with a snapshot of some modern ideas about heaven (pp. ix–xvi). This discussion is apt, since what follows serves to defamiliarize the biblical materials. Her first chapter (pp. 1–11) tackles heaven in ancient Hebrew cosmology – the upper-storey of a three-tier cosmos suggested by the biblical creation narratives. This discussion is important, since it establishes a key difference between ancient and modern ideas of heaven, namely, that in the biblical materials heaven was a cosmological region, <italic>spatially</italic> located in relation to earth. The discussion of the hermeneutical problems associated with this defunct cosmology (pp. 7–8) is particularly worthwhile.</p>
<p>In subsequent chapters, Gooder discusses the inhabitants of heaven – God and the angels. Her treatment of the metaphor-laden language about God in the Bible usefully introduces readers to the problem of the limits of theological language (pp. 12–15). She writes: ‘It is almost impossible to disentangle reality from metaphor. The biblical writers used human language … to describe that which defies description’ (p. 15). Her taxonomy of the inhabitants of heaven (pp. 32–58) is thorough and clear. The introduction to the extra-canonical angels traditions preserved in the pseudepigraphical writings of <italic>Enoch</italic> and <italic>4 Ezra</italic> will be particularly useful for readers unfamiliar with such traditions (pp. 54–8).</p>
<p>Of the remaining chapters, attention should be given to the material on death, resurrection and the afterlife (chs 8—9, pp. 79–100). This is perhaps the point at which Gooder’s work bears most strongly upon popular notions of heaven. Gooder’s discussion of the Hebrew afterlife tradition is very helpful (pp. 81–7), being sensitive to both the historical development and variety of the tradition. The resultant picture of the afterlife as resurrection to <italic>re-embodied</italic> existence leads to a worthwhile discussion of what the ‘spiritual body’ means in 1 Corinthians 15 (pp. 88–90). The discussion is reminiscent of Tom Wright, and Gooder’s work is as admirably clear and understandable as his.</p>
<p>The final chapter of the volume briefly considers some of the ways in which reflection upon the biblical portrayal of heaven and the resurrection might bear upon spirituality (pp. 101–3), ecology (pp. 103–4) and worship (pp. 104–5). This brings the discussion full-circle, and challenges the reader to exercise imagination and creative judgement in making sense of the biblical materials.</p>

<p>Richard Longenecker, author of a well-respected commentary on Galatians in the Word series, is preparing in his retirement to produce a full exegetical commentary on Romans, and this book is the Introduction to that work. It far exceeds in length and detail what one would expect in an Introduction. To publish it separately gives the author free rein to develop every relevant issue, but it has its drawbacks: it lacks the discipline of space constraints in the usual commentary format; it threatens to leave the eventual commentary as a headless torso; and when problematic issues arise the reader is tantalizingly referred to a future volume or volumes.</p>
<p>There are few surprises in the conclusions reached but what is valuable is the clear and fair summaries of the different views of commentators ancient as well as modern, and the full bibliographies that follow each section. Chapters on authorship, integrity (defending the full sixteen-chapter version, including the final doxology) and date, are followed by more interesting discussions of the addressees and the purposes of Romans. Longenecker characterizes the Roman congregations as closely allied to the Mother Church in Jerusalem, its Gentile as much as its Jewish members. They were, he argues, forced by the revocation of the right of assembly by Claudius on his accession to the imperial throne in <sc>ad</sc> 41 to form themselves into house churches. When the Jewish Christians were expelled by the edict of <sc>ad</sc> 49 Roman Christians still retained their ties to Jerusalem. Longenecker might have considered an alternative reconstruction of the situation in Rome, that it was precisely the power vacuum caused by these events that encouraged Paul in this letter to try to recruit the Roman congregations into his own network of churches. His discussion of the purposes of Romans also leads to a reassuring conclusion that Paul wished to transform his readers’ understanding of the gospel, renew their commitment to Christ, appreciate his efforts to contextualize his message (concerning the state ch. 13, and the issue of food offered to idols chs 14—15), but also to share in his conviction of the universality of the Christian message. Purposes such as polemic against Paul’s own (Pharisaic) Judaism and apologetic for the intended rapid expansion of the Gentile mission are consistently ignored or downplayed.</p>
<p>The chapter on Greco-Roman oral rhetorical and epistolary conventions is an excellent discussion; less satisfactory is the treatment of Jewish and Jewish Christian procedures and themes: attention is paid to the remnant theme of chapters 9—11, but not to the quite extraordinary interpretation of Genesis 15.6 (given contemporary Jewish exegesis) in chapter 4. What might have been the most interesting chapter (Ch. 9, ‘Major interpretative approaches prominent today’) turns out to be something of a disappointment; the topics covered are well worn, like righteousness, and faith in versus faithfulness of Christ; there is a critical review of Jewett’s recent sociological commentary but nothing on recent critiques of the ‘new perspective’ of Sanders and Dunn. The new commentary will, I am sure, be a competent (and lengthy) piece of work but, as far as one can tell from this Introduction, not particularly ground-breaking.</p>

<p>Few initiatives could be more relevant at a time of strain within the Anglican Communion and of sluggishness in the ecumenical movement than those that remind us of the conciliar dimension of the Church. Conciliarity stands for the coming together, through representative channels, of the whole Church to take counsel for its faith, order and mission. The conciliar tradition goes back to the Council of Nicaea in <sc>ad</sc> 325 and perhaps to the Council of Jerusalem described in the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 15. Twenty years ago Professor Norman Tanner of the Gregorian University in Rome headed the team that produced a definitive bilingual edition of the decrees of all the councils that are recognized by the Roman Catholic Church (RCC). Now he has gathered together his published articles on the conciliar tradition. These pieces appear not to have been revised for publication in this form; so there is some repetition and the occasional anachronism (Cardinal Ratzinger is still said to be the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: p. 99). Nevertheless, these are very instructive studies that would repay attention by all those engaged in the study of Church history, ecumenism and ecclesiology generally. Norman Tanner brings a refreshing perspective to bear on many aspects of his theme as he shows how a range of topics – among them, the Eucharist, Mary and non-Christian religions – were handled by councils.</p>
<p>The first major study in this volume deals with the Asian dimension of councils and corrects the common perception that the institutional life of the Church, including its teaching, has been dominated in an imperialistic way by the West. On the contrary, Jesus, the apostles and many leading figures of the early Church were from the East, indeed from Asia as it was understood at that time. Four of the first seven councils were held in Asia; the other three in Constantinople, on the borders of the East. All seven were called and presided over by Eastern Roman emperors and empresses and had their decrees promulgated by them. The early councils sought consensus and unanimity in a way that is more eastern than western. The language of the councils was not legalistic, in the Western fashion, but open-textured, flexible, hospitable to a range of interpretations except those heresies that were intentionally being ruled out. In the Middle Ages the Western Church felt inferior and threatened; it was vulnerable to attack and the future of Christianity itself was in question. Therefore, it sometimes reacted violently to threats to its unity, not least at the time of the Reformation. But this is precisely where (and as far as I can see, only where) Professor Tanner slips up, in suggesting, on more than one occasion, that because Scripture was the supreme authority for the Reformers they were not particularly interested in conciliarity. Far from it: Reformation texts are loaded with conciliar reflection and polemic; Luther and Cranmer appealed to a general council, but one that was freely representative, not packed by the pope. The Reformers were in significant ways heirs of the fifteenth-century conciliarists and the modern churches that have been shaped by the Reformation are conciliar or synodical churches, even when they are also episcopal. Sources of authority and structures of authority need to be distinguished.</p>
<p>Norman Tanner himself, though always disarmingly equable in his judgements, makes his sympathies clear enough. The Roman Catholic Church is injuring herself by continuing to regard conciliarity with suspicion, 700 years after certain councils (notably Constance) took matters out of the hands of the (fragmented) papacy in order to heal the Church. The loss of regional councils (let the reader understand: and the consequent centralization of the RCC) is ‘one of the gravest wounds in Christian history’ (p. 76) and has contributed to the RCC’s weakness in facing modern challenges. It is too inward looking and reactive, but ecumenical councils are a good antidote to preoccupation with the papacy. However, there is hope because the Holy Spirit ‘blows where She wills' and will stir up lay people, including women, to revive the Church. This stimulating and engaging account will be useful for private study or for teaching assignments.</p>

<p>In 2008 the Archbishop of Canterbury awarded Margaret Barker a Lambeth Degree ‘in recognition of her work on the Jerusalem Temple and the origins of Christian liturgy, which has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the New Testament and opened up important fields for research’ &lt;www.archbishopofcanterbury.org&gt;. In <italic>Temple Mysticism</italic> Margaret Barker enlarges her contribution still further, with a volume that is the companion to her <italic>Temple Theology</italic> (SPCK, 2008).</p>
<p>A scholar with a still-developing corpus of work around a substantial theological thread can be an intimidating prospect. At what point is it best for the uninitiated to pick up the thread? However, those who are unfamiliar with Margaret Barker’s other books need have no fears about plunging into this one. It stands on its own considerable merits and does not require any preknowledge of the subject.</p>
<p>Her argument is that there is a deeply profound mystical tradition associated with Jerusalem’s ancient First Temple. The impact of this tradition stretches into the Christian era. It is hugely influential: John of Patmos sees a vision of the New Jerusalem as a ‘huge golden cube’ (p. 12). The New Jerusalem thus resembles the Temple’s innermost holy of holies and the two are intimately connected. Both are the site of the divine throne, and the collective (Christian) priesthood of John’s era stands in the divine presence as once did their Jewish forebears.</p>
<p>But this mystical tradition was necessarily an oral tradition; in its customs, rites and beliefs it was unsurprisingly secretive; and it was succeeded by the Deuteronomists and their heirs, ‘a movement akin to the Reformation that changed the face of Europe’ (p. 170). Rediscovering the contours and content of the tradition is the task she sets herself, and it is the task of a detective. For ‘Temple mysticism is a hypothesis’, she admits (p. 1). She goes about establishing her hypothesis with consummate skill, examining and re-examining both the biblical sources and an array of extra-biblical sources as well. Her technical ability with texts dazzles: a tiny adjustment of a character here, the removal of a punctuation mark there, and the new (and original?) sense of the manuscript emerges, shedding light on the lost spirituality of the high priests.</p>
<p>Perhaps the boldest assertions that <italic>Temple Mysticism</italic> makes are in the last chapter, ‘The Servant’. The temple mystics were ‘Servants of the Lord’ (p. 13). Barker argues that in the First Temple tradition Adam was seen as such a servant. He was not just the tiller of Eden. He was the high priest whose expulsion from the garden is a type of the loss of the Temple (as describe in Ezek. 28), a loss and expulsion which are reversed by the advent of the new Servant/Priest, Jesus Christ, who restores creation by making atonement, who is ‘stricken for the transgression of my people’ (p. 161).</p>
<p><italic>Temple Mysticism</italic> is subtitled <italic>An Introduction</italic>, and that is what it is. Lucid, intelligent and provocative, it challenges the reader to further study in the light of its hypothesis for, as Margaret Barker observes, ‘there is a whole Bible waiting to be reread’ (p. 1).</p>

<p>One of the questions that is often asked when exploring the question of the role of women in the earliest Christian communities is that of whether the New Testament is more or less conservative than the surrounding culture. In other words, do the infamous Pauline passages about the relationship between wives and their husbands and about the role women may or may not play in corporate worship represent an attitude that was more inclusive and accommodating than the surrounding culture or more exclusive and restrictive? Of course the answer to this question is far from straightforward since the crucial factor that affects our ability to answer it is the issue of which particular culture is being referred to. The picture is complex and hard to reconstruct.</p>
<p>Lynn Cohick’s enormously helpful book seeks to fill in some of the background to this question. She notes in her introduction that she isn’t attempting to respond to questions about whether women can or should be involved in Church leadership and worship in the contemporary Church (p. 21). Instead she explores the background by asking what a woman’s life might have been like in the first century and beyond.</p>
<p>What results is a fascinating and rich portrait of women’s lives in this period. Using a wide range of sources, Cohick paints a picture that covers many aspects of women’s existence in the Ancient Jewish and Graeco-Roman world. She begins with an exploration of the perception of women as daughters (pp. 33–64) and paints a powerful picture of the power of the father (<italic>patria potestas</italic>), not only his ability to accept or reject a child at birth but also his continued role even once the daughter was married. One of the great strengths of this whole book is that Cohick not only depicts the official position but also offers anecdotes drawn from letters, various kinds of writing and archaeological evidence of the exceptions to the official position. So, for example, in this first chapter she paints the stark picture of the fathers’ ability to cast a new born out of the family at whim but then balances that against the enormous affection evidently shown towards various daughters in ancient texts.</p>
<p>The subsequent chapters follow other aspects of a woman’s life from marriage and ideals that existed about married women (ch. 2) to the reality of being a wife (ch. 3) and the role of mothers (ch. 4). Chapters 5 and 6 explore the religious activities of Gentile women and God-Fearers and the informal power of Jewish and Christian women, respectively. Again, the great power of these chapters lies in Cohick’s exploration not only of the official position but also of evidence of what really happened as well. The final three chapters turn their attention to the sphere of work at different levels of society, with Chapter 7 looking at what women’s work could mean in this period, Chapter 8 exploring the place of slaves and prostitutes and Chapter 9 that of benefactors and patrons.</p>
<p>The very few frustrations of this book arise as much from the nature of the sources as from what Cohick does with them. There are times when the information feels repetitive, but then sometimes the information needs repeating as a slightly different aspect of women’s existence is explored. Another frustration is that the overlap between Jewish women and Graeco-Roman women is blurred. Cohick rightly refuses to drive too hard a wedge between the two but as a result it is hard, sometimes, to discern the differences in reality for Jewish and Gentile women.</p>
<p>Overall this is an invaluable book. It has not yet made it onto my bookshelf as I return again and again to the points it is making. Anyone who wants to reflect seriously on the nature of the earliest Christian communities, let alone on the role of women in those communities, should make this essential reading, as it brings to life through its balanced exploration of laws and anecdotes the complex, though largely alien, world of the earliest Christians.</p>

<p>The term ‘Scholasticism’ was first used in the early modern era as a term of opprobrium. Both Erasmus and Luther contrasted their own brand of theological discourse with the logic-chopping sophistry, useless disputation and pastoral sterility of medieval philosophy and theology. Their criticism was of the scatter-gun variety: Thomists, Scotists and Nominalists were lumped together and labelled as ‘bad’ for paying too much heed to Aristotle and not enough to divine grace.</p>
<p>The Baroque Scholasticism of the Counter-Reformation came in for even more stringent criticisms from the leading thinkers of the Enlightenment, who regarded it as the pedantic philosophy of papist monks and friars, beholden to the dark authority of the unenlightened past. The nineteenth-century Catholic revival, known as ‘Neo-Scholasticism’, was a conscious counter-blast to the Enlightenment, a bold attempt to employ traditional methods in pursuit of answers to entirely new questions.</p>
<p>The dangers of the method were noted even in the thirteenth century by some of its ablest practitioners, but Scholasticism exemplified the free and liberating interplay between rational enquiry and the demands of faith, motivated by confidence in their essential unity and compatibility. As such, it was at the forefront of new and daring developments in theology in particular and intellectual endeavour in general. Even in the thirteenth century, more conservative-minded theologians complained that modernizers had gone too far by adopting what was considered by some to be a near blasphemous approach to the material of <italic>Sacra Doctrina</italic>. Some, for example Bonaventure, complained that they were trying to make of Aristotle a Catholic.</p>
<p>Originally published in 1995, this translation from the German makes this invaluable and uniquely exhaustive survey of Scholasticism available to English-speaking readers for the first time. The author combines history and evaluation, covering the subject from the first stirrings of this new methodology in the philosophically sensitive hands of late antique figures such as Boethius; through early medieval thinkers such as the mysterious John Scotus Eriugena, whose work caused alarm to many; the maverick Peter Abelard, sometimes known as the first Scholastic, who provided impetus by pointing out the inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions in what had been inherited from antiquity; and the two Anselms – Canterbury and Laon – one of whom, Laon, taught Abelard (to little effect, according to Abelard) and the monk-Archbishop, known as the Second Augustine, who was the bridge between late antiquity and the then methods of the Schoolmen. Leinsle is particularly thorough on the reception of Aristotle’s natural philosophical works from the mid-twelfth century onwards, which provoked the intellectual revolution to which Scholasticism could be said to have been a response and flourishing of the method in the hands of such masters as Thomas Aquinas and his teacher Albert the Great. Reactions to Scholasticism on the part of the Reformation thinkers and the reaction of the Council of Trent are covered with admirable balance and even-handed analysis, and the political undertow involved in Neo-Scholasticism is handled with sensitivity. Throughout, Leinsle points out both the pitfalls and the potential of this long-lived and, in its heyday, avante-garde theological and philosophical methodology.</p>

<p>Kenneth Appold’s <italic>The Reformation</italic> aims to provide a short overview of this most complex part of European history. The period has received a vast amount of scholarly attention, with many works (products of both detailed research and short introductions) published every year.</p>
<p>This engaging book provides a fairly thorough synthesis of much of the historical writing on this period. A short work, it takes the reader on a journey through the medieval period and the experiences of the ‘struggling’ Catholic Church, through to the transformative beliefs of Martin Luther, ending with the final establishment of the Reformation Church in Europe. Despite this relatively short length, Appold provides an impressive amount of detail. A particular strength of the book is its consideration of the history of the medieval European Church, which is comprehensive, including, for example, a thorough discussion of the process of Christianization in different parts of Europe and a compelling history of the papacy and of papal power. The work also explores the impact of Lutheranism on Europe, and draws together much relevant historiography, both old and new. It covers some intriguing information, which is useful to both the general reader and the scholar. This includes, for example, material peripheral to Lutheran thought, such as the case of Hans Sachs, a shoemaker from Nuremberg, who wrote a poem about Luther, ‘The Wittenberg Nightingale’.</p>
<p>Indeed, the work is an interesting variation on some of the other introductions to the period recently written, including <italic>The Reformation: A Very Short Introduction</italic>, by Peter Marshall, and Diarmaid MacCulloch’s excellent <italic>Reformation: Europe’s House Divided</italic>. Appold is far from Anglo-centric, and it is useful to be reminded of the German and European religious beliefs which were so crucial to the evolution of Reformation thought.</p>
<p>However, Appold’s <italic>Brief History</italic> may fall victim to underestimating the importance of other countries and other Reformers, not least those in England. Though the work promises to be a history of the Reformation as a whole, Appold skirts very briefly over the influences of crucial characters such as Zwingli and, most surprisingly, Calvin. This makes the work somewhat unbalanced in its consideration of the establishment of Reformation thought and its lasting impact. Appold also argues that he challenges many traditional historiographies by arguing that medieval Christianity lacked unity. Yet, this is far from a new position, as any work considering the beliefs of groups such as the Lollards will show. Further still, it is possible that Appold underestimates the strength of the Roman Catholic Church in some parts of Europe, in particular in relation to its impact on popular forms of piety. Nevertheless, the work stands as a thorough and thought-provoking account of this fascinating part of history, and, especially in conjunction with some of the other introductory volumes available, would be useful to anyone interested in studying the origins of the European Reformations.</p>

<sec id="sec20-0040571X12443662"><title>Dewey D. Wallace, Jr., <italic>Shapers of English Calvinism, 1660–1714: Variety, Persistence, and Transformation</italic>, Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2011; 368 pp.: 9780199744831, £45.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Having already written elsewhere about John Owen, one of the towering figures in the seventeenth-century Calvinist heritage, Dewey Wallace turns his attention in this nuanced and detailed study to five other representatives of the diverse Reformed constituency of late Stuart England. The book focuses on some less familiar variations of Reformed thought, such as the mystical Calvinism of Peter Sterry, the ‘ancient theology’ of the exceptionally erudite Theophilus Gale, and the natural theology of moderates such as William Bates and John Howe.</p>
<p>The book also explores the evangelical Calvinism of Joseph Alleine, as well as (and perhaps more interestingly) how the later hagiographic image of him was constructed; ‘Oh with what Exstasie and Ravishments of Spirit did he flie away into the Bosom of his Saviour!’ said his funeral sermon (p. 147), while others spoke of his humility, piety and steadfastness as a Puritan martyr amid persecution. Each of the subjects of this volume represent spiritual trajectories that have long continued in English-speaking Protestantism, though they are also chosen for being somewhat idiosyncratic in themselves. Collectively, Wallace tells us, ‘they show a diversity of creative adaptations of the Calvinist impulse in a changing era’ (p. 8).</p>
<p>It is especially refreshing to have here an exploration of the thought of John Edwards of Cambridge, who was very much a Church of England Calvinist in an age when Calvinism has often been thought (quite erroneously) to have fallen off the edge of the Anglican map. It cannot have helped his cause that his near-namesake Jonathan Edwards (1703–58) turned out to be one of America’s most significant theologians and philosophers and has accordingly grabbed all the subsequent attention. It is a delight that someone has been able to distinguish them and give the older John, who was a significant spokesman for Reformed Anglicanism in his day, a new lease of life. That being said, it is fascinating to note that Edwards promoted a transformed moderate version of Reformed theology, not a carbon copy of Owenism, and ‘oscillated between the attempt to make Calvinism more winsome and a querulous defensiveness about it’ (p. 240).</p>
<p>Regrettably, Wallace passes rather too quickly over the excellent recent work of Stephen Hampton into the Anglican Reformed tradition of this period, and shows no signs of appreciating its significance for any appraisal of post-Restoration ‘Anti-Arminianism’. If one of the strengths of Wallace’s book is that it rightly recognizes the variety within Calvinism generally, it is unfortunate that he does not make more of the multiplicity of genuinely Anglican ways to sit in the wide stream of thought that is Reformed theology.</p>
<p>Personally, I find it irritating and inconvenient to be forced to flick to the back of a book all the time in order to find the endnotes. But for those who are not so insatiably curious about sources, finer details and interesting asides, Wallace’s style in the main text makes this a meaty but pleasurable read, and demonstrates yet again that Reformed theology has always been about more than simply predestination.</p>

<p>Eberhard Busch, a Reformed theologian and former student of Karl Barth, as well as author of an authoritative biography of his mentor, offers in <italic>The Barmen Theses Then and Now</italic> a stimulating theological analysis of the Barmen Declaration. The Declaration, the founding document and clarion call of the generally Nazi-wary Confessing Church wing of the German Protestant Church, opposed emphatically both the pro-Nazi German Christians and so-called ‘Aryan’ Christianity during the Third Reich. Despite the temporary consensus forged at the time of the Declaration’s passage, the church’s unity would fracture as debates concerning its posture toward the Nazi state and the regime’s anti-Semitic policies and actions revealed deeper fissures. The book is valuable both for its appraisal of the situation in which the Declaration arose and for the rich tapestry of timeless theological application weaved by its author.</p>
<p>The book’s contributions are many. Busch’s clear and consistent Reformed, Barthian theological position is not wielded in a heavy-handed manner, but is instead coupled with a warm ecumenism that can be appreciated by those outside his theological tradition. In this, Busch reflects the fact that the Declaration was intended by its framers to promote ecclesiological unity. A second positive lies in the nature of the work, which is reflected in its title. Busch wants to help the reader to understand Barmen both in its original context and as a theological guide for present-day living. Even a brief perusal of the theses will make obvious their myriad potential applications for twenty-first-century life. Third, Busch demonstrates that the biblical and confessional unity of the Confessing Church in particular led some of its adherents – including, of course, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemöller – to push back in exemplary and courageous fashion against efforts on the part of the Nazi regime to control the German Protestant Church.</p>
<p>One significant point of critique is warranted, however. Busch rightly notes that it ‘is correct and profoundly fateful that the Barmen Declaration … does not imply in any way that it stands and must stand in an essential bond with the Jews’ (p. 30). Yet, he presents a skewed summary of the nature of the anti-Jewish sentiments present in Germany in the 1930s when he avers that ‘the anti-Semitism of the time was not argued Christologically but in terms of the <italic>Volk</italic>, that is, ethnically, which is why baptized Jews were also ostracized and persecuted’ (p. 30). This view elides the fact that many German Protestants, including the prominent theologian Paul Althaus, intermingled Christological commitments – including the charge of deicide against the Jews – with a theological construct of the German <italic>Volk</italic> as an ‘order of creation’. This latter construct, married to the prevalent German nationalism of the time, provided for many a fertile ground for anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>This important critique aside, Busch’s compact, accessible study is invaluable not only for those interested in Jewish-Christian dialogue and in the history of the churches during the Third Reich but also for Christians seeking to develop a deeper understanding of the role of the churches in society, especially during troubled times.</p>

<p>As this book’s (rather dull) title indicates, A. T. Houghton was a pioneer missionary in northern Burma and thereafter for over twenty-five years a leader in English evangelical Anglican mission and church circles. Yates’s book reveals a solid, safe, sensible, large-hearted man; people trusted him; he was a good chairman – fair, careful and thorough with a huge appetite for work. Whether there was anything sparkling or scintillating in Houghton’s own two thousand autobiographical pages does not emerge. Was he ever angry or petrified? Why did it have to wait for Morogoro to make him a canon? There seem to be hardly any Asian or African friends in this story, except Tailum Jan and U Set Paw. He seems to have been unusually partisan in his negative reaction to the charismatic movement, in contrast to his discriminating attitude towards the World Council of Churches (WCC). We don’t learn much about his emotions in this book. Did he have any hobbies? Was he fluent in Jinghpaw? Was he ravished by any poetry?</p>
<p>Houghton was a remarkable person, born in 1896 and living into the last decade of the twentieth century. His life was touched by both World Wars and he narrowly escaped drowning when his ship was bombed in the Atlantic in 1941. He loved his military life and perhaps was over-fond of military images of Christian mission and discipleship. He hoped to return to Burma, but the war and Bishop West scuppered his appointment as a missionary bishop like his brother Frank in China, and instead he became a hugely influential leader in the Bible Churchmen’s Missionary Society (BCMS), in English and international mission circles, and in the whole evolution of Anglican evangelicalism in the twentieth century. Inevitably the book has a dated feel, because Canon Houghton retired nearly fifty years ago and died nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>The book gives glimpses of some old conflicts and bugbears: the 1922 conflict which led to the emergence of the BCMS out of the Church Missionary Society; the rejection of the 1928 Prayer Book; the stubbornness and occasional ignorance of Dr Daniel Bartlett; the early conflicts between the Student Christian Movement and the Inter-Varsity Fellowship; the WCC New Delhi conference in 1961; the 1964 Anglican-Methodist scheme; the famous disagreement between Martyn Lloyd-Jones and John Stott at the Evangelical Alliance meeting in 1966; the distasteful struggles surrounding the birth of Trinity College Bristol in 1971. Houghton was obviously thrilled with the Billy Graham Haringay crusade and worked hard for years through the Keswick movement to develop ‘scriptural holiness and discipleship’. After his very narrow upbringing it is not surprising he had his peccadilloes. He was deeply devoted to, and supported by, his wife and large family.</p>
<p>I wish I could ask my late father Osmond (named in this book) or my late godfather John Webb, who worked among the Shan in Burma and later in Thailand, how they would summarize A. T. Houghton. I feel sure they would say, ‘A godly and faithful servant of our Lord; a lovely man.’</p>

<p>This, the latest in a series of volumes of sources published over some twenty years by the Church of England Record Society, provides a fascinating insight into the riches of the archives at Lambeth Palace Library. Thirteen chapters in all pick out a wide range of different sources to lay before the reader, each of which is prefaced by a critical introduction. Barber and Taylor have assembled an impressive array of specialists, and there is something for practically everyone interested in the history of the Church of England.</p>
<p>Some of the contributions are perhaps more immediately attention grabbing than others. In almost his last published piece, the late Patrick Collinson introduces documents bearing on the sequestration of Archbishop Grindal, one of the key moments in the emergence of the Elizabethan conflict over what would later be called ‘Puritanism’. Michael Snape prefaces a remarkable account by Archbishop Randall Davidson of his visit to the Western front in May 1916, an account quoted elsewhere but here reproduced for the first time in full, and with extraordinarily extensive and helpful annotation. At first glance, Arthur Burns’s selection (though it is almost all the Lambeth material bearing on the subject) of documents touching on the parish of Bethnal Green in the early nineteenth century is less compelling, but in fact such is the judiciousness and comprehensiveness of Burns’s introduction that this piece alone looks set to stand alongside other, lengthier discussions of London church life as a vital contribution to research. This is just a taste of the excellent things to be found in this book.</p>
<p>Three institutions in effect are celebrated in this volume – not only Lambeth Palace Library itself, and the Church of England Record Society, but also the Clergy of the Church of England Database, available online and a unique scholarly resource, which is used to inform several chapters. The high quality of contributions – that is, in terms of selection of material and scholarly introduction – makes this a vindication of the work of all three.</p>

<p>John B. Cobb, Jr, is one of the key developers of process theology, applying Alfred North Whitehead’s process philosophy to Christian faith. Cobb is author, editor or contributor to over thirty-five books. As such, he is a known quantity to readers of contemporary theology. Those who are sympathetic to his thinking find his writing well conceived and well argued. <italic>Spiritual Bankruptcy</italic> joins the pantheon of his works as an excellent theological contribution to twenty-first-century debates on topics such as environmental degradation and social justice.</p>
<p>Readers should not approach <italic>Spiritual Bankruptcy</italic> expecting to read statistics about poverty or global warming. Instead, Cobb takes a more philosophical approach. He begins the book with the prima facie acceptance of an impending catastrophe. The catastrophe is primarily environmental, but he skilfully leads readers into an engagement with the role religiousness plays in perpetuating or contributing to environmental and social problems. Yet, even though religiousness contributes to problems, Cobb does not let secularism off the hook. Secularism leads to the shortcomings of over-adherence to science, separation of theology and philosophy, secularism in universities, and economism.</p>
<p>At the end of the first chapter, Cobb gives readers a glimpse of his conclusion when he suggests that secularizing Christianity gets closer to the biblical message than an overly religious adherence to Christ. He writes, ‘Jesus stood in this tradition, critiquing both the political and the religious authorities of his day and calling for countercultural communities … Sadly, the message of Jesus has been concealed and corrupted by the religiousness of many who intend to reverence him’ (p. 13). For Cobb, secularization represents an opportunity for the message of Christ to reach its fullest potential and avoid getting bogged down in religion.</p>
<p>Chapters 2 through 8 trace the origins of secularism and follow its development. Beginning in ancient Greece and Israel, Cobb follows secularism’s growth in the Church and its rise in the Renaissance, through modern science and culminating in the Enlightenment. In Chapter 5, he examines the secularist intent of modern philosophy. The following chapter explores secularism in education. Chapter 7 continues in education, focusing on the academic discipline of economics, and Chapter 8 is about reactions to secularism. He writes, ‘Secularism as a historical phenomenon has led to avoiding questions of value beyond considering what people happen to want or falling back on the default position of self-interest’ (p. 125).</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Cobb is critical of secularism as an abstract construct. He uses historical examples and concludes that secularism falls short of providing a system in which humanity can respond to the great crises of the early twenty-first century. He optimistically proposes a ‘new philosophy’ as a response to the failures of secularism, and he believes that a new philosophy can offer salvation to the Earth. ‘The Earth should be seen as a living organism or as supportive of numerous living organisms’ (p. 145). Chapter 9 includes a section on Alfred North Whitehead and his theism. Cobb then draws out the implications of his own new philosophy for science, higher education and economics.</p>
<p>Cobb concludes <italic>Spiritual Bankruptcy</italic> with a chapter about secularizing Christianity in the United States. Readers are forewarned not to stray too far from Cobb’s definition of ‘secularization’. He criticizes it for its failures, but he draws helpful lessons from secularizing Jesus as a means to better understand how to respond to environmental and social problems. However, readers beware! Secularizing Christians, Cobb believes, ‘<italic>could</italic> start a fire that would save the world’ (p. 183).</p>

<p>This is a useful, thought provoking and ultimately rather frustrating contribution to the debate about political liberalism, the theoretical tradition that began with John Locke. This tradition was boldly reaffirmed by the late John Rawls but has subsequently been attacked from various quarters. John Perry seeks to refresh the debate by showing the abiding relevance of Locke’s <italic>Letter on Toleration</italic>.</p>
<p>Locke-Rawls (or ‘Johannine’) liberalism is centred on the idea that the state should disregard its citizens’ religion. It should limit itself to upholding secular laws, which exist to protect individual rights. People can worship however they want, as long as no secular laws are broken. This is the model of politics and religion that we still take for granted in the West to a huge extent. But, according to a clear new orthodoxy in political science, and especially political theology, it is deficient. By forcing everyone into the box of rational individual, it fails to see that many people have another, deeper sense of belonging, or ‘loyalty’, that defines their public identity. Of course this is likely to be some species of religious conservatism.</p>
<p>Perry broadly endorses this ‘turn to loyalty’ (p. 10), which includes communitarians and ‘republicans’, who emphasize the need for public values or ‘virtue’, and postmodern theologians such as Hauerwas and Milbank, though he avoids the flashy polemics of most such thinkers. He agrees that classical liberalism is overconfident that a rational theory of the state can set the proper boundary between religion and politics, and so solve the ‘theopolitical problem’ (p. 49).</p>
<p>Yet he is not a conventional Locke-knocker. His aim is to reframe the question by showing that there is more nuance in Locke’s work than is usually supposed. He was aware that his theory could only find widespread support if a certain theological consensus was in place: if Christianity was understood to be supportive of toleration. Only thus could a Christian feel a dual loyalty to his religion and to the tolerant state. It is only on the basis of the ‘harmonization of loyalties’ (p. 52) that Locke can develop his theory of the state as the neutral defender of individual rights. We must see these as two distinct moves: ‘Much of the confusion [in liberal theory today] is due to our overattention to the later of these (toleration requires a governmental policy of neutrality) and neglect of the former (people will not endorse neutrality as a principle without some assurance that their prior allegiances are not compromised when that principle is actually invoked)’ (p. 121).</p>
<p>This is an important insight into Locke and liberalism. It seems that the ideal of the state’s secular neutrality is based on a rising climate of liberal Christianity. The fascinating question arises of whether liberalism continues to need its liberal religious basis. On an empirical level this seems to be the case: a fully secular liberalism evidently alienates religious conservatives. Perhaps liberalism should be understood as a religious tradition disguised as a rational political one. Can such a tradition, which naturally forgets its underlying nature, work?</p>
<p>But Perry seems uninterested in this area: instead he places himself with those who ‘make the turn to loyalty … [They] perceive that Locke’s harmonization [of loyalties] was unstable. They thus set out to reimagine political theology and political theory afresh so as to reestablish the harmonization of loyalties that make [<italic>sic</italic>] abstract respect possible’ (p. 206). This feels disappointing in the light of the discussion about Locke’s daringly theological harmonization of liberal faith and modern politics. Perry seems wary of what he finds in Locke, and retreats into currently dominant assumptions.</p>

<p>The enlargement of the European Union since 2004 to include ten formerly communist states (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania) has not only been of great political significance but also of major religious interest, given the generally anti-religious policies of the pre-1990 regimes. The authors of this timely, well-researched and well-documented study ask, in their own words, ‘What are the broad patterns of church–state relations in these countries? How did these models grow historically, how were they reshaped by communist policies, and how have they evolved in the pre-accession stage? How significantly different are these models from church–state relations in established Western democracies?’ (p. 11). Each of the ten countries is examined in turn, looking at what changes (if any) have occurred in the actual constitutional arrangements of church and state, relations between the churches and political processes, and indicators such as the teaching of religion in schools and public debates on issues such as sexuality, abortion and euthanasia. The result is an informative and salutary reminder of just how diverse the church–state situations of Europe are, in ‘east’ no less than ‘west’. For that reason alone this work should repay study in Britain where too often the debate polarizes into a false choice between diehard traditionalist defence of ‘establishment’ and desire for a purely ‘secular state’. Europe abounds in possible models.</p>
<p>The degree of secularization (in terms of identified church allegiance) varies enormously between the extremes of, on the one hand, strongly Catholic Poland and (largely) Orthodox Romania and, on the other hand, Estonia and the Czech Republic where all churches are minorities in a largely ‘post-Christian’ population. But most important in this study is the interplay revealed between continuity and change in formal church–state relations since 1989–90. In some countries the basic legislative framework remains largely the same as in the communist period (though of course now in very different hands), which in some cases was in turn essentially inherited from still earlier times. In some instances the relationships, both between government and churches and between the churches have been solved relatively well (as in Estonia, apart from an intra-Orthodox dispute). In others (Bulgaria, for instance) they remain problematic, especially for minority faith communities. Oddly, given their Romanian background, the authors’ treatment of the Hungarian Reformed Church of Transylvania and its role in the 1989 revolution is meagre. But the delicate situation at the EU level is recognized. The EU has studiously and rightly avoided any attempt at general legislation concerning churches or religion, this remaining within the domain of each member state. But this leaves ambiguous the situation of minority faith <italic>communities</italic> as distinct from persons whose individual rights of conscience can be addressed by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, some surprisingly slack editing (for such an eminent publisher) has resulted in a reference to a previously unheard of ‘freedom of consciousness’ (p. 135), not to mention the process of ‘ascension’(!) to the EU (p. xi). Such infelicities should not, however, detract from the value of this study.</p>

<p>This is an immensely practical guide to making Church appointments. While many of its assumptions have obvious roots in the Church of England and its primary focus is on the appointment of new parish priests or local ministers, its application is much wider than this. The authors map and discuss every stage in an appointment process, from the time that a vacancy arises to the point at which it is filled. This process will continue post-appointment. By then, it has become the unfolding narrative of the local church and its minister, and space is left in the blank pages of a final chapter for this story to be recorded.</p>
<p>If the book were simply an instruction manual for search committees, interview panels and senior clergy with responsibility for filling vacancies, it would be a good example of that genre. But it is much more. The authors’ long experience of coaching and involvement in church selection procedures gives them a depth of insight into the motivations of those entrusted with new appointments. It also makes them aware that many committees are not equipped for the tasks that lie ahead of them. Hence their care in describing the kinds of conversations that should precede any attempt to draw up a parish profile or its equivalent, and their insistence on clarifying the essential features to be included in role descriptions and synopses of local situations. Many clergy who have been candidates for posts will rejoice to see the thoughtful suggestion that the floor plan and measurements of the housing attached to the job be included in the application pack. The advice about wording advertisements bears close reading.</p>
<p>The guidance on shortlisting and interviewing is an excellent demonstration of the marriage of administrative efficiency and intuition. Merely getting the process right is not enough. The formulation of questions, the provision of food that can be eaten in the course of conversation at an interview, and the need to be attentive when one candidate appears to meet all the criteria but the instinct of the panel is that an apparently less compatible candidate is the person best suited to lead them on the next phase of their journey all receive honest treatment. There is material here for candidates themselves, particularly in a culture where illustration from personal experience will certainly be required at an interview.</p>
<p>Some useful tables and flow charts provide checklists of tasks to be completed as the appointment process advances. It is disappointing that typesetting constraints have prevented them from being more impressively presented. Appointing committees would be well advised to photocopy them in large format. The text itself is attractively conversational, though grammatical purists will wince frequently. Archdeacons and other senior local clergy should hold multiple copies of this book for lending to parishes and churches and even church school governors faced with filling a vacancy.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity I will refer to these works as <italic>Journey</italic> and <italic>Confirmation</italic> respectively. Both are about Christian initiation but their purposes are very different. <italic>Journey</italic> is a collection of essays that focus on the history, ecclesiology and theological connections between baptism, confirmation and the Eucharist in Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox and Protestant churches. The background is the broad measure of mutual recognition of one another’s baptismal practice by these churches. Brief historical surveys are used to understand the role of confirmation when it is seen more broadly than as just the gateway to eucharistic participation. The ecumenical purpose is to encourage the notion that agreement between churches is likely to be more far reaching if we start from the base of our mutually agreed mission and the wide level of existing mutual recognition of one another’s baptism, than if we start with issues that more obviously divide us, such as the recognition of orders and eucharistic fellowship. <italic>Confirmation</italic> is exactly what it says on the cover – ‘The Confirmation and Discipleship Handbook’ – but I think it is also potentially much more than that. Written by a very effective partnership of a distinguished practical theologian and a highly gifted adult education practitioner it sets out a programme of ten sessions for confirmation preparation for adults and young people. The chapters of <italic>Confirmation</italic> are based on the main parts of the Eucharist. Each contains a masterly theological reflection mini essay on specific parts of the Eucharist, and a session outline that can be adapted for local use. <italic>Journey</italic> is written by distinguished people who are masters of their art of theological writing and ecumenical conversation. <italic>Confirmation</italic> is a well-earthed mini masterpiece of practical theology that is specifically intended to resource people directly engaged in ministries of Christian initiation and the discipling of new Christians.</p>
<p>It is increasingly common practice at the start of the twenty-first century for people to be welcomed to full eucharistic participation on the basis that they have come to Christ in their baptism. Young people and adults show that they have begun to appropriate their baptism for themselves so they are welcome to the Eucharist along with everybody else. The lived policy is what Paul Avis describes as BACSI – Baptism as Complete Sacramental Initiation. In this context confirmation becomes what the cliché says – ‘a rite in search of a meaning’. Through the use of historical survey and reference to ecumenical agreed statements <italic>Journey</italic> proposes that Christian initiation should be seen as a process or a pilgrimage that starts with baptism, may include confirmation, and is completed in eucharistic participation. The individual survey essays are well written and easy to follow in spite of overextensive footnoting. The two essays by Martin Davie ‘Baptism and confirmation – from the New Testament to the Reformation’ and ‘Confirmation and Christian Unity’ are characteristically well researched, lucid and practical. Harriet Harris – <italic>‘</italic>Baptism and the journey of Christian initiation’ combines attention to theology, spirituality and discipleship very effectively. The pastoral dimension referred to in the book title is provided by Bishops Christopher Hill and Stephen Platten. They read like pieces produced out of well-considered experience by overbusy bishops. The first words of Bishop John Hind’s Foreword to <italic>Journey</italic> describes the book as ‘the swansong of FOAG – the Faith and Order Advisory Group’ and that’s what it reads like, I’m afraid – the last gasp of a committee. The individual pieces are fine, but there is a great deal of repetition between them. While reading these chapters I found myself occasionally grunting general assent. Only Harriet Harris’s essay in this book comes close to inspiring further reflection for me.</p>
<p>By contrast I found myself wanting to argue with almost every chapter of <italic>Confirmation</italic> – not out of irritation but because Robin Greenwood’s theological reflections and Sue Hart’s session outline’s sparked off thoughts and questions about theology, process and content in relation to Christian catechesis. <italic>Journey</italic> was written to share more widely the writers’ findings from their ministry with confirmation candidates and with other new Christians in their parish of St Mary Monkseaton, Whitley Bay – not far from Newcastle on Tyne. Hailing from the North East myself I had a wry smile at the thought of good practical theology coming out of Whitley Bay – but that is exactly the point. The purpose of Christian theology and spirituality is that it is to be lived by people who long to see the glory of God revealed in ordinary places. From the beginning Greenwood invites the reader to take what they have written, reflect on it and adapt it. Passionate commitment runs right through <italic>Confirmation</italic> from the opening page, ‘Christian communities need to be joyfully and seriously lit up … The baptised, gathered around Christ, flourish when worship and learning is how we do church together’ – to the last, ‘March towards the splendour. Your God goes with you. (from a wall in the monastery of Lluc, Majorca).’</p>
<p>Greenwood and Hart would be entirely content with the idea commended by Paul Avis and his colleagues of Christian initiation as a journey from baptism to Eucharist. The eucharistic focus of both books arises from the catholic tradition backgrounds of most of the writers. Eucharist gives shape to authentic Christian discipleship, witness and worship. But as <italic>Confirmation</italic> illustrates very clearly, eucharistic celebration leads to being sent out to ‘live and work to your praise and glory’. Eucharist is not the final destination of the journey of Christian initiation. Lives lit up with the glory of God are. Maybe that’s why ecumenical enterprises that have focused so closely on establishing agreement between churches about penultimate issues are proving so profoundly unsatisfactory to many of those of us who minister in local churches.</p>

<p>The title, somewhat coyly perhaps, hides the fact that this is a book of sermons. It’s easy to imagine why. Sermons are generally better heard and experienced than read. But Barbara Brown Taylor weaves the most beautiful and affecting written texts and, reading them, you could indeed almost be there. This is the kind of skilful writing that can move you to laughter or tears, and produce that lump in the throat or the catch of the breath that’s a sign of really good and powerful preaching. This is a book filled with memorable and beautiful pieces, small enough to read before sleep or on waking, and powerful enough to stir the stoniest of hearts.</p>
<p>These are pieces written for congregations of people who are living the kinds of lives that we all recognize and these reflections are addressed to all of us. They speak with a pastoral directness that typifies the kind of preaching that Harry Emerson Fosdick advocated. They also bring the biblical stories alive with a power that Dreamworks would envy. And behind these readily accessible and vivid pieces lies deep and engaged biblical scholarship. These sermons are what the best sermons should be; rooted in the Bible, shaped out of research and prayer, and addressed to the realities that grip all of us.</p>
<p>The sermon on Job, ‘Out of the Whirlwind’ (pp. 64–9), takes us through the whole story of Job in a way that is unfailingly vivid, profound and original, leaving us with a message that God prefers devout defiance to polite piety. The sermon on the story of Naaman, ‘The Cheap Cure’ (pp. 157–63), tells the story so powerfully (and takes time to do it) that you find yourself looking at your own skin to see how it looks. In a time when few people know the Bible as intimately as we think we should, these sermons really do bring it home.</p>
<p>But perhaps most telling is the way that Barbara Brown Taylor can connect these stories so powerfully to the experiences any of us might be going through. There is a real sense that these stories are ours, and we’re part of them, and telling them makes a difference to us. She tells the story of Mary and the annunciation and then says, ‘If there are any big changes going on with you right now – if something is under way you cannot predict the end of, and your stomach is rolling with your own version of morning sickness – then you might try following Mary’s lead. Who knows? … Maybe that shadow hanging over you is the power of the most High’ (p. 18).</p>
<p>Some preachers are great at bringing the Bible to life. Some are theologically profound. Some are deeply pastoral and speak directly to people’s lives. Barbara Brown Taylor seems to do it all. I began to read looking for tips for my preaching. But I found myself deeply moved and simply engaged with Scripture and faith in life-changing ways.</p>

<p><italic>Making Sense in Religious Studies</italic> is a valuable companion to anyone embarking upon, or struggling with, a religious studies degree. The book forms part of a series of study guides designed to offer students with up-to-date, detailed information on how to navigate successfully their way through various degrees. The book is written in a clear, accessible style and breaks down the complex tasks of research and writing into manageable steps. While the book can be read front to back, the chapters stand alone and can be consulted separately as needed. It also contains sample assignments that allow the reader to see what the advice looks like in practice.</p>
<p>As the foreword indicates, <italic>Making Sense in Religious Studies</italic> aims to offer guidance stretching from where to sit in lectures to how to write with style, from how to locate resources to how to give an oral presentation. In addition to general advice relevant to students of all arts degrees, the book also contains advice specific to the field of religious studies. In some cases, whole chapters are given over to areas vital to the subject, such as doing comparative research, reading religious texts and learning foreign languages and, in others, general advice tailored to the subject. Throughout, the editors remain aware of the diverse nature of religious studies degrees, taking examples from a range of topics and giving specific advice on how to approach more unusual, but increasingly common tasks, such as reviewing films.</p>
<p>The book not only outlines the necessary skills and practices necessary to achieve success with a religious studies degree but also largely avoids the common pitfall of many study guides, namely, reducing learning to hoop jumping and underplaying the importance of genuine engagement. In contrast to study guides that trivialize learning as a means to exam success, <italic>Making Sense in Religious Studies</italic> situates an exploration of effective study skills in a discussion about the nature of genuine study. The authors stress the importance of becoming an engaged learner and that real success depends on approaching research and writing from a ‘being’ mode of study, which involves flexible and creative thought. This is particularly relevant to religious studies, considering the emphasis many religious traditions place on learning as a way of life and religious devotion.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Making Sense in Religious Studies</italic> avoids the most common pitfall of study guides there are some minor disappointments. First, while the book does cover how to locate resources and how to read religious texts, its emphasis is upon writing. Chapters on how to engage with and critique other types of text would have been useful. Second, although the book would be particularly valuable for distance or part-time learners of religious studies, it only fleetingly addresses their specific needs. Last, while <italic>Making Sense in Religious Studies</italic> acknowledges that some religious studies degrees comprise a theology component, it does not properly explain how theology papers or modules may need to be approached differently.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Making Sense in Religious Studies</italic> is a boon for any student of religious studies. It untangles the processes of research and writing and encourages a methodological yet engaged approach to study.</p>

<p>There seems to be no escape from strident atheists these days and, although the theists fight back, few have really grappled with the logic to point to the existence and nature of God as the source of morality. Baggett and Walls are to be commended for this complex but rigorous excursion into the philosophical arguments that expose the weaknesses of attacks on religious ethics.</p>
<p>Their primary purpose is to establish that the widespread belief in something called morality points convincingly to the existence of God, and why claims to morality without God founder. Secondly, they argue that the God to whom their account of morality points is indeed the God of the Christian Gospels – and an Arminian rather than a Calvinist God to boot. The double purpose is valuable because logical explorations of the existence or otherwise of God too often evacuate the deity of any personality and turn him into a cipher. The problem with this approach is, paradoxically, picked up in the book’s conclusion, where the authors discuss the problem of transposition but don’t apply it to their own project. In taking on the atheists on their own, analytical, terms, considerations of the character of God can only go so far before losing engagement with the interlocutor, since the atheist has problems seeing beyond propositional truth. Conversely, where the authors, confessing their own religious commitments, move onto matters of eternity and ethics, which only make sense from within a theistic belief structure, the result is theologically more satisfying but feels preachy compared to earlier chapters.</p>
<p>The book’s value depends on its intended readership. The introduction led me to believe it was intended as a rebuttal of militant atheism, perhaps for those influenced by Dawkins and Co. But, assuming such people might read it, the style seemed inappropriate. The case builds up inexorably, mostly through discussion of different philosophers and the conflicts and tensions between their arguments. There is none of the sheer panache which makes one suspect sometimes that the atheists are having more fun than the religious. The writing comes more to life in the later chapters, which explore the nature of morality in the light of the Christian God, but here the style is more partial than an uncommitted reader, let alone an antagonist, would countenance.</p>
<p>I suspect the book is really for the philosophically alert Christian seeking reassurance that the atheists’ logic can be engaged on its own terms and in ways consistent with faith in the God of the Bible. It is reassuring and encouraging to have the arguments rehearsed here, and to make them stick. It is a tougher call to absorb the intricately discussed detail so as to make each argument one’s own. By seeking to hold together the attenuated God of the logicians with the living God of Christianity, the authors have written a book that is tricky to classify and not always easy to read. But it is a book which needed to be written and is well worth grappling with.</p>

<p>Fr. Santhosh Sebastian Cheruvally presents us with an important study of Dom Henri Le Saux <sc>osb</sc> (also known as Abhishiktānanda). Le Saux was a French Benedictine monk who went to India in 1948 with the primary goal of launching a Benedictine monastic endeavour adapted to Hindu monasticism. Bede Griffiths followed in his footsteps and together their writings have opened up a profound exchange between Catholic Christianity and Hindu Advaita Vedanta. While this books deals with many things Roman Catholic, it will be of enormous interest to an ecumenical audience. Cheruvally’s study focuses on Le Saux’s Christologies and critically assesses them in the light of the magisterial teachings of the Catholic Church. I recommend this book for five reasons.</p>
<p>First, it brings together the writings of Le Saux and presents the organic development of his Christology in the context of his experience and influences in India. Second, Cheruvally sets up an important hermeneutical bridge between indigenous theologies (a form of local Church) with the great traditions of the universal Church. This bridge is vital to the health and future of the Church not only in India but also world-wide as it sets roots in God’s soil in nations everywhere. Finding whether the bridge is stable is tested by the teachings of Vatican II and the ongoing Catholic magisterium of the Church regarding the unicity of Christ in relation to other religions. Third, Cheruvally applies these teachings to establish whether Le Saux’s Christologies are healthy and nourishing. This task is undertaken with diligence. Fourth, Cheruvally’s answer to this question of Christological orthodoxy is nuanced and searching. He recognizes in Le Saux’s corpus two differing Christologies, one insightfully and sophisticatedly nourished from Le Saux’s deep readings in Advaita Vedanta and his own mystical and ascetical practices. In this Christology there is a taking up of the profound teaching of ‘Saccidananda’ (the Hindu ‘name’ of the divine) and seeing in it a path that leads to Christ that both affirms and transforms this deep Vedantic teaching. This Christology is a remarkable inculturation and shows what Christian theology might achieve in dialogue with Hindus and their rich traditions.</p>
<p>The second form of Christology is nourished by Le Saux’s own learning from his Advaitin masters and from his later mystical experiences. Here Le Saux makes Christ a cipher for what is attainable in all men and women; their contact with the inner divinity that is present within the ‘self’. In doing this he downplays the historical and particular, the scandal of Jesus Christ, which has been a tendency in some theology of religions. Cheruvally argues that this Christology lacks the marks of authentic representation of the truth of Christ as taught in the Church’s traditions.</p>
<p>This is a case-study to show the dynamics of inculturation as applied to Christology, which will be helpful to all interested in these questions, not only in India but also everywhere that the Church is planted and grows.</p>

<p>This book sets out with the admirable intention of assessing the theological challenge that other religions make to Catholic faith. As a ‘phenomenological account’ it contains some useful surveys. Christian Troll’s assured introduction to Islam is shot through with scholarly wisdom. Martin Ganeri manages to encapsulate the luxuriant growth of Hinduism into something both manageable and clear. Paul Williams’s introduction to Buddhism is solid, reliable and carefully nuanced. Stratford Caldecott offers a thought-provoking essay on the ‘New Age Movement’ – an unexpected contribution in a volume on ‘World Religions’ but valuable for the clarity of its exposition.</p>
<p>As a ‘theological account’ (p. 19) the book is less successful. Gavin D’Costa attends to key texts, most importantly <italic>Lumen Gentium,</italic> Vatican II’s Constitution on the Church. He makes the point that nowhere did the council make any statement about the ‘theological status’ of other religions. He is right to be cautious; a frothy inclusivism is as unhelpful as a lazy pluralism. But to stop here is to sell the council short. <italic>Nostra Aetate</italic> (<italic>NA</italic>)<italic>,</italic> the council’s ground-breaking declaration on relations with other religions, calls on Christians to ‘acknowledge, preserve and encourage’ the spiritual truths and values found among other religions (<italic>NA</italic> 2). While the declaration never presumes to speculate about what such ‘spiritual and moral truths’ might be, the implication is clear: the Church is called to learn how the Spirit may be at work and how ‘through conversations and collaboration’ Christians and other people of faith can be drawn together into a deeper understanding of the word that God speaks to humankind. On this point it may well be that the council’s other great dogmatic constitution, on revelation, which makes only minimal appearance in this book, has important guidance to offer.</p>
<p>D’Costa’s comment that <italic>Nostra Aetate</italic> is a ‘phenomenological commentary’ (p. 15) on <italic>Lumen Gentium</italic> not only ignores the significance of the recovery of the scriptural basis of Christian faith but underestimates the impact which the declaration has had not just on Jewish-Christian relations but on interreligious relations <italic>as a whole</italic>. In this regard Roy Schoeman’s essay on Judaism is a major let-down. In his eagerness to reaffirm a Catholic mission to the Jews, Schoeman makes paltry reference to the wealth of theological debate and official Church commentary, especially from Pope John Paul II, which <italic>Nostra Aetate</italic> has provoked. Whether we like it or not, the key conciliar insight, that Judaism is a living tradition from which the Church ‘draws nourishment’ means that an interreligious element is built into the very foundations of Christian faith.</p>
<p>This book contains principles which need to be respected if theology is to avoid a naïve endorsement of all things religious. There are also a few examples – most obviously Ganeri on <italic>Vedanta</italic> and <italic>Bhakti</italic> – which show how dialogue can be honest and informative. Missing, however, is much sign of what Barth memorably referred to as the ‘Catholic and’. He was, of course, referring to the subtleties that surround the Nature–Grace debate. But the point can be extended to the wider reaches of Catholic living and culture. At its best Catholicism involves dogmatic teaching <italic>and</italic> spiritual vision, faithfulness to tradition <italic>and</italic> imaginative reflection on the gracious ways of God. Much of this book is disappointingly one sided.</p>

<p>Laura Hartman begins from the dilemma I suspect many of us share: wondering how to shop ethically when in a supermarket. Some of us, of course, simply don’t use supermarkets. Some of my rural neighbours are about as free from consumerist attitudes as it is possible to be, though the ones I have in mind are not Christian. The author wishes to help Christians think about the problem. She proposes four criteria: avoiding sin, embracing creation, loving the neighbour and envisioning the future. A chapter is dedicated to each of these and Christian examples are given for each. Francis of Assisi, John Woolman and Richard Sider illustrate the first. Sider’s well-known book (<italic>Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger</italic>) urges that to the extent that we neglect the imperative to redistribute we sin, and the author agrees. Clement of Alexandria, Thomas Aquinas and Matthew Fox illustrate the importance of embracing creation, and the author finds a grain of truth in prosperity theology, and in the defence of middle-class hedonism by John Schneider. The point is that one of the criteria by which we choose must be to value creation. One of the key voices in the book is Wendell Berry’s, and the author cites his comment that our culture is not nearly materialist enough: the way we treat things and dispose of them shows that we do not care for creation enough. Dorothy Day above all exemplifies the command to love the neighbour: she enjoyed sharing good coffee and good bread with the very poor. Hartman argues (and I agree) that the word ‘love’ apply not only to near and even distant neighbours but also to the planet. Love means responsibility, and we have a responsibility which embraces both the planet and future generations, and this has to determine our choices. The final criterion derives from eschatology, which the author understands primarily through Sabbath keeping, and primarily through authors like Wendell Berry, Ched Myers and Norman Wirzba. Sabbath keeping means trusting God’s provision and this can lead to altered patterns of consumption. Hartmann goes on to consider the Eucharist as part of the education of our desire. A final chapter reflects on the way a contemporary Reformed theologian, a Methodist and an Orthodox theologian all interweave these four criteria in their choices. Unlike some of the books she cites (Sider, for example) this book is not a ‘call to discipleship’, and Hartmann is much more generous to the prosperity gospel preachers and people like Schneider than I would be inclined to be, but its ruminative style nevertheless does compel us to think what we are doing as consumers if we are unable to radically free ourselves from the market. I don’t quite find ‘the world otherwise’ here as Ton Veerkamp puts it (Ton Veerkamp, <italic>Die Welt anders</italic>, Argument: Berlin, 2012) but there is, as the author intends, food for reflection for Christian congregations.</p>

<p>Philip Clayton is well known for his writings on the relation of science and religion: the magisterial <italic>Oxford Handbook</italic> has left students of the subject in his debt. Whereas the <italic>Handbook</italic> surveyed the topic in the broadest way possible, <italic>The Predicament of Belief</italic> concentrates on a particular approach. Clayton and Knapp find the questions posed by modernity compelling and attempt to set out a Christian response that takes utterly seriously the philosophical assumptions of scientific modernism. Thus they see themselves as part of the response to the wave of writing by the so-called ‘New Atheists’, although their discussion is far more philosophically rigorous than that of most of their opponents.</p>
<p>The main strength of the book is the way in which it unflinchingly faces the ‘Reasons for doubt’ – the title of the first chapter. For Clayton and Knapp the most important of these are whether the ‘Ultimate reality’ can be conceived in a theistic or personal sense: is the concept of ‘God’ coherent? In successive chapters they discuss the problem of divine action and the scandal of particularity. They provide a subtle reworking of the Deist view that God may create but that, if God is to be regarded as either loving or just, God may not ‘intervene’ in the ongoing travails of the universe. This eases the question of divine action, only to transfer the sharpest of the difficulties onto incarnation. Thus the authors face the problem of trying to retain enough links with traditional Christian faith while at the same time denying the possibility of God’s action in the world. Their convoluted attempts to resolve this crucial issue serve to demonstrate just how little room for manoeuvre the wholehearted adoption of scientific modernism leaves for theology. In a way that seems reminiscent of Bultmann and the programme of <italic>demythologization</italic>, the authors opt for ‘Christian minimalism’: how little must we retain to remain Christian?</p>
<p>A secondary theme of the book is to develop a structure of belief, setting out a series of levels: from what the ‘Relevant Community of Experts’ can confidently be expected to believe, through beliefs that might be controversial but seem endorsed by personal experience, to that which it is hoped may be true, to – finally – ‘beliefs’ which the believers knows are not true but finds metaphorically helpful, as perhaps in liturgy or drama.</p>
<p>A. N. Whitehead spoke of Christianity as ‘a religion in search of a metaphysic’. Clayton and Knapp choose to find that metaphysic in scientific modernism. Their approach is rigorous and consistent, but makes little attempt to engage the postmodernist dissatisfaction with the totalitarian claims of modernism. There is today considerable doubt whether the deliberate limitations of scientific modernism, developed in the nineteenth century to help the sciences progress in their own limited fields, can be extended into the all-encompassing philosophy with which Clayton and Knapp are in dialogue here. They present an intriguing attempt to find a new, minimalist, way forward, but like many previous such attempts it is likely to be rejected by both modernists (why bother with belief at all?) and many Christians (can the essence of Christian faith be recognized here?).</p>

<p>Many works exploring popular culture and religion forge too easy alliances between the two phenomena, according to which already known beliefs are located within popular culture, or its functions are identified as new forms of implicit religion. In the case of popular music, lyrics are brought to the fore, even though popular music may be recognized not to work primarily through lyrics but first of all through sound and the emotional response of the listener. Much more satisfying are those works which pay close attention to what popular culture is achieving, and how, using many disciplines and perspectives to do so, religion (and even theology) being reshaped, and its content mutating as a result of the interaction. This collection comes into the ‘satisfying’ camp, even if it does not go very far in clarifying how the content of Christian belief or theology might be affected by how influential the rock band U2 have become around the world. It assesses, from a number of angles, why U2 are so popular, what the band is about, what their influences are, and how their music and lyrics might be interpreted and are being used.</p>
<p>Deriving from the first academic conference (in 2009) to explore U2’s work, the book contains sixteen of the papers delivered, together with a foreword by the rock music critic Anthony De Curtis and an introduction and select U2 bibliography provided by the editor. There are essays about U2’s origins (Neil McCormick), the educational impact of their political commitments (Rachel Seiler), the vocal complexity of particular recordings (Christopher Endrinal), U2 as a marketing phenomenon (Michele O’Brien), and their use of language (Bruce L. Edwards on political rhetoric, and John Hurtgen on ‘antilanguage’). Of these, coming from a teenage friend of the band, McCormick’s is especially powerful, even moving. It includes a reflection on the profound impact of four secondary school teachers on the band-members which would give hope to any exhausted, overburdened teacher.</p>
<p>Beyond these, an essay of particular note is Beth Maynard’s analysis of U2 in live performance, through the lens of ‘leitourgia’, used in its Greek form to retain the sense of a public gathering arranged to serve the people. Though the participation and impact experienced at U2 concerts may seem like (and for some Christian fans function as) a worship service, the privatization – and sheer lack of publicness – of what we now know as liturgy is of concern to Maynard. Yet U2 concerts may, in fact, enable deep theological encounters to begin in a way that forms of Christian worship may not. Stephen Catanzarite’s piece on U2’s conservatism is surprising, even something of a shock, yet strangely reassuring. It goes some way to explaining why U2 has survived as a band for so long, been able to ‘speak’ to different generations and, while dabbling in some of the excesses of the rock music world, has never quite succumbed to it, or been submerged within it.</p>
<p>And what of the point of reviewing a book like this in <italic>Theology</italic>? An adaptation of a quote from Deane Galbraith’s chapter on U2’s use of angel imagery in their work perhaps sums things up: ‘U2’s music is not simply an assimilation of … orthodox Christian doctrine but is also poking and prodding at the very limitations of orthodoxy’s construction’ (p. 188). Indeed! This collection is not simply a collection of theological pieces, and its use and importance for theological thinking is sometimes circuitous and oblique. But it is also evidence of the kind of wrestling which Christian preachers, teachers, youth workers, lay workers and theologians need to do not simply with the quest for ‘relevance’ but with respect to the fact that theology (words about God which grasp, however inadequately, something of what God is doing in the world, including sometimes in the Church) needs to remain sharp and not ecclesiastically captive.</p>
