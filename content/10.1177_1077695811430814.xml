<p>Take any-sized American tragedy or crime in any town large or small, and what you are left with are stories of sadness and heartbreak. From the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the Oklahoma City bombings, shootings, and everything in between, these news events leave behind scars on communities and the families that are impacted.</p>
<p>Media descend on these crime scenes hoping to be the first to “break the news” and share what they know—not just through traditional media but, more often, using the new kids on the block of Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. And in their collective and frenzied scramble for the facts, they are also looking for the faces. Regardless of the medium—be it print, broadcast, or the Web—reporters believe that victims will tell the best stories. They seek out victims who can give voice to what happened on the day of the incident or in the days, weeks, months, and even years that follow. While the victim’s pain may fluctuate and be of varying degrees, one may wonder the personal costs should they share their story with mass media and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>In her new book, <italic>Second Wounds: Victims’ Rights and the Media in the U.S.</italic>, Carrie A. Rentschler examines what victims experience following crimes and what rights victims possess following these crimes. Beginning with the roots of the victims’ rights movement of the 1960s, Rentschler explains the concept of secondary victimization—those indirectly touched by tragedy, such as families of death-row inmates.</p>
<p>For journalism, media, and communication faculty, <italic>Second Wounds</italic> provides a solid resource for better explaining and examining what victims experience when interacting with media following a crime or tragedy. Oftentimes undergraduate students are taught and schooled how to conduct interviews and gather facts to produce the news. However, universities and programs across the country do not always focus on interacting with victims who find themselves in particularly fragile and emotional states. Far too often, reporters, and those studying to become reporters, expend their energy and skills on simply “getting” the story.</p>
<p>Rentschler examines a number of programs and resources on the topic of victim interviews. She points to a variety of interviews with scholars and specialists on victims’ experience with news media. One, in particular, sums up the dilemma when reporters cover tragedy and search for sound bites. A twenty-six-minute training video, produced in 1999 by the Victims’ Assistance Legal Organization for the National Victim Assistance Academy, opens with footage from the deadly shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado. Rentschler points out that news media in the film are depicted as aggressive and damaging to victims, all the while attempting to meet audience demand for crime news as the story breaks and evolves. In the film, journalism professor Greg Luft expands upon the problem with aggressive reporters who seek out victims: they search for these sources to “feed the beast” of breaking news.</p>
<p>In another example, Rentschler dissects the booklet <italic>Crime Victims and the Media</italic>, produced by the National Center for Victims and Crime. It points to a series of instances where repeated communication between reporters and victims actually exacerbates old wounds, leaving behind individuals and families who are more wounded than before. Rentschler points to one example in which a TV news broadcast showed footage of a medical examiner cradling the skull of a victim. And while the victim’s family avoided the on-air coverage, they were forever haunted with the eternal possibility of seeing such horrific images.</p>
<p><italic>Second Wounds</italic> offers students and scholars alike much to consider with regard to victims of crime in America today. The book was born from Rentschler’s dissertation, <italic>Crime Victims and U.S. Public Culture</italic>, but also, somewhat unknowingly, from her freshman year at the University of Minnesota. The year was 1989, and Rentschler and a sizable number of women across the country became outraged by the killing of fourteen female engineering students in Montreal, Quebec. She was active in the political movements that followed and, a year later, enrolled in peer counseling training at the Sexual Violence Program.</p>
