<p>Physicians have the privilege to observe the magnificence and the fragility of both the human body and the human condition. A doctor’s memory is a catalog of the misery and miracles of humanity written in tropes of scientific argot. <italic>The Art of Medicine</italic> offers a cross-cultural glimpse into this world with hundreds of pictures spanning over 2000 years of history.</p>
<p>The book represents a small fraction of London’s famous Wellcome Collection, which consists of books, art, and artifacts revolving around medicine and its role in society. <italic>The Art of Medicine</italic> is divided into 6 chapters extending from anatomy to mental illness to prevention. Each section juxtaposes images from various cultures and epochs drawn from medical texts, ancient carvings, sculpture, medical imaging, and propaganda posters. Illustrations ranging from the comic to the grotesque tell stories of suffering, healing, and scientific curiosity. The pictures are faithfully reproduced and accompanied by informative captions.</p>
<p>The text is succinct and provides a historical framework within which the subject of the accompanying artwork can be understood. There is virtually no commentary on the art itself, allowing the reader to create his or her own narrative regarding the connection between flanking illustrative panels. The book is more of a collection of curiosities than a historical text or an anthology of art. While it is wonderful to browse, its lack of a linear story arc makes it cumbersome to read from cover to cover.</p>
<p>Some of the most beautiful pictures are excerpts from medical texts or stylized scientific images. These draw attention to the inherent splendor of biology itself, even when detached from the surrounding drama of human experience. Considering these anatomic representations within the context of human frailty only magnifies their arresting aesthetic appeal.</p>
<p>The chapters exploring disease and healing are pulled from a wide gamut of artistic and medical sources and portray doctors, patients, and illness itself through human and objective lenses (quite literally in the case of several micrographs). These works highlight the dual nature of medicine as an impersonal science and an art of human compassion. Illustrations of frightened and often distrusting patients undergoing amputation or blood-letting are not merely reminders of a more horrific past but demonstrations of the terror and vulnerability that can overcome anyone afflicted by disease.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Art of Medicine</italic> is a splendid and eclectic, graphic journey through the history of the medical humanities. It is certain to spark conversation if left on the coffee-table and likely to be appreciated by any physician or lover of art.</p>
