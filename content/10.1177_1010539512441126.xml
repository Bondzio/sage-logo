<p>Emeritus Professor Mark Liveris was educated at Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia, where he completed his PhD in organic chemistry. His parents migrated to Australia from the small Greek island of Castellorizo, and migrants from this island have been a great source of strength to the Australian medical, dental, and other professions. His early career (1960-1970) was in teaching and research, the latter including postdoctoral research as a fellow with the National Research Council of Canada. At the Western Australian Institute of Technology, now Curtin University, he was in turn inaugural Head of the Department of Chemistry (1967-1969), Assistant Director (Applied Science; 1969-1974), and Foundation Dean and Deputy Vice Chancellor of Health Sciences (1974-1986).</p>
<p>After 7 years of developing science education at Curtin University, particularly in chemistry, Prof Liveris was invited to establish the Division (now Faculty) of Health Sciences. During his appointment Professor Liveris used his knowledge, experience, skills, and extensive network of local, national, and international colleagues to guide the Faculty’s development to its present prominence in the health field. One of his major contributions to Australian health workforce training was his understanding of the roles played by allied health professionals and nurses in the health care system and his recognition of the importance of these roles, particularly in academic teaching, learning, research, and resource allocation.</p>
<p>After establishing Curtin’s Faculty of Health Sciences in 1974, he was appointed to the position of Deputy Vice Chancellor (Health Sciences) in 1987, and he held the prime responsibility for the academic direction and administration of the largest health sciences faculty in Australia. He served on numerous boards and committees and most notably he was Chairman of the Board of Management of Royal Perth Hospital and its Research Foundation, Chairman of the State Health Advisory Network, President of Council of the Cancer Foundation of Western Australia, and President of the Australian Hospital Association.</p>
<p>Honor and awards accorded him included the OBE, WHO Fellow, and Western Australia Citizen of the Year (Professions Category). In 1986, he was appointed a Kellogg International Fellow in Health, the sole Australian among 30 fellows from 18 countries. In 1987, he was invited to serve on the Visiting Board of the University of Colorado’s New Centre for Human Caring. He was a member of the Public Health Research and Development Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council from 1987-1993 and a member of the Council’s Research Strategy Committee for the 1993-1995 Triennium. He was appointed an Honorary Professor at the Beijing Medical University, China with which he has had a long association and Clinical Professor, School of Public Health, University of Hawaii, USA.</p>
<p>Professor Liveris was President of the Asia-Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) for six years (1995 to 2001). He served on the APACPH Council for many years and mentored many health professionals from our region. He was awarded the APACPH Public Health Recognition Award on 15 December 1992.</p>
<p>Professor Liveris was a dedicated educator who sought to improve health and well-being throughout our region. Mark died on 19 December, 2011 after a long battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife Leonie and three children. He will be greatly missed by all of his colleagues in APACPH.</p>
