<abstract>
<p>A 54-year-old woman was diagnosed with an asymptomatic gastric tumor during routine radiological investigation for staging of breast carcinoma. Subsequent endoscopic biopsy confirmed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Surgical resection of the stomach showed a tumor with 2 distinct components: a superficial lymphoepithelioma-like adenocarcinoma and a deeper submucosal component consistent with immature teratoma. There was lymph node metastasis. The patient is well without any evidence of disease 18 months post surgery.</p>

<body>
<p>Biphasic tumors in the stomach are rare, and most have been reported under the appellation of “carcinosarcoma,” which in all likelihood represent a metaplastic carcinoma with both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components derived from a common progenitor cell showing bivergent differentiation. The recently described gastroblastoma is an unusual but characteristic epitheliomesenchymal tumor composed of a low-grade spindle cell component admixed with a low-grade (even benign) epithelial component in young patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911429941">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911429941">2</xref></sup> Rare examples of biphasic soft tissue sarcomas occurring in the stomach have also been described. A gastric teratoma with an adenocarcinoma arising from the teratomatous epithelial elements has been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911429941">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The case we describe herein is a unique biphasic or collision tumor composed of a gastric lymphoepithelioma-like adenocarcinoma and a primitive neuroepitheliomatous component similar to that encountered in an immature teratoma. We wish to highlight this combination that has not been described previously.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>During staging investigation for ductal carcinoma of the breast, a computed tomography scan revealed a mass in the stomach in a 54-year-old woman. Subsequent biopsy of the gastric mass was reported as a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma; the patient then had a total gastrectomy, lymphadenectomy, and splenectomy.</p>
<p>The patient was disease-free 18 months after gastrectomy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1066896911429941">
<title>Pathologic Findings</title>
<p>Macroscopic examination revealed an exophytic tumor in the posterior wall of the gastric body measuring 5.5 × 2.7 × 1.7 cm. The surface had a villous appearance, and a well-circumscribed nodule measuring 1 cm in greatest dimension was present in the underlying submucosa. In addition, there were 4 small gastric polyps ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.4 cm. Six perigastric lymph nodes were dissected.</p>
<p>Microscopically, the lesion consisted of 2 distinct components: a superficial, largely mucosal-based, component and a separate submucosal nodule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911429941">Figure 1</xref>). The former was composed of invasive glands and solid cords of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and moderately pleomorphic nuclei. There were focal areas with clear cell morphology. There was a prominent admixed lymphocytic infiltrate that was peritumoral and intratumoral in locale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911429941">Figure 2</xref>). There was invasion of the submucosa but not beyond. The adjacent gastric mucosa showed evidence of high-grade dysplasia. The second component was highly cellular and consisted of round to oval cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scanty cytoplasm. There were distinct canals and tubules lined by similar primitive cells resembling neuroectodermal canals seen in the neuroepithelial component of immature teratomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896911429941">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, well-formed, true rosettes were also present. Despite complete sampling of this component, no other germ cell or teratomatous elements were found.</p>

<p>The adjacent gastric mucosa showed a chronic active gastritis with prominent complete intestinal metaplasia. <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> were not present. The macroscopically noted polyps were small foveolar polyps or adenomas and lacked dysplasia. One of the 6 perigastric lymph nodes was positive for the neuroepitheliomatous (teratomatous) component.</p>
<p>The superficial component showed immunoreactivity for low molecular weight keratin, pancytokeratin, CK19, and focal positivity for CK20. EBER in situ hybridization was negative. Mismatch repair proteins, hMLH1, hMSH2, hMSH6, and PMS2, were retained.</p>
<p>The deeper submucosal nodule was positive for vimentin and focally immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896911429941">Figure 4</xref>) and synaptophysin but negative for CD99, CD56, neurofilament, chromogranin A, all cytokeratins, mismatch repair proteins, desmin, and actin.</p>

<p>In addition, MUC 1, MUC 2, 5AC, and MUC 6 were performed. Only focal MUC 6 immunopositivity was seen in the adenocarcinomatous component. OCT3/4 was also done, but the germ cell component was negative.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The distinct morphological and immunophenotypic features together with the clear demarcation of the 2 components support this lesion being a collision tumor consisting of lymphoepithelioma-like adenocarcinoma and a primitive neuroectodermal component morphologically consistent with an immature, monodermal teratoma. Teratomas with monodermal primitive neuroectodermal differentiation have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911429941">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The differential diagnoses of biphasic neoplasms of the stomach include teratoma, carcinosarcoma, gastroblastoma, and synovial sarcoma.</p>
<p>Gastric teratomas occur more often in infancy and childhood. To the best of our knowledge, there has been only one published case of gastric teratoma with adenocarcinoma in an 83-year-old man.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911429941">3</xref></sup> This case did not show associated gastric mucosal dysplasia seen in the case presented in this report. Their diagnosis of teratoma was based on the presence of a variety of mature and immature tissues including immature neuroepithelial components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911429941">3</xref></sup> The adenocarcinomatous transformation reported by Matsukuma et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911429941">3</xref></sup> was clearly derived from the teratomatous component and was based on the indistinct boundary between the adenocarcinomatous and teratomatous components and by the presence of cytological atypia (dysplasia) of glandular epithelium within the teratoma. In the present case, the 2 components were clearly separated and well demarcated from each other, and the submucosal nodule was composed exclusively of tissue morphologically consistent with primitive neuroepithelium. In addition, the overlying mucosa displayed preinvasive, high-grade dysplasia.</p>
<p>Germ cell neoplasms, such as choriocarcinoma and yolk sac tumor, have been reported to occur in association with gastric adenocarcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911429941">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911429941"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911429941"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911429941">8</xref></sup> Although most extragonadal germ cell neoplasms occur in midline sites and are related to the embryonic migration of germ cells, the occurrence of germ cell neoplasms in association with gastric adenocarcinoma suggests that there may be other histogenetic mechanisms.</p>
<p>Carcinosarcomas have been described in the stomach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911429941">1</xref></sup> and are usually characterized by an intimate admixture of both elements. Although a primitive neuroectodermal component has not been reported in carcinosarcoma of the stomach, it has been described in carcinosarcoma of the uterus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911429941">9</xref></sup> The morphological features of the uterine case were similar to those described in the present case. The primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) component expressed GFAP, synaptophysin, Leu 7, and neuron-specific enolase. Interestingly, the tumor cells were negative for O13 (CD99). These authors suggested that the absence of O13 staining did not necessarily exclude a diagnosis of PNET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911429941">9</xref></sup> In view of this, it is quite conceivable that the undifferentiated primitive component in our case also represents a PNET. We prefer the possibility of an immature neuroepitheliomatous component of a teratoma because of the primitive neurotubules and canals, and the presence of true rosettes. However, this distinction may be merely semantics, as there is overlap between the 2 entities.</p>
<p>Gastroblastoma is a distinctive, biphasic epitheliomesenchymal neoplasm of the stomach occurring in young adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911429941">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911429941">2</xref></sup> This neoplasm is characterized by uniform, mildly atypical spindle cells with admixed clusters of epithelial cells. The spindle cells are immunoreactive for vimentin and CD10 whereas the epithelial cells are cytokeratin positive.Z</p>
<p>Chromosomal analysis by comparative genomic hybridization could possibly reveal information regarding the relationship between the 2 tumors: whether the neuroepitheliomatous component is clonally related to the adenocarcinoma or whether they are in fact unrelated tumors.</p>
<p>We report the clinicopathological features of the first case of a collision tumor of the stomach composed of adenocarcinoma and immature teratoma.</p>
