<abstract>
<p>In the research reported here, we investigated how suspicious nonverbal cues from other people can trigger feelings of physical coldness. There exist implicit standards for how much nonverbal behavioral mimicry is appropriate in various types of social interactions, and individuals may react negatively when interaction partners violate these standards. One such reaction may be feelings of physical coldness. Participants in three studies either were or were not mimicked by an experimenter in various social contexts. In Study 1, participants who interacted with an affiliative experimenter reported feeling colder if they were not mimicked than if they were, and participants who interacted with a task-oriented experimenter reported feeling colder if they were mimicked than if they were not. Studies 2 and 3 demonstrated that it was not the amount of mimicry per se that moderated felt coldness; rather, felt coldness was moderated by the inappropriateness of the mimicry given implicit standards set by individual differences (Study 2) and racial differences (Study 3). Implications for everyday subjective experience are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>In Virgil’s <italic>Aeneid</italic>, Leocoön advised his fellow Trojans to beware of Greeks bearing gifts before they accepted the wooden horse into Troy. Leocoön could not explicitly identify the threat, but he was nevertheless suspicious of the Greeks’ unexpected, yet generous and affiliative, gesture. Other people, too, often rely on such gut feelings to identify potential threats in their social environment: People may feel a sudden chill down their spine or goose bumps on their arms when a person or situation makes them feel uneasy or uncomfortable. However, people may not consciously know why the other person makes them feel that way; the interaction itself can be perfectly polite and mundane, even pleasant—there may just be something “off” about the other person or situation that gives them the chills. In the research reported here, we examined whether such feelings of coldness stem from implicit suspicions that are triggered by other people’s nonverbal behavior.</p>
<p>Nonverbal behaviors are pervasive and often rich with implicit cues about a person. Nonverbal behavioral mimicry, in particular, occurs with little to no conscious awareness yet may take place during 30% or more of any given interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611434535">Chartrand &amp; Bargh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611434535">Lakin &amp; Chartrand, 2003</xref>). However, there exist implicit standards for nonverbal behavior—including how much mimicry should occur during a given social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611434535">Dalton, Chartrand, &amp; Finkel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611434535">Finkel et al., 2006</xref>). Different social situations permit different amounts of mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611434535">Cheng &amp; Chartrand, 2003</xref>), and although mimicry can signal a desire to affiliate and foster feelings of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611434535">Chartrand &amp; van Baaren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611434535">Maddux, Mullen, &amp; Galinsky, 2008</xref>), mimicry is generally more common and appropriate in certain kinds of interactions (e.g., among peers and in-group members) than in others (e.g., among competitors and out-group members; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797611434535">Lanzetta &amp; Englis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797611434535">Yabar, Johnston, Miles, &amp; Peace, 2006</xref>). The fact that mimicry can elicit feelings of disliking and threat if it is applied in an interaction with the wrong person or in the wrong situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611434535">Liu, Vohs, &amp; Smeesters, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797611434535">Stel et al., 2010</xref>) suggests that people’s implicit standards for mimicry often guide their social assessments and reactions.</p>
<p>One such reaction to mimicry may be heightened feelings of physical coldness. Exposure to negatively tinged social cues can nonconsciously invoke diffuse and generalized subjective states in individuals (e.g., an overall negative mood; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611434535">Chartrand, van Baaren, &amp; Bargh, 2006</xref>), and recent work on embodiment has suggested that such feelings can include a sense of physical coldness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611434535">Bargh &amp; Shalev, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611434535">IJzerman &amp; Semin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0956797611434535">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>). If such embodied reactions also occur when interaction partners violate implicit standards for mimicry, then people’s nonconscious reliance on mimicry cues in evaluations of social environments may be greater than previously theorized.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956797611434535">
<title>Implicit Suspicion Embodied as Physical Coldness</title>
<p>The first assessment a perceiver makes of other people is how socially “warm” or “cold” they are—it is a first-pass friend-or-foe assessment that gives the perceiver a sense of whether to be suspicious or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611434535">Asch, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611434535">Cuddy, Fiske, &amp; Glick, 2008</xref>). People assess the trustworthiness of faces faster than they assess any other trait (i.e., after just 100 ms of exposure; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797611434535">Willis, 2006</xref>). However, it is unclear (a) what nonverbal cues perceivers attend to when making assessments of interpersonal warmth or coldness and (b) how perceivers react when those nonverbal cues give them reasons to be suspicious.</p>
<p>We suggest that an inappropriate amount of behavioral mimicry may be an implicit cue to suspicion because it signals that something is “off.” For instance, it may signal social coldness. Given the potential evolutionary significance of detecting possible threats in the social environment, suspicious nonverbal cues may lead people to experience a generalized, diffuse feeling of physical coldness because this feeling would be consistent with related psychological concepts of social threat (e.g., concepts associated with the idioms “icy stares” and “cold receptions”). Indeed, research on embodiment has suggested that people often construe their abstract, social world in concrete, physical terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797611434535">Schubert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797611434535">Williams, Huang, &amp; Bargh, 2009</xref>), such that activating physical coldness may activate social coldness, and vice versa (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797611434535">Williams &amp; Bargh, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In other words, people may literally feel cold in response to social cues. People who are made to feel lonely or socially excluded, for instance, make lower room-temperature estimates than do people who are made to feel socially included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0956797611434535">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>), and briefly experiencing physical coldness significantly increases feelings of loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611434535">Bargh &amp; Shalev, 2012</xref>). The same principle applies to perceptions of social threat: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611434535">Knight and Borden (1979)</xref> found that socially anxious participants who were assigned a public-speaking task subsequently experienced heightened vasoconstriction—a physiological response to threat that is associated with cold skin and goose bumps. Vasoconstriction also occurs when an interaction partner behaves in stereotype-inconsistent ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611434535">Mendes, Blascovich, Hunter, Lickel, &amp; Jost, 2007</xref>), which suggests that perceived violations of social standards for behavior can indeed trigger feelings of coldness.</p>
<p>This type of embodiment appears to be rooted in neurobiology. The gut feeling people get about the trustworthiness of their interaction partners is linked to signals from the insula—the region of the brain that regulates feelings of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611434535">Meyer-Lindenberg, 2008</xref>), physical warmth and coldness, and certain types of behavioral mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611434535">Insel &amp; Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611434535">Lee, Josephs, Dolan, &amp; Critchley, 2006</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611434535">Kang, Williams, Clark, Gray, and Bargh (2010)</xref> found that the same region of the insula (left anterior) was activated by the physical sensation of coldness and by social coldness (in the form of betrayals) in an economic trust game. Given that mimicry is a primitive social behavior that both humans and nonhuman primates engage in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611434535">Chartrand &amp; van Baaren, 2009</xref>), there also may be primitive links between implicit standards for mimicry and tendencies toward suspicion. An overlap among the neural systems for mimicry, trust, and embodied feelings of coldness may facilitate the coactivation or spreading activation that links perceived violations of implicit mimicry standards to physical feelings of coldness.</p>
<p>Note that a basic tenet of our account is that perceivers’ embodied reactions may go beyond direct reflections of the metaphorical warmth or coldness of manifest social cues. Although direct exposure to cold social cues can certainly elicit sensations of physical coldness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797611434535">Williams et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0956797611434535">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>), we suggest that perceivers’ reactions to multiple, often compounding social cues is dynamic and context dependent—interactive as opposed to additive. Implicit standards for nonverbal behavior may change with the situation, which means that mimicry can be appropriate in one moment yet inappropriate in the next. And within a given context, situation-behavior mismatches may signal social coldness. Therefore, it may be more “chilling” to be mimicked than to <italic>not</italic> be mimicked during a socially cold interaction because any mimicry would violate implicit standards for that type of interaction. Not only may such inappropriate mimicry be intrusive and deplete self-regulatory resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611434535">Dalton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611434535">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), but a person’s violation of standards for mimicry could signal that that person is also not going to follow other standards for behavior—a potentially broader threat that can be inferred only from evaluating the underlying behavior in the context of the overarching situation.</p>
<p>Another basic tenet of our account is that violations of implicit mimicry standards should moderate felt coldness, but adherence to those standards should not moderate felt warmth. People react to negative deviations, but they tend not to react much to behaviors that meet their standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797611434535">Skowronski &amp; Carlston, 1987</xref>). It is easier for perceivers to confirm interaction partners’ negative traits and disconfirm their positive traits than to do the reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797611434535">Tausch, Kenworthy, &amp; Hewstone, 2007</xref>), a fact that suggests a perceptual bias toward suspicion. Consistent with the notion that moderate physical warmth is people’s default state, research has shown that experiencing physical warmth does not lower self-reported feelings of loneliness as much as experiencing physical cold increases them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611434535">Bargh &amp; Shalev, 2012</xref>, Study 2). Thus, although by default, people may want to trust others, they nevertheless remain highly vigilant to cues suggesting that they cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797611434535">von Hippel &amp; Trivers, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, individuals may feel physically cold when other people violate implicit standards for mimicry. We tested this general hypothesis in three studies. Specifically, we examined how differences in the explicit style of an interaction (Study 1), dispositional differences in the individual (Study 2), and racial differences between the individual and the interaction partner (Study 3) can all moderate implicit standards for mimicry and thus determine whether it is the presence or the absence of mimicry that perceivers find chilling.</p>

<title>Study 1: Interaction-Style Differences</title>
<p>In our initial study, we sought to test whether the presence or absence of mimicry by an interaction partner would lead individuals to report different levels of felt coldness. Any friendly interaction is likely to involve at least a small amount of mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611434535">Lakin &amp; Chartrand, 2003</xref>), so in an affiliative context, a complete lack of mimicry would violate implicit behavioral standards. However, we argue that what instills felt coldness is not always the absence of mimicry per se, but rather the deviation from behavioral standards given the overarching style of the ongoing interaction. Mimicry is generally linked to affiliative intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611434535">Chartrand &amp; van Baaren, 2009</xref>), and it occurs more often among peers than among nonpeers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611434535">Cheng &amp; Chartrand, 2003</xref>). Therefore, mimicry should not occur in interactions that are more task oriented than affiliative, because such interactions may be too polite and formal to warrant affiliative behaviors such as mimicry. Differences in the explicit style of an interaction (affiliative vs. task oriented) could change perceivers’ implicit standards for mimicry—and violations of either type of standard could be chilling for perceivers even if the conscious elements of the interaction remain perfectly mundane and pleasant. Thus, if one’s interaction partner uses an affiliative interaction style, then a lack of mimicry might violate behavioral standards and thus be chilling; however, if the interaction partner is task oriented and expresses no affiliative intent, then the <italic>presence</italic> of mimicry might violate standards and elicit feelings of coldness.</p>
<p>Participants in Study 1 interacted with an experimenter who used either an affiliative or a task-oriented interaction style while either mimicking or not mimicking the participants’ nonverbal behaviors. We hypothesized that participants’ subsequent feelings of physical warmth or coldness would depend on the experimenter’s interaction style. A lack of mimicry would match a task-oriented interaction but would not match an affiliative interaction; we therefore hypothesized that participants would feel colder when they were not mimicked in an affiliative interaction or were mimicked in a task-oriented interaction than when they were mimicked in an affiliative interaction or were not mimicked in a task-oriented interaction.</p>

<p>Forty Duke University undergraduates (24 female, 16 male; mean age = 18.88 years) participated in exchange for course credit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797611434535">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797611434535">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>A Caucasian female experimenter who was blind to our hypothesis greeted participants in either a friendly and informal manner (<italic>affiliative</italic> condition) or a polite yet highly professional manner (<italic>task-oriented</italic> condition). The experimenter maintained this demeanor throughout the course of her interaction with each participant and exhibited a range of subtle cues to signal either a desire to affiliate with the participant or a narrow focus on conducting the study properly. The friendly demeanor in the affiliative condition involved the use of speech disfluencies (e.g., “um”), hyperbolic responding (e.g., saying “awesome” instead of “good”), eye contact, and smiling. The professional demeanor in the task-oriented condition involved a polite, formal, and rehearsed communication style and was stiffer in form and delivery.</p>
<p>Participants first completed a photo-description task with the experimenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611434535">Chartrand &amp; Bargh, 1999</xref>). The experimenter handed each participant 10 photographs, 1 at a time, and instructed the participant to verbally describe each photograph. The experimenter gently enforced a 30-s time limit for each description, using either a friendly and encouraging manner (in the affiliative condition) or a polite yet insisting manner (in the task-oriented condition). Throughout the course of this interaction, the experimenter either mimicked the participant’s postures, gestures, and nonverbal mannerisms or did not mimic them at all; the experimenter’s mimicry of the participant’s nonverbal behavior was subtle, delayed by 2 to 4 s, and deliberately inexact so as to prevent any conscious detection by the participant.</p>
<p>Following this interaction, participants were seated at a nearby computer, and the experimenter left the room. Participants then completed a questionnaire (“How I Feel Right Now”), in which they rated the extent to which single words or short phrases reflected the way they felt at that moment, using a scale from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 9 (<italic>extremely</italic>). Items measuring how physically cold and physically warm participants felt were randomly embedded among these items. Note that in a pilot test (<italic>N</italic> = 42), we found that the modal response for felt coldness was 1 (followed by 2) and the modal response for felt warmth was 5; these results suggest that, by default, participants felt a moderate degree of warmth but little coldness, and are consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611434535">Bargh &amp; Shalev, 2012</xref>, Study 2).</p>
<p>Participants then reported demographic information and completed a funnel debriefing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611434535">Bargh &amp; Chartrand, 2000</xref>). No participants reported any suspicions about the true purpose of the study or any awareness of mimicry by the experimenter.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>We tested felt coldness and warmth separately using a 2 (mimicry: mimicry vs. no mimicry) × 2 (interaction style: affiliative vs. task oriented) analysis of covariance, controlling for participants’ race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0956797611434535">3</xref></sup> Results indicated a crossover interaction for felt coldness, <italic>F</italic>(1, 35) = 8.86, <italic>p</italic> = .005, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .20, but no effects for felt warmth (<italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1.0). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611434535">Figure 1</xref>, participants in the affiliative condition reported feeling colder when they were not mimicked than when they were mimicked, <italic>F</italic>(1, 35) = 6.48, <italic>p</italic> = .015, whereas participants in the task-oriented condition showed the reverse pattern, <italic>F</italic>(1, 35) = 2.88, <italic>p</italic> = .098.</p>

<p>Consistent with findings from past work on violations of implicit standards for mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611434535">Dalton et al., 2010</xref>), our results revealed that participants who interacted with an affiliative experimenter felt colder if they were not mimicked than if they were. However, it was not the lack of mimicry per se that participants reacted to: The experimenter’s interaction style determined whether it was the presence or the absence of mimicry that participants found chilling. This result suggests that perceptions of an interaction partner’s use of mimicry depend on implicit standards associated with the context of the situation, and that perceivers’ embodied reactions are based on the combination of a given interaction partner’s level of mimicry and such situation-based standards for mimicry.</p>

<title>Study 2: Individual Differences in Self-Construal</title>
<p>In our second study, we examined how individual differences moderated participants’ embodied reactions to mimicry. Past work has shown that there are trait differences in how people construe themselves in relation to others—whether they regard themselves as socially interdependent or socially independent. Individuals with more interdependent self-construals prefer greater physical and psychological closeness with other people than do individuals with more independent self-construals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611434535">Holland, Roeder, van Baaren, Brandt, &amp; Hannover, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797611434535">Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002</xref>). Although mimicry and feelings of interdependence are correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611434535">Ashton-James, van Baaren, Chartrand, Decety, &amp; Karremans, 2007</xref>), mimicry can threaten one’s sense of independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611434535">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). We argue that individuals with different self-construals differ in their standards for how much mimicry is appropriate in a given interaction, and that feelings of physical coldness result from deviations from these individual standards.</p>
<p>Participants in Study 2 engaged in a friendly interaction with an experimenter who either mimicked or did not mimic their nonverbal behaviors over the course of the interaction. Participants were then tasked with estimating the room temperature (a paradigm used in past research on embodied reactions to negative social feedback; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0956797611434535">Zhong &amp; Leonardelli, 2008</xref>). We hypothesized that highly interdependent participants would make lower room-temperature estimates when they were not mimicked by the experimenter than when they were, and that highly independent participants would make lower room-temperature estimates when they were mimicked by the experimenter than when they were not.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants first completed the picture-description task used in Study 1; during the task, they were either mimicked or not mimicked by a Caucasian female experimenter. Next, the experimenter suddenly “remembered” that the building’s maintenance department had asked “everyone” to fill out a brief report. The experimenter handed participants a clipboard with a form instructing them to estimate and write down the current room temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) and to note whether they had noticed any change in temperature while they had been in the room. The actual room temperature was held constant at 72 °F.</p>
<p>Participants were then seated at a nearby computer, where they completed a 24-item measure of self-construal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797611434535">Singelis, 1994</xref>). Note that we assessed self-construal at the end of the study so as to avoid making it salient prior to the interaction and to ensure that our “independent” participants had identifiably independent self-construals even after they engaged in a friendly interaction (which may prime interdependence; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611434535">Gardner, Gabriel, &amp; Hochschild, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0956797611434535">4</xref></sup> Self-construal scores were standardized, with positive scores representing interdependence and negative scores representing independence. Funnel debriefing again ensured that no participants were aware of our hypothesis or of any mimicry by the experimenter. No participants reported noticing any change in room temperature while they were in the room.</p>

<sec id="section11-0956797611434535">
<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>We used a regression analysis to predict participants’ temperature estimates from their mimicry condition (mimicry vs. no mimicry), their self-construal, and the interaction of these two variables, controlling for race. Results indicated a significant crossover interaction of mimicry condition and self-construal, <italic>b</italic> = 2.64, <italic>F</italic>(1, 30) = 5.55, <italic>p</italic> = .025, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .17. Interdependent participants who were not mimicked reported marginally colder room temperatures than did those who were mimicked, <italic>b</italic> = 2.59, <italic>F</italic>(1, 30) = 3.34, <italic>p</italic> = .078. Conversely, independent participants who were mimicked reported marginally colder room temperatures than did those who were not mimicked, <italic>b</italic> = −2.69, <italic>F</italic>(1, 30) = 2.87, <italic>p</italic> = .100. The full pattern of results is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797611434535">Figure 2</xref>. Note that given the constant room temperature of 72 °F, the observed differences in temperature estimates were errors of underestimation; estimates below 72 °F imply felt coldness resulting from violations of participants’ personal standards for mimicry.</p>

<p>These results suggest that different perceivers react to mimicry in different ways. Whereas interdependent individuals felt colder when they were not mimicked, independent individuals felt colder when they were mimicked. These diverging sensitivities to mimicry highlight how individual differences moderate perceivers’ implicit assessments of social threat and thereby moderate the embodied reactions that follow.</p>

<title>Study 3: Racial Differences in Interaction Partners</title>
<p>We next considered how characteristics of one’s interaction partner can moderate embodied feelings of coldness in response to the presence or absence of mimicry. The nonverbal posturing and behavior used in interactions between people of different races can differ from the posturing and behavior used in interactions between people of the same race, often because of the negative arousal and anxiety inherent in cross- race interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611434535">Dovidio, Kawakami, Johnson, Johnson, &amp; Howard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797611434535">Richeson &amp; Trawalter, 2005</xref>). Recent work has suggested that mimicry may not be standard in cross-race interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611434535">Dalton et al., 2010</xref>); therefore, in Study 3, we tested the hypothesis that the absence of mimicry might be chilling in same-race interactions, whereas the presence of mimicry might be chilling in cross-race interactions.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Caucasian and non-Caucasian participants completed the same picture-description task used in Studies 1 and 2.

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>In three studies, we found that people literally feel colder in response to inappropriate amounts of behavioral mimicry and that an individual’s implicit standards for appropriate amounts of mimicry in a given interaction depend on the interaction style of the interaction partner (Study 1), the individual’s chronic disposition (Study 2), and racial differences between the two interaction partners (Study 3). A test of discriminant validity in Study 1 confirmed these increases in reported felt coldness, supporting the notion that suspicious nonverbal cues from interaction partners can elicit negative embodied reactions. The consistency of this effect across three different studies suggests that it may generalize to a range of social situations and relationships.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that people readily rely on implicit mimicry standards to assess and react to their social environment. Mimicry is typically considered an affiliative act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611434535">Lakin &amp; Chartrand, 2003</xref>), so it is easy to see why mimicry that occurs in a nonaffiliative context might raise one’s suspicions. Indeed, in our studies, nonstandard amounts of mimicry seemed to evoke a threat response similar to that evoked by counterstereotypic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611434535">Mendes et al., 2007</xref>). It would be interesting to examine whether such felt coldness corresponds with flight behaviors (e.g., behavioral distancing) or fight behaviors (e.g., behavioral backlash; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797611434535">Rudman &amp; Fairchild, 2004</xref>), or whether it is merely conflated with psychological distance. These embodied reactions could also occur in lieu of behavioral responses, particularly in situations that do not warrant a behavioral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797611434535">Smith &amp; Semin, 2007</xref>). Future studies could explore the behavioral correlates of these embodied reactions.</p>
<p>Our results also highlight the importance of (implicitly) knowing when to mimic other people and when it is okay to be mimicked by them, particularly if one wishes to minimize (or accurately assess) suspicion in zero-acquaintance contexts. This might require having properly calibrated standards for mimicry—that is, standards that are neither too broad nor too narrow. Having too broad a standard for how much mimicry is appropriate might increase one’s susceptibility to deception and threat, yet having a standard that is too narrow might facilitate unnecessary suspicion. Overly narrow standards may be especially problematic when one’s interaction partner’s mimicry is impaired because of developmental or physical disabilities or is guided by different cultural standards. An inability to establish trust at such an implicit level may undermine any subsequent efforts to get along.</p>
<p>It is still unknown how prevalent these embodied reactions are, and the answer might depend on the underlying cognitive mechanisms at work. In the present studies, participants’ standards for mimicry were presumably based on rather broad aspects of interactions (e.g., affiliative interactions, interdependent orientations), which suggests that the effects are generalizable. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether any kind of social mismatch is equally chilling. The observed effects could be limited to broad social norms that activate expectancies (whose violation leads to vasoconstriction) or to preferences (i.e., thwarted subgoals for how the interaction should unfold). Future studies could test for these boundary conditions, though we should note that the social-cognitive underpinnings of mimicry—including its interface with other mental processes—are still being explored, so there may be yet-unidentified factors that further moderate the prevalence of embodied reactions. For instance, if one’s interpersonal motives deviate from those typically involved in a particular type of interaction, then one may assess an interaction partner’s violations of standards for that type of interaction more positively, and they would thus be less chilling.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that people implicitly rely on mimicry cues to evaluate and react to other people. This means that everyday feelings of coldness may often stem from individuals’ implicit suspicions about an interaction partner’s nonverbal behavior. If an interaction partner’s mimicry can be assumed to be properly calibrated and thus meaningful, then it may be a cue to deception or threat. If this is indeed the case, then perhaps people are well served to beware of any strangers bearing mimicry.</p>
