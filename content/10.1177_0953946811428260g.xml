<p>I come to <italic>Peacebuilding: Catholic Theology, Ethics, and Praxis</italic> from the perspective of my work helping to develop <italic>Just Peacemaking: The New Paradigm for the Ethics of Peace and War</italic> (Cleveland, OH: Pilgrim Press, 2008), which is both Catholic and Protestant. Both books originated as responses to the call of the US Catholic bishops’ <italic>Challenge of Peace</italic> for going beyond just war and pacifism, to develop ‘a positive Christian theology of peace’. Both also respond to the practical struggle for peacemaking where war and the threat of war portend enormous destruction in our time of increasingly destructive weapons, and where the enormous costs of militarisation undermine budgets for education and human needs.</p>
<p>Lisa Cahill affirms <italic>Just Peacemaking</italic> (p. 328). Maryann Cusimano Love argues that ‘Just-peace norms’ are rapidly growing in widespread understanding. ‘The Catholic church, along with others, can play a role today in publicising and institutionalising norms of just peace… Just-peace principles … must be pursued in all phases of the conflict cycle’ (p. 56). She advocates ‘<italic>Just Peacemaking …</italic> as a new paradigm that parallels but pushes beyond the just-war tradition’ (p. 75). She affirms the ten practices of just peacemaking ‘that provide alternatives to war’, but rightly indicates the feature of <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> that deserves widespread praise: most authors of <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> have practised peacemaking in Indonesia, the Philippines, Latin America, Africa etc. Thus <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> is strongly rooted in Catholic tradition, is theologically rich, and its theology is not abstract and detached but supports actual peacemaking in challenging contexts.</p>
<p><italic>Peacebuilding</italic> says ‘how war is conducted has moved thinking from just war to just peace proposals, exactly as just peacemaking does’ (p. 446). It quotes Drew Christiansen: ‘“The time has come to draw the various pieces into a coherent teaching on peace and war” whose positive elements are defense of human rights, a “relatively new teaching on [nonviolent direct action] and pursuing justice and forgiveness”, and support for international law and global institutions’ (p. 403). Exactly these same positive practices, and drawing them together into a coherent teaching, is what <italic>Just Peacemaking</italic> also advocates. <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> now gives a clear account of the change to presumption against war in Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul II, and Benedict XVI (pp. 279-83), but says ‘the tradition has not worked out a satisfactory account of what peacebuilding requires’ (p. 282). Here in <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> is that satisfactory account.</p>
<p>One <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> practice is <italic>dialogue</italic>. Interreligious dialogue was crucial for the peacemaking after the ‘sad years’ in Indonesia, writes Thomas Michel, but was also important in peacemaking in other countries, as described by Peter Phan and others. John Paul Lederach writes that the texts from Bishop Gómez Serna’s diocese in Colombia ‘envision dialogue in the very arrival of Jesus as the Word made flesh and the only way that human community creates meaning both within itself and with God’ (p. 37).</p>
<p>By the practices of dialogue the authors mean what just peacemaking means by <italic>cooperative</italic> conflict resolution: ‘sharing life, collaboration for justice and peace, and sharing religious experiences’ that antagonists can use to motivate cooperative efforts for peacemaking, not as interruptions that Enlightenment-influenced rational conflict resolution brackets out:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Father Bert practices conflict resolution in Mindanao, the Philippines. He has learned to see that in war, the real enemy is not the soldier or the rebel. The real enemy is war itself… The combatants were also victims… Man is made in the image and likeness of God. By nature man is good. It’s the situation that makes him bad sometimes. But even then, he has been redeemed by Jesus Christ and God’s grace is enough if the person wants to change.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For me, life is precious and sacred, be it the life of the non-combatant or the combatant. Jesus reached out to those who were marginalised by society. He showed them his compassion. He helped them recover their humanity. Even to the thieves, he offered heaven. This should be the role of the Church, to accompany people back to the fold and not to marginalise them. That is why the Church teaches reconciliation (pp. 40-41).</p>
<p>Kenneth Himes contends that Catholic theological ethics assumes too much of an organic understanding of society, so its peacebuilding lacks a theory of conflict resolution. It fails ‘to acknowledge the deeply conflictual nature of human reality’ (p. 282). Headley and Neufeldt say they have needed to learn ‘conflict analysis, mediation, and facilitation’ from Quakers and Mennonites (p. 146). John Paul Lederach, a leading practitioner of conflict resolution throughout the world, supplies much of that theory in chapter 2, which parallels the chapter on cooperative conflict resolution in <italic>Just Peacemaking</italic>. <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> probably refers to Lederach more times than any other author<italic>—</italic>with 61 references, besides his own chapter. The only non-Catholic author, he may nevertheless be close to canonisation. When one author referred to John Paul, I was not sure if he was referring to John Paul Lederach or John Paul II. Maybe he should be called John Paul III. (‘Just peace’ is referred to 66 times—though not always with its ten practices in mind.)</p>
<p>Himes’s contention may explain why <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> lacks attention to the just peacemaking practice of nonviolent direct action, but emphasises ‘accompaniment’—42 times in the book—which is a form of nonviolent direct action, accompanying those who are threatened by violence, creating temporary peace, and quietly confronting would-be violators with the knowledge their violence would cause public notice. Accompaniment is more pastoral and less confrontational than other forms of nonviolent direct action sweeping across the world and bringing nonviolent change for justice.</p>
<p><italic>Peacebuilding</italic> does emphasise the just peacemaking practice of acknowledging responsibility for conflict and injustice, and seeking healing through repentance and forgiveness. Robert Schreiter describes a strength of Catholic teaching and practice—‘ritual, sacrament, and spirituality’ (pp. 221-30) with its openings to God’s action in our lives, and its bringing healing through repentance and forgiveness. Daniel Philpott writes that <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> defines reconciliation as ‘acknowledgment of the suffering of victims, the confession and transformation of perpetrators, public apologies, acts of forgiveness, public memorials, the healing of a wide array of wounds, and the overcoming of hatred and enmity’ (p. 95). He notes Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI’s emphasis on forgiveness—a theme that recurs throughout <italic>Peacebuilding</italic>. (I suggest that Donald Shriver’s chapter in <italic>Just Peacemaking</italic> [2008], and his insightful book, <italic>An Ethic for Enemies: Forgiveness in Politics</italic> [New York: Oxford University Press, 1995], could add clarity: Forgiveness is composed of four elements: (1) Judgment of injustice done; (2) Forbearance from revenge; (3) Empathy for the humanity of all involved; (4) Intent to renew community where possible. This answers opponents of forgiveness who think it overlooks injustice.)</p>
<p><italic>Peacebuilding</italic> strongly emphasises sustainable economic justice—a <italic>Just Peacemaking</italic> practice. ‘While the common good embraces all, those who are weak, vulnerable, and most in need deserve preferential concern. A basic moral test for our society is how we treat the most vulnerable in our midst. In a society marred by deepening disparities between rich and poor, Scripture gives us the story of the Last Judgment (see Mt. 25.31-46) and reminds us that we will be judged by our response to the “least among us”’ (Cusimano Love, p. 90). ‘Church teaching and pastoral practice that trace to the teachings of Jesus and the earlier prophetic tradition concern themselves with the plight of the poor, the widows, the orphans, and the marginalised’ (Lederach, p. 96). Reconciliation involves ‘rectifying the plight of the poor and the dispossessed, freeing those who are trapped in poverty, debt, and slavery; giving bread to the hungry; canceling debts; and judging and punishing oppressors. Second Isaiah 40 through 55 pronounces most clearly the restorative character of justice, using the term again and again to describe God’s comprehensive restoration of a people that has gone astray, ultimately through a messianic suffering servant. Justice here is ‘saving justice’—an active, transforming process’ (Philpott, p. 97).</p>
<p>When William Headley and Reina Neufeldt of Catholic Relief Services write of ‘Connecting and Amplifying Voices for Just Peace’ in Colombia , it makes one think of the war in Afghanistan: ‘This solidarity program engaged the U.S. Catholic community in trying to reorient U.S. policy from one centered on military aid and intervention to one that could help build conditions for a just and lasting peace. In collaboration with the bishops’ conferences in Colombia and the United States, CRS supported increasing humanitarian and development aid, conditioning military aid on human rights, and giving greater support for the peace process’ (p. 141).</p>
<p>Focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa, Todd Whitmore echoes Himes: ‘For development truly to contribute to peace, Catholic social teaching will need a much more sustained discussion of sin and its social manifestations, … particularly focused on how various entities draw upon development discourse to mask, in John Paul’s words, ‘the all consuming desire for profit’, and the ‘thirst for power’, particularly as manifested in new forms of indirect rule. Development … has been from the start, whatever else it has been, a tool for extracting labor and natural resources from indigenous peoples’ (p. 175). (Some of us may wonder if Whitmore is also thinking of our own nation.) Therefore, he advocates the just peacemaking practices of human rights and democracy, based on Catholic teaching of the fundamental dignity of the human person: ‘Catholic human rights theory, which identifies social and economic needs such as housing, food, health care, and sanitation as fundamental rights, provides a basis on which to train the analytical eye on the fact that many deaths during war result from the lack of these rights being protected and promoted’ (p. 157). He says we need to emphasise these, and not only ‘the direct/indirect killing and quality-of-life/right-to-life distinctions’ (p. 157).</p>
<p>The chapter on Catholic Relief Services by Headley and Neufeldt repents for not having confronted structural injustices in pre-genocide Rwanda, in apartheid South Africa, and in ‘other struggles to protect life, dignity and human rights’ (p. 128). Here the theological ethic of ‘the <italic>common good,</italic> which includes Catholic social teaching’s specification of human rights and responsibilities, provided a rationale for programs that could address’ these structural injustices (p. 129, italics in original).</p>
<p>Peter-John Pearson writes that Catholic teaching on human rights was crucial for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and for building a new society in South Africa. Over half of South Africans worship weekly, so it was important to find an ethic for the new civil culture that had faith support. But South Africa, the United Nations, and the Catholic Church, all had great diversity; hence they all converged on human rights as their uniting tradition. Furthermore, ‘it was the human rights violations hearings that made the TRC most accessible to the average South African’ (p. 197).</p>
<p>Kenneth Himes writes: ‘A theologically inspired communitarian social ethic runs through the tradition. God desires community and humans are essentially relational, and society is both necessary and natural… The root [biblical] metaphor for this communitarian vision is the biblical emphasis on covenant’, and solidarity is crucial. This promotes <italic>an international order</italic> (pp. 267, 273-74). Here <italic>Peacebuilding</italic> resembles the just peacemaking theme of community as working with cooperative forces in the international system, and with the United Nations and international cooperation.</p>
<p>Lisa Cahill writes perceptively of</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>how important the scriptures are to Catholic peacebuilding around the world… Catholic social teaching centers on the concepts of human dignity and the common good, and advocates for human rights and the mutual accountability of everyone in society. Its language tends to be universalistic rather than culturally specific or explicitly religious… Catholic social teaching sees justice as the key standard by which social relationships should be measured, although it is also informed by gospel values such as love of neighbor, the preferential option for the poor, and solidarity. In other cultural settings people often place their primary emphasis on this biblical language. They refer to the example of Jesus and to the Bible, especially the New Testament. Jesus’ teaching and ministry are held up as examples of love, forgiveness, and reconciliation (p. 302).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I echo Cahill: <italic>Just Peacemaking</italic> relegated its scriptural grounding to the introductory chapter in order to invite ‘all persons of good will’ to support just peacemaking practices. Elsewhere, we base the ten peacemaking practices scripturally, and should do that more extensively.</p>
<p>Cahill also writes incisively of support for peacemaking in the theology of creation of all persons as ‘one flesh’, in the image of God, of the meaning of the cross as solidarity, of ‘God entering into our situation in the mode of suffering love to bring justice and right order as unity among God, human beings, and all creation’, and of the death and resurrection of Christ offering hope to a broken creation (pp. 314, 322, 324-26).</p>
<p><italic>Just Peacemaking</italic>’s tenth practice is support for grassroots peacemaking groups and voluntary associations, in parishes and local churches, and in societal groups outside the churches, engaging members in peacemaking practices, and providing a source of truth independent of propaganda from antagonists or governments. Precisely these functions were a crucial contribution of teams of persons in Indonesia organised by the Church’s Crisis Center: ‘The accurate documentation of conflicts is important for countering the exaggerated and inflammatory claims made on all sides… The Crisis Center’s credibility was enhanced by the bishops’ decision to staff it not only with Catholics, or other Christians, but also with Muslims… It also served to remind all … that Muslims and Christians in other parts of Indonesia were still able to live together in peace and work together for peace’ (pp. 250-51, 258). ‘The broader task … was to educate the Catholic people about peacebuilding as an essential element of the gospel message’ (p. 251). David O’Brien’s chapter also emphasises local churches.</p>
<p><italic>Just Peacemaking</italic>’s practices of independent initiatives, of nonviolent direct action, and of reducing offensive weapons and the arms trade are missing from <italic>Peacebuilding</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Peacebuilding</italic> brings a rich narrative of peacemaking practices in local experience of the international Catholic Peacebuilding Network. It describes and analyses the theology that underlies these peacebuilding practices—not as abstract and generic, but as specifically engaged theology by actual practitioners. Nor is its description of peacemaking practices merely pragmatic, disengaged from theological thinking. The practices and the theology are interwoven, and each enriches the other. I suggest Catholic peacebuilding and interdenominational just peacemaking have much to learn from each other.</p>
