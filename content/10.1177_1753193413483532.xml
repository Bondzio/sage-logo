<p>Skin is the largest and arguably most vital organ in the body. In the hand, skin forms an even larger proportion of constitutive components. Skin problems account for the majority of hand operations particularly if one includes the emergency department repair of hand lacerations. Skin is the one structure that is involved, injured or transgressed and requires repair in every single operative hand procedure. When skin fails either primarily as in Epidermolysis bullosa, or secondarily as wound dehiscence after closure, the outcome of the operative procedure and the function of the hand is endangered. Meticulous handling and closure of the skin is recognised as an important factor in improving hand surgical outcomes. And yet, a review on published output in the JHS(E) over the last year from March 2012 reveals only three papers on “skin” out of a total 177 papers published. Of these three, one was a case report on skin necrosis in a 6 year old with Raynaud’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413483532">Bhat et al. 2012</xref>), one a short report on accurately marking the A1 pulley on the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193413483532">Zhang et al. 2012</xref>), and one a full length article on the aesthetic outcome of fingertip reconstruction in complete syndactyly release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193413483532">Bulic 2013</xref>). By chance or design, these three are evenly distributed amongst the categories of articles published by the journal. And at least, we have avoided the faddish inclination to re-describe all known flaps by their perforators, an annoying habit of little innovative or progressive value.</p>
<p>But why are there a dearth of articles on skin? Is it that we know all there is to know about skin? Is it because there is no satisfyingly obsessive, detailed and discrete classification of skin injuries (to compare to the AO classification of bony injuries) around which one could design comparative articles? Is it because skin tends to heal itself and is (erroneously) regarded as a forgiving structure? In comparison with the fine balance of a digital extensor mechanism, skin is forgiving, but skin is no less responsible for stiffness and loss of function than poorly managed tendon or bone and joint injuries. Despite this causative effect, skin wounds are in my experience, often neglected and “left to heal”. The therapists are then tasked with stretching, massaging and overcoming the resulting scars, stiffness and contractures. Thank goodness for therapists. A good proportion of their work deals with scars and skin contractures.</p>
<p>This month we have attempted to redress the balance by collecting articles relating to skin disorders affecting the hand. We include an innovative attempt to explain the ‘impossible’ physiology of a venous flap along with a technique that makes these capricious flaps more reliable. There are articles on new or modified techniques of skin flaps and when all else fails, one on hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hopefully these articles will encourage surgeons to consider and attempt (or re-attempt) venous and the other flaps. A record of their experiences will hopefully fill this journal in the future. Alternatively or in addition, these articles should inspire more submissions on the vital organ that is skin.</p>
