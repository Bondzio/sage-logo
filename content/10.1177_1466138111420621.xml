<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to discuss the concept of community as a methodological tool in the absence of a face-to-face interaction context. Our perspective emphasizes the constitutive role of the researcher and his or her methods in creating communities in any kind of social research. In our case study of research that we conducted in a private medical centre in Barcelona, we show how Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) users were ‘imagined’ as a community through the use of press clippings as mediation tool in the ethnographic interview.</p>

<p>In this article we wish to discuss the concept of community as a methodological tool that will enable us to construct an ethnographic object. We have in mind an ethnographic object that is not necessarily localized, but takes into account the connections between subjects, ideas and experiences – connections that may be intangible though they may constitute a community of feeling and meanings. How, from this point of view, do we draw the limits of the community? Do communities exist by themselves, or are they a product of the ethnographic method – and if so, to what extent? Our interest in the methodological implications of the concept of community originated in a research project carried out in a private centre for reproductive medicine in Barcelona, Spain, which explored the social and cultural implications of infertility treatments. In this particular context the concept of community was also important as a frame of meaning. Apparently, the community existed neither as an objective space of social relationships nor as a collective representation in the individuals’ consciousness; however, the use of the concept of community as a methodological tool turned out to be crucial in the development of our research. In this article we highlight the relevance of the concept of community in the analysis of social relations in a situation where the community is apparently inexistent.</p>
<p>Why do we insist on using this concept if the community was so insubstantial in our case study? Ethnographers have used the concept of community in two different ways: as an object of analysis, and as a context. Community as a context is not only a space of social relationships but also a frame of meaning, that is, a domain inside which ‘things make sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111420621">Agar, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111420621">Bruner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111420621">Goffman, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138111420621">Schutz, 1970</xref>). Taking into account the different meanings that it has acquired throughout the history of ethnographic research, by using the concept of community as a methodological tool we can integrate at least two different sorts of polarities. The first is to do with the process of knowledge production, that is, between theory and the practice of field work; and the second is to do, on the one hand, with a space of social relations and, on the other, a system of representations.</p>
<p>Interaction between these two polarities has enabled us to propose a tentative typology of three forms of community: localized, dispersed and imagined. This typology covers different kinds of social reality and different positions of the ethnographer in relation to them, positions from which the researcher builds a particular context and its consequent theorization. Equally these three types of community reflect the relation between the material dimensions of particular forms of sociality and the representational ones.</p>
<p>We shall briefly discuss each of these types, but it is the third one, imagined communities, which will constitute our object of analysis.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1466138111420621"><title>Community and method</title>
<p>Traditional ethnography made use of a type of community as an object of analysis that we shall call the <italic>localized community</italic>. In localized communities, the members coexist and create a common space by means of multiple bonds – economic, moral, political and historical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1466138111420621">Redfield, 1989</xref>). Established examples of localized communities are tribal communities, villages and neighbourhoods. Participant observation is the method used to carry out research in these contexts because it responds to the need to localize a community. In ‘naturalistic ethnographies’, which were the expected product of research conducted in localized communities, the role of the ethnographer in the constitution of the community under study was largely ignored. Communities existed as objective realities by themselves and the purpose of research was merely to turn that objective existence into an object of scientific scrutiny.</p>
<p>More recent concerns with intersubjectivity, ethnographic authority and the problematization of context have consistently debunked this model of objective localized communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111420621">Clifford, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111420621">Dilley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111420621">Gupta and Ferguson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1466138111420621">Marcus, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111420621">Marcus and Fisher, 1986</xref>). Now ethnographers are seen as active participants in the very constitution of their object of analysis. Even though localized communities continue to provide much of the data in contemporary ethnographical research, those communities are no longer seen as pre-existing objects but rather as interactive spaces between researcher and informants that constitute the particular products of a scientific practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1466138111420621">Burrell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1466138111420621">Cicourel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111420621">Jenkins, 1994</xref>). According to Fabian, contexts – and this can also be applied to communities – ‘must be constituted in a practice that is individually and therefore historically situated and determined’ (1995: 48).</p>
<p>But what happens when the community is not apparent and, as a result, cannot be apprehended with the traditional method of participant observation? How do we organize ethnographic research in areas where people do not interact directly with each other on a regular basis, when different social processes call into question the need to identify a territorially localized community? According to our definition, dispersed and imagined communities would be instances of these invisible communities, and represent concrete examples with which to develop the answers to those questions.</p>
<p>A case in point of a <italic>dispersed community</italic> can be found in pastoralists and stockbreeders with scattered habitats. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1466138111420621">García García (2000)</xref>, a Spanish anthropologist who conducted fieldwork in a community of stockbreeders in the north of Spain, face-to-face sociability had been replaced by a network of communication without which day-to-day life would be totally different. A shared discourse, appearing as a form of social relationship, substitutes the shared space. This does not mean that the community does not indentify itself with a particular geographical location, but that this geographical location is not constituent of the main forms of sociability within the community. These communities are dispersed but are not totally unlocalized since they are still within the limits of a territorial unit. The constitutive role of the ethnographer, on the other hand, is in this case much more apparent since it is through a shared discourse between ethnographers and informants as a form of social relationship that ethnographers create links with their research communities.</p>
<p>The last type of community we wish to look at is the <italic>imagined community</italic>. All communities – localized, dispersed and imagined – are integrated by individuals who identify themselves with what Charles Taylor has defined as a particular ‘social imaginary’: ‘that common understanding which makes possible common practices, and a widely shared sense of legitimacy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111420621">Taylor, 2004</xref>: 23). Benedict Anderson's (1991) concept of ‘imagined community’ refers to the ways in which national communities have built their own social imaginaries in the process of capitalist development. An imagined community is a community of people who have never met each other and, in most cases, never will, but they imagine themselves as a community through particular forms of mass communication made possible by printed texts, such as newspapers and novels. In the following decade, Arjun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138111420621">Appadurai (1996)</xref> developed Anderson's ideas further in order to analyse what he called the processes of deterritorialization in the formation of contemporary social identities. For him, the culture of a group of migrants (i.e. a diaspora community) who move to a new location and rebuild their history and ethnic project is, above all, an ‘imagined culture’ (p. 49). And mass media such as television and cinema, ‘electronic capitalism’ in his words, have a central role as creators and diffusers of new images and as legitimators of individual imaginations (p. 53). In contrast to Anderson, Appadurai disengages the formation of imagined communities from the process of nation-state building. Instead, he places the individual, individual imagination and the different life projects that a single individual may conceive for him/herself at the centre of the analysis of the societies of the late 1990s.</p>
<p>This change of theoretical object for the social sciences highlights the tensions between delocalized and imagined lives, since the latter create a sense of locality that is dissolved into the former, that is, as processes of deterritorialization make identity formation more challenging. Appadurai provides examples from his own life to emphasize the ethnographers’ position as coetaneous with social actors in the very social reality they want to analyse. Coevalness or coetaneousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1466138111420621">Fabian, 1983</xref>) have a distinctive political meaning inherent to the practice of ethnography in Appadurai's conception of social research. None of the authors who developed this idea in the 1980s and 1990s went beyond Fabian's theoretical criticism of contemporary anthropology and its obsession with localizing and turning physical space into temporal distance. This theoretical criticism together with Anderson's notion of imagined community and Appadurai's emphasis on the different individual imaginations as constitutive of a new perspective upon cultures and social identities has enabled us to see the viability of a new form of ethnography.</p>
<p>In our research with infertile couples undergoing assisted reproduction treatment, we carried out an ethnographical study of a non-localized social reality without a common social discourse, without durable social relationships that could be observed, and without a shared project as a community, present or future. We believe that it is the concept of imagined community that most clearly reflects this social reality. But an imagined community, as we have seen, cannot exist in isolation from the means by which the process of imagination takes place – the press, mass media and electronic capitalism in the above examples. What are the means by which this ‘imagined community’ of ART users is created? During our research we found that these sets of isolated couples, which apparently had nothing in common other than going through an ART treatment, constituted a community of experience and meanings.</p>
<p>To address this question we have divided the remainder of this article into four main sections. In the first section, ‘From invisible community to imagined community’, we analyse the particular social circumstances that make the community invisible and why it makes sense to turn this invisible community into an imagined community. The second section, ‘The written press and the ethnographic interview in the ART context’, contains a description, justification and contextualization of the method of ‘journalistic mediation’ used during the research. In the third section, ‘Contextualizing personal trajectories through the press’, we present a brief description of the way in which the press makes the community as it makes the ART context. Finally, in the fourth section, ‘The imagined community in action: Contrasts and identifications’, we analyse some of the conversations that arose in the interviews using press clippings, focusing our attention, specifically, on the clash of antagonisms and identifications that the cases reported in the press generated and how they contributed, among the couples undergoing ART treatments, to make explicit ideas, values and kinds of knowledge that put to work different coetaneous representations concerning family, paternity and maternity.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1466138111420621"><title>From invisible community to imagined community</title>
<p>The research participants were 25 couples, who did not know each other, lived in different towns in Catalonia and had different jobs. They formed a heterogeneous group of people who did not seem to have much in common apart from the fact that they all had been born in Catalonia, although some of the couples lived in a different place from where they had been born, and they were all paying for IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) treatment with their own gametes in a private clinic.</p>
<p>The age range was 29 to 35. Most had been married for between three and five years and were house-owners, living in new buildings in middle-class suburbs. For some of them, this was the first treatment after the infertility diagnosis, whereas for others it was part of a long-term process using artificial insemination or other ART treatments. Whatever the particularities of each case, during the interview they all reported feeling misunderstood by their immediate social environment, by society in general, or by political agencies which, in their view, did nothing to allow simpler, fairer access to these techniques.</p>
<p>Infertile couples undergoing assisted reproduction described their experience as unique, something that can only be understood by someone who has been through the same process. This was a recurrent theme in our informants’ conversations which corroborated the idea of a tacit community of experience and meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1466138111420621">Csordas, 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, these infertile couples have no interest in seeing themselves as members of this community or in participating in any form of sociability within that community; infertility is assumed as a temporary experience that does not entail any identity investment. Even though there are infertility associations, membership is very ephemeral.</p>
<p>The clinical context, which is focused on case work, reinforces an individualized relationship with the couples. These relationships are above all dyadic relationships between professionals (doctors, biologists, nurses and psychologists) and the couple. So the atmosphere of the clinic does not encourage sociability between patients in any way. Furthermore, couples may perceive their relationship with their clinicians to be depersonalized because, during the treatment, they are in contact with a team of experts instead of a single individual. This is something that patients found unsettling in so far as, in their view, it risked transforming a deeply personal and emotional experience into a cold technological procedure.</p>
<p>This type of dyadic relationship turned out to be a template for ethnographic research, since the relationship between the ethnographer and informants became another form of dyadic relationship. This is partly due to the fact that the clinic oriented the ethnographical research in terms of a set of interviews between the ethnographer and the couples. Furthermore, a requisite for conducting interviews in the clinic was that patients should sign an agreement to participate in this research, thus reproducing these very same dyadic conditions.</p>
<p>As the research progressed, we realized that ethnographic interviews conducted in these terms were clearly insufficient. A very important part of the experience of patients was rendered invisible. As the relationship with some couples became stronger, they told us that fundamental aspects of their experience had been missed in the interviews. We concluded that there was a complex system of cultural meanings originating in a common experience of a biotechnological process and that could not be disclosed in the dyadic relationship of the interview. In order to grasp this complexity we decided to carry out interviews in a different way by introducing press clippings during the interview, instead of just asking questions, to elicit more complex narratives from the ART users’ experiences. It was then that we became aware of the existence of an invisible, latent community, in the process of being imagined. In general terms, the press and the mass media are very much part of the cultural construction of ART. In this particular field, media events do not merely report on some external reality but are part of that reality in so far as ART users become conscious of their own experience (as a shared experience) above all through the press. To a large extent, ART simultaneously comprises individual experiences and media events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111420621">Melhuus, 2009</xref>). This dual nature of ART as an object supports our methodological option of using press clippings in the ethnographic interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1466138111420621"><title>The written press and the ethnographic interview in the ART context</title>
<p>While planning the research, with the cooperation of the physicians and biologists at the reproduction centre, we decided to hold three interviews with each couple: one before the beginning of the IVF treatment, another during the treatment and another after the treatment. We used written press articles during the interviews with the couples in order to solve three main methodological questions which emerged during fieldwork. In the first place, it was impossible to carry out direct observations in order to contrast them with the information obtained in the interviews to the couples. Indeed, during the first year of our research we were not even allowed to observe the doctor–patient interactions. Second, we needed to integrate the innovations and new debates which were constantly emerging in the field of ART within our research, including these developments as a ‘context’ of the interview. And finally, we realized that the same question could not be put to all interviewees in the same way, especially while working with people immersed in what was, to a large extent, a painful and laborious process. The press articles enabled us to ask questions that were relevant to our research without taking over the couples’ experiences.</p>
<p>In this article we describe and analyse only the first interview, the one held before the treatment. Interviews were conducted with both members of the couple in their home. The couples were informed at the beginning that the interviews would be divided into two parts. In the first part, they were asked to talk about their personal experiences up to the time of the interview. In the second part, they were shown a selection of press clippings about different cases or debates concerning ART and were encouraged to comment on them.</p>
<p>In what follows we will concentrate our attention on the second part. A miscellaneous selection of press clippings about ART was shown to the interviewees, articles from the Spanish press between 1999 and 2001 (see Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1466138111420621">Table 1</xref>). A central set of articles focused on different concepts and aspects of ART. As our research progressed we changed some of these articles so that new concepts and new problems were regularly introduced. For instance, the question concerning experimentation on spare embryos from IVF was introduced in the final months of the research, when debates on the subject began, after it had been approved in the UK. This dynamic set of articles enabled us to incorporate ongoing scientific and technical developments and the debates in the public sphere.</p>
<p>In order to highlight relations between different groups of people within our research, we used the idea of mediation which some sociological studies have attributed to the mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111420621">Askew and Wilk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111420621">Bourdieu, 1997</xref>). The written press could be said to mediate in the relationships between physicians and researchers, users’ opinions and political powers. In fact, the media events that we used normally involved one or other of those social subjects.</p>
<p>During our fieldwork we used the press articles to talk to the biologist or the psychologist at the reproductive medicine centre, as well as to the patients. This was the first justification for the use of what we would call the ‘journalistic mediation method’. But above all, these articles helped us to contextualize the couples’ experiences in a broader social framework, enabling them to create a space for reflection and to think about themselves in the third person, as it were, thus creating an ‘illusion of immediacy’. This last aspect was a methodological breakthrough for our research: by making use of the written press, we were able to create a context of immediacy in which the couples thought about their experience in terms of other relationships and other couples’ experiences. In other words, the research framework thus creates an imagined community of sorts.</p>
<p>Some couples commented at the end of the first interview or at some other time that they liked this part of the interview, that it made them feel good. In fact, the press clippings did not provide couples with new information, since they were already widely-read in this particular topic. Perhaps, we think, by contextualizing the experience, by connecting it with other individuals attuned in some way to what they were going through, the press clippings helped the couples to overcome their feeling of isolation and social misunderstanding, without violating the privacy of an emotionally painful experience, although this is just a hypothesis (compare narratives as relational act in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138111420621">Seaton, 2008</xref>). Let us take a closer look at the sort of context that was created by means of the press clippings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1466138111420621"><title>Contextualizing personal trajectories through the press</title>
<p>Our aim is not to carry out an analysis of the written press in relation to ART, but to show how, through the written press, our informants are confronted with social alterities and relations with ART that they cannot envisage in their own specific situation. Other anthropologists, who have also done research on ART, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1466138111420621">Edwards (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111420621">Hirsch (1999)</xref>, applied a similar method in which cultural meanings are elicited by appealing to their informants’ social imaginary. These authors analysed the social imaginary of assisted reproduction by confronting non-users with hypothetical cases. In our research we analyse this social imaginary by confronting ART users, specifically couples undergoing IVF treatments using their own gametes, with other ‘real’ cases as they appeared in the written press (compare the use of vignettes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1466138111420621">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>What social alterities and what relations with ART can be found in the press clippings? Mothers over 49, single women, gay and lesbian couples and fertile couples with inheritable diseases can all become parents with ART. This is the imagined community we have made visible through the press clippings.</p>
<p>The main characteristic of this imagined community is exceptionality. Science makes the impossible possible. ‘Children with two mothers’, ‘male eggs’, ‘(a child) born to save (another child)’, ‘selecting children’ (selection of embryos for particular purposes), ‘sperm banks: a safe service’, ‘science is about creating choice. Egg-freezing allows women to have a career’, ‘we are lagging behind’ (freezing eggs was not allowed in Spain at that time and there was a shortage of oocytes) (see Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1466138111420621">Table 1</xref>). These are some of the headlines from the selected press clippings. The press uses provocative language to create an image of exceptionality. ART solves problems, exceptional problems, but it also produces problems that are no less exceptional, among them technical, ethical and legal problems, such as ‘Should we freeze eggs?’ ‘How many embryos should be transferred?’ ‘Which inherited diseases justify embryo selection?’ ‘What do we do with the spare embryos after IVF?’ ‘Can we use frozen embryos for research?’ ‘How many donations, of eggs or sperm, can be done by the same individual?’.</p>
<p>In relation to ART, the press breaks down and moves the limits between nature and society, between gender and procreation, between substance and persons. Generally speaking, our informants see these articles as transgressing the limits of what is ‘normal’ in relation to paternity and maternity, of the ‘family’ as a ‘natural’ entity. The question of limits cropped up throughout the conversations generated by the press clippings. ‘There should be some limits’, ‘I accept things up to a limit’, ‘These are the things for which there should be some restrictions, some limits’. These were some of the most frequent reactions. But without a doubt the most interesting thing was to see how, throughout the conversation, several social imaginaries were implemented to locate those limits and to suggest their flexibility. By using their experiences the couples were able to relate to other ART users that appeared in the press stories in an apparently contradictory way, by simultaneously drawing contrasts and tracing identifications, and in this way opening up different conceptions of how kinship, maternity and paternity could be created.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1466138111420621"><title>The imagined community in action: Contrasts and identifications</title>
<p>In a single interview, using a personal story told in the first person, the press clippings allowed us to produce a story in the third person that opened up new questions for analysis and interpretation. By using the press clippings in the interviews, the connections between the couples who were receiving IVF treatment using their own gametes and other ART users in other situations became apparent and encouraged them to rethink and resignify themselves in the light of what they read and heard in the press reports. The couples related to these different individuals in two ways: by means of contrasts and identifications. Significantly, contrast and identification were not exclusive alternatives; for the same ‘press case’ a single person can relate to the characters that appear in the story in both ways almost at the same time. This suggests that they recognize themselves as participants in a common experience, even though this is not a community of intentions. In fact, their experience as ART users leads them to accept, through the mediation of the press, something that initially they were unaware of: the different ways of making kinship relations in their own social context. In this connection, the experience of ART as a media event adds a strong social sense to an intimate and individualistic environment.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1466138111420621"><title>Contrasts</title>
<p>When confronted with the imagined community built through the media, ART users presented different reactions. Our press clippings did not elicit an immediate identification with the situations they describe. The news is always exceptional and our informants did not want to see themselves in these terms; they felt the need to draw the limits between the normal and the abnormal. For our informants, ART had always been a last resource intended to achieve what they understood as an ‘ordinary family life’: a father and a mother of an age that identifies them as parents and not as grandparents, economically stable, and so on. This is the ‘norm’, the model that our informants took as reference. But the press does not portray ART in those terms. Consequently, their own experience was stressed by means of the contrast it produced with the press clippings. It was from this contrast that abstract norms and values became explicit in our informants’ narratives.</p>
<p>The contrast can be elaborated in two different ways. Sometimes they took their own particular experience of ART as a model from which general moral values could be constructed. They went through IVF because they wanted to be like normal people and have an ordinary family, but the press stories draw attention to the different possibilities opened up by ART. Women can freeze their eggs and then unfreeze them when they are over 40, allowing them, in the meantime, to have a career. ‘Why do they do this? Is it only for their convenience and comfort? Is it a “normal” family that they want?’ In fact, these women, our informants said, want to have children without the hassle involved in bringing them up. This produces a very clear contrast with our informants’ situations. ‘What is the difference between freezing your eggs at an early age and having IVF treatment to have a child over 40?’, asked one of our informants. By means of this exceptionality, they tried to show how different their own situation was and how justifiable their activities were. ‘Those women do not really need ART; they are only interested in their own convenience, whereas we are looking for a normal family with all the sacrifices that this involves.’</p>
<p>But the events depicted in the articles were not only pitted against their own particular experience as ART users. Sometimes they saw themselves as abstract, ordinary subjects, so the exceptionality of the press clippings was highlighted by the ‘normality’ of their own lives. There is no need to undergo ART treatment to see how risky and hazardous those situations can be. ‘A child with two mothers, or two fathers: how is this possible?’ In order to explore and to judge these possibilities our informants reflected upon their experience as ordinary subjects in an ordinary social environment. How would a child develop under these conditions? What about when they go to school? What will the other children do? How will they react? and so on. Once again, we see our informants’ efforts to present themselves as ordinary people.</p>
<p>The press did not provide an image with which the subjects could identify: on the contrary, it was an image with which they refused any identification. It was a counter-image of sorts. Only to the extent that they saw themselves as distanced from what was described in the press, the press clippings could be defined as ‘good to think’. Meaning, in this particular case, originates in the contrast between themselves and the press. The contrast is the one between the exceptional and the unexceptional, the extraordinary and the ordinary, the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the unnatural. Because our informants were striving to see themselves as ordinary people in search of an ordinary family life, nothing of what happened in the press clippings bore any resemblance, in their view, to their own experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1466138111420621"><title>Identifications</title>
<p>Yet there were ways in which the relationship between our informants and the imagined community of the press could be more complex. The contrast was not always so clear because on many occasions they did recognize themselves in some of the events or empathized with some of the people who appeared in the press. Even though the recognition was nearly always partial, for none of the press clippings referred directly to a situation equivalent to their own, sometimes they were able to perceive some degree of commensurability. Because they had gone through a specific experience, they were in a position to better understand what goes on in this case. The analogies and similarities with themselves helped them to think about their own situations from a different perspective. And conversely, their own experience as ART users helped them to interpret the press in a particular way.</p>
<p>Let us discuss some examples. Information obtained from <italic>The Washington Post</italic> refers to an American couple who were having IVF treatment to select the embryo in order to save the life of their sick daughter (see Appendix Table, section no. 6). One of our interviewees made the following comment: ‘I don't know … life's like that … we cannot generalize but if you start by being able to choose: I want him to have blue eyes, I want him to be blond, I want him to be tall, it will come to a stage that there won't be any ugly people. I am not convinced by this licence to choose.’ Initially, the relationship is clearly that of contrast. But then his partner added: ‘we cannot generalize, we should see each case on its own merits. I think that in that case I would have done the same thing. But now you don't think about the 18 embryos that will be wasted (out of which one was chosen), you only think that you have been able to save your daughter.’ Besides, the husband concluded, having changed his mind somewhat and agreeing with his wife, ‘you have another argument: life begins when it [the embryo] is inside … ’. The contrast has turned into an identification.</p>
<p>As regards research with embryos or cloning, the same couple was totally against both possibilities, but at a particular time during the conversation the woman placed herself on the side of identification: ‘there is also another issue’, she contended, ‘and it is that you think: Ok, in a few years time I will have my own child and he may need a transplant which cannot be performed today but may be possible in 20 years time thanks to the research carried out with embryos and cloning’.</p>
<p>Even those situations which were initially seen as remote because of their strangeness, relevant only in terms of their opposition to our informants’ experience, such as a child with two fathers and no mother, or a woman giving birth in her late 40s, could become oddly familiar in many respects. ‘We have always heard of women who are mothers over 40, of unmarried mothers or widows, women or couples who give their child to an orphanage’. These are some of the stories used by the couples during the conversation in order to explain to themselves their identification with a form of making kinship that was initially very different from theirs. Women who use IVF to be mothers when they are old, women who have inseminations with a donor's sperm, or eggs or embryo donations, all this can be equated to situations that were well known before the development of ART, and some of them the result of unfortunate circumstances.</p>
<p>But this was not the only question that emerged. In the first stage of the conversations we had with our informants, the decision to have a child who could be your grandchild, or the decision of a woman to have a child on her own, or two women or two men, these were seen as acts of selfishness. ‘The people who took these decisions were not thinking about the child.’ This is how our informants reacted to the press articles. In fact, in this part of the interview, the child, in the abstract, was an important source of meaning, the child conferred legitimacy to certain limits. But gradually the same conversations changed their orientation: ‘is it not also true that a wanted child, maybe with only one mother, with two mothers or two fathers, or an adopted child, could be better cared for than a child who has been born in “normal” circumstances to a couple who did not give much thought about the question of having children?’</p>
<p>The subjects can understand the events described by the press because they see themselves as part of a bigger whole; that is, they see themselves as syntagmatically related to those events. They all belong to the same community of experience and meaning, even though they are involved in different types of family. But semiosis goes both ways. By thinking about the press, they reflected on their own situation as a way of clarifying their doubts concerning their own experience. Conversely, it was also because of that particular situation that they felt in a position to better understand the press. Those press clippings could be taken as a metonymy of their own situation because they were all participants in the same imagined community of meaning. In a similar vein, they themselves became a metonymy of the imagined community of ART users as it emerged in the press clippings.</p>
<p>The interesting thing in the couples’ conversations was this oscillation between abstraction and identification as regards each of the cases that appeared in the press. In this oscillation, different meanings cross-cut each other or competed with each other: it all depends on the perspective we adopt. What can be seen, initially, as the tension between agency and the need to impose limits, between individual wishes and social values is also, and above all, the cross-cutting of some of the cultural meanings which in this context can be effectively used to express and to make, in part, the relationships of family, paternity and maternity.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1466138111420621" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We began this article by looking at the different ways in which the concept of community has been used in ethnographical research. Beyond sociological objectifications, communities turn out to be always frames of meaning, contexts within which people make sense of their own and each other's experiences. Now the researcher's role in the constitution of these frames of meaning should not be ignored; and our purpose in this article has been to explore the methodological implications of this role. Once we have accepted that the community is not just an object ‘out there’ but an interactive space whose existence emerges to a great extent from the very practice of ethnography, the next step is to find out what this practice might be, and what ethnographic methods contribute to the formation of that interactive space. It is widely acknowledged that conventional participant observation continues to play a key role in the constitution of <italic>localized</italic> communities. Ethnographers see communities, to a great extent, because that is what their research methods lead them to see. But what happens when these communities are no longer localized? What methods should be used in this context, and how do these methods contribute to the configuration of another form of community?</p>
<p>The community of ART users has been defined as an imagined community. This means that the community is not only invisible in physical space, but also as a form of collective representation in people's minds. Imagined communities cannot be divorced from the means by which they are constituted (i.e. imagined). I live in an imagined community not so much because I have the members of that community ‘in my mind’ but because, without actually being aware of who they are, I share with them certain meanings made explicit through the mass media. This is the sense in which ART users can be seen as an imagined community. Members of this community do not know each other and do not even care about each other, but they share a social imaginary provided by the mass media. So how do we do the ethnography of a community of this sort? By what we have defined as the method of journalistic mediation. Notice that this method, as we have described it in the preceding paragraphs, does not consist simply in <italic>observing</italic> people imagining their own community via the press: the researcher <italic>participates</italic> very actively in this process of imagination. It is the researcher who keenly urges people to think about their own experiences in the particular situations presented in the press and vice versa, to think about those situations in terms of their own experience.</p>
<p>The imagined community thus constituted turns out to be not an homogeneous set of individuals who see themselves as belonging to an encompassing whole but a context, a frame of meaning from which different individuals can draw different resources to interpret their lives: a cluster of events, subjects and situations to which individuals can relate in complex ways. The press does not generate a single, anonymous opinion. In fact, the opinions that emerge cannot be dissociated from the set of social relationships of the individual who confronts the press. Perhaps they cannot even be dissociated from the particular situation in which that confrontation takes place – in our case, the ethnographic interview. In this context, ‘making sense was about relating elements in a way that would build contexts in which audience members could stand in analogy to one another … ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111420621">Schlecker and Hirsch, 2001</xref>: 73). This concept of <italic>analogy</italic> has been developed here by identifying the contrasts and identifications with which meanings about family, paternity and maternity could be made explicit. The analogies are complex, because there is nothing simple or straightforward in the particular experiences we have been looking at.</p>
<p>It might be the case that the context of ART is particularly suitable to analysis through the method of journalistic mediation because, as we have already pointed out, ART are simultaneously individual experiences and media events – or so they were in Spain in the late 1990s and early 2000s which is when those technologies became fairly popular. But our purpose has been just to show the applicability of an ethnographic method to a particular object. Thus the contribution of this article is essentially methodological. The ‘method of journalistic mediation’ has also uncovered important issues related to forms of sociability and identification highlighted by the use of certain kinds of biotechnologies. Similarly, the use of this method opens up the question of how the knowledge and ideas associated with these biotechnologies are becoming part of certain social imaginaries, and identifies the complex relations between those social imaginaries and individual experiences as an area for analysis. Further research in similarly media-saturated environments should examine how far our approach can go beyond the ART field.</p>
