<abstract>
<p>Taking Action Opportunities (TAO) is a curriculum that combines guided reflection, a focus on the local environment, and innovative use of wildlife technology to empower student action toward improving the environment. TAO is experientially based and uses remote cameras as a tool for schoolyard exploration. Through TAO, students engage in research design, implementation, and analysis, and increase participation in environmentally responsible behavior. TAO was tested with fifth-grade students (age 10-11 years) through a pre- and posttest design. Treatment groups (<italic>n</italic> = 93; 4 classes, 2 years) were compared with control (<italic>n</italic> = 89; 4 classes, 2 years) and baseline data (<italic>n</italic> = 458) to measure knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. Students in the treatment groups demonstrated significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) gain in all categories. These students left fifth grade with experience, skill, and confidence in improving their environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nature programming, the Internet, and multimedia bring the excitement of wildlife to the immediate attention of young people, but students remain surprisingly disconnected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487888">Pergams &amp; Zaradic, 2006</xref>). Although we have many tools to bring the biodiversity of the far-reaches of the globe into our living rooms, students have little understanding of nearby animal species and wild places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487888">Louv, 2005</xref>). The combination of remote-camera technology, experiential environmental education, and outdoor learning offer a powerful opportunity to reconnect young people to their local wildlife and empower them to make positive environmental change.</p>
<p>Remote cameras are a rapidly evolving technology that has been widely adopted by the scientific community for conducting wildlife research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053825913487888">Brooks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1053825913487888">Swann, Hass, Dalton, &amp; Wolf, 2004</xref>). Remote cameras have increased our ability to document the presence/absence of rare and secretive species, estimate abundance of species with unique markings (e.g., individual tigers), and learn more about animal behavior. As remote cameras have become more widely used in research, the technology has improved, camera size has been reduced, infrared beams have been incorporated to allow nighttime observation without disrupting the animals, and cost has decreased. Remote cameras are now affordable for teachers who want to use their schoolyards as outdoor classrooms to teach students the processes of science, help students engage in environmentally responsible behavior (ERB), and increase students’ sense of place.</p>
<sec id="section2-1053825913487888">
<title>Pedagogical Grounding for TAO</title>
<p>Experiential education, environmental education, and outdoor learning have contributed a wealth of information for building effective curricula that can be used to improve knowledge, attitudes, and ERB in young people. When these educational efforts are conducted in a familiar setting, such as the schoolyard, educators have the ability to increase knowledge about the local environment, can strengthen students’ sense of place, and can guide students in practicing new behaviors toward improving the local environment.</p>
<p>Experiential learning and environmental-education efforts often target elementary-school-age children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053825913487888">Carrier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053825913487888">Ernst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053825913487888">Lindemann-Matthies, 2006</xref>). Research has demonstrated that younger participants exhibit the greatest rates of change in ERB as a result of environmental education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1053825913487888">Zelezny, 1999</xref>). Upper elementary students, 10 to 13 years old, have increased cognitive abilities compared with younger students, are able to approach broader subject matter, have begun to address ethical concerns, and are ready to investigate ecological applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053825913487888">Randler, Ilg, &amp; Kern, 2005</xref>). By age 12, young people’s scientific and environmental attitudes are established and resistant to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487888">Cronin-Jones, 2000</xref>). Using a familiar location such as the schoolyard where lessons can provide repeated, extended exposure to the local environment may increase connection to the environment and empower students to make positive environmental change.</p>
<p>Students can be encouraged to tackle difficult environmental problems by focusing on a question and working to identify approaches toward improving an environmental issue, such as loss of biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053825913487888">Kaplan, 2000</xref>). Issues associated with conservation and the environment can be challenging for students, especially when people are asked to confront their own impacts on the earth and on biodiversity. Teaching for Conceptual Change offers a theoretical framework that takes students through a process of identifying prior knowledge, confronting misconceptions, and orienting instruction around a focus question to which students return throughout the course of a lesson to break down barriers that prohibit learning and prevent behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487888">Hewson, Beeth, &amp; Thorley, 1998</xref>). In a successful application of this approach, investigation of new concepts or a new process of inquiry becomes the focus of the learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053825913487888">Duit, Treagust, &amp; Mansfield, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1053825913487888">Strike &amp; Posner, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Outdoor settings are effective learning environments when sufficient time is given to overcome novelty and promote optimal learning; these settings are most effective when they provide frequent, repeated, experiential, inquiry-based experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487888">Cronin-Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053825913487888">Ernst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487888">Fisman, 2005</xref>). Extended experiences in the outdoors can increase student knowledge and affinity for nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487888">Bizerril, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487888">Martin, Bright, Cafaro, Mittelstaedt, &amp; Bruyere, 2009</xref>). Outdoor lessons are well supported when paired with classroom instruction and most successful when active observation and investigation are central activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053825913487888">Carrier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487888">Mygind, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053825913487888">Randler et al., 2005</xref>). The schoolyard is an optimal setting for students because it is familiar, and teachers can use the schoolyard to present frequent experiences in the outdoors.</p>
<p>Reaching the target goal of increased ERB is more complicated than a simple linear progression from knowledge and awareness, through positive environmental attitudes, to action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053825913487888">Ernst &amp; Stanek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053825913487888">Hines, Hungerford, &amp; Tomera, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053825913487888">Monroe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053825913487888">Newhouse Berns &amp; Simpson, 2009</xref>). The Taking Action Opportunities (TAO) curriculum is designed to be a pedagogically sound, reflective, and engaging experience for students. In this article, we assess the effectiveness of TAO in increasing student knowledge, attitudes, and ERB about schoolyard-wildlife habitat.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1053825913487888">
<title>TAO Curriculum</title>
<p>We developed the TAO curriculum to incorporate remote cameras and related wildlife-biology technologies into educational practice to engage students in the process of conducting scientific research and taking environmental action in their schoolyard. TAO combines theories of Teaching for Conceptual Change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053825913487888">Posner, Strike, Hewson, &amp; Gertzog, 1982</xref>), experiential learning, and active learning to provide a learner-centered, constructivist, change-oriented, 12-week series of experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2009b</xref>). TAO lessons are conducted in 1-hr per week sessions, and take place in the schoolyard and classroom. In addition, small-group time is used to monitor schoolyard remote cameras and conduct observations.</p>
<p>Students sign up for small-group time during which they monitor schoolyard remote cameras and conduct schoolyard-wildlife observations. Remote cameras store images on a standard Secure Digital card; images are downloaded as part of camera maintenance. Data are compiled by the teacher, and shared and analyzed with the class. Schoolyard remote-camera captures from a given week are compared with previously monitored protected areas that are part of the TAO database. Protected areas are places with high-quality wildlife habitat that offer a resource with which to compare schoolyard captures. Data sets and photographs from protected areas are available to teachers through the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Project WILD (<email>jan.welsh@state.mn.us</email>). Data sets are complete for three Minnesota sites and two international sites (i.e., Soberania National Park, Panama, and Danum Valley, Borneo). Data are expressed per trapnight (i.e., one camera collecting photographs for one night) for a total of 140 trapnights.</p>
<p>Critical reflection is important in developing knowledge and understanding, and building personal decision-making skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053825913487888">Higgins, 2009</xref>). TAO is explicitly reflective. Each lesson begins with a prior-knowledge question to which students respond. That question is discussed with the class to allow students to share thoughts and ideas. Key questions are revisited at specified points in the curriculum to give students the opportunity to reflect on how much their ideas and knowledge have changed.</p>
<p>The body of each lesson is focused on an experiential, inquiry-based activity. Lessons focus student inquiry on topics about how wildlife richness and abundance change as high-quality wildlife habitat is reduced and converted into small, isolated patches. Lessons are designed to help students make connections about the health of their schoolyard habitat for wildlife based on their remote-camera captures. Early in the curriculum, students use a map of the schoolyard created using Google Earth to document animal sign (e.g., tracks, scat, dens). During key lessons, students build Excel spreadsheets and graphs to analyze remote-camera captures. Students compare their graphs with graphs from a protected area. Students compare number and identity of species captured, number of captures per species, and times of high animal activity. The curriculum also features a 3-week series of lessons using Google Earth to quantify schoolyard and protected-area habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Each lesson ends with a reflection question and a TAO. The reflection question is used in the same manner as the prior-knowledge question. Reflection questions extend student thinking related to a lesson and issues of wildlife habitat, and allow quiet reflective time to think and write about what was experienced in a lesson. In some TAOs, students are elected by the class to model specific behaviors (e.g., the class selects two students to write a letter to a local environmental organization); others are done independently outside of school (e.g., students extend the schoolyard lesson on documenting animal sign by spending 30 min at home searching for an animal sign).</p>
<p>Lesson components (i.e., prior-knowledge questions, experiential inquiry-based activity, reflection question, TAO) prepare students for their final lesson that brings all of their schoolyard learning together. In that final lesson, students use their knowledge to create a proposal for improving wildlife habitat in their schoolyard. Habitat-improvement proposals have included conducting a schoolyard clean-up day, planting native vegetation, and building structures for wildlife (e.g., nest boxes for birds, roosting boxes for bats, adding a water source for wildlife).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that the treatment (i.e., the TAO curriculum) would increase student knowledge, attitudes, and behavior confidence, intent, and practice about wildlife habitat. We hypothesized that attitudes would be more resistant to change and, therefore, would change less than knowledge and behaviors. We used a pre- and posttest comparison, and a comparison of posttest scores with a large baseline data set to assess student changes in knowledge, attitudes, and ERB.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The TAO curriculum was pilot-tested with students in Minnesota during fall 2008 and revised after that experience. The full 12-week curriculum was conducted with fifth-grade students in a school in eastern Minnesota (i.e., the treatment groups), during spring (<italic>n</italic> = 41 students in 2 intact classes) and fall (<italic>n</italic> = 52 students in 2 intact classes) semesters, 2009. An intact class is a classroom of students with a single primary classroom teacher. One of the authors (D. Tanner) worked with classroom teachers to deliver TAO content. Students at a separate school participated in control groups during spring (<italic>n</italic> = 42 students in 2 intact classes) and fall (<italic>n</italic> = 47 students in 2 intact classes) semesters, 2009. Schools were in the same school district, and represent students from small town neighborhoods, both approximately 30 min from a major metropolitan area. All classes conducted the same environmental science unit that is included in fifth-grade, Minnesota standards. Students in the treatment groups participated in TAO lessons in addition to their environment unit. Genders were evenly represented in the treatment (males, <italic>n</italic> = 45 and females, <italic>n</italic> = 48) and control groups (males, <italic>n</italic> = 44 and females, <italic>n</italic> = 45). A quasiexperimental, pretest, posttest, nonequivalent group design was used because it was not feasible to randomly assign students to treatment and control groups; intact classes were used in all cases (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053825913487888">Carrier, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A Student Opinion Survey (SOS) instrument was used to assess student learning and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior confidence, intent, and practice about issues of wildlife habitat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2010</xref>). The SOS was developed to measure results of TAO. Validation of the instrument was conducted using a sample of 458 fifth-grade students. Cluster analysis was used to identify groupings of questions and determine baseline student responses. More detail about this instrument is available in a separate article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2010</xref>). The instrument contains 37 items: 4 short-answer knowledge items, 12 Likert-type scaled attitude items, 14 Likert-type scaled behavior items, and 7 self-reported behavior practice frequency items. Attitude and Likert-type scaled behavior items had 5 points: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. The most proenvironmental response to each item was scored 5, while the least proenvironmental response was scored 1. Behavior practice items were frequencies, ranging from 0 to &gt;5 following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053825913487888">Wilke, Hungerford, Volk, and Bluhm (1995)</xref>. Scoring ranged from 1 (<italic>no action</italic>) through 5 (<italic>4 or more actions</italic>).</p>
<p>As part of development and testing of the SOS, a baseline study was conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, and ERBs of the 458 fifth-grade students. Students in the baseline sample represented urban (<italic>n</italic> = 96), suburban (<italic>n</italic> = 110), small town (<italic>n</italic> = 147), and rural (<italic>n</italic> = 105) youth. The gender balance of the sample was nearly even (i.e., 244 females, 214 males). Questions on the SOS were derived from the literature:<disp-quote>
<p>Knowledge questions (<italic>n</italic> = 4) were based on research findings on student-schoolyard biodiversity knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053825913487888">Lindemann-Matthies, 2002</xref>). Attitude questions (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were based on items previously published in EE literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053825913487888">Leeming, Dwyer, &amp; Bracken, 1995</xref>); one was incorporated from the Student Self-Report of Attitudes (Ernst personal communication), and three were developed to specifically address habitat loss and landscape fragmentation. Behavior items (<italic>n</italic> = 21) were developed at three levels in each of three categories. Categories were based on The Middle School Environmental Literacy Instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053825913487888">Wilke et al., 1995</xref>) and included ecomanagement, persuasion, and political activism. Behavior levels included: behavior confidence, behavior intent, and behavior practice. The Student Opinion Survey explicitly measures ERB by asking how confident students feel about wildlife-habitat improvement ERB, if they intend to participate in specific ERB, and frequency of participation in ERB. All scale-based questions were randomized before the instrument was administered. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2010</xref>, p. 421)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The SOS instrument was administered at the beginning and end of each semester; treatment and control groups completed the pre- and posttests during the same school week. Responses were analyzed using one-sided matched-pairs <italic>t</italic> tests in JMP version 8.0.1, and MANOVAs on the difference scores between pre- and posttests in R, version 2.9.1. Results were compared with the baseline sample (<italic>n</italic> = 458) of Minnesota fifth graders, which served as a reference condition. Comparisons were made among the baseline study, pre-, and posttests for all control and treatment groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1053825913487888" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Pretest responses for treatment and control group on the SOS were similar to the reference condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2010</xref>) across all categories. Control group posttest scores also reflected baseline scores, while treatment group posttest scores were significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Knowledge questions about wildlife habitat were similar among pretreatment, pre- and postcontrol groups, and baseline students. The posttreatment groups showed increases in number of correct responses per student, increased number of categories used to express written responses, and decreased frequency of “I don’t know.” When asked to consider an animal and describe its habitat, students in the treatment groups reported native species more frequently than did students in baseline and controls (87% vs. 61% listed native species, respectively), and the number of students who answered “none” was reduced in the treatment groups (0% vs. 5%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053825913487888">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053825913487888">Figure 1</xref>). When asked how the ways people build houses, towns, and roads change habitat for wildlife, treatment groups had a wider diversity of answers and the number of students who did not know was reduced from 15% in baseline and control groups to 1% in the posttest treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053825913487888">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053825913487888">Figure 2</xref>). The SOS contained a short-answer question that asked how houses, towns, and roads can be changed to improve wildlife habitat. This question was the most difficult question for baseline and control students; “I don’t know” was their most frequent answer (25%). Only 5% of the treatment group responses on the posttests were “I don’t know” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1053825913487888">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053825913487888">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>There were dramatic differences in the number of species students’ were able to list as being found in the schoolyard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1053825913487888">Figure 3</xref>). Students in the baseline study listed few species of mammals and birds that they thought would be found in their schoolyard (<italic>M</italic> = 3.86, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.14, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2010</xref>). In the treatment groups, pretest scores were similar to the baseline scores. After participating in TAO, students listed significantly more bird and mammal species (<italic>M</italic> = 11.80, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.57 spring 2009; <italic>M</italic> = 10.21, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.80 fall 2009).

Student attitude scores were higher in the spring than the fall semester control group. Because the control group difference was significant, individual semesters were analyzed separately for each test in the analysis. Gender was not a significant influence in the spring or fall treatment groups, MANOVA, <italic>F</italic>(5, 87) = 1.53, <italic>p</italic> = .19, <italic>df</italic> = 1, or the control groups, MANOVA, <italic>F</italic>(5, 82) = 1.19, <italic>p</italic> = .32, <italic>df</italic> = 1.

<p>Difference scores were analyzed among the 33 scaled questions between the treatment and control groups to determine change in scores for attitudes and three behavior categories. Differences between treatment and control groups were significant for spring 2009, MANOVA, <italic>F</italic>(5, 76) = 10.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>df</italic> = 1, and fall 2009, MANOVA, <italic>F</italic>(5, 93) = 24.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>df</italic> = 1. The Bonferroni post hoc test demonstrated that differences were not due to chance (i.e., <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Therefore, ANOVA was used to determine whether the difference for each category of question was significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1053825913487888">Table 5</xref>). All categories (i.e., attitude, behavior confidence, behavior intent, behavior practice, and list of schoolyard species) differed significantly between the treatment and control groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The size of that difference was largest for behavior practice for spring 2009 and fall 2009 (spring 2009, <italic>t</italic> value = 5.22; fall 2009, <italic>t</italic> value = 7.34), indicating that students in the treatment groups changed more in the behavior practice category than in the remaining categories.</p>

<p>Student journal writings supported results of the TAO curriculum in changing their knowledge, attitudes, and ERB about wildlife habitat in the treatment groups. A couple of student excerpts demonstrate improved understanding of local wildlife and feeling of empowerment in taking part in ERB.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I would expect to see more abundance of wildlife in [our schoolyard] because there are fewer buildings and roads and a lot of grasses and trees that animals can use as habitat. (Summer, age 10)</p>
<p>A lot of animals surprised me in the schoolyard. I completely didn’t expect to see gray fox or Virginia opossums because I had no idea they were here. I would like to help plant more native plants and do more camera studies to make our habitat even better. (Isaac, age 11)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>TAO incorporates components of experiential environmental education identified as important in changing ERB. When these components are used well, they can help educators reach goals of developing citizens that are active, informed, and prepared to take part in improving habitat for wildlife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053825913487888">Ernst &amp; Stanek, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053825913487888">Hines et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053825913487888">Hungerford &amp; Volk, 1990</xref>). Behaviors that students reported doing on the behavior practice portion of the SOS included picking up trash, participating in habitat-improvement projects, writing letters to environmental organizations, talking about wildlife issues, and presenting ideas to school and community leaders. Students demonstrated increased sense of ownership in their schoolyard. During the final TAO lesson, students work in small groups to build proposals for habitat improvement in the schoolyard. Students vote for the project they would most like to implement. After TAO is completed, students and teachers have the opportunity to extend student learning to implement a habitat-improvement proposal. In the treatment school, teachers and students proposed and received funding from the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) to implement habitat-improvement projects. Students were eager to spend time outside in the schoolyard, and they made statements that showed their lack of prior familiarity with schoolyard and neighborhood habitat.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>TV and movies always make animals seem so scary. This isn’t as scary as I thought it was. The animals aren’t either. (Wil, age 10)</p>
<p>I can’t wait to go home and start exploring. I never thought about looking for animals near my house. I have lots of trees there, and I bet there are animals there too. (Abby, age 10)</p>
<p>I was shocked to see red fox in our schoolyard. I wonder if they come to my yard too! (Jacob, age 11)</p>
<p>Student written responses to prior-knowledge and reflection questions support that students expanded their knowledge about schoolyard habitat. Students also demonstrated that they learned about habitat quality in the protected area used for comparison and were able to contrast that habitat with the quality of their schoolyard habitat. Bradley offers an example: “I learned that handling a park is tough. You have to know a lot about habitat to run a park. You have to be wise.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students improved their understanding of wildlife living in their schoolyard and increased their ability to discuss what they can do to improve habitat. Improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and ERB demonstrate an ability to connect students to schoolyard-habitat issues. Significant life experiences about the environment during childhood are often cited by environmental leaders and professionals as the reason they decided to work on environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487888">Chawla, 1998</xref>). Student comments indicated that TAO served as a significant life experience for them, setting up the potential for long-term effects. For example,<disp-quote>
<p>I had never thought about taking biology classes when I get to middle school and high school, but now I will definitely take those classes. (Keith, age 10)</p>
<p>When I get older, I want to be a biologist. I want to use camera research to learn more about Virginia opossums because they are so interesting, and I had no idea there were so many where I live. I want to learn everything about them . . . and how we can make their habitat better. (Corri, age 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students became more knowledgeable about the mammal and bird species that live in their schoolyard, significantly increasing their performance in listing schoolyard species from a mean of 3.86 species in baseline analyses of fifth graders to 10.21 to 11.80 after TAO instruction. Classes participating in TAO shifted from a high percentage of students thinking about distant, charismatic species that would not be found in their local area to a majority of students focusing on species that are likely to be found in their schoolyard. After completing the curriculum, no student reported that they could not list a species and describe its habitat. We interpret that change as an increased sense of place and increased probability of taking action to improve one’s own place (i.e., the schoolyard and community).</p>
<p>Student knowledge of what constitutes habitat for wildlife improved in the treatment group posttests. Students answered questions about how they understand healthy wildlife habitats and ways people can improve wildlife habitats such as, “People build houses, roads, and towns. How do you think this changes wildlife habitat?” and “Describe ways you think our houses, roads, and towns could be changed to improve wildlife habitat.” Compared with baseline data and control groups, treatment group students were able to list more ideas for each posttest question, and their ideas were more varied. The proportion of students who did not know how to answer was reduced from 16% to 1% for ways that people change wildlife habitat and from 26% to 5% for ways people can improve wildlife habitat. Treatment group students were more knowledgeable about wildlife living in their schoolyard, and they had more ideas about how to improve habitat for wildlife. Remote-camera data collection and analysis combined with active science lessons helped build a strong base of knowledge about local habitat, and improved students’ abilities to communicate their new understanding.</p>
<p>All student groups started out with high mean attitude scores, as expected. By ages 10 to 13, students have been exposed to educational units about the environment and received numerous messages about the environment from the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487888">Hanna, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053825913487888">Palmberg &amp; Kuru, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053825913487888">Randler et al., 2005</xref>). The media play a major role: Children receive 83% of their information about the environment from media sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487888">Coyle, 2005</xref>). Treatment group gains in attitude were significant, but were not as large as gains in each of the three behavior categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1053825913487888">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Positive environmental attitudes are important antecedents of ERB, but children and adults with proenvironmental attitudes do not necessarily feel empowered or understand how to take action on environmental issues. Behavior categories for this study included ERB focused on stewardship, ecomanagement, persuasion, and political action (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1053825913487888">Wilke et al., 1995</xref>). These behaviors were surveyed at a range of difficulty from picking up litter, to writing letters to environmental decision makers, and talking about wildlife habitat issues with families and school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1053825913487888">Tanner, 2010</xref>). Students’ experiences in participating in ERB helped to build their confidence in ERB skills, intention to participate in ERB, and self-reported frequency of practicing ERB. The goal of increasing behavior practice was supported throughout the curriculum, and results showed that practice was the area of strongest gain among the categories of attitude, behavior confidence, behavior intent, and behavior practice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1053825913487888">Table 5</xref>). Students’ weekly written reflections provided evidence of increased personal awareness that they were empowered to take part in ERB. Students frequently wrote original ideas about activities with which they would like to work because they took part in using schoolyard-wildlife cameras. Connecting students’ schoolyard discoveries to quantitative science was critical in moving a series of wildlife photographs from novel disconnected images to focused analysis about schoolyard-habitat quality. Students who participated in TAO increased their knowledge about schoolyard species and ways that schoolyard habitat can be improved for wildlife, attitudes about issues of habitat loss and landscape fragmentation, and confidence, intent, and frequency of practicing environmental behaviors.</p>
<p>Gender differences were an interesting area of this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053825913487888">Carrier (2009)</xref> found that boys scored significantly higher than girls on scores for environmental knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and comfort levels in the schoolyard. She used an outdoor treatment group compared with a control group of students participating in the same lessons taught in a traditional classroom setting. We found that girls scored consistently higher than boys across all categories, but that girls’ and boys’ gains were not significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Girls reported higher scores in attitude, behaviors, and listing schoolyard biodiversity, but boys and girls gained the same amount through their participation in TAO. This is a promising result showing that teachers using TAO have an ability to reach girls and boys equally using schoolyard science practices that use innovative technology and active learning with remote cameras.</p>
<p>Curricula that combine experiential, interdisciplinary approaches and connect students through learner-centered exercises to their local environments can help educators reach the goal of building sustainability-literate citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053825913487888">Lugg, 2007</xref>). This field test demonstrated significant gains in ERB, especially in behavior practice. Girls had a higher level of knowledge than boys on the pretest, but both gained equally through TAO. This engaging approach linked students to their schoolyard and to a range of wildlife habitats, providing opportunities for students to increase their confidence, intent, and frequency to participate in wildlife habitat ERB, building a foundation for sustainability-literate, active citizens.</p>
<p>More general lessons from this work show that a concerted and intentional effort to focus on the local environment helped students better understand activities they could do and supported efforts to participate in ERB. A structure of practical steps that build upon each other throughout the course of the curriculum was important in building students’ confidence and skills. Guided reflection incorporated in the open and close of each lesson helped students focus their learning and understand their progression of acquiring new knowledge and applying that knowledge in new settings.</p>
