<sec id="sec1-1078155212462439"><title>Background</title>
<p>The development of monoclonal antibodies in the last few decades has advanced cancer therapy by providing more targeted therapy towards tumor cells. By interfering with specific receptors or antigens, monoclonal antibodies can incite antitumor activity through a variety of mechanisms – activation of host immune response to tumor cells, delivery of cytotoxic molecules into tumor cells, or inhibition of downstream cell signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462439">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212462439">2</xref></sup> There are currently over a dozen monoclonal antibodies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer treatment with many more in the pipeline. The first monoclonal antibody to be approved for the treatment of a malignant indication was rituximab. Targeting CD20 surface receptors on normal and malignant B cells, rituximab is currently being used as both monotherapy and in conjunction with other antineoplastic agents for the treatment of many other malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212462439">2</xref></sup> Additionally, rituximab is utilized for the treatment of non-malignant indications including autoimmune disorders and chronic graft-versus-host disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462439">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212462439">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Monoclonal antibodies are considered to be a form of biological therapy. In order to preserve protein viability and decrease bacterial contamination, these drugs must be stored and prepared at specific manufacturer guidelines. All monoclonal antibodies are available as preservative-free single-use (or single-dose) vials that should not be reused for additional doses, with the exception of trustumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212462439">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212462439"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212462439">12</xref></sup> This can lead to considerable drug waste when doses that do not use an entire vial are prescribed. With the development of newer and more expensive biological therapies, drug waste translates to considerable economic loss. The financial and clinical impact of dose-rounding of chemotherapy (including monoclonal antibodies) has been reported to be beneficial, leading to significant cost savings without any significant associated increase in toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212462439">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212462439"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212462439"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212462439">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of dose-rounding rituximab to the nearest available vial size and to potentially develop institution based guidelines for the dosing of all monoclonal antibodies. In addition, we conducted a physician opinion survey to assess the general consensus of dose-rounding rituximab.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1078155212462439" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was a retrospective chart review of electronic medical records from October 2008 through September 2010 of all rituximab orders prescribed for hematologic or oncologic indications at Stanford Hospital and Clincs. We looked at the potential deviation from the prescribed dose to the dose of the nearest vial size. Data collected include patient demographics and dose prescribed. Drug cost data was obtained from the pharmacy department’s purchasing division. Patients actively enrolled in clinical research trials were excluded. Additionally, medical oncologists and hematologists at this institution were surveyed to assess their acceptability with percent dose deviation when doses of rituximab are rounded to the nearest vial size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1078155212462439" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Over a period of 24 months, there were 2028 rituximab orders processed through the pharmacy for a hematologic or oncologic indication. We performed a theoretical analysis of rounding rituximab doses, which ranged between 100 mg and 1300 mg. Dose was rounded up or down, based on 100 mg vials sizes. The percent dose deviation was calculated for each dose and the least of the two was taken. For example, a 105 mg dose would be rounded down to 100 mg (4.8% dose deviation) rather than rounded up to 200 mg (90.5% dose deviation). Dose deviation after rounding analysis was evaluated and compared. Of these orders, 153 required no rounding. Seven hundred and eighty nine orders could be rounded down to the nearest vial size. The remaining 1086 orders could be rounded up to the nearest vial size. When rounded up or down, 66.1% of all rituximab orders were less than 5% deviation of the actual dose while 25.7% of all orders were within 6–10%. Less than 1% of all rounded doses deviated greater than 10% of actual dose. In total, if these orders were rounded up or down to the nearest vial size, 99.4% of all rituximab doses would fall within 10% deviation from original dose ordered.</p>
<p>From our survey of 51 hematology and oncology physicians, we received 19 responses. Four physicians reported that they do not prescribe rituximab often. Six physicians (40%) reported to be comfortable with a 5% or less difference in dose deviation if rounding to the nearest vial. Five physicians (33%) reported to be comfortable with a 10% or less difference in dose deviation. The remaining four physicians (27%) were comfortable with a greater than 10% dose deviation.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1078155212462439" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rituximab, like many monoclonal antibodies is available only as single-use vials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462439">1</xref></sup> According to the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC), single-use vials are designed for use in a single patient for a single case/procedure/injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212462439">3</xref></sup> The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter 797 standards for sterile compounding also follow a similar definition as single-use vials may not contain proper preservatives to protect against contamination and instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212462439">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212462439">18</xref></sup> Utilization of single-use vials for multiple patients by health care personnel have resulted in reported cases of contamination and spread of infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212462439">19</xref></sup> However, most of these cases were not performed in a clean room or under aseptic technique, which may have further compromised the integrity of the vials and final parental product.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212462439">20</xref></sup> Interestingly, USP Chapter 797 standards for sterile compounding allow single-use vials to be used up to 6 hours from initial needle puncture if initial puncture was performed in an ISO Class 5 air environment or better.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212462439">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212462439">18</xref></sup> This can lead to considerable confusion regarding whether or not the remainder of the vials may be used a second time within the 6 hour time frame. If this were the case, scheduling patients on the same day would be vastly beneficial.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a different perspective on the issue of dose rounding. When clinically appropriate, they encourage efficient utilization of drugs and biologics through methods such as scheduling two or more patients who are receiving the same drug on the same day. When such strategies are not feasible and the remainder of single-use vials must be discarded, CMS provides payment for the amount of drug or biologic discarded in addition to the amount administered. For example, if a patient is prescribed 645 mg of rituximab, the infusion center can additionally bill CMS for the 55 mg of rituximab wasted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212462439">21</xref></sup> Although this practice provides strong financial incentive for cancer centers to bill for wasted drug, this may hinder the practice of rounding to nearest vial sizes.</p>
<p>Both safety and efficacy should be considered when dose rounding is undertaken. Rituximab’s anticancer properties are dependent on the binding and saturation of CD20 receptors on malignant cells. Early phase I dose-escalating trials of rituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma have demonstrated no dose-limiting toxicity for doses ranging from 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> up to 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. In addition, there has not been any established relationship between dose and frequency or severity of adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212462439">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078155212462439">23</xref></sup> While the lack of increased toxicity with dose escalating rituximab can be extrapolated to support minimal risk associated with dose rounding up, there is no data addressing clinical efficacy with rounding down. A physician opinion survey was used to determine the maximal dose deviation for clinical efficacy.</p>
<p>We have shown that of the physicians that responded to our survey, all responders considered at least a 5% deviation in dose to be acceptable. Over a 12 month period, this potentially allowed for 66.1% of all rituximab orders to be rounded: 313 orders rounded down and 357 orders rounded up. This could result in saving 6712 mg of rituximab from being wasted due to rounding down and 7735 mg of rituximab being utilized. While rounding up may seem like a potential increase in utilization, this is actually a reduction in wastage. Based upon our acquisition cost of US$563.22 per 100 mg vial of rituximab, we projected a saving of approximately US$37,803 through rounding down and capturing additional cost of $43,568 through rounding up. Of note, most of the survey responders were comfortable with at least 10% dose deviation (60%), projecting a potential saving of approximately US$55,861 through rounding down and capturing additional cost of US$90,595 through rounding up.</p>
<p>Over recent years, pharmacy departments have looked to minimize cost through maximizing labor efficiency and closely monitoring inventory and procedures. Through our daily experience compounding medications, we have noticed that rituximab vials, like many other injectable medications, contain a small amount overfill. Anecdotally, we have discovered this to be approximately 2–3 mg per 100 mg vial. This fortuitously allows us to occasionally prepare some doses of rituximab without having to open another vial which would result in wasting of the remaining unused drug. For example, a 720 mg dose of rituximab can be prepared with only seven 100 mg vials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212462439" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our retrospective analysis evaluated the feasibility of dose rounding a biological agent. We chose to evaluate only rituximab when it was prescribed for a malignant indication. Based on our potential calculated cost savings, cost capturing and our physician opinion consensus of rounding to the nearest vial within 5% of actual dose calculated, our study shows that dose rounding can have tremendous financial implications if applied to other monoclonal antibodies on the market. However, it is important to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data of these agents. In addition, with the substantial surge in cost of new biological agents entering the market, efforts to minimize unnecessary drug waste has become more important than ever.</p>
