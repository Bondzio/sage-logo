<abstract>
<p>The authors test the hypothesis that low-effort thought promotes political conservatism. In Study 1, alcohol intoxication was measured among bar patrons; as blood alcohol level increased, so did political conservatism (controlling for sex, education, and political identification). In Study 2, participants under cognitive load reported more conservative attitudes than their no-load counterparts. In Study 3, time pressure increased participants’ endorsement of conservative terms. In Study 4, participants considering political terms in a cursory manner endorsed conservative terms more than those asked to cogitate; an indicator of effortful thought (recognition memory) partially mediated the relationship between processing effort and conservatism. Together these data suggest that political conservatism may be a process consequence of low-effort thought; when effortful, deliberate thought is disengaged, endorsement of conservative ideology increases.</p>

<body>
<p>Conservative political ideology in Western democracies may be identified by several components, including an emphasis on personal responsibility, acceptance of hierarchy, and a preference for the status quo. These ideological components map closely onto nonideological psychological processes, which support attitudes consistent with political conservatism. We describe how attitudes and behaviors consistent with these components increase as a consequence of thinking that requires little time, effort, or awareness. From this starting point, we develop the argument that political conservatism is promoted when people rely on low-effort thinking. When effortful, deliberate responding is disrupted or disengaged, thought processes become quick and efficient; these conditions promote conservative ideology.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167212439213">
<title>Perceptions of Personal Responsibility</title>
<p>People prefer “person” explanations for the causes of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167212439213">Heider, 1958</xref>), drawing dispositional inferences about those whose behavior they have observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167212439213">Gilbert &amp; Malone, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0146167212439213">Ross, 1977</xref>). This resembles conservative ideology’s emphasis on self-reliance and personal responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0146167212439213">Skitka &amp; Tetlock, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0146167212439213">1993</xref>). Political conservatism has been linked to Protestant Work Ethic values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167212439213">Feather, 1984</xref>), and conservatives are more likely than liberals to make dispositional attributions in numerous domains, including obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167212439213">Crandall, 1994</xref>), misfortune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0146167212439213">Williams, 1984</xref>), poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0146167212439213">Zucker &amp; Weiner, 1993</xref>), unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167212439213">Feather, 1985</xref>), and intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0146167212439213">Skitka, Mullen, Griffin, Hutchinson, &amp; Chamberlin, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>These person explanations occur quickly and easily. Perceivers automatically code behavior in terms of traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0146167212439213">Uleman, Newman, &amp; Moskowitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0146167212439213">Winter &amp; Uleman, 1984</xref>); these traits form the basis of dispositional explanations for behavior that occur with little effort. For example, perceivers are more likely to make internal attributions for behavior when their mental resources are taxed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212439213">Gilbert, Pelham, &amp; Krull, 1988</xref>); without sufficient cognitive resources, people emphasize dispositional causes. In brief, endorsement of personal responsibility represents one component of political conservatism that occurs easily and efficiently.</p>

<sec id="section2-0146167212439213">
<title>Acceptance of Hierarchy</title>
<p>People accept and maintain status differences between people and groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167212439213">Berger, Cohen, &amp; Zelditch, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167212439213">Jost &amp; Banaji, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0146167212439213">Ridgeway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0146167212439213">Sidanius &amp; Pratto, 1999</xref>). This acceptance of hierarchy is also a core component of political conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212439213">Bobbio, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, &amp; Sulloway, 2003</xref>). Research links acceptance of hierarchy to political conservatism empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0146167212439213">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994</xref>), and opposition to equality is related to endorsement of conservative social policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167212439213">Jost &amp; Thompson, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Acceptance of hierarchy is also simple and efficient. Status distinctions are discerned quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0146167212439213">Moors &amp; De Houwer, 2005</xref>) and easily (e.g., when only “thin slices” of information are available; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167212439213">Ambady, Bernieri, &amp; Richeson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167212439213">Costanzo &amp; Archer, 1989</xref>). Members of low status groups accept status differences implicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167212439213">Jost, Pelham, &amp; Carvallo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0146167212439213">Rudman, Feinberg, &amp; Fairchild, 2002</xref>), and people maintain interpersonal hierarchical differentiation by complementing the dominant or submissive posture of an interaction partner (by being more submissive or dominant, respectively) without awareness of doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0146167212439213">Tiedens &amp; Fragale, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0146167212439213">Zitek and Tiedens (2011)</xref> found that hierarchy is perceived, remembered, and learned more easily (and liked more) than nonhierarchical arrangements. Together these data indicate that acceptance of hierarchy—a second component of political conservatism—proceeds in the absence of effortful information processing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0146167212439213">
<title>Preference for the Status Quo</title>
<p>Preference for the status quo represents a third component of political conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167212439213">Bobbio, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167212439213">Burke, 1790/1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0146167212439213">McClosky &amp; Zaller, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0146167212439213">Stone, 1994</xref>). A host of psychological mechanisms advantage the processing and endorsement of the status quo. What comes first impacts judgment more than what comes later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167212439213">Asch, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167212439213">Jones &amp; Goethals, 1972</xref>), established decisions tend to be repeated in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0146167212439213">Samuelson &amp; Zeckhauser, 1988</xref>), and the familiar is experienced more favorably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167212439213">Festinger, Schachter, &amp; Back, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0146167212439213">Zajonc, 1968</xref>). Across several domains, perceivers simply assume that existing and long-standing states are good and desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212439213">Eidelman, Crandall, &amp; Pattershall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212439213">Eidelman, Pattershall, &amp; Crandall, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These mechanisms operate quickly and efficiently. Primacy effects are enhanced under time pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167212439213">Kruglanski &amp; Freund, 1983</xref>), and the effect of exposure on evaluation is strongest when stimuli are processed outside of awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167212439213">Bornstein, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167212439213">Bornstein &amp; D’Agostino, 1992</xref>). Status quo bias increases as a function of the number of alternatives, implying a simple and efficient strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167212439213">Kempf &amp; Ruenzi, 2006</xref>). Participants’ preference for existing states is unaffected by having their mental resources taxed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167212439213">Eidelman et al., 2009</xref>), and they seem unaware that time in existence increases liking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167212439213">Eidelman et al., 2010</xref>). These findings indicate that status quo endorsement—another component of political conservatism—requires little time, effort, and awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167212439213">Eidelman &amp; Crandall, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Low-Effort Thought and Political Conservatism</title>
<p>Emphasis on personal responsibility, acceptance of hierarchy, and preference for the status quo are linked to fast and efficient ways of processing information; each may be quickly and easily endorsed, often outside of awareness and with little or no effort. Because these and other components of political conservatism (e.g., self-interest; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0146167212439213">Moore &amp; Loewenstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0146167212439213">van den Bos, Peters, Bobocel, &amp; Ybema, 2006</xref>) are closely linked to automatic, default processes, we predict that restricting people to simple and basic modes of thought will lead to the acceptance of conservative attitudes and values. Taxing, limiting, or otherwise disengaging effortful, deliberative thought should increase endorsement of conservative ideology.</p>
<p>Alternatively, low-effort thought might promote political conservatism because its concepts are easier to process, and processing fluency increases attitude endorsement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212439213">Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2009</xref>). Another form of this argument is that those who espouse politically conservative attitudes and opinions handle ideological information in a more cursory manner (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0146167212439213">Tetlock, 1983</xref>). These ideas have support, but are distinct from our claim. We argue that low-effort information processing promotes the ideological <italic>content</italic> of political conservatism. When time and effort are in short supply, emission of responses consistent with conservative ideology should increase.</p>
<p>The motivated social cognition approach of Jost and his colleagues also underscores the content of conservative ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2007</xref>). These researchers argue that the endorsement of political conservatism stems from needs to manage threat and uncertainty; the stability, predictability, and certainty attached to conservative political concepts are thought to provide an additional means through which these needs might be secured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212439213">Chirumbolo, Areni, &amp; Sensales, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>). The motivated social cognition account emphasizes how conservatism is well suited to satisfy epistemic and security needs, but we underscore how conservative ideology will arise as a <italic>process</italic> consequence of low-effort thought. Low-effort processing may be used independent of needs for stability and certainty; our account is that low-effort thought <italic>alone</italic> will promote political conservatism.</p>
<p>We tested these ideas in four studies. Study 1 was conducted in vivo at a local bar, with alcohol intoxication serving as a hindrance to effortful thinking; political attitudes of bar patrons were correlated with a measure of their blood alcohol content (BAC). In Study 2, we measured participants’ political attitudes under normal working conditions or cognitive load. In Study 3, we manipulated time pressure and measured the endorsement of terms related to liberal and conservative beliefs. We expected alcohol, load, and time pressure to interfere with effortful information processing, leaving participants to lean more heavily on thinking that was easy and efficient. In Study 4, we manipulated effortful processing directly by asking participants to consider political terms in a deliberate or cursory manner. In all studies, we expected low-effort thought to promote conservative ideology.</p>

<sec id="section5-0146167212439213">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In Study 1, we took advantage of alcohol consumption as a common and powerful means of disrupting deliberative thought. Alcohol restricts cognitive capacity and impairs controlled responding (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167212439213">Abroms, Fillmore, &amp; Marczinski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167212439213">Easdon &amp; Vogel-Sprott, 2000</xref>) while leaving automatic thinking largely intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212439213">Bartholow, Dickter, &amp; Sestir, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167212439213">Fillmore, Vogel-Sprott, &amp; Gavrilescu, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167212439213">Herzog, 1999</xref>). If low-effort thought promotes political conservatism, the inability to process information thoroughly and override simple responding associated with increasing levels of alcohol intoxication should lead to the expression of more conservative attitudes.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0146167212439213">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Eighty-five community members (29% female) who were patrons of a local New England bar participated without remuneration. Mixed-sex groups of 3 to 4 experimenters obtained permission to stand outside the bar’s busiest exit and approach potential participants as they left. Participants were asked to complete a short survey about social attitudes in exchange for learning their BAC. Before collecting data, experimenters verified that each participant was at least 21 years of age and not driving. Those who met these criteria completed a short survey and then blew into a breathalyzer. Participants were apprised of their BAC and thanked for their assistance. They were given contact information so they could rescind participation at a later date if they saw fit (none did).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167212439213">
<title>Measurement of political conservatism</title>
<p>Participants completed a short survey that contained 10 items drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167212439213">Eysenck (1951</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167212439213">1975</xref>) that tapped various aspects of political conservatism (e.g., “Production and trade should be free of government interference” and “Ultimately, privately property should be abolished”). All items were answered on 9-point Likert-type scales (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 9 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) and combined to form an index of political conservatism (α = .62) with higher numbers, reverse-scored where necessary, indicating more conservative political attitudes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0146167212439213">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Participants also indicated how much education they had (1 = <italic>some high school</italic>; 2 = <italic>high school diploma</italic>; 3 = <italic>some college</italic>; 4 = <italic>college degree</italic>; 5 = <italic>masters degree</italic>; 6 = <italic>doctorate or equivalent</italic>) and their self-identification as liberal/conservative (1 = <italic>very liberal</italic>; 5 = <italic>very conservative</italic>). An experimenter coded participants’ sex as either male or female.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0146167212439213">
<title>Measurement of BAC</title>
<p>BAC was assessed with an Alco-Sensor FST breathalyzer (Intoximeters Inc., St. Louis, MO). Participants were asked to blow a steady stream of air into the breathalyzer until told to stop (when the LCD of the breathalyzer displayed a reading, typically 2 to 3 s from when the participant started to blow). Breathalyzers were calibrated prior to data collection and fresh mouthpieces were used for each participant.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0146167212439213">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants averaged some college education (<italic>M</italic> = 3.77, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.73), and they can be described ideologically as centrists (<italic>M</italic> = 2.45, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.05). Participants’ mean BAC level was .058, with a range of .00 to .18, and their mean endorsement of political conservatism was 4.96, with a range of 2.2 to 7.8. Self-identification as liberal/conservative was unrelated to BAC, <italic>r</italic> = −.14, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .18.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0146167212439213">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>To determine whether BAC was related to political conservatism, we regressed the 10-item conservatism index on participants’ self-identification as liberal/conservative, sex (0 = <italic>male</italic>; 1 = <italic>female</italic>), level of education, and BAC. Consistent with predictions, BAC was a significant predictor of political conservatism, β = .21, <italic>t</italic>(82) = 2.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02, over and above ideological self-identification, sex, and education. Not surprisingly, self-identification was also a significant predictor of participants’ political conservatism, β = .68, <italic>t</italic>(82) = 7.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, but neither sex (β = .01) nor level of education (β = .06) predicted political conservatism in the model (both <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .45).</p>
<p>We performed an additional regression analysis that included a squared BAC term and the interaction between ideological self-identification and BAC as additional predictors in the model to test for the possibility that the effect of BAC on political conservatism was (respectively) curvilinear or dependent on participants’ self-identification as liberal or conservative (these terms were computed after relevant variables were centered to control for multicollinearity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167212439213">Cohen, Cohen, West, &amp; Aiken, 2003</xref>). Neither of these predictors were related to political conservatism (both <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .94), whereas the effect of BAC on political conservatism remained significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0146167212439213">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bar patrons reported more conservative attitudes as their level of alcohol intoxication increased. Because alcohol limits cognitive capacity and disrupts controlled responding, while leaving automatic thinking largely intact (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167212439213">Bartholow et al., 2006</xref>), these data are consistent with our claim that low-effort thinking promotes political conservatism.</p>
<p>The interaction between BAC and self-identification as liberal/conservative was not significant, indicating that the relationship between BAC and conservatism held for those who leaned to the political left and the political right. As BAC increased and capacity for deliberative thought decreased, liberal and conservative participants shifted toward conservatism.</p>
<p>Our data are correlational, and the possibility of reverse causality remains—political conservatives may drink more alcohol. Although BAC was correlated with endorsement of politically conservative attitudes, it was unrelated to self-identification as liberal/conservative, and BAC predicted conservative attitudes when self-identification was statistically controlled. This suggests that a predisposition to ideological conservatism does not account for our results. Indeed, there is reason to expect that willingness to imbibe is, in general, negatively correlated with political conservatism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0146167212439213">Margulies, Kessler, &amp; Kandel, 1977</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0146167212439213">2</xref></sup></p>

Participants indicated their political attitudes by responding to several statements; half did so while their cognitive resources were depleted by working on a second task concurrently (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212439213">Gilbert et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0146167212439213">Wegner &amp; Erber, 1992</xref>). With their attention divided, participants with depleted resources should be less able to engage in deliberative thinking when reporting their political attitudes. If the output of low-effort thought is consistent with conservative ideology, participants with depleted resources should indicate more conservative attitudes than those with ample cognitive resources.</p>
<p>We also measured political liberalism in addition to political conservatism. Liberal political beliefs may be independent of conservative beliefs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167212439213">Kerlinger, 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212439213">1984</xref>), particularly among nonexperts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0146167212439213">Sidanius &amp; Duffy, 1988</xref>) and those unmotivated to form opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167212439213">Federico, 2007</xref>), and so our hypothesis is largely silent on the relationship between deliberate thought and liberalism. We made no firm predictions about the effect of load on liberalism other than to expect a pattern distinct from the effects of load on conservatism, which would indicate that load’s effect is not due to acquiescence or other nuisance processes.</p>
<p>We also measured participants’ mood to ensure that changes in political attitudes under cognitive load were not due to temporary changes in affect. To ensure that any effect of load was not due to differences in ease of processing or understanding, we asked an independent sample of participants to respond to the statements while we recorded response times, and another to rate each statement for its complexity. Statements were also compared for reading difficulty.</p>

<p>Participants indicated their political attitudes using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0146167212439213">Kerlinger’s (1984)</xref> Social Attitudes Statement Scale (SASS). The SASS treats liberalism and conservatism as distinct constructs. Thirteen items make up a liberalism subscale (e.g., “Large fortunes should be taxed fairly heavily over and above income taxes”; α = .69), and 13 items make up a conservatism subscale (e.g., “A first consideration of any society is the protection of property rights”; α = .69). All items were answered on 7-point Likert-type scales (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), with higher numbers indicating more of each construct.

The BMIS asks participants to indicate how they are feeling (e.g., <italic>active, sad, fed up</italic>) at the moment and has separate subscales for valence and arousal.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Participants under cognitive load reported more conservative attitudes than those not under cognitive load. Because cognitive load depletes available mental resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167212439213">Gilbert et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0146167212439213">Wegner &amp; Erber, 1992</xref>), participants were left to draw more heavily on thinking that was easy and efficient. We maintain that this thinking promotes political conservatism. Cognitive load also produced a corresponding shift in liberal attitudes; when under load, participants’ endorsement of political liberalism decreased.</p>
<p>Mood was not responsible for changes in participants’ political attitudes. Neither the arousal or valence scales of the BMIS were affected by our manipulation of cognitive load nor were participants’ self-reported frustration and annoyance. Similarly, the complexity and ease of processing of conservative and liberal statements did not differ. These are unlikely causes of the differential endorsement of conservatism and liberalism across load conditions.</p>

<title>Study 3</title>
<p>Time pressure also disrupts effortful thinking, forcing responses that are quick and efficient (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212439213">Bargh &amp; Thein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0146167212439213">Strack, Erber, &amp; Wicklund, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0146167212439213">Wegner &amp; Erber, 1992</xref>). We predicted that these conditions would promote conservative ideology. We operationalized conservative ideology in Study 3 as the endorsement of conservative words and phrases.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167212439213">Hansson, Keating, and Terry (1974)</xref> considered a similar hypothesis and gave participants either 2 min or unlimited time to respond to several ballot initiatives; time-pressed participants showed more support for ballot initiatives that could be considered politically conservative. We do not know whether low-effort thinking led to favoring political conservatism; the conservative initiatives may have been easier to understand and thus more appealing. Two minutes for reading, thinking about, and voting on several ballot initiatives might well have created arousal or negative mood, which could in turn lead to more conservative-consistent choices. We developed a study that provides a clearer test of time pressure’s effect on political attitudes. We again measured political liberalism separately from political conservatism, allowing us to distinguish potential changes for each ideology separately. This distinction could not be discerned from the results reported by Hansson and his colleagues.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When effortful thinking was disrupted by rapid presentation of words and phrases related to political conservatism, endorsement of these terms increased. Endorsement of terms related to political liberalism was not affected by time pressure. Time pressure forces reliance on information processing that is quick and efficient (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167212439213">Bargh &amp; Thein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0146167212439213">Strack et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0146167212439213">Wegner &amp; Erber, 1992</xref>). Study 3 joins Studies 1 and 2 in suggesting that this type of thinking promotes conservative ideology.</p>
<p>Arousal was affected by our time pressure manipulation, but it was not responsible for the effect of time pressure on conservatism. Although political conservatism has been linked to negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0146167212439213">Wilson, 1973</xref>), time pressure affected conservatism directly, rather than through mood.</p>
<p>Neither the response times to terms tapping political conservatism and political liberalism nor ratings of their complexity differed. This suggests that the increased preference for political conservatism was not because it was easier to understand or process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212439213">Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0146167212439213">Reber, Winkielman, &amp; Schwarz, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>One alternative account is that the manipulation of time pressure increased needs for cognitive closure. Need for closure reflects an aversion to uncertainty and a preference for clear and definitive answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0146167212439213">Kruglanski &amp; Webster, 1996</xref>), and both time pressure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167212439213">Heaton &amp; Kruglanski, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0146167212439213">Kruglanski &amp; Freund, 1983</xref>) and cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212439213">Ford &amp; Kruglanski, 1995</xref>) have been conceptualized as situational determinants of closure needs. Because political conservatism is thought to provide stability and certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>), our participants may have been drawn to it when under load and time pressure. If our claim that low-effort thought promotes conservative ideology is correct, it should be possible to increase conservatism via low effort thought independent of epistemic needs. This was the goal of Study 4.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section39-0146167212439213">
<title>Study 4</title>
<p>In our last study, we manipulated reliance on low-effort thought as simply and directly as possible. Participants endorsed political terms under instruction to consider each in either a deliberate or cursory manner. We expected participants who used little mental effort to endorse conservative ideology more than those who used deliberate processing. To confirm that our manipulation was not just another means of increasing epistemic motivation, we measured participants’ needs for closure and structure immediately following our processing manipulation.</p>
<p>We also sought direct evidence that low-effort processing was responsible for increases in political conservatism. Because depth of processing affects memory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212439213">Craik &amp; Tulving, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167212439213">Jacoby &amp; Dallas, 1981</xref>), we presented participants with a surprise recognition memory task at the end of the study; they were shown a number of political terms and asked to recognize which had been presented previously. We considered recognition accuracy to be an indicator of the extent to which participants relied on high-versus low-effort thinking, and expected it to be at least partially responsible for the relationship between our processing manipulation and endorsement of political conservatism.</p>

Participants indicated whether they had seen the exact term before by responding “yes” or “no.” We used signal detection analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0146167212439213">Swets, 1964</xref>) to determine participants’ response accuracy by calculating <italic>d</italic>′, the difference between the proportions of correct recognitions (“hits”) and false recognitions (“false alarms”) in standardized <italic>z</italic> scores (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0146167212439213">Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999</xref>). This measure controls for random guessing and biased responding; positive higher values indicate more accurate recognition of terms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Study 4 provides strong evidence that low-effort thought promotes political conservatism: The direct manipulation of effortful processing altered participants’ endorsement of conservative ideology. When instructed to use shallow processing, political conservatism generated more agreement than when participants were instructed to think hard. Because needs for closure and structure were unaffected by this manipulation—and were unrelated to political conservatism—epistemic motives make a poor explanation for these data.</p>
<p>Direct support for the role of low-effort thought in promoting political conservatism comes from meditational analyses. Depth of processing has downstream effects, including recall accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167212439213">Craik &amp; Tulving, 1975</xref>). Those instructed to use shallow processing had poorer recall at the end of the study, and recall accuracy was partially responsible for the link between processing style and conservatism. These results enhance confidence that our experimental manipulation of deliberation increases the care taken in processing. And when care, consideration, and cogitation increases, we find that endorsement of political conservatism decreases.</p>
<p>These findings were again limited to conservatism; there were no comparable or contrastive effects found for political liberalism. There seems to be something unique about the ideological content of political conservatism and its relation to low-effort thought.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section53-0146167212439213">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Four studies support our assertion that low-effort thinking promotes political conservatism. In Study 1, as alcohol intoxication increased among bar patrons in a community sample, so too did political conservatism (with participant sex, education level, and ideological self-identification partialled out). In Study 2, participants under cognitive load reported more conservative attitudes (and less liberal attitudes) than participants not under load. Time pressure (Study 3) and direct instruction to use low-effort thought (Study 4) increased endorsement of words and concepts related to political conservatism. Across these different measures, manipulations, and samples, data were consistent in suggesting that low-effort thought promotes conservative ideology.</p>
<p>Differences in the complexity of stimuli used to measure political conservatism cannot account for these findings. If conservative words, phrases, and statements were easier to understand than their liberal counterparts, we might expect our results to be mediated by processing fluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167212439213">Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0146167212439213">Reber et al., 1998</xref>). Yet independent ratings of complexity for conservative and liberal stimuli did not differ, nor did response times.</p>
<p>Several theorists have suggested a link between negative affect and conservatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212439213">Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswick, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0146167212439213">Wilson, 1973</xref>). In our studies, momentary changes in frustration, annoyance, and mood did not covary with changes in political attitudes, and the causal relationship between time pressure and political attitudes remained when arousal was statistically removed. Situationally induced shifts in negative affect do not appear responsible for the pattern of data found in our studies.</p>
<p>Our findings complement the motivated social cognition approach of Jost and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2007</xref>). According to this approach, the endorsement of political conservatism stems from needs to manage threat and uncertainty, and this approach could characterize the manipulations of load and time pressure as increasing participants’ needs for cognitive closure. When distracted or in a hurry, the cost of not having closure and the need to reach a quick, simple, and certain answer increases. Conservative ideology, in this account, is well suited to meet these needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167212439213">Chirumbolo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Like our own approach, the need for closure account emphasizes the unique content of conservative ideology, but there is also an important difference. According to the closure account, the ability of political conservatism to provide certainty and stability increases endorsement of this ideology under load and time pressure. In contrast, we maintain that conservative ideology matches the output of low-effort thought; epistemic needs may be sufficient to increase dependence on low-effort thinking (e.g., load is thought to increase the cost of not having closure <italic>because</italic> it requires more effort; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167212439213">Ford &amp; Kruglanski, 1995</xref>), but it is not necessary. We argue that the products of low-effort thought are consistent with political conservatism, and the data from Study 4 are consistent with this account, independent of closure needs.</p>
<sec id="section54-0146167212439213">
<title>Connections</title>
<p>We are not the first to link social-cognitive processes to the realm of politics. Historically, researchers have emphasized the storage, organization, and retrieval of political concepts, and how in consequence new information is processed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167212439213">Conover &amp; Feldman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0146167212439213">Lau &amp; Sears, 1986</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0146167212439213">McGraw, 2000</xref>, for a review). More recently, the motivated aspects of political cognition have been highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>). We are not at odds with these perspectives. Instead, we underscore an online, cognitive process by which political information is considered, interpreted, and evaluated to the favor of political conservatism.</p>
<p>We also distinguish our approach from research on ideology and cognitive style. Many have suggested that liberals and conservatives differ in the way they think, with those on the right of the political spectrum thought to process information in more simple-minded terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212439213">Adorno et al., 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0146167212439213">Stone, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0146167212439213">Tetlock, 1983</xref>). This hypothesis has support (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167212439213">Jost et al., 2003</xref>), but is not our claim. <italic>We argue that low-effort thinking promotes political conservatism, not that conservatives rely on low-effort thought</italic>. Similarly, we do not assert that conservatives fail to engage in effortful, deliberative thought but rather that disengagement of effortful thinking leads to cognitions consonant with political conservatism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0146167212439213">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ideology is multiply determined, coming from many sources, including values, experience, history, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167212439213">Conover &amp; Feldman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167212439213">George, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167212439213">Jost, Federico, &amp; Napier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0146167212439213">Lane, 1962</xref>). The processes we have studied suggest one modest link—early and important, but not dispositive. The wide variety of North American political beliefs reminds us to be restrained in interpreting these data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section55-0146167212439213">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The psychological foundation from which ideology is derived may not be neutral. Without the means or motive to override an initial impulse that promotes conservative ideology, the political scales may be tipped toward the right of center and may provide a contributing explanation for what has been described as a conservative bias in American politics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167212439213">Frank, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167212439213">Jost, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis also suggests that some forms of political ideology may result from intentional and effortful correction. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0146167212439213">Wänke and Wyer (1996)</xref> found that liberals scored higher than conservatives on the Attributional Complexity Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167212439213">Fletcher, Danilovics, Fernandez, Peterson, &amp; Reeder, 1986</xref>), an indicator that the former generate more complex and detailed (if not more effortful) explanations for the behavior of others. Skitka and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0146167212439213">Skitka et al., 2002</xref>; Study 4) analyzed interviews conducted for the 1987 National Election Studies and found that liberals were more than twice as likely as conservatives to correct an initial “person” attribution with a “situation” explanation in response to a question about government assistance. These correlational findings suggest that some instances of ideology may result from correction processes, overriding and adjusting initial conservative responses. Our experimental studies provide evidence of causal direction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section56-0146167212439213">
<title>Boundaries</title>
<p>It is quite likely that well-rehearsed, habitual political positions are unaffected by load, alcohol, or distraction—even when drunk, a longtime Republican does not think herself a Democrat, and a busy and highly distracted, committed liberal isn’t confused into endorsing conservative opinions.</p>
<p>We did not recruit extreme ideologues or the politically sophisticated, both of whom are efficient processors of political information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0146167212439213">Milburn, 1987</xref>). Those who are ideologically schematic may be resistant to manipulations of low-effort thought. People with strong political views—left or right—show more cognitive ability than broadly defined centrists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167212439213">Kemmelmeier, 2008</xref>), and the ideological or extreme liberal might demonstrate efficient thought processes that favor the left end of the political spectrum (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0146167212439213">Moskowitz, Gollwitzer, Wasel, &amp; Schaal, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>We also recognize the historical and cultural boundaries of our ideas and data. In a context where the components of conservatism we discussed are independent or not otherwise linked to political conservatism (e.g., if preference for hierarchy were linked to political liberalism), low-effort cognitive processing may not promote conservative ideology. The arrangement of what kinds of cognitions occur quickly and easily may be as culturally varied as the arrangements of political ideology by culture. There is little question that psychological process affect and are affected by culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0146167212439213">Schaller &amp; Crandall, 2004</xref>), and the same is true of political ideology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167212439213">Bisin &amp; Verdier, 2000</xref>). In a North American context, the evidence suggests that cognition is arranged to readily perceive responsibility and blame, to quickly notice and accept hierarchy, and to easily prefer the status quo. The argument for a broader cultural context is yet to be made.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Low-effort thinking promotes political conservatism. This claim provides a counterweight to early psychological perspectives on political ideology that tended to see conservatism in somewhat pathological terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167212439213">Adorno et al., 1950</xref>). Our findings suggest that conservative ways of thinking are basic, normal, and perhaps natural. Motivational factors are crucial determinants of ideology, aiding or correcting initial responses depending on one’s goals, beliefs, and values. Our perspective suggests that these initial and uncorrected responses lean conservative.</p>

In the 2006 data sample, more than 70% of these respondents had had an alcoholic drink (“more than a few sips”). We correlated political ideology with a measure of drinking, “On how many occasions (if any) have you had alcoholic beverages to drink—more than just a few sips during the last 12 months?” We found a negative correlation between conservatism and alcohol intake, <italic>r</italic> = −.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00001.

These data undermine the argument that the correlation in Study 1 is due to the greater likelihood of conservatives to imbibe; the population tendency seems to go in the opposite direction.</p>
