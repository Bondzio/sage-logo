<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To determine the role of intraoperative electrocochleography to optimize the fitting of the floating mass transducer of the Vibrant Soundbridge on the round window membrane in patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Prospective cohort study.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Tertiary referral center, Otolaryngology Department, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Twenty-six adult patients suffering from chronic otitis media with moderate to severe conductive and mixed hearing loss, all with previous unsuccessful functional surgery, underwent round window vibroplasty. Thirteen subjects had intraoperative compound cochlear action potentials measured to assess vibroplasty coupling during and after surgery. In these patients, surgery was modified according to electrocochleographic feedback. The other 13 had vibroplasty without electrocochleography monitoring.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. The average preoperative air conduction and bone conduction thresholds (0.5-4 kHz) were not statistically significantly different between the 2 cohorts (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Compound action potential recordings indicated specific surgical modalities to optimize coupling of the floating mass transducer with the round window membrane. The average postoperative Vibrant Soundbridge–aided air conduction threshold improvements (0.5-4 kHz) were 54.6 ± 8.9 and 41.7 ± 11.1 dB HL, respectively, in the monitored and unmonitored cohorts (<italic>P</italic> = .0032).</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. Improved round window vibroplasty outcomes are observed when the surgeon is promptly informed of the compound action potential changes induced by the floating mass transducer round window membrane vibroplasty and alters surgery accordingly. The key point for optimal coupling is a floating mass transducer in full contact with the round window membrane, free to vibrate without any contact with the surrounding bony structures and mobile footplate.</p>

<p>Active middle ear implants (AMEIs) have recently provided new therapeutic alternatives for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss. Fully or partially implanted AMEIs with the actuator fitted on the residual ossicular chain or on the round window (RW) membrane have demonstrated very promising outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811430808">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811430808">6</xref></sup> Indeed, the mechanical coupling of actuator with the RW membrane or with the footplate is more difficult to establish in patients with ossicular chain lesions in comparison with coupling to the normal long process of the incus, as done in patients with sensorineural hearing loss. For RW vibroplasty (VPL), several factors have been considered to improve the vibration transfer of the floating mass transducer (FMT) at the RW.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811430808">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430808">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effectiveness of RW VPL in restoring speech understanding in these patients has been associated with large variations in outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811430808">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811430808">15</xref></sup> To reduce the variability inherent in any surgical procedure, a strict and consistent surgical protocol should be followed, assisted by intraoperative monitoring procedures to validate the consistency and efficacy of the treatment.</p>
<p>Information on the quality of the coupling should be provided in real time, while surgery is ongoing, to allow the surgeon to decide whether to modify the surgical technique to optimize the outcome. To this end, a neurophysiological intraoperative monitoring (NIM) technique is needed.</p>
<p>Among the different auditory NIM techniques (electrocochleography [ECoG], auditory brainstem responses [ABRs], and auditory steady-state responses [ASSRs]), ECoG can appropriately satisfy these needs, furnishing large-amplitude cochlear potentials after several sweeps.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to assess whether ECoG, during RW VPL, provides useful feedback to the surgeon to immediately alter the surgical procedure so as to reduce possible damage to the cochlea, improve the RW VPL coupling, and, in revision cases, verify the function of the FMT and ultimately recouple the FMT to the RW to restore hearing.</p>
<sec id="section1-0194599811430808" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The most appropriate surgical technique to optimize the FMT–RW membrane coupling and improve the functional outcome was evaluated with the assistance of intraoperative ECoG monitoring. The patients were 26 adults suffering from chronic otitis media (15 undergoing canal wall-up and 11 canal wall-down tympanoplasty, all with previous unsuccessful functional surgery). All patients presented with moderate to severe mixed hearing loss. Thirteen subjects had intraoperative compound cochlear action potentials (CAP) measured to assess vibroplasty coupling during and after surgery. In these patients, surgery was modified according to ECoG feedback. The other 13 subjects, the historical control group, had vibroplasty without ECoG monitoring.</p>
<p>The following audiometric measures were collected preoperatively (preop) and postoperatively (postop) at 48-month follow-up: bone conduction (BC) and air conduction (AC) thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz; Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB)–aided AC threshold; VSB-aided air-bone gap (ABG); number of patients with overclosure and closure of the postop ABG to ≤10 or ≥30 dB HL; and speech understanding scores as a percentage for bisyllabic words correctly repeated at 65 dB HL. No patient was lost to follow-up.</p>
<p>In all patients, the VSB (manufactured by MED-EL Hearing Technology, Innsbruck, Austria) was used. The device characteristics, the surgical principles of RW FMT implantation, and device activation have been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811430808">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811430808">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811430808">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intraoperative ECoG recordings were performed with the Medelec Synergy N-EP (CareFusion, San Diego, California) or the Audera AEP/CAEP (GSI, Eden Prairie, Minnesota).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811430808">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811430808">17</xref></sup> The implant was activated by a 404 VSB audio processor directly connected to the recording system. The gain of the audio processor was set at 0. The output limiter, noise reduction, and speech enhancement features were turned off. ECoG was recorded using a custom-made cotton wick electrode (+) placed close to the RW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>) and 2 subdermal electrodes placed, respectively, over the ipsilateral tragus (−) and the sternum (“ground”). The stimuli presented were alternating clicks (11 pps) from 100 dB HL to the threshold level. ECoG potentials were filtered through a 3- to 3000-Hz bandpass filter and averaged over several responses (100 repetitions). The activation of the cochlea was assessed by the CAP threshold, and amplitude was assessed as a function of different RW membrane methods for stabilizing the FMT. The RW VPL coupling was examined with ECoG before and after (1) drilling of the RW bony lip and the bony floor facing the RW membrane, (2) removal of the secondary RW membrane, (3) avoidance of bony contact and placing fascia all around the FMT RW complex, (4) pushing the FMT 1 mm inside the RW niche, (5) placing a disk of cartilage on the lateral face of the FMT, and (6) stapedotomy on fixed stapes.</p>

(2) The FMT is pushed approximately 1 mm inside the RW niche, improving the contact with the RW membrane: ECoG shows lower thresholds (60 dB HL), higher amplitude (0.3 µV), and reduced latency (2.2 milliseconds) outcomes.

<p>ECoG outcome indicates 5 key points for optimal FMT–RW membrane coupling: (1) removing part of the bony lip to obtain a complete view of the RW membrane and a full RW membrane–FMT contact, (2) drilling on the bony floor facing the RW to facilitate a perpendicular FMT–RW membrane relationship, (3) interposing fascia between the FMT and RW membrane and all around the FMT to avoid contact with the surrounding bone, (4) locating the FMT approximately 1 mm inside the RW niche and placing a disk of cartilage on the lateral face of the FMT to ensure stability of the FMT–RW membrane coupling, and (5) verifying that the footplate is mobile and not limiting the vibromechanical input to the cochlea (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599811430808"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>In a subject with unsatisfactory ECoG results (improvement below 30 dB HL), after a good VPL procedure, stapes fixation was observed. ECoG recordings showed that improved performance in terms of CAP threshold (around 20 dB HL lower), latency (0.2-millisecond improvement), and amplitude (about 30% higher) could be obtained after a limited platinotomy covered with fascia.</p>
<p>Two patients in the control group, with ABG closure greater than 30 dB, were subsequently submitted to revision VPL with intraoperative ECoG measurements. It was in fact possible to identify an undiagnosed coexisting otosclerosis in one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811430808"><bold>D</bold></xref>) and a tympanosclerotic footplate fixation in the other, which was causing a substantial increase in input impedance at the RW. This was reflected by high-threshold and low-amplitude values of CAPs that presented an altered morphology with a clipping of the CAP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811430808"><bold>E</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this report was to verify the effectiveness of ECoG to monitor RW-VPL surgery by measuring acoustically evoked CAPs. The ultimate aim of the study was to endorse the utility of this methodology to be used routinely in the intraoperative setting as a guide to the different steps that allow a correct FMT placement onto the RW membrane to optimize VPL coupling and minimize the potential risks of cochlear damage.</p>
<p>Identification of the specific surgical steps and correlation between changes in electrophysiological CAP parameters and postoperative hearing are the prerequisites for using audio-monitoring techniques to prevent damage to auditory structures and obtain improved auditory outcome.</p>
<p>The monitored group showed a statistically significantly lower VSB-aided AC threshold compared with the unmonitored cohort (27.4 ± 9.7 vs 38.1 ± 10.4 dB HL; <italic>P</italic> = .0121) and a definitely improved VSB-aided ABG at 48 months (−15.7 ± 7.1 vs −3.6 ± 5.2 dB HL; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>
<p>Recently, 2 articles have reported on the utility of intraoperative monitoring in optimal RW membrane–FMT coupling with ASSR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811430808">18</xref></sup> and ECoG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811430808">19</xref></sup> in small subsets of subjects (4 and 3 patients). At the beginning of our investigation, we considered evaluating all of the parameters of the ECoG response (ie, cochlear microphonics [CM], summating potentials, and CAPs). It was soon realized that CAPs, in most cases, were more sensitive markers of early interaction between the surgical action and cochlear structures than CMs and that, when detected sufficiently early, they could suggest modifications in the surgical procedure to optimize VPL.</p>
<p>CAPs monitoring provided the opportunity to learn which surgical steps were potentially responsible for intraoperative cochlear function deterioration and how subtle changes in surgical technique accurately undertaken could significantly affect hearing restoration.</p>
<p>Complete removal of the RW bony lip to obtain a clear and complete view of the RW membrane and drilling of the bony floor facing the RW to precisely accommodate the FMT perpendicular to the RW membrane need to be performed with a low-speed diamond drill and with frequent pauses to avoid the risk of permanently damaging the high-frequency responses. Occasionally, drilling on the RW bony lip may produce a laceration of the RW membrane, and this induces temporary changes in CAPs. In fact, provided that no suction of perilymph has been performed, and that the RW membrane is immediately covered by fascia, no significant shifts in CAP parameters will be observed. These observations indicate that these steps do not significantly alter the normal physiologic response of the cochlea to acoustic stimuli to the point that hair cell function is lost.</p>
<p>The bony contact of the FMT with the surrounding structures limits the movements of the FMT by an increase in the resistive (friction) component of impedance. CAP amplitudes have been shown to be significantly affected by the presence or absence of a layer of soft and thick connective tissue placed on the bony floor under the FMT.</p>
<p>Highly significant variations in CAP thresholds, latencies, and amplitudes have been observed by optimizing the FMT–RW membrane interface by (1) removing any secondary RW membrane and interposing a thin piece of fascia between the FMT and the RW membrane (the fascia must be large enough to cover all around the portion of the FMT directly facing the RW niche), (2) ensuring a perpendicular and full contact between the RW membrane and the FMT, (3) pushing the medial face of the FMT approximately 1 mm inside the RW niche, (4) placing a disk of cartilage between the lateral face of the FMT and the bone of the sinus tympani, (5) verifying that the footplate is mobile, and if fixed, a very limited platinotomy may be required to relieve inner ear pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>All of these findings are in agreement with our first observations and recent literature data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811430808">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811430808">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811430808">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811430808">20</xref></sup> Postop-aided ABG, by definition, an audiometric index of RW-VPL coupling, allowed quantifying the amount of amplification provided by the VBS FMT to achieve complete closure or overclosure of the ABG. Altogether, the outcome of the present study showed a wide range of ABG data, from ABG overclosure to closure to 10 dB and to more than 30 dB in both study cohorts. ABG overclosure, indicating an excellent coupling, was observed in 77% and 46%, respectively, of the monitored versus unmonitored patients. Closure of the ABG to ≤10 dB, indicating a good coupling, was observed in 23% and 38%, respectively, of the ECoG versus unmonitored patients. ABG closure ≥30 dB, which indicates either an incorrect coupling or an undiagnosed coexisting severe footplate fixation, was observed in only 2 patients in the unmonitored group. These differences among groups were statistically significant, especially in terms of thresholds (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The 2 patients in the control group, with ABG closure greater than 30 dB, were subsequently submitted to revision VPL with the aim of understanding the reasons for the poor postop results and to try to improve their hearing. Interestingly, intraoperative ECoG measurements provided new insights into the mechanism governing the mechanical stimulation of the cochlea via the RW in patients with stapes fixation. At revision, these patients had the FMT precisely inside the RW niche, as it should be following the RW VPL surgical protocol. This was a puzzling finding that was clarified by inspection of the oval window and by ECoG testing. It was in fact possible to identify an undiagnosed coexisting otosclerosis in one and a tympanosclerotic footplate fixation in the other, which was causing a substantial increase in input impedance at the RW. This was reflected by high-threshold and low-amplitude values of CAPs that presented an altered morphology with a clipping of the CAP peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The threshold and amplitude values shifted immediately and significantly to lower-threshold and higher-amplitude CAP values after performing a limited platinotomy. Surprisingly also, the CAP morphology regained its peculiar shape, clearly indicating an improved transfer of vibratory energy from the FMT to the cochlear fluids, following the reduction of the endocochlear fluid hypertension induced by the FMT pushed inside the RW membrane.</p>
<p>One patient from the monitored group had a device failure and was successfully reimplanted with ECoG monitoring. The patient experienced benefit with the initial device, but performance declined progressively during the year following device fitting. Surgery for device replacement was uneventful; it confirmed that the initial device was not eliciting any ECoG response despite a good FMT–RW membrane contact evaluated with intraoperative observation of the stapes footplate and RW reflex. The old device was removed, and the new implanted device showed a very good ECoG response with good hearing benefit immediately following activation.</p>
<p>A further possible indication for ECoG monitoring was provided by a 74-year-old woman with bilateral chronic otitis media who had been fitted with left ear RW VPL at the age of 69 years. She was very pleased with her hearing restored by the VPL and was frequently at the outpatient department for regular reviews. During removal of debris from her ear canal, the FMT cable was accidently exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>), but at computed tomography (CT) scan, the FMT was still well seated in its original position in the RW niche, and the patient did not refer any change in function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). She accepted the revision surgery to replace the cable in its position (with great anxiety fearing losing her restored hearing). Surgery was performed with the assistance of ECoG. The FMT was still located inside the RW niche eliciting optimal CAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811430808"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>); the cable was repositioned inside a deep groove, and the middle ear was obliterated with fat and muscle.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article discusses the intraoperative monitoring technique that is routinely used in our department for RW VPL. We have learned how to make subtle, yet valuable, changes to our surgical technique so as to assess the factors that may interfere with hearing during RW VPL.</p>
<p>ECoG can be performed effectively during RW VPL with improvement in the degree of hearing restoration. The online feedback allows us to modify the surgical procedure so as to minimize trauma to the cochlea and to understand how to develop subtle technical improvements that can increase hearing preservation beyond their current levels.</p>
