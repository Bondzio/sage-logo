<abstract>
<p>Within a system of societal inequities, privilege consists of unearned advantages that are conferred on individuals based on membership or assumed membership in a dominant group. This article describes the relationship between privilege and oppression, dimensions of privilege, characteristics of privilege, costs of privilege, and resistance to awareness of privilege. Understanding of privilege can enhance counseling psychology practice, research, training, and professional organizations. The article concludes with recommendations for exploring privilege and a vision for systemic change.</p>

<body>
<p>Privilege is a challenging topic, and I want to acknowledge some people who have helped me to explore and deepen my understanding of privilege. As president of the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP), I appointed a Special Task Group on exploring privilege that consisted of some of the best thinkers on privilege in our field—Rebecca Toporek, Daniel Wallinski, Anneliese Singh, Janie Pinterits, Will Liu, Lisa Spanierman, Matt Englar-Carlson, Pam Foley, and Lew Schlosser. Through phone calls, conversation hours, and sharing of resources, they helped to guide my journey. I also want to thank my colleagues, Muninder Ahluwalia, Roger Worthington, and Rebecca Toporek, my student assistant, Kristin Conover, and the members of the exploring privilege conversation in which I participated for their contributions to my understanding of privilege.</p>
<p>And I want to thank all of you for exploring this topic with me today, for honoring me with your time and your interest. It is a privilege to have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today. And by that, I mean speaking with you is a source of pleasure that’s been granted to me. But that’s not the kind of privilege I’ll be talking about. You’ll hear more about that as we go along. But before we delve into privilege, I want to start by talking about oppression.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000011426297">
<title>Privilege and Oppression</title>
<p>I remember when I first developed an understanding of oppression. It was my first year of college, and I had the good fortune to take Psychology of Women with Michelle Fine. I credit her with my foundational understanding of feminism as encompassing multiple aspects of societal inequities, including gender, physical ability, race, and social class. I’ve always described my feminist awakening as developing a new lens through which I could view the world.</p>
<p>The personal became political, and suddenly, my mother having taken my father’s last name became a sign of property ownership and loss of identity for all women. A man holding open a door for me promoted learned helplessness. Someone asking me if had a boyfriend imposed an assumption of heterosexuality.</p>
<p>I recall the day I sought refuge in the Women’s Studies office, distressed that I was colluding in my own oppression by wearing high heels and lipstick. I was clearly not the first person to seek out Joan Shapiro, the Director of Women’s Studies, in such a moment, and she responded with empathy and humor, assuring me that I would get through this crisis. And I did—I learned to cope with oppression, but I couldn’t learn not to see it.</p>
<p>Rather than a lens through which I <italic>could</italic> view the world, it was actually a lens through which I <italic>could not help</italic> but view the world. Less like a lens—more like Lasik surgery—a permanent alteration that enabled me to see more clearly. Once I started seeing through this lens, I couldn’t stop, although I do need to make sure I remain attentive to what this lens enables me to see more clearly. I haven’t been able to turn off the lens of oppression for the past 25 years, and I think that’s a good thing. I don’t ever want to develop the ability to ignore systemic marginalization, bias, and disparities in resources.</p>
<p>Similarly and fortunately, once our field started identifying oppression, we didn’t stop. Consequently, we have several decades of literature on oppression and how it operates systemically, individually, and within counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000011426297">Ponterotto, 2008</xref>). I want to broaden our work on oppression by bringing greater clarity and depth to our understanding of privilege. I want to do this, not only within this talk, but also within my own experience, and within counseling psychology.</p>
<p>As a biracial, Asian American, bisexual, Jewish, Buddhist feminist, I’ve had ample opportunity to explore multiple aspects of my own oppression. I was a Women’s Studies major and belong to numerous identity-based professional organizations, all of which helped me to develop language, identity, and community related to my oppressed identities. Less well formed is my sense of how to examine my privilege as a light-skinned, traditionally gendered or “cisgender,” currently able-bodied person who was raised with economic privilege.</p>
<p>This tendency to focus on oppression rather than privilege is something I’ve observed in our profession, as well as in my own experience. Although oppression and privilege are interrelated, it seems much easier to look through the lens of our own oppression to see other people’s privilege than it is to examine our own privilege. Of course, there is much work still to be done by focusing on oppression, and I think those conversations will be most effective if we bring exploration of privilege more centrally into our process and integrate it with an understanding of oppression so we have a more complete picture of how power operates in our society. The conversation about privilege is not unrelated to the conversation about oppression, but it takes us in a slightly different direction. And, without it, we’re missing a piece we need to do the work that we are best equipped to do as counseling psychologists working with societal inequities.</p>
<p>What is this lens of privilege? A microscope? A telescope? Binoculars? Perhaps I could make a case for any of these, but the metaphor I chose is reading glasses. Similar to privilege, they help you to see things more clearly, but people don’t use them consistently. You can’t use reading glasses if you don’t have them—you need to obtain them; the ability to see privilege needs to be cultivated. Reading glasses are not always readily available when and where you need them; similarly, we do not always have the awareness and emotional wherewithal available to see privilege in all situations. Using reading glasses might make you feel old, which may entail a shift in your view of yourself and how you relate to others; when we see our own privilege, our view of ourselves and our relationship to others may shift. Wearing reading glasses is not consistent with what’s considered conventionally attractive; my awareness of privilege is not necessarily embraced by others. And then there are those moments when you’re outdoors and you want to read, so you need your sunglasses <italic>and</italic> your reading glasses, and you can’t really wear both, so you are forced to make a choice about which lens you will use. The ability to see privilege presents us with choices—will I shield my eyes or will I expose myself to awareness of injustices?</p>
<p>And, yet, reading glasses are an imperfect metaphor for awareness of privilege. Reading glasses are adaptive equipment that facilitate a functional limitation; awareness of privilege is a skill that can be cultivated to resist collusion with systems of unequal power. Our society values clear sensory vision but impedes clear awareness of privilege. The metaphor is imperfect, but it captures some of the key elements I want to express, so with your indulgence, I will move forward with it. And I want to thank Linda Mona for helping me to articulate the problematic aspects of the comparison.</p>

<title>Dimensions of Privilege</title>
<p>Now I’d like to give you an opportunity to craft or fine-tune your own privilege lenses. Peggy McIntosh introduced many of us to the idea of privilege in her article “White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000011426297">McIntosh, 1989</xref>). Her awareness of men’s resistance to acknowledge male privilege moved her to explore her own privilege based on Whiteness. She noted the relationship between awareness of oppression and privilege. She said, “As a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something that puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege, which puts me at an advantage” (p. 10). She said, “White privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks” (p. 10). She then went on to describe some of the benefits of White privilege. I want to share with you some of these advantages she articulated and show the ways others have extended her checklist to other types of privilege. As you read these statements, I encourage you to consider what manifestations of privilege apply to you.</p>

</list>
<p>I want to share an experience of consciousness-raising about social class privilege. I wrote about this experience in last spring’s Society of Counseling Psychology newsletter . . .</p>
<p>“If you or an immediate family member is a doctor, lawyer, or has a master’s degree or higher, take one step forward.” Thinking about the numerous PhDs sitting around my family’s Thanksgiving table, I stepped forward.</p>
<p>“If your family ever accepted public assistance, such as food stamps, take a step back.” I stood still. My arms stretched back as I tried to maintain my grasp on the hands of people on either side of me as they took a step.</p>
<p>I had decided to spend my Saturday afternoon at a workshop called “Exploring Economic Oppression and Privilege.” We had already spent several hours conceptually and experientially considering economic inequalities in our society. Now we were in the midst of an activity in which we started standing shoulder-to-shoulder and holding hands as the facilitator read a series of statements and we took steps forward or backward to signify our economic privilege and oppression.</p>
<p>“If your parents owned their own home while you were growing up, take one step forward.” I took another step forward, forcing us to let go of each other’s hands—I lost the connection and stood alone.</p>
<p>More steps forward; more steps backward, and then: “If you’ve ever skipped a meal or gone away from a meal hungry because there wasn’t enough money to buy food in your family, take one step back.”</p>
<p>I heard people behind me take a step. Oh no, how terrible. My mother stocked enough food to feed a small army, and she cooked meals that were healthy, with colorful ingredients and from countries all over the world. I couldn’t even imagine being hungry in my house. That’s when the tears started—imagining the beautiful, capable adults with whom I’d spent the day as children with empty stomachs, imagining the suffering of parents unable to meet their children’s basic needs. I was glad the people behind me couldn’t see my tears. It was certainly a privilege to cry over the mere idea of hunger when others didn’t typically have the space to grieve their lived experience of it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011000011426297">
<title>Defining Privilege</title>
<p>There are many types of privilege with articulated advantages. But does every identity category fall into privileged and oppressed groups? There are lists available for adult privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011426297">Anji, 2009</xref>) and nonfat privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011426297">Tish, 2003</xref>), although some people argue against the comparison of these categories to other, more established, forms of privilege (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011426297">“The adult privilege checklist,” n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than consider each dimension individually, let’s consider the question: How can we determine what is privilege and what is not? In order to have a common understanding of the term, the Exploring Privilege Special Task Group developed a definition of what we mean by privilege.</p>
<p>I’m enthusiastic to share this definition with you as, to tell you the truth, I’m feeling a little protective of the term “privilege.” I think it’s important not to use “privilege” too broadly to account for everything good that happens to people. If we are imprecise, we weaken the concept by making it vulnerable to being ignored. Let’s not dilute privilege—let’s define what we mean by it.</p>
<p>What is privilege? Privilege is comprised of unearned advantages that are conferred on individuals based on membership or assumed membership in a dominant group. Privilege has the following characteristics:</p>
<list id="list17-0011000011426297" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Privilege reflects, reifies and supports dominant power structures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Privilege is supported structurally and systemically, including an investment in maintaining a lack of consciousness about the benefits and costs resulting from that privilege.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Privilege is enacted through societal structures, systems, and daily interactions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A single individual may experience intersecting privileges and oppressions that may reflect differential receipt of benefits.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Let’s look more closely at each piece of this definition.</p>
<p>Unearned advantages are benefits that help you advance and that you receive without exerting any effort or demonstrating any skill. I started to think about what advantages are earned and what are unearned, and I found the distinction to be difficult to discern in some cases. Sometimes earned and unearned advantages have the same outcome—the difference is in <italic>why</italic> someone achieved that outcome. It can be unclear exactly to what the outcome can be attributed, which can make it difficult to know whether an advantage is earned or not.</p>
<p>For example, remember getting into college? Perhaps you got into college in part, due to being a “legacy,” your parent attended the same college—this would be an unearned advantage, or maybe you got into college because you worked hard in high school to earn good grades—this seems like an earned advantage. However, maybe you were able to study because you didn’t have other responsibilities, such as working part-time as a high school student to help support your family. So, even something that seems like an earned advantage can have unearned components.</p>
<p>Another example of an unearned advantage is the ability to marry legally because you are in a mixed-sex relationship. An earned advantage might be working hard to develop a loving and supportive relationship. But you may not need to work as hard to be supportive in a mixed-sex couple as in a same-sex couple because the relationship does not need to withstand negativity from family and society.</p>
<p>An unearned advantage may be realtors showing you homes in “good” neighborhoods because you are White, and an earned advantage might be saving money to buy a home in a “good” neighborhood, but maybe you could save money because your family provided some financial assistance, such as paying for college or covering some expenses for your children. It should start to be apparent that it’s difficult to know for sure which advantages are earned when privilege is so deeply embedded in our society.</p>
<p>One additional thought about unearned advantages—the point in someone’s life in which they experience privilege may have an impact on the psychological consequences of privilege. Privilege is comprised, not only of unearned <italic>external</italic> advantages, but also of unearned <italic>internal</italic> advantages, as well.</p>
<p>One example of this in my own life is related to sexual orientation. I was not aware of same-sex attractions and did not start to see myself as bisexual until I was in my 20s, so for all intents and purposes, I grew up heterosexual. As an adolescent, I was not subjected to anti-LGBT taunts, fear of rejection, or violence. I have been in a same-sex relationship and identify very openly as bisexual, so I no longer maintain the external manifestations of heterosexual privilege. And, yet, I find myself less concerned about disclosing my sexual orientation or expressing public affection with a same-sex partner than many of my peers who identified with a sexual minority status earlier in life than I did and who experienced negative consequences for doing so. My feelings of security remain as a remnant of heterosexual privilege. So, we may carry the advantages of early experiences of privilege within us across time and context.</p>
<p>Back to the definition. “Membership or assumed membership in a dominant group.” “Membership” is not clear-cut, as you may <italic>actually</italic> be a member, or you may be <italic>assumed</italic> or <italic>perceived</italic> to be a member. This may be most evident as it relates to invisible identity statuses, such as social class or sexual orientation. People who are perceived to be middle to upper class or heterosexual are conferred certain advantages, whether or not these individuals actually belong to these social categories, so that’s what I mean by “assumed membership.”</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the characteristics of privilege. Privilege reflects, reifies, and supports dominant power structures. In other words, the privileges that exist are based on the extant societal inequalities such that people are conferred privilege due to their association with a group that has societal power. Because they gain privilege, this group retains power, which creates a context for more privilege and more power, and so on.</p>
<p>The corollary to this is that behaviors that are not associated with power structures are not based on privilege. People may be treated with respect and have their concerns prioritized based on their privileged status, but this does not mean that all lack of respect and inattention to someone’s needs are based on societal inequalities. Some people are just plain mean. Of course, people with privilege can be mean with fewer consequences compared to those without privilege. Members of the exploring privilege group in which I participated provided some clear articulation of this concept:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We all have times when we feel excluded or feel like our voice isn’t being heard. Sometimes this is attached to sociopolitical categories, but sometimes it’s related to other things. Let’s validate these feelings without lumping them all into privilege. People are often insensitive, but it’s related to privilege only when it’s connected to their position of power within a larger sociopolitical context that the system has set up to meet their needs. (personal communication, April 20, 2011)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>So, just because someone is in a position of power over you, because they are your supervisor or advisor, for example, does not mean they have privilege.</p>
<p>Privilege is supported structurally and systemically, including an investment in maintaining a lack of consciousness about the benefits and costs resulting from that privilege. This lack of consciousness is one of the things that makes it difficult to distinguish between earned and unearned advantages. We need to cultivate an awareness of privilege because society has an interest in keeping it hidden.</p>
<p>Oppression has been described as a birdcage—if you position yourself very close to the cage and look at a bar, the other bars are outside your vision, and then it seems as if the bird could just fly around that one bar and get out, but when you step back, you can see the systems of interconnected bars that keep some birds in and some birds out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011426297">Frye, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>One example of what keeps us from seeing privilege is the belief system of meritocracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000011426297">McNamee &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>). We believe people in our society gain things by virtue of the hard work they’ve put in and by their positive qualities. According to this belief system, if someone doesn’t succeed, it’s because they didn’t work hard enough and consequently don’t deserve to. This belief in meritocracy ignores the fact that we have an unequal playing field to begin with and we operate within a system that rewards some groups of people and creates barriers to success for others.</p>
<p>We also remain unaware of privilege due to limited exposure to people without the types of privilege we have. We are able in many ways to remain segregated from people who are different from ourselves. This may take the form of physical separation from less privileged people, as can be the case with social class, ethnicity, and physical abilities. Limited exposure may also take the form of not knowing about the experiences of people who have less privilege than you do. Standpoint theory argues that people who are marginalized have a better understanding of people with power than vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000011426297">Swigonski, 1993</xref>). The more power you have, the less knowledge you have of that power and of the people with less power.</p>
<p>Privilege is enacted through societal structures, systems, and daily interactions. Privilege operates on many levels. For example, with regard to able-bodied privilege, societal structures and systems include buildings with limited wheelchair access, sidewalks without curb cuts, and policies that limit the full participation of people with disabilities. Daily interactions include people saying you shouldn’t have children or ignoring your presence in a meeting due to your disability.</p>
<p>A single individual may experience intersecting privileges and oppressions that may reflect differential receipt of benefits. It’s not as simple as thinking that some of us have privilege and some of us do not. Most of us have some aspects of our identities that are associated with privilege and others that are associated with being marginalized or oppressed– also known as “target” identities. There may be some particular ways in which target and privileged identities intersect.</p>
<p>For example, you may try to access privilege by presenting desirable characteristics you share with a privileged group. So, you may demonstrate aspects of yourself that are similar to those with privileged identities. I grew up in the southern United States, a region still affected by the long history of slavery and oppression of African Americans. Given this context, it is not surprising that some light-skinned African Americans hid their ethnic background and attempted to “pass” for White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000011426297">Clair, Beatty, &amp; Maclean, 2005</xref>). Such attempts to portray oneself as similar to those with privilege are completely understandable within the context of societal inequities, but they may lead to rejection of other target group members who do not share these characteristics, as well as rejection of characteristics in oneself that are inconsistent with those of the privileged group.</p>
<p>Another way privileged and target identities may intersect is that it may be more difficult to remain aware of your own privilege when you’re feeling triggered with regard to your target identities. Because of this, you may find that you unconsciously exert privilege when you’re feeling vulnerable due to a target identity. For example, if I were feeling vulnerable due to public harassment or assaults against women, I might convene a group of peers to provide support and consider action. If I invite only women who were born with female bodies, I exclude the voices and experiences of transgender women, who may feel even more vulnerable due to an additional marginalized status.</p>
<p>Privilege may separate you from others who share your target identity. For example, people of color with social class privilege may be called “bougie” or be accused of selling out or acting White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011426297">Liu, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>All of these intersections between privilege and target identities may create a barrier to exploring our own privilege. I notice for myself the difference in ease talking about my target compared to my privileged identities. It isn’t always easy to talk about oppression, but when I do, it allows me to connect with others who experience these same types of oppression or gain sympathy from allies. But to talk about my privilege provides none of these benefits. Somehow, talking about not having power gives me strength, but talking about having power makes me feel vulnerable.</p>

<title>Costs of Privilege</title>
<p>All that I’ve described occurs within a complex system of interrelated privilege and oppression. This system harms those who hold the privilege, as well as those who do not. The costs of systems that support privilege for people who don’t have it may be more obvious and include discrimination, limited access to resources, health disparities, and the psychological toll of minority stress. But what about the costs of these systems for people who have privilege? Is there a down side to having privilege? I mean, isn’t it good to have advantages, earned or not?</p>
<p>Numerous authors have articulated the costs of various types of oppression to members of dominant groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011426297">Bacon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000011426297">Blumenfeld, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011426297">Goodman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011426297">Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000011426297">Kivel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011426297">Ponterotto, Casas, Suzuki, &amp; Alexander, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000011426297">Spanierman &amp; Heppner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000011426297">Spanierman, Poteat, Wang, &amp; Oh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000011426297">Thompson, 1995</xref>). Costs of White privilege include cognitive distortions of self, such as believing that all achievements are merit based; of reality, for example, denying the existence of racism; or of others by relying on stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011426297">Ponterotto et al., 2010</xref>). Interpersonal costs include limited exposure to people of other races, tension, avoidance, or fear in relationships with people of color, and disconnection from one’s own cultural group and heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000011426297">Kivel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011426297">Ponterotto et al., 2010</xref>). Costs of heterosexism include locking all people, LGB and heterosexual, into rigid gender-based roles that inhibit creativity and self-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000011426297">Blumenfeld, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000011426297">Thompson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, because privilege is conferred based on perceived group membership, we may need to work to maintain our membership in these groups, sometimes at physical expense. For example, male privilege is conferred based on biological, behavioral, emotional, and other qualities associated with masculinity. In attempts to achieve this masculine ideal, some men take steroids, which can result in adverse effects, including aggression, heart failure, liver damage, hair loss, infertility, and testicular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011426297">Baggish et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011426297">Graham, Evans, Davies, &amp; Baker, 2008</xref>). Thus, unexamined male privilege can lead to physical harm.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I read a book called <italic>Orange Is the New Black</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000011426297">Kerman, 2010</xref>), a memoir written by a Smith College graduate who got involved in the drug trade after college and ended up spending a year in a federal women’s prison. The author, a White woman with economic and educational advantages, gained some awareness of her privilege through her encounters with other incarcerated women, who were primarily poor women and women of color. I feel like I have a pretty good sense of how economic challenges and societal oppression may make someone vulnerable to commit crime, but I started to think about the ways in which unexplored privilege may create a vulnerability to psychological and behavioral problems due to entitlement, lack of awareness of consequences for oneself and others, distance from the victims, and limited coping skills for facing disappointments and failures.</p>

<sec id="section5-0011000011426297">
<title>Resistance to Awareness of Privilege</title>
<p>Exploration of privilege will benefit everyone, and yet people often resist such exploration. If you’re not used to using reading glasses, they can make you dizzy. Exploring privilege may create some disequilibrium, and so you may find yourself trying to avoid doing so in a variety of ways.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000011426297">Watt (2007)</xref> articulated some possible challenges to exploration of privilege, including denial of privilege, avoiding exploration based on a religious or personal principle (as in, “I can’t explore my heterosexual privilege because the Bible says that homosexuality is a sin”), false envy (e.g., a heterosexual woman who says “it’s so hard to find a man; life would be so much easier if I were a lesbian”), or benevolence (generating acts of goodwill without noticing how reaching down to help those less fortunate than yourself maintains the current dominant structure).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011426297">Ancis and Szymanski (2001)</xref> identified ways in which counselor trainees resisted acknowledging White privilege in a variety of ways, including anger and defensiveness, attributing differential treatment to nonracial factors, resentment toward racial and ethnic minorities for their perceived privileges, and resentment that others did not recognize the participant’s own marginalized status. So, we have a number of mechanisms for fending off the exploration of privilege.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I tell people I’m working on exploring privilege, they say what a good idea this is and then they go on to tell me about all the all the other people who should explore privilege—typically some type of privilege that this person doesn’t have. Women tell me that men need to explore privilege. LGB people want heterosexual people to examine privilege. Heterosexual, White men tell me wealthy people should explore class privilege. It’s been less common for people to say they want to take a look at their own unearned advantages. To focus on <italic>other people</italic> exploring privilege can deflect exploration of privilege by emphasizing the view of oneself as oppressed. If we want to embrace the lens of privilege, we need to deepen our awareness of <italic>our own</italic> privilege.</p>
<p>But this isn’t easy. It’s difficult to admit to having privilege. I more readily emphasize the oppression I’ve experienced than reveal the ways I benefitted from unearned advantages. It’s a much more sympathetic and inspiring story to tell you that I overcame innumerable odds to get where I am and that I achieved beyond anyone’s expectations of me. If I tell you that my family paid for my Ivy League education, that my ethnicity was never a barrier to being tracked into honors courses, that I went to prom with a boy; I find myself wanting to make sure you also know that I had to pay for graduate school myself, that I was taunted due to my Asian features, that my bisexuality is frequently dismissed. My desire to tell you these things is an indication of the discomfort I feel associating myself with privilege. Such discomfort may cause me to avoid exploring privilege or to move too quickly to action. We need to get in touch with the discomfort, to know its shape and feel, so we can recognize it and so it won’t derail our exploration. This will entail bravery and vulnerability and self-awareness. I ask that you notice what’s difficult for you to accept about your privilege and that you develop an awareness of how you resist such exploration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011000011426297">
<title>Exploring Privilege in Practice, Research, Training, and Professional Organizations</title>
<p>So, that’s what privilege is and why we should explore it. What happens when we use a lens that enables us to see privilege more clearly? Before we do this, I want to emphasize the importance of honoring the lens (or Lasik surgery) of oppression. Using a lens of seeing privilege without the lens of oppression takes marginalized individuals out of our view, which prevents us from seeing the systemic effects of societal power imbalances on the people who have the least access to resources. So, we need to keep oppression in the forefront of our consciousness, even as we explore privilege. We do not want to reduce our support of people who are disenfranchised and shift our resources into programs for privileged people. So, keeping oppression in mind, let’s consider what it might mean to use the lens of privilege in our practice, research, training, and professional organization.</p>
<sec id="section7-0011000011426297">
<title>Exploring Privilege in Practice</title>
<p>What might therapy look like through the lens of privilege? First, we would take the client’s privilege into account in terms of case conceptualization. We might see ways in which clients are limited by their unexplored privilege. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011426297">Lapour and Heppner (2009)</xref> discovered that high school students with class privilege had extremely high self-efficacy for high prestige careers, so they had no doubt that they could attain and succeed in such jobs, but may have rejected potential career options they might enjoy due to a desire to maintain social class privilege—there are things they would like to do but wouldn’t consider because these jobs were not prestigious enough. Recognizing that clients are limiting their options due to privilege or considering any of the costs of privilege I discussed earlier might help the therapist to develop a more multidimensional sense of the clients’ problems and ways of addressing them.</p>
<p>We might also help clients explore privilege, in which case it will be useful to know what an emerging awareness of privilege might look like. In a recent issue of <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000011426297">Todd and Abrams (2011)</xref> described ways in which White college students shifted between recognition and denial of White privilege. The authors observed that these students</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>a) slid along the continuum [from recognition to denial] like a marble rolling back and forth on a flat piece of wood being tilted back and forth; (b) jumped back and forth from one end of the continuum to the other; or (c) stayed somewhere in between with relatively little movement, being pulled in two ways at once. (p. 368)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This description of dialectics captures the complexity of White people’s relationship with privilege. Understanding these patterns can help therapists recognize them and meet clients where they are. It may also help therapists respond to clients’ seeming mixed messages about privilege with empathy rather than frustration. The authors offer therapists a specific tool by suggesting mindfulness as a strategy for working with these dialectics.</p>
<p>Another way therapists might work with privilege is by helping clients maintain an awareness of privilege, even when managing vulnerabilities related to target identities. Beyond therapy, we might consider how to help people explore privilege in the workplace, in organizations, and in their communities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011000011426297">
<title>Exploring Privilege in Research</title>
<p>Looking through the lens of privilege as researchers, we would want to measure specific types of privilege (see the White Privilege Attitudes Scale—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011426297">Pinterits, Poteat, &amp; Spanierman, 2009</xref>), as well as privilege across multiple dimensions (see the Privilege and Oppression Inventory—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011426297">Hays, Chang, &amp; Decker, 2007</xref>; and the Social Privilege Measure—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000011426297">Black, Stone, Hutchinson, &amp; Suarez, 2007</xref>). In addition, we might want to measure related constructs, such as White racial identity status, responses to racism (including White guilt), negative consequences of racism, and racial attitudes. The good news is that we’re already doing this in our profession. There are established measures, and we know something about how these constructs operate.</p>
<p>Although we need to do research on effective training related to privilege, we should make sure we’re studying not only therapists or our students. We need to understand how awareness of privilege operates for people who are likely to be our therapy and consultation clients so that we can develop and implement effective interventions. Intervention research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011426297">Soble, Spanierman, &amp; Liao, 2011</xref>) will provide evidence for what works and guide our efforts to help people grapple with their privilege.</p>
<p>The focus of much research on privilege has been on White privilege. I want to encourage researchers to explore other types of privilege, as well. Furthermore, some research approaches, such as community-based participatory research, may help address structural privilege that is embedded in the research process, so we should consider how we’re conducting the research in addition to the content focus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011000011426297">
<title>Exploring Privilege in Training</title>
<p>Turning the lens of privilege to training, we would focus on consequences of structural inequalities for people with privilege, in addition to consequences for target groups.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011426297">Ancis and Szymanski (2001)</xref> did a qualitative analysis of 34 White, master’s-level counseling students’ written responses to McIntosh’s list of conditions associated with White privilege. Of the 10 students who demonstrated awareness of White privilege and discrimination, 8 of them attributed their increased realization of privilege and discrimination to reading the McIntosh article. This is an indication of the power of exposing students to privilege concepts and checklists.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000011426297">Hays, Dean, and Chang (2007)</xref> conducted group interviews with 16 practicing counselors and found that when these counselors talked about clients with privilege, they referred primarily to clients’ social class privilege. The counselors’ reactions to client privilege and oppression influenced counseling interventions, and counselors had difficulty working with clients with privilege. The therapists in the study said they were not adequately prepared to address power issues in counseling, that the training lacked processing and application outside the classroom, and that this topic was not addressed in supervision. So taking privilege into account in training, we would help therapists identify and work with their own reactions to client privilege, develop empathy for clients with privilege, especially social class privilege, and learn how to help clients explore privilege.</p>
<p>I had several opportunities this year to talk with students about privilege at the regional counseling psychology conferences, and I found the students better versed and more experienced exploring privilege than many of us who received our degrees a decade or more ago. This is promising for the future of our field, although currently many of us will need to learn how to provide training on privilege when we never received it ourselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0011000011426297">
<title>Exploring Privilege in Professional Organizations</title>
<p>I want to acknowledge the history of leadership within counseling psychology that has worked to make the SCP a welcoming place for many types of marginalized individuals. I would not be here without the founders of the Sections for the Advancement of Women, Ethnic and Racial Diversity, and LGBT Issues. I want to thank the leadership of the SCP for talking about oppression. Derald Wing Sue’s articulation of microaggressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000011426297">Sue et al., 2007</xref>) helps me to weather the ways in which my target identity draws negative attention. Rosie Phillips Bingham’s said in her presidential address, “[A]lthough exclusion is easier, inclusion is better” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000011426297">Bingham, 2000</xref>). No amount of privilege could have gotten me here had the climate of inclusion not been established already.</p>
<p>When we look through the lens of oppression, we can celebrate that here we have the first biracial, Asian American, bisexual, Jewish, Buddhist feminist president of the Society of Counseling Psychology. But when we look through the lens of privilege, we see that we have yet another light-skinned, cisgender, currently able-bodied person who was raised with educational and economic privilege at the helm. Both are true, and if we see only one or the other, we do not see the complete picture.</p>
<p>So, what should we do to work with both oppression and privilege within the Society of Counseling Psychology? I’m pleased to say that we’ve accomplished some things this year that moved us in this direction. The Executive Board spent two hours during the midyear meeting in January in an experiential workshop about privilege, so the leadership of the organization had a chance to deepen their awareness of privilege. I again want to thank the Exploring Privilege Special Task Group for developing and implementing some initiatives that moved us in this direction. They provided opportunities for conversations among professionals and students—at APA conventions, at the Multicultural Summit, and via conference calls. I took part in one of these phone conversations and was struck by how much my understanding of privilege deepened from a series of four 1-hour phone calls. I hope that we planted a seed that will be cultivated and will grow, within each of us and within our organization.</p>

<title>Using the Lens of Privilege Effectively</title>
<p>Before we end, I would like to provide some suggestions about how to use the privilege lens most effectively. First, know that you need the lens. I hope that this presentation has helped you to identify what aspects of privilege you are aware of and in what areas are you not as aware of your privilege as you could be.</p>
<p>You have to make sure you have your privilege lenses handy if you want to use them. You might have many pairs of reading glasses that you keep all around the house. Try to keep your awareness of privilege close to the surface in many different situations so it’s easy to access your privilege lens.</p>
<p>A group of students asked me how to talk with people outside our field about privilege. As you may have experienced yourself, when you develop a new perspective, you may want to share it with others. Or the feeling may be even stronger—sometimes we get a little evangelical about sharing our new truth and have little tolerance for others who do not understand things as we do. How do we talk about privilege with people when we’re not in a teaching or helping position with them—when it’s not our job to expand their perspective? We may need to help students, clients, and ourselves grapple with this—to deal with our own reactions to other people’s lack of awareness of privilege and to find effective ways of communicating our views. The solution I shared with this group of students was that, rather than trying to teach another person about privilege or convince them that it will be beneficial to explore privilege, you can demonstrate exploration of privilege by sharing your own story about having privilege and coming to an awareness of it.</p>
<p>You may think of yourself as someone highly attuned to social inequities. Due to the hidden nature of privilege and the ease of falling into collusion with societal power structures, it’s important to remain vigilant and humble about our ability to remain aware of privilege.</p>
<p>Ideally, you will acclimate to using the lens of privilege. You’ll recognize that seeing through the lens of privilege provides you with a more accurate view of reality and that it is lack of awareness of privilege that creates a distortion.</p>
<p>Connect with others who use the lens of privilege. In this room, you are surrounded by colleagues who share an interest in exploring privilege. Let’s make the SCP a community of people who support one another in these endeavors.</p>
<p>After we explore privilege, what do we do about it? As you gain an awareness of privilege, you may not be sure how to take action. How do I help people who have less privilege than I do? How do I use my power to change the system? I believe that if we explore and gain an awareness of our own privilege and have conversations with others with whom we share similar aspects of privilege, actions will emerge from these insights and connections. We need to go bravely forth into exploration without knowing the precise path for change and trust that the outcome can emerge only in the context of increased awareness and collaboration. We may not know the path, but if we take this journey together, we can move forward.</p>
<p>But what I hope and what I envision is that awareness of privilege may help you to experience yourself more fully and enable you to have more fulfilling connections with others. It will enable you to use your powers—those internal qualities and external resources that you gained because or despite societal inequities—to dismantle the structures of our society that create unequal access to power. And, this will ultimately help reduce suffering and create a world in which everyone can reach their potential. I hope that, together, we can move toward accomplishing this vision.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
