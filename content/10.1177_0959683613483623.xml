<abstract>
<p>Invertebrate primary succession is investigated across a chronosequence in the subalpine (birch woodland) zone at Fåbergstølsbreen using pitfall traps. Presence and abundance of taxa, functional groups and communities are examined using a geo-ecological approach including mapping, graphical analysis, two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). Twenty-nine of the 67 recorded taxa, and 14 of the 37 epigeal (surface active) taxa colonize terrain deglacierized for &lt;20 years and catches of most of these pioneer taxa attain an early peak on terrain deglacierized for &lt;40 years. Catches of most later colonizers peak in the mature (‘climax’) stage where 86% of the pioneer taxa and 79% of the epigeal pioneers are also recorded. The number of taxa increases across the chronosequence as new taxa, predominantly predators, appear but relatively few taxa drop out of the succession, and as the dominant species in the traps changes from the harvestman, <italic>Mitopus morio</italic>, to the wood ant, <italic>Formica lugubris</italic>. The invertebrate communities are interpreted as loosely organized groupings of individualistic species, the distributions of which are strongly related to terrain age. Changes during succession are interpreted as driven primarily by competition between the carnivorous taxa, though herbivores and omnivores comprise up to 24% and 11% of the taxa, respectively, in both pioneer and mature zones. Hence the ‘addition and persistence model’ of invertebrate succession, previously proposed for the alpine zone, is largely substantiated but partially modified for the subalpine zone, where succession is generally more rapid, overall changes during succession are greater, communities are better organized, food webs appear better developed, and there is an element of replacement change in the later stages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the pioneering research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483623">Janetschek (1949)</xref> in the Austrian Alps, models of invertebrate succession on glacier forelands have been greatly influenced by supposed similarities with and dependence on vegetation succession. Vegetation succession on glacier forelands has been investigated in considerable detail in many different regions (see reviews in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683613483623">Matthews, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683613483623">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683613483623">Nagy and Grabherr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683613483623">Walker and del Moral 2003</xref>). However, the patterns and processes of invertebrate succession are relatively poorly understood in these and other habitats. The dominant model of primary vegetation succession emphasizes replacement change: i.e. the sequential colonization of plant communities, with pioneer species being replaced later by distinctly different communities. Recent investigations of the succession of various groups of invertebrates have revealed some differences from this ‘classical model’, including the facts that some pioneer invertebrate species, especially predators, can establish themselves rapidly, ahead of plant colonizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683613483623">Gereben-Krenn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683613483623">Gobbi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683613483623">Hågvar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683613483623">Hodkinson et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683613483623">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483623">Kaufmann, 2001</xref>), and that the succession of invertebrates may exhibit greater continuity than previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483623">Kaufmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683613483623">Kaufmann et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Some studies of invertebrate succession on glacier forelands have often stressed that species turnover is conspicuous after the pioneer stage with little overlap in species composition between early and later successional stages (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483623">Janetschek, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483623">Kaufmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683613483623">Macfadyen, 1963</xref>), reflecting the influence of vegetation and soil development on invertebrate community development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683613483623">Kaufmann and Raffl, 2002</xref>), the later establishment of herbivores and detritivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683613483623">Bardgett et al., 2005</xref>), and the development of functional links between soil-dwelling or epigeal (surface active) invertebrates and vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613483623">Albrecht et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683613483623">Carlson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683613483623">Gobbi et al., 2010</xref>). However, other results, especially from the high Arctic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683613483623">Hodkinson et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683613483623">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683613483623">2004</xref>) and the alpine zone in southern Norway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483623">Bråten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683613483623">Hågvar, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683613483623">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683613483623">Hågvar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683613483623">Vater, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483623">2012</xref>), provide little support for major vegetation effects on invertebrate succession. This led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483623">Vater (2012)</xref> to propose an alternative model of invertebrate succession that emphasizes the progressive addition and the persistence of taxa, rather than replacement change, with comparatively little plant–invertebrate interaction.</p>
<p>The broad aim of this paper is to test further the ‘addition and persistence model’ using a glacier-foreland chronosequence from the subalpine zone in southern Norway. There are three main objectives: first, to describe the succession of invertebrate taxa and the pattern of invertebrate community development at Fåbergstølsbreen, a southeastern outlet of the Jostedalsbreen ice cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683613483623">Figure 1</xref>); second, to compare the results with those found, using similar methods, in the alpine zone at Storbreen, Jotunheimen; and third, to discuss the broader implications of the results in the context of the theory of invertebrate succession on glacier forelands.</p>

<title>Study site</title>
<p>Fåbergstølsbreen glacier foreland (61°43′N, 7°18′E) occupies an east-facing tributary valley of Jostedalen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683613483623">Figure 1</xref>). It extends approximately 2 km from the glacier snout (approximately 620 m above sea level) to its lowest point at about 480 m a.s.l. The area is characterised by subalpine woodland dominated by the downy birch (<italic>Betula pubescens</italic>), which forms part of the northern boreal zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683613483623">Moen, 1999</xref>). Data from Bjørkhaug-i-Jostedalen meteorological station (324 m a.s.l.) shows a mean annual air temperature of +3.7°C (July mean +13.4°C; January mean −4.9°C) and a mean annual precipitation of 1380 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613483623">Aune, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683613483623">Førland, 1993</xref>). Geologically, the area is composed of granitic to granodioritic gneiss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683613483623">Lutro and Tveten, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683613483623">Sigmond et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The chronosequence is based on a well-developed system of ‘Little Ice Age’ moraines dated by glacier monitoring, aerial photographs, historical evidence and lichenometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683613483623">Bickerton and Matthews, 1993</xref>). The outermost moraine, which dates from the ‘Little Ice Age’ maximum of c. <sc>ad</sc> 1750, clearly demarcates the glacier-foreland boundary. Beyond this limit, on terrain deglaciated at least 9700 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683613483623">Dahl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683613483623">Owen et al., 2007</xref>), dense birch woodland contrasts with the patchy and less dense woodland cover over the older parts of the foreland.</p>
<p>The vegetation succession on glacier forelands in the subalpine birch belt has been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683613483623">Robbins and Matthews (2010)</xref>, who recognize a herbaceous pioneer <italic>Poa-Oxyria</italic> community that can develop, under favourable habitat conditions, into birch woodland with a dwarf-shrub understorey within 70 years (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683613483623">Fægri, 1933</xref>). However, there is a variety of habitats in response to microtopography and disturbance processes, associated in particular with variable drainage conditions on moraine slopes and the shifting courses of glaciofluvial meltwater streams, respectively.</p>

<p>Sampling and analytical methods were similar to those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483623">Vater (2012)</xref>. The glacier foreland was subdivided into five zones of increasing age, from Zone 1 (terrain age 0–20 years; deglacierized between <sc>ad</sc> 1984 and 2004) to Zone 5 (terrain age 153–254 years), with the area outside the glacier foreland forming Zone 6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683613483623">Table 1</xref>). The age zones represent progressively longer time intervals, to take account of the general pattern of initially rapid and later levelling-off of rates of colonization and succession as described, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683613483623">Kaufmann (2002)</xref>.</p>

<p>A total of 90 pitfall traps were arranged according to a ‘three-trap system’ (i.e. three traps were located in close proximity at each site). This introduced an element of replication while also taking account of small-scale habitat variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683613483623">Vater, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483623">2012</xref>). Progressively fewer sites were located in Zone 1 (seven sites) to Zones 4 and 5 (three sites each), and five sites were located in Zone 6: to allow for expected patterns of diversity and heterogeneity through time. The variable number of traps per time zone was not ideal as the number of taxa recorded will increase with the number of traps in use. However, tests made on the Storbreen glacier foreland showed that as few as three traps are sufficient to provide a reasonably representative sample of of the presence of taxa at single sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683613483623">Vater, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483623">2012</xref>). Furthermore, number of taxa recorded in each of Zones 4 and 5 at Fåbergstølsbreen was close to the number recorded when results from these two zones were combined together (see below). Thus, the effects of different numbers of traps per zone are regarded as insignificant in this data set based on a minimum of nine traps per zone.</p>
<p>Each trap consisted of a plastic cup set into the ground with the 70 mm diameter rim set level with the surface. Raised, plastic, rain-proof and cone-shaped lids prevented the traps filling with water and protected against small mammals. A 30% solution of ethanol (25 ml) was used as the killing and preserving agent, and 5 ml of ethylene glycol were added to reduce evaporation. Two collections were carried out in July to early September in 2004. Each collection represented the invertebrates trapped over a period of 12 or 18 days, each trap being filled and emptied twice. As collections were made by visiting the traps sequentially and all traps were emptied and filled within a few days of each other, any phenological changes between the early and late collections are likely to affect all age zones of the chronosequence equally. The average trapping rate – number of individuals per site per day – over the two collections, was used in subsequent numerical analyses involving abundance/activity. Nomenclature follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683613483623">Chinery (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683613483623">Olsen (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683613483623">Roberts (1995)</xref> (see also Fauna Europea, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.faunaeur.org">www.faunaeur.org</ext-link>). Most epigeal taxa (86%) were identified to species level or represent single species, whereas most flying invertebrates were identified only to family level.</p>
<p>The catches in the pitfall traps measure abundance of the epigeal insects (especially beetles and ants) and arachnids (spiders, harvestmen and mites) in the form of surface activity (rather than density). Although several epigeal taxa are able to fly (e.g. several beetles), where they have regular non-flying surface activity they are classified as non-flying epigeal taxa. Flying insects, include Diptera (flies), Hemiptera (true bugs), most Hymenoptera (sawflies, bees and related taxa), Plecoptera (stoneflies) and Trichoptera (caddisflies). These were analysed even though pitfall traps are not designed for flying insects, the presence of which in the traps may sometimes represent only chance occurrences and the absence of which may not be indicative of absence in the field.</p>
<p>The distribution and abundance of all individual taxa from 29 sites were mapped in geographical space and analysed graphically in relation to age zones. In order to test the ‘addition and persistence model’, the timing of first and last appearance and of the attainment of maximum abundance/activity of each taxon in the chronosequence were analysed. This focused on whether replacement change of taxa occurs during succession. Possible bias of the estimated number of taxa due to the inclusion of the flying insects and family-level data was investigated by carrying out separate analyses of the epigeal taxa and the epigeal taxa identified to species level. This demonstrated that inclusion of flying taxa and family-level units had no appreciable effect on the results (see below).</p>
<p>Temporal patterns in functional groups (carnivores, herbivores and omnivores) were analysed in a similar way, again with separate consideration of the epigeal taxa. The diet of the adult life phase was used in the definition of the functional groups: carnivores included predatory, parasitic and scavenging carnivores; herbivores included phytophagous, mycetaphagous (fungal eating) and scavenging herbivores; and omnivores included predatory and scavenging taxa that may supplement their diet with vegetation or plant detritus (detritivores). All taxa apart from five unidentified species of Hemiptera (designated H4, H5, H9, H16 and H18) were assigned to a functional group.</p>
<p>Community analysis involved classification of all taxa using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683613483623">Kent and Coker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683613483623">Lepš and Šmilauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683613483623">Kent, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683613483623">van Tangeren, 1995</xref>), mapping and ordination using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683613483623">Clarke 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683613483623">Kent, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683613483623">Lepš and Šmilauer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683613483623">McCune and Grace, 2002</xref>). Eight species groups and seven site groups were considered optimal in terms of retaining interpretable detail. Twelve rare species (occurring at &lt;5% of the sites, i.e. at one site only, mostly in Zone 6) were excluded from the classification and ordination analyses to prevent them from affecting the statistical stability of the results.</p>

<p>Patterns in the dynamics of taxa and functional groups across the chronosequence: (a) number of taxa and epigeal taxa per age zone; (b) number of first and last appearances of taxa and epigeal taxa per age zone; (c) number of taxa, epigeal taxa and flying taxa attaining peak abundance (maximum catches) per age zone; (d) number of carnivores, epigeal carnivores, herbivores and omnivores per age zone.</p>

</fig>
<p>Despite an increase in the number of taxa with terrain age across the chronosequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2a</xref>), the number of taxa in Zones 2–5 (31–39 taxa) is little higher than in Zone 1. The similar form of the curve for epigeal taxa alone, which is almost identical to that of the epigeal taxa identified to species level, should also be noted. However, it is possible that the taxon Staphylinidae (rove beetles) may hide a high number of epigeal species of unknown successional pattern.</p>
<p>In the oldest zone (Zone 6), the number of taxa and the number of epigeal taxa both reach distinct maxima of 55 and 30 taxa, respectively, which can be attributed to the number of first appearances exceeding the number of last appearances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2b</xref>). In contrast to the arrival of 3–9 new taxa (of which two-thirds are epigeal taxa) in each of Zones 2–5, there are relatively few last appearances as terrain age increases. Indeed, no taxa appear to drop out of the succession before Zone 3 (terrain age 41–64 years) and the number of last appearances associated with Zones 3–5 remains extremely low (2–6 taxa per zone, of which half are epigeal taxa). There are no last appearances shown in Zone 6 because there is no later stage.</p>
<p>A substantial number of taxa attain peak abundance on relatively young terrain (24 in Zones 1 and 2, of which 10 are epigeal taxa and 14 are flying taxa) but relatively few (14 in total) on terrain of intermediate age in Zones 3–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2c</xref>). However, about half of the recorded taxa (34) and over half of the epigeal taxa (20) reach their maximum abundance in Zone 6.</p>
<p>The distributions of carnivorous, herbivorous and omnivorous taxa across the chronosequence are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2d</xref>. These functional groups show a similar pattern to that of the overall number of taxa with carnivores in the majority in all zones. The proportion of carnivores is high throughout, greatest in Zones 1–4 (65–72% of taxa), falling to 53% in Zone 6. Of the epigeal taxa, 78–94% are carnivores in Zones 1–4 and the proportion remains high in Zones 5 and 6 (81% and 73%, respectively). Though much lower in numbers throughout the chronosequence, the proportion of herbivores is relatively high in Zone 1 (24%), progressively less in Zones 2–4 (declining to &lt;10% of taxa in Zone 4) before rising again to &gt;20% in both Zones 5 and 6. Omnivores are comparatively rare (6–11% throughout) rising slightly in the older zones.</p>
<p>Distributions of seven epigeal taxa and one flying taxon are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3</xref> while maps of the other taxa are available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683613483623">Vater (2006)</xref>. <italic>Amara alpina</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3a</xref>) is one of 11 taxa that attain peak abundance in Zone 1, whereas <italic>A. quenseli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3b</xref>) and <italic>Mitopus morio</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3c</xref>) are two of the 13 that peak in Zone 2). Both of the <italic>Amara</italic> beetles appear to be pioneers but also occur with lower abundance on older terrain, including sites in Zone 6. However, whereas <italic>A. alpina</italic> is absent from Zones 3 and 4, <italic>A. quenseli</italic> occurs in all zones. The harvestman, <italic>Mitopus morio</italic>, also colonizes rapidly and is the commonest species on relatively young terrain (Zones 1–3) but its abundance is much reduced in Zone 3 and in the older zones. The next three beetles colonize more slowly. <italic>Notiophilus aquaticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3d</xref>) reaches maximum abundance in Zone 3: although it is less abundant in the older zones, this decline appears particularly patchy. <italic>Pardosa lugubris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3e</xref>) and <italic>P. trailli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3f</xref>), in common with other <italic>Pardosa</italic> species, reach their peak abundance in Zone 6. The wood ant, <italic>Formica lugubris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3h</xref>), which first appears in Zone 3, is the commonest species in Zones 4–6 (where it was found in all traps), increasing rapidly in abundance by Zone 5 and becoming extremely abundant in Zone 6. The final example is <italic>Bombus</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3g</xref>), a bumblebee that occurs occasionally in the two oldest zones, and represents the large number of species that were trapped only occasionally on the oldest terrain.</p>

<title>TWINSPAN species groups</title>
<p>The first division of the taxa by TWINSPAN separated 24 widely distributed taxa from 31 that occur predominantly on relatively old terrain. The second division of the former group split off 14 taxa that tend to favour relatively young terrain, while the second division of the latter split off seven taxa that are sparsely distributed on terrain of intermediate age (as well as occurring sparsely on relatively old terrain). After three divisions, TWINSPAN defined eight interpretable groups of species of which those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3</xref> may be considered examples. It should be noted, however, that the members of each group exhibit considerable individuality in their distributions.</p>

Although they occur on relatively old terrain, these taxa linger on in the older zones in much lower numbers. Most of these are flying taxa, Diptera (Muscidae spp., Nematocera spp., <italic>Heledromia</italic> spp., <italic>Mycetophila</italic> spp., and <italic>Delia</italic> sp./<italic>Zaphne frontana</italic>) or Hemiptera (H9 and H16); the others include three epigeal species, <italic>Amara quenseli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3b</xref>), <italic>Bembidion fellmanni</italic>, and <italic>Trombidium holosericeum</italic>.</p>

<p>This second large group of pioneers includes eight taxa, four epigeal species (<italic>Erigone longipalpis, Malthodes flowoguttatus, Miscodera arctica</italic>, Staphylinidae spp.) and four flying taxa (Belytinae spp., Ichneumonidae spp., <italic>Beckerina</italic> spp. and <italic>Drymeia</italic> spp.).

<p>The two taxa in this very small group of species – <italic>Amara alpina</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3a</xref>) and <italic>Eudasyphora cyanicolour/Cynomya mortuorum</italic> – combine maximum abundance in Zone 1 with very few occurrences in Zones 3–5 and moderate abundance in Zone 6.

<p>Further clarification of the nature of the site groups and their interrelationships is shown in the NMS biplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683613483623">Figure 5</xref>), which provides a visual representation of the similarities between sites in a two-dimensional ‘species space’. The stress statistic of 9%, which is a ‘badness-of-fit’ measure, indicates that this two-dimensional representation of complex, multidimensional relationships contains little distortion. The site groups generally occupy distinct areas of this space of reduced dimensionality and the temporal pattern of the chronosequence is clearly reflected in the curvilinear arrangement of sites. The pioneer and early-successional site groups 1–3 occupy the top left of the space, whereas the late successional and climax groups 5–7 occupy the bottom right.</p>

<title>Nature of colonization and succession at Fåbergstølsbreen</title>
<p>Twenty-nine taxa and 14 epigeal taxa were recorded on terrain deglacierized for &lt;20 years (Zone 1) where vegetation cover is generally low. This rapid initial colonization is in accord with many other studies, which have emphasized such factors as the mobility of many invertebrates, including the non-flying, epigeal taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683613483623">Coulson et al., 2003</xref>), the ability of carnivores (such as carabid beetles, spiders and harvestmen) and detritivores to subsist in the absence of vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683613483623">Hågvar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683613483623">Hodkinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683613483623">König et al., 2011</xref>) and the possibility of invertebrates feeding on heterotrophic micro-organisms that may utilize ancient carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683613483623">Bardgett et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Taxa numbers, including the number of epigeal taxa, continue to rise relatively slowly on terrain deglacierized for 21–64 years (Zones 2 and 3), then level off in older Zones 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2a</xref>). Together with concurrent low numbers of first appearances after Zone 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2b</xref>), this suggests that most taxa able to survive the environmental conditions on recently deglacierized terrain arrive early in the succession and are not limited by their dispersal abilities (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683613483623">Ingimarsdóttir et al., 2012</xref>). This may, in turn, partly reflect the relatively short distances to source populations beyond the glacier–foreland boundary, including the probable existence of populations of many of the taxa on the valley sides high above the foreland.</p>
<p>The appreciable number of taxa with peak catches in Zones 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2c</xref>) indicates that most of these early colonizers are able to reproduce and expand their populations soon after reaching the site, as suggested in earlier studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683613483623">Gereben-Krenn et al., 2011</xref>). However, the epigeal taxa recorded on the youngest terrain (Zone 1) build up their populations somewhat more slowly than the flying taxa. Whereas peak catches of many flying taxa are attained within 20 years, the epigeal taxa attain their early peaks only after 20–40 years (Zone 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2c</xref>). Fewer taxa have peak catches in Zones 3–5, where competition may be reducing the abundance of many of the pioneer species whilst having a relatively small effect on the number of taxa. Particularly important as an underlying cause of this pattern is likely to be the increasing abundance of <italic>Formica lugubris</italic>, which first appears in Zone 3 and becomes extremely abundant on older terrain.</p>
<p>Lack of dependence of the invertebrate succession on the vegetation succession is supported by the fact that predatory carnivores predominate not only in the pioneer zone but also make up a high proportion of the invertebrate fauna throughout the chronosequence. This is especially true for the epigeal taxa with 78–94% carnivores in all zones. Although they do not require plants for food, the carnivores may nevertheless make use of vegetation for shelter. Furthermore, the substantial proportion of pioneer herbivores in Zone 1 (24%), which includes both phytophagous and mycetophagous taxa, decline through Zones 2–4 as the vegetation develops, before rising again in Zones 5 and 6.</p>
<p>Although persistence of taxa is high throughout the succession with 86% of the taxa and 79% of the epigeal taxa from Zone 1 also occurring in Zone 6, by Zone 4 the number of last appearances approximates the number of first appearances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting replacement change, as does the slow rise in the proportion of herbivores in Zone 5. However, there is no evidence of the species populations being affected by replacement change to the extent reported by, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483623">Kaufmann (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683613483623">Kaufmann and Raffl (2002)</xref> who demonstrated rapid taxa turnover and almost no taxa overlap between the youngest and oldest zones at the Rotmoosferner, Austrian Alps. This may relate to greater complexity of communities and less severe environmental conditions at more southerly latitudes.</p>
<p>Differences in the invertebrate populations at the glacier–foreland boundary between late-successional Zone 5 and mature Zone 6 (which represents a potential end point to succession or ‘climax’ stage) imply that succession on the oldest parts of the glacier foreland has not ended. Most pronounced of these differences is the much larger number of taxa (32 taxa in Zone 6, in contrast to 5 in Zone 5) that attain peak abundance outside the foreland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683613483623">Figure 2c</xref>). Another difference is the greater number of taxa (55 taxa outside the boundary, in contrast to 39 inside), although the two zones have a majority of taxa in common (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0959683613483623">Table 2</xref>) and there is little difference in terms of the number of epigeal taxa or functional groups.</p>
<p>The classification and ordination analyses shed further light on changes in invertebrate community structure. Although particular taxa comprising the TWINSPAN species groups exhibit individuality in their distributions, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683613483623">Figure 3</xref>, successional status is readily interpretable as the groups occupy distinctive, though overlapping positions in the chronosequence. The TWINSPAN site groups are even more age-dependent as the sites within each group generally occupy spatially contiguous areas of the chronosequence, which do not overlap with the areas occupied by other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683613483623">Figure 4</xref>). Similarly, the disposition of site groups in the NMS biplot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683613483623">Figure 5</xref>) is interpreted as a rapid successional development (indicated by the arrow) of several recognizable but indistinct communities.</p>

<sec id="section19-0959683613483623">
<title>Subalpine versus alpine succession</title>
<p>The subalpine chronosequence at Fåbergstølsbreen has similarities and differences in comparison with the chronosequence previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483623">Vater (2012)</xref> from Storbreen in the low-alpine belt of the alpine zone. Broadly similar numbers of taxa occur on the foreland but trapping rates tend to be higher at Fåbergstølsbreen where there is a similar trend of increasing numbers of taxa with terrain age reflecting similar numbers of first appearances and last appearances. Most early colonizers are therefore persisting into relatively old zones on both forelands where the mature birchwood tends to be richer in species than the mature alpine heathland. In both chronosequences, relatively few taxa are limited to terrain of intermediate age and therefore distinctly mid-successional in status. However, in the case of the subalpine chronosequence species groups 5 and 6 are characterized by small numbers of mid-successional species. In terms of functional groups, both chronosequences are dominated by carnivores, even though herbivores are more important in the subalpine zone, both in the pioneer and mature/ ‘climax’ stages. Although they are relatively few in number, omnivores also appear more important in the subalpine zone, especially in the mature stages.</p>
<p>Differences between the two chronosequences are clearer in relation to taxa abundance, particularly with respect to the zones in which peak catches occur, which reflect more rapid succession in the subalpine zone. This is particularly apparent in relation to <italic>Mitopus morio</italic>, the dominant pioneer species on young terrain on both forelands, which is three times as abundant in Zone 1 (deglacierized for &lt;20 years) at Fåbergstølsbreen, and reaches its peak abundance in Zone 4 at Storbreen. A large number of other taxa exhibit a similar pattern, reaching peak abundance in Zones 1 or 2 at Fåbergstølsbreen but Zone 4 at Storbreen. This rapid expansion of the subalpine populations is followed by an earlier decline (Zone 3 at Fåbergstølsbreen; Zone 5 at Storbreen), which appears to relate to the earlier onset and greater extent of competition from later colonizers, such as <italic>Formica lugubris</italic> (which is absent from the alpine zone). The fact that many more taxa attain peak abundance in Zone 6 in the subalpine zone may reflect the availability of a greater range of available niches in the woodland.</p>
<p>The subalpine chronosequence is also characterized by the development of a better organized and more complex community structure than the alpine chronosequence. There are clearer differences between species groups and especially between site groups, albeit with considerable continuity reflecting individuality in the distribution patterns and behaviour of the taxa. The greater importance of herbivores and omnivores in the later stages of the subalpine chronosequence suggests the development of more complex food webs there. Furthermore, each site group occurs in fewer age zones in the subalpine chronosequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0959683613483623">Table 3</xref>), and the site classifications suggest fewer (three rather than six) interpretable communities in the early stages of succession at Fåbergstølsbreen, which appear to be converging on one or two mature communities. There may also be greater community differences across the glacier foreland boundary at Fåbergstølsbreen, resulting from both the greater number of rare species and the greater abundance of some of the commoner taxa in Zone 6. However, a discontinuity is not evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683613483623">Figure 5</xref>, which emphasizes that the late-successional and mature communities have much in common, and hence that succession on the glacier foreland is arguably approaching ‘climax’ status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0959683613483623">
<title>Implications for the ‘addition and persistence’ model</title>
<p>In essence, the ‘addition and persistence’ model of invertebrate succession proposes a process whereby, through time, taxa colonize newly deglacierized terrain without replacement change of discrete communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683613483623">Vater, 2012</xref>). Several aspects of the results from Fåbergstølsbreen are in accord with this model: the number of taxa caught increases across the chronosequence while the number of first appearances of taxa exceeds the number of last appearances; and most taxa recorded in the youngest zone also occur in the oldest zone, with far more taxa attaining peak abundance in the oldest zone than in any other. Thus, few taxa are exclusive to particular communities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the abundance patterns of individual taxa and the community differences do provide evidence consistent with an element of replacement change. In particular, the dominant pioneer species early in succession, <italic>Mitopus morio</italic>, can be interpreted as being replaced by <italic>Formica lugubris</italic> by Zone 5. <italic>Trombidium holosericeum</italic> and <italic>Amara quenseli</italic>, which exhibit similar distribution patterns, may also be locally dominant pioneers. Similarly, <italic>Pardosa lugubris</italic> and other species of <italic>Pardosa</italic> may be locally dominant in the oldest zones. As relatively few other taxa exhibit the same patterns, however, this cannot be said to constitute replacement of one community by another. Although a relatively large number of taxa appear for the first time in Zone 6, their low abundance means they are rarely consistent members of the late-successional or mature communities. These late colonizers are therefore additions to, rather than replacements of, those taxa that persist from the earlier successional stages.</p>
<p>Similarly, although there are differences between the communities, analyses at the community level show that the defined TWINSPAN groups are far from discrete entities (see, especially, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683613483623">Figure 5</xref>). The overall picture is one of rapid colonization producing a continuum of variability, which is organized along a successional time gradient. This does not imply an absence of community structure, only that the taxa exhibit a level of individualistic behaviour that is too high to constitute discrete communities.</p>
<p>It might be argued that inclusion of the flying taxa is biasing the sample in favour of the ‘addition and persistence model’ because (1) they are able to move relatively freely across the chronosequence and (2) most have not been identified to species level. Thus, they could be regarded as vagrants that do not belong to the local community characteristic of particular terrain ages, and differences in distribution and successional status between related species may be hidden within the higher taxonomic units. However, the greater mobility of flying invertebrates does not mean they should be excluded, a priori, as part of the community, especially as the abundance of many of these taxa indicates that populations have established locally. The temporal patterns identified from considering all trapped taxa are, moreover, strongly supported by those inferred from separate analysis of the epigeal taxa, most of which have been identified to species level. In relation to the pioneer taxa from Zone 1, for example, 86% of the pioneer taxa persist to Zone 6, while 79% of the epigeal pioneers persist. Furthermore, if only epigeal taxa identified to species level are considered, 80% are still classifiable as persistent pioneers.</p>
<p>As there is even less evidence for replacement change in the results from Storbreen in the alpine zone, it can be suggested that the ‘addition and persistence’ model is most appropriate in severe environments, where succession is a slower process and the early successional stages last longer. This conclusion is consistent with other results, not only from other Norwegian alpine and polar chronosequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483623">Bråten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683613483623">Hågvar, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683613483623">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683613483623">Hågvar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683613483623">Hodkinson et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683613483623">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683613483623">2004</xref>) but also from the Austrian Alps, where replacement change has been widely recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683613483623">Janetschek, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683613483623">Kaufmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683613483623">Kaufmann and Raffl, 2002</xref>). However, the model needs to be tested further under a wider range of environmental conditions, in relation to particular groups of invertebrates, and in the context of secondary succession.</p>

<list id="list2-0959683613483623" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Individual invertebrate taxa colonize the glacier foreland rapidly and a high proportion persist from the pioneer zone to the mature communities. Of the 67 recorded taxa, almost 50% occur on terrain within 20 years of deglacierization, and 86% of these pioneer colonizers occur also on the oldest terrain (deglacierized c. 9700 years ago). Similar patterns of rapid colonization and persistence apply to the pioneer epigeal taxa, which exhibit ~80% persistence to the mature stage.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Carnivores are particularly abundant, comprising 73–94% of epigeal taxa throughout the chronosequence. The majority of the early colonizers, including the dominant pioneer, <italic>Mitopus morio</italic>, attain peak abundance within 40 years of deglacierization. However, the flying pioneers tend to attain peak abundance sooner than the epigeal pioneer taxa, and many pioneers and most of the later colonizers attain peak abundance in the oldest zone. Later stages of succession are dominated by <italic>Formica lugubris</italic>, and are generally richer in species because of the persistence of pioneers combined with a relatively large number of additional taxa of low abundance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the community level, TWINSPAN species groups are related to terrain age but overlap in composition owing to considerable within-group variability reflecting taxa individuality. However, TWINSPAN site groups are more strongly related to terrain age, forming contiguous, nearly non-overlapping groups (in terms of presence and abundance) across the chronosequence and in the NMS ordination. Thus, the invertebrate communities are not discrete entities but are interpreted as parts of a continuum of variability. They nevertheless represent the emergence of a community structure that appears better organized than on glacier forelands in the alpine zone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Invertebrate succession in the subalpine zone is therefore consistent with a modified ‘addition and persistence model’. This allows for an element of replacement change in the later stages of a successional process that is nevertheless largely characterized by the addition of new taxa and the subsequent build-up of their individualistic populations. There appear to be few dispersal limitations on the colonization of a large proportion of the epigeal taxa (as well as the flying taxa), which reproduce successfully soon after arrival on the glacier foreland. Later changes in the abundance of invertebrate taxa and community organization during succession can be attributed to two processes: first, competition between predatory carnivores (providing the main underlying mechanism of change that is relatively independent of the parallel process of vegetation succession); and second, the development of food webs involving herbivores and, to a lesser extent, omnivores.</p></list-item>
