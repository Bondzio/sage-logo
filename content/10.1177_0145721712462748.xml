<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A 15-minute physical activity educational video narrated by US Surgeon General Dr Regina Benjamin was developed and evaluated. The video addresses the following topics: the effects of exercise on diabetes, preparations for beginning physical activity, types of physical activity, safety considerations (eg, awareness of symptoms of hypoglycemia during activity), and goal setting. Two patient screening groups were held for evaluation and revision of the video. Patient satisfaction ratings ranged 4.6 to 4.9 out of a possible 5.0 on dimensions of overall satisfaction, how informative they found the video to be, how well the video held their interest and attention, how easy the video was to understand, and how easy the video was to see and hear. Patients reported the educational video effective in empowering them to take strides toward increasing and maintaining physical activity in their lives. The tool is currently used in a clinical research trial, Project DECIDE, as one component of a diabetes and cardiovascular disease self-management program.</p>

<p>Physical activity—an essential self-management behavior for people with type 2 diabetes—has many benefits, including a contribution to weight loss; prevention of weight gain; improvement in insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and hypertension; and reduction in overall complications of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712462748">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712462748">2</xref></sup> Combined aerobic and resistance exercise programs result in greatest benefit to health and physical function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712462748">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712462748">4</xref></sup> The American Diabetes Association recommends a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity combined with resistance training activities 3 times per week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712462748">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the known importance of physical activity in managing diabetes and the consensus practice recommendations regarding incorporating regular activity into self-management regimens, the rates and intensity of physical activity among persons with type 2 diabetes, particularly African Americans, are alarmingly low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712462748">6</xref></sup> The third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported that 31% of individuals with type 2 diabetes reported no regular physical activity, with an additional 38% reporting less activity than clinically recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712462748">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712462748">8</xref></sup> Multiple barriers affect rates of physical activity among persons with type 2 diabetes, including lack of awareness, insufficient knowledge of amount and type of activity, fear of hypoglycemia, and presence of diabetes complications and comorbidities (eg, hypertension, peripheral neuropathy, and amputations) affecting engagement in exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712462748">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712462748">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712462748"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712462748">11</xref></sup> Additionally, accessibility and environmental issues (eg, cost barriers, reduced access to facilities, unsafe neighborhoods) make it difficult to meet exercise recommendations for persons in underserved communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712462748">11</xref></sup> To address these concerns, we endeavored to develop a tool that would provide a high-risk type 2 diabetes population with accessible and usable information about physical activity and safety guidelines for persons with diabetes and how to incorporate physical activity into daily life.</p>

<title>Content</title>
<p>The <italic>DECIDE to Move! Physical Activity for People With Type 2 Diabetes</italic> video was developed for Project DECIDE, a clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, investigating a problem-solving intervention for African Americans with type 2 diabetes. The video a provides evidence-based information in conjunction with current clinical practice recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712462748">5</xref></sup> The 15-minute video was created to encourage clinically recommended levels of physical activity for people with type 2 diabetes, comorbidities, and diabetes-related complications.</p>
<p>The content outline for the video is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712462748">Table 1</xref>. The DVD includes expert recommendations (eg, benefits, amounts and types of activity, safety guidelines) and patient perspectives (testimonials) to empower the viewer to engage in physical activity. Parallel to the objectives of Project DECIDE, the video provides a knowledge-based foundation, which the viewer can use to make changes to his or her physical activity routine, rather than prescribing a specific exercise regimen, which is often a barrier to participation.</p>

<title>Moderator and Narrator</title>
<p>The video was moderated by the surgeon general of the US Public Health Service, Dr Regina M. Benjamin, who provided her expertise in explaining the benefits of physical activity and encouraged patients to have fun with exercise. Her scripted content was reviewed and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as required, prior to production. Additionally, an audio narrator with previous experience in medically related audio projects was chosen as the voice for the video.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145721712462748">
<title>Patient and Expert Participants</title>
<p>The video also included 7 authentic patient volunteers with type 2 diabetes, who shared their stories and testimonials regarding physical activity and living with diabetes. Patient volunteers were recruited from a previous research study of exercise training, as well as from local diabetes and amputee support groups. Eligible candidates were middle-aged or older adults with diabetes who may have had an additional health concern (eg, obesity, diabetes-related complication or disability) and were currently making progress toward their physical activity goals across a spectrum of activity options (eg, walking, structured exercises or classes at a facility, or in-home exercise).</p>
<p>Patient volunteers were screened to gather demographics (ie, age, gender), age of diabetes onset, means of treating diabetes, and type/frequency of their physical activity. This information was sent to the scriptwriter, who contacted them for a more thorough interview regarding physical activity. Factors such as gender, body size, and status of exercise success of the on-screen candidates were carefully considered to foster representativeness and ability of the target audience to relate to the volunteers. Ultimately, 4 individuals were selected for filming and production: 2 males and 2 females (3 African Americans, 1 Caucasian), ranging in age from 58 to 68 years old and with diversity in their preferred type of physical activity, success with physical activity, body type, and mobility. Volunteer commentary was predominantly unscripted, allowing them to freely share their experiences with overcoming challenges to initiate and maintain physical activity.</p>
<p>Health care professionals delivered key clinical information in the video. The exercise physiologist (K.J.S.) and an endocrinologist (S.H.G.), who served in the expert roles, also represented racial and gender diversity.</p>

<sec id="section7-0145721712462748">
<title>Production</title>
<p>The <italic>DECIDE to Move!</italic> video was produced by the Digital Media Group of the Johns Hopkins Marketing and Communications Department, a multimedia agency with over 30 years of experience in medical education video production. The Digital Media Group oversaw all aspects of preproduction (ie, client meetings, script writing, storyboard preparations, equipment/location preparation), graphics development (ie, a stylized 2-dimensional animated sequence demonstrating blood vessel disease and fat deposits clogging the arteries), filming, and postproduction (eg, music and narration, editing).</p>

<title>Video Screening for Patient Satisfaction and Usability</title>
<sec id="section9-0145721712462748">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Two independent screening groups were held for persons with type 2 diabetes to view the video and provide feedback and ratings. The first was held in January 2011 and the second in March 2011. Reflecting the health disparities focus of the Project DECIDE program of research, participants were 8 (screening 1) and 12 (screening 2) African American men and women with type 2 diabetes who were residing in Baltimore City and were recruited from a prior study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712462748">12</xref></sup> Participants were 61 ± 10 years old (range, 43-80 years) and reported high school education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145721712462748">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants attended a 90-minute visit. After completing the informed consent process, participants viewed the <italic>DECIDE to Move!</italic> video. Following the video, participants were asked to remain quiet until each participant completed a formal satisfaction survey for feedback and ratings. Participants rated on a scale of 1 to 5 (1, not at all; 5, very much) each of the following dimensions: overall satisfaction with the video, how informative they found the video to be, how well the video held their interest and attention, how easy the video was to understand, and how easy the video was to see and hear. A final open-ended question assessed the main message that was taken away from the video.</p>
<p>After the surveys were complete and collected, an informal discussion was held for open-ended feedback on the video content and technical aspects (eg, audio and video quality, clarity). Feedback from the first screening group led to edits and revisions to font size, spelling errors, and animation. The revised version of the video tool was then presented to the second screening sample and assessed.</p>

<sec id="section11-0145721712462748">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results from the 2 screening groups are found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712462748">Table 2</xref>. Patients rated the video very highly across each dimension evaluated. Responses to the open-ended question assessing the main “take-home” message were consistent with core content topics presented in the video (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712462748">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p><italic>DECIDE to Move! Physical Activity for People With Type 2 Diabetes</italic> is a 15-minute video developed to challenge barriers that impede physical activity initiation and engagement in persons with type 2 diabetes. The video was customized to the target audience, providing evidence-based recommendations for physical activity, safety guidelines, and behavioral strategies for overcoming barriers. It was found to be engaging and informative in this development and evaluation study. It is currently being used as an educational tool in a problem-solving self-management training program for African Americans in poor metabolic control. Furthermore, the video has application to a wider population, as evidenced by its receipt of a 2011 Telly Award in the Health and Wellness category, honoring excellence in educational films and videos. The aim of dissemination of this publicly available video is empowerment of more individuals to “decide to move” to improve their disease management.</p>
