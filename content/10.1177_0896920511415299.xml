<p>In the midst of high employment rates, debates over the labor-market effects of undocumented immigrants, and a renewed assault on organized labor’s very existence, there is increasing discussion over what exactly the world of work looks like in the USA and what can be done to improve conditions of work for all workers, and especially low-wage workers. Part of the challenge of these discussions is that much of what goes on in the restaurants, on the construction sites, or in the auto-body shops of the ‘new economy’ remains in the shadows. It’s not even clear to academics or activists what we should call this new (-ish if we take the cardinal year of 1973 as a jumping off point for everything new) set of economic arrangements (post-Fordist? neoliberal? neo-Schumpeterian workfare state?) or even if they represent a fundamental shift or, in the words of Francis Fox Piven, ‘merely’ neo-laissez-faire economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511415299">Piven and Cloward, 2000</xref>). Attempts to nail down exactly what might be happening on a global scale are ever more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511415299">Brenner et al., 2010</xref>). When it comes to providing prescriptions for what advocates and organizers can and should do to arrest the declining power of workers, there is even less agreement. Some of Peck’s earlier work points to the need to scale up movements to stand in the way of global roll-outs of neoliberal regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511415299">Peck, 1996</xref>). Other writers, such as Sites, emphasize the role of the regulatory and policy apparatuses of the national state in framing opportunities and challenges for mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511415299">Sites, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511415299">2007</xref>). Piven and Cloward, in concurring with Sites, see the current challenges to workers requiring the development of new ‘repertories of contention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511415299">Piven and Cloward, 2000</xref>). Finally, while gesturing towards the importance of moving to scale, James DeFillipis claims that resistance to neoliberalism must be local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511415299">DeFilippis, 2004</xref>). To top it off, the labor movement itself is blessed (or cursed) with a fairly massive labor revitalization literature that offers a host of recommendations and critiques. Newer actors such as workers’ centers are alternatively lauded as the new organizational form for increasing worker power (Fine, 2006) or as weak organizations that can do little to fundamentally change the conditions of work for low-wage workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511415299">Jenkins, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this high level of uncertainty, there are some things we can say we know with a fairly high degree of certainty. We know that the conditions of work for all workers, but especially low-wage workers have significantly deteriorated. These conditions of work include stagnating wages, challenging scheduling practices, limited access to benefits, or limited ability to move up the occupational ladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511415299">Bernhardt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511415299">Kalleberg, 2009</xref>). Employers are increasingly ‘transferring risk’ onto hourly and other low-skill workers through job redesign, which has significant consequences for all areas of life for low-wage workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511415299">Kalleberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511415299">Lambert, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511415299">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, workplace abuse and violations of labor law have skyrocketed to Dickensian levels not seen since the industrial sweatshops of the early 20th century. We know that the Federal Government’s ability to enforce basic labor law has declined substantially to the point that they are barely able to keep up with the complaints they receive from workers, let alone engage in pro-active investigations of workplace abuses as in earlier periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511415299">Bobo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511415299">Fine and Gordon, 2010</xref>). We know that training and workforce development in the post-welfare reform era ignores the reality of weakened job ladders and workplace abuses.</p>
<p>And we know that organized labor is at yet another crossroads in 2011. The upsurge in energy, members, and political influence that followed the 1996 election of the New Voice slate appears to be foundering. Between the acrimonious battle between the Service Employees’ National Union (SEIU) and UNITE-HERE, the failure to pass the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), and less than optimal returns (in terms of overall union density at the national level) on the massive investment of resources into the organizing model, the labor union movement appears to be facing new realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511415299">Fine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511415299">Fletcher and Gapasin, 2009</xref>). We also know that even at the height of the organizing model’s energy and power, workplace abuses continued unabated and the conditions of work for low-wage workers continued to worsen.</p>
<p>We know that a group of small, underfunded, understaffed organizations called workers’ centers emerged in the late 1980s and through the so-called boom years of the 1990s as an attempt to combat workplace abuses and improve the conditions of work for low-wage workers. Janice Fine, in her book-length treatment of the workers’ center ‘movement’ defines them as ‘community-based and community-led organizations that engage in a combination of service, advocacy, and organizing to provide support to low-wage workers’ (p. 11). We know that workers’ centers are largely concentrated among (although not limited to) immigrant communities, are generally small, autonomous organizations that are founded by a combination of immigrant rights activists, religious leaders, and worker rights advocates, although some unions have established workers’ centers to assist their organizing.</p>
<p>Fine makes 10 basic claims about what workers’ centers do, based on extensive interviews and some observational studies of individual workers’ centers. First, she claims that workers’ centers at their core are hybrid organizations in that they combine elements of different kinds of organizations. Second, workers’ centers are service providers, either through direct service provided by the organization itself or through referrals. Third, workers’ centers engage in advocacy, which Fine defines as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>conduct[ing] research and releas[ing] exposes about conditions in low-wage industries, lobby[ing] for new labor and immigration laws and changes in existing ones, work[ing] with government agencies to improve monitoring and grievance processes and bring[ing] suits against employers. (p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fourth, workers’ centers engage in what Fine calls organizing. For Fine, this organizing is building strong membership organizations and engaging in leadership development for the purpose of direct economic action at workplaces and public policy reform (p. 12). Part of the hybrid nature of workers’ centers is their fifth characteristic. Fine claims that they are largely place-based rather than worksite-based. Due to this place-centeredness, workers’ center members and the organizations themselves often have strong ethnic and racial identification.</p>
<p>Fine also finds workers’ centers distinct in their commitment to leadership development and internal democracy within the organization. Many workers’ centers claim a commitment to ‘Freirian’ (Fine’s terms) forms of organizing, in their focus on using tools of popular education to build democratic organizations with strong worker leadership. Her ninth claim is that workers’ centers ‘think globally’, that their leadership especially expresses solidarity with other social movements locally and internationally. Oftentimes, workers’ centers maintain transnational ties with organizations in the home countries of many of their members. The 10th claim is that workers’ centers often have broad social change agendas that move beyond work-related problems to community and immigration needs. Workers’ centers by necessity and design are heavily involved in coalition building and, finally, have small and involved memberships.</p>
<p>Fine claims that workers’ centers ‘arise because of an absence of pre-existing institutions to integrate low-wage immigrants into American civil society and provide them with pathways to economic stability through service, self-help and self organization’ (p. 33). Much like the settlement houses of the earlier immigrant wave periods of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, workers’ centers fill the social service, advocacy, community building, and organizing void left by a weakened labor movement and a dearth of other pro-immigrant organizations. Political parties are weak and no longer rely on or are equipped to take advantage of the mobilization of new immigrants. In Fine’s view, even the immigrant organizations that exist, such as hometown associations, rarely engage in local politics or advocacy (p. 36).</p>
<p>Immigrant and other low-wage workers approach workers’ centers because they have no other place to turn, not only to resolve their workplace issues, but to find assistance on a host of other issues. Workers’ centers offer ESL classes, provide health services, run fraternal clubs, and provide identification cards for the undocumented (p. 73). According to Fine, workers’ centers, in their approach to solving workplace problems, often have legal clinics. Workers’ centers act as proxy intake centers for the opaque bureaucracies of government agencies such as the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (p. 78). As is often the case, what we don’t know about workers’ centers encompasses the most important questions about them and their role in movements of low-wage workers.</p>
<p>There are some signs of an emerging scholarly consensus that workers’ centers are largely effective in individual workplace justice campaigns, or what Nik Theodore has called ‘the hand-to-hand combat of neoliberalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511415299">Theodore, 2006</xref> and personal communication). We know that workers’ centers have success in campaigns to restore lost wages, and to fight discrimination, and that oftentimes these campaigns ignite collective action that leads to policy change or significant changes in conditions of work. One clear example of this is the role that Young Workers United, a workers’ center in San Francisco, played in passing a municipal paid sick leave law (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://youngworkersunited.org">youngworkersunited.org</ext-link>, consulted 27 May 2011). Beyond scattered examples such as this, it is unclear whether, how, or to what end workers’ centers can move to scale, that is create ‘something’ that reconfigures the power balances between worker and employer (Gordon, pp. 146, 291).</p>
<p>There is also a dearth of academic study that confirms or complicates Fine’s notions of why workers’ centers came into existence. It is true that in many cities and regions, such as the suburban sprawl of New York’s Long Island confronting The Workplace Project (documented by Gordon in <italic>Suburban Sweatshops</italic>), workers’ centers have become hubs for services and the major advocacy and organizing organizations for low-wage immigrant workers. But there are a number of cities and regions which have a relatively dense network of institutions that provide services to immigrant workers and organize immigrants around other issues, albeit not necessarily to improve their conditions of work. We know little to nothing about the struggles, daily practices, successes, and activist niches of workers’ centers in such places where they are a part of a large field of immigrant-oriented institutions.</p>
<p>This is why <italic>Working for Justice: The LA Model of Organizing and Advocacy</italic> is such an important work. Edited by Ruth Milkman, Joshua Bloom and Victor Narro, the book is a work of public sociology that documents the work and campaigns of unions and workers’ centers in the progressive, pro-labor hotbed of Los Angeles in the early 21st century. In examining these campaigns and organizations in detail we are left with some significant new understandings of workers’ centers and their role in movements for low-wage workers, but as always, questions remain.</p>
<p>Los Angeles is clearly a different place in terms of social movement mobilization than other US cities. The authors point out that unlike other cities, where unions and workers’ centers rarely connect and largely work on separate tracks, in Los Angeles unions and workers’ centers ‘interact regularly and have developed, over time, a shared strategic repertoire’ (p. 2). This is precisely what a hybrid of Piven’s and DeFilippis’s recommendations for mobilization should look like: local resistance to neoliberalism that develops new and confounding repertoires of contention. Because of the uniquely advanced development of workers’ center and union interactions documented here, the various chapters of the book reveal a number of important points about the role of workers’ centers in improving conditions of work for low-wage workers and what an active local labor movement looks like and can achieve</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it becomes increasingly clear throughout the book that workers’ centers have certain comparative advantages when it comes to generating movements for low-wage workers while unions have others. These advantages are in fact largely mutually exclusive and are in their own ways vital to improving conditions of work for low-wage workers. Most importantly, these advantages are built into the state regulatory apparatus that governs these organizational forms. Workers’ centers as they are designed now cannot be unions in the sense of representing a group of workers. The moment they claim to do so, they begin to run afoul of the National Labour Relations Act (NLRA) and related labor law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511415299">Rosenfeld, 2006</xref>). The creative repertoires of contention developed by workers’ centers to improve conditions of work for low-wage workers are largely inappropriate for labor unions as defined by US labor law. Arguing that workers’ centers are some form of ‘community union’ or need to become more like unions in order to have more sustainable or long-term impact on conditions of work for low-wage workers is entirely unhelpful without taking into account the constraints the state places on this possibility.</p>
<p>This forces us to move past the ‘common sense’ which would say that because workers’ centers are small, staff-led, and cannot build the kind of monopoly (in the political and economic sense) power that unions have, they are merely reformist, confined to individual-level interventions or that their contributions are limited until they become more like unions. Instead we are left with the task, both in reading and in further research, of teasing out just what it is that workers’ centers can do to move movements to scale or of better understanding just what are the movement advantages of workers’ centers. There are a host of examples in the book of such activities, such as uniting with unions to provide community support, developing expanded tactical repertoires, leveraging government agencies in support of low-wage workers, or overcoming the infamous ‘urban trenches’ of work and home through unique mobilization. Importantly we also get a sense that workers’ centers are able to craft ideological appeals on behalf of low-wage workers that draw in allies traditionally averse to labor union-led campaigns for workers. There is something about ‘community-based non-profit worker rights organizations’ that seems to have broader ideological and discursive appeal than the rhetoric of unions and collective bargaining.</p>
<p>We also get a better sense from the book of what exactly the ‘community’ means for workers’ centers. In Los Angeles, workers’ centers both create new communities and mobilize extant communities. Some workers’ centers act similarly to the centers in Janice Fine’s work, creating community by agglomerating disparate individual workers under the banner of improved working conditions. Others engage in what community and social movement scholars have called the ‘social construction of space’, creating defended communities that can be mobilized for action. Still other workers’ centers (the Korean Immigrant Workers Association is the best example of this) are deeply engaged in contesting definitions of community and neighborhood. In other words, some workers’ centers mobilize specific ethnic communities, some mobilize neighborhoods, some create community out of disparate individuals or groups who come into a center with workplace labor law violations and some build community within a specific industry. This is a not unimportant clarification, both theoretically and practically. ‘Community group’ has different connotations for different social movement actors and can often be used in an almost pejorative sense when describing workers’ centers. What we learn from <italic>Working for Justice</italic> is that there is, for example, a significant operational and social movement niche difference between workers’ centers and local Jobs with Justice chapters.</p>
<p>In a related way, we also get a better sense of the diversity of workers’ center intervention strategies. Earlier work on workers’ centers made some mention of this diversity, but by chronicling the array of centers in Los Angeles, Milkman et al. introduce us to the broad array of strategic choices made by workers’ centers. Workers’ centers differ not only in how they conceive of the community that they are mobilizing, but also in how they choose which campaigns to work on, whether they prioritize health and safety violations or focus on wage theft, their relationships with labor unions, and how they relate to the legal system and government bureaucracies.</p>
<p>In presenting this diversity, Milkman and her collaborators force us to the provocative question of what exactly are the implications of this diversity. In other words, why are workers’ centers so diverse in terms of the communities they mobilize and the intervention strategies they engage in? There are at least three possible answers to this question.</p>
<p>First, this diversity of approaches could represent movement incoherence. It is entirely possible that instead of a strength, this diversity represents a movement too small, too scattered, and too focused on the crushing weight of the daily struggles of workers to reflect on shared experiences and develop ‘best practices’. A second, more sanguine version of this idea is that this diversity represents movement immaturity, that at some point, best practices will float to the top and a more coherent set of approaches will develop. Finally, it is possible that this diversity of approaches brings us back to earlier discussions of variegated neoliberalism and strategic repertoires. There exists the tantalizing possibility that whether intentionally or not, workers’ centers have developed a diversity of approaches because of the diversity of challenges faced by low-wage workers. Different industries, different local and regional economies, and different communities of low-wage workers interact with different aspects of neoliberal political economy and different regulatory legacies. There may be something that we can learn about the nature of the neoliberal regulatory project by examining the diversity of resistance to it.</p>
<p>All this being said, what is most provocative about <italic>Working for Justice</italic> is that the labor movement in Los Angeles confounds the assumption shared by much of the labor movement revitalization literature that union density is a proxy for movement strength. Again, it is important to emphasize the overarching conclusion that unions and union density are necessary, but it becomes apparent that they are not sufficient for improving the conditions of work for low-wage workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920511415299">Sullivan, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511415299">2010</xref>). Los Angeles has fairly low union density (as compared to Chicago or New York) but strong labor movement vitality. Workers’ centers play an important role in the organizational diversity that drives the movement in the Los Angeles labor movement and in fact is what makes the labor movement in Los Angeles a movement.</p>
<p>Beyond the organizational diversity, the Los Angeles model shows what makes a movement successful is sharing: of resources, strategic repertoires, membership, and campaigns. It is in this specific instance that the weakness of the work is revealed. The work of public sociology is vital because it gets us to better understandings of ‘how it works’, grounding broad conceptions of economics, politics, and social theory in actually existing labor market arrangements, social movement histories, and political agency.</p>
<p>The weakness of this approach is that by not fully engaging in theoretical reflection, one can sometimes be left with the leftist version of ‘great man’ history, with too much agency and happy coincidence. For example, failure to engage with Walter Julio Nicholls’ theoretical and empirical work on relational platforms and their role in facilitating the social movement sharing so important to the Los Angeles model leaves those who seek to create the same momentum in other cities pining for the progressive Shangri-La of Los Angeles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511415299">Nicholls, 2003</xref>). The final wrap-up chapter in this volume often seems to descend into a hagiography of the Downtown Labor Center and specific individual activists. This chapter could have been better shaped to both theoretically and empirically draw the lens of analysis out to more meso- or macro-level types of analysis.</p>
<p>There is a significant amount of rich data in this work that would help answer the question that both academics and workers’ center staff have about moving to scale. Again, we learn from <italic>Working for Justice</italic> that workers’ centers have more tactical freedom, have more ability to build and mobilize community and even are able to construct ideologically more palatable appeals on behalf of low-wage workers. But we are still left unsure of exactly what moving to scale would look like or even how the scale achieved by Los Angeles workers’ centers and unions could be replicated elsewhere. A whole school of theory would say that strong membership organizations are the key to building a movement for low-wage workers, implying that if workers’ centers cannot do that then they should be the gateway into unions for the organized (as <italic>Working for Justice</italic> hints). This is the basis of Jenkins’ critique of workers’ centers and is a common critique that surfaces when labor activists first become aware of workers’ centers. An entirely different set of theory would argue that workers’ centers move to scale by increasing their disruptive and discursive skills, thereby embarrassing and forcing the hand of government agencies to re-regulate the labor market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511415299">Piven and Cloward, 1979</xref>). Again, this is not merely an academic task. Workers’ centers need to respond to the new overtures from a reforming and re-energized Department of Labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511415299">Fine and Gordon, 2010</xref>) in ways that fit their strengths and avoid significant movement co-optation.</p>
<p>Or perhaps what we learn from <italic>Working for Justice</italic> is that the role of workers’ centers in moving efforts to improve conditions of work for low-pay workers to scale may be ‘just doing what they do’ and fully occupying the movement niches they already can and do occupy. Instead of seeing workers’ centers just through the frame of community organization or labor market intermediary, perhaps workers’ centers fit in the long history of organizations that built social movements by socially constructing objective conditions as social problems (wage theft in this case) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511415299">Blumer, 1971</xref>), mobilized allies and the affected around the problem, and created ‘causal stories’ and frames that moved policy change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511415299">Kingdon, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511415299">Stone, 1989</xref>). The historical analogs of workers’ centers may not only be found in labor history or even in the history of community organizing but rather in the efforts of such groups as the rape crisis centers of the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511415299">Gornick and Meyer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>It is clear then that there is much still to know about workers’ centers and the struggle to improve conditions of work for low-wage workers in 21st century America. <italic>Working for Justice</italic> is an excellent stepping off point for even more empirically rich, theoretically grounded studies of the workers’ center movement.</p>
