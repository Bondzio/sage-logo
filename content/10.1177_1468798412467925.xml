<p>Published in 2004, Charmian Kenner’s book continues to add to more recent ‘syncretic literacy studies’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798412467925">Drury, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798412467925">Gregory et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798412467925">Gregory, 2008</xref>) that focus on young literacy learners’ ‘process of blending different cultural, linguistic;literacy experiences to create new forms as syncretism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798412467925">Drury, 2009</xref>, p. 262). Kenner’s book, along with her ongoing BeLiFS project led by Eve Gregory (Economic and Social Research Council; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/Grants/RES-062-23-1613/read">http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/Grants/RES-062-23-1613/read</ext-link>), continues to shed light on early literacy education in a complicated web of home, community and school interactions against multilingual and multicultural backdrops.</p>
<p>In this book, Kenner presents the complexity and richness of London six-year-olds’ biliteracy learning experiences in various settings (i.e. homes, community heritage language schools and mainstream English primary schools). Kenner captures the wealth of these biliterate children’s metalinguistic knowledge. She also foregrounds their agentive roles in negotiating meaning making and their creative experiments with different language symbols. Drawing on rich descriptions of these young children’s biliteracy learning in various milieux, Kenner offers language teachers and policy makers insights into an extended language learning curriculum. Such a curriculum mobilizes reciprocal exchanges among various actors in immigrant families, community schools and mainstream English primary schools to enrich children’s biliteracy development in linguistically and culturally diverse contexts.</p>
<p>The book has five chapters. Chapter 1presents six children’s wide range of literacy experiences at home and community language schools. These immigrant families and community schools were determined to expand children’s literacy options in different languages, thus creating spaces for young children to connect with their heritage languages and cultures. For example, Yazan maintained his links with Syria by paying summer visits and writing letters to his grandparents there. Sadhana kept her regular phonetalks in Spanish with her grandmother who lived in Ecuador. Selina’s parents, originally from Hong Kong, subscribed to television channels from Taiwan, Hong Kong and London to immerse their children in Cantonese, Mandarin and English popular cultures, which had been ‘highly motivating’ (p. 6) for Selina and her siblings’ literacy learning in multiple languages. In this chapter, Kenner also accentuates how diverse modes stimulated these young children’s literacy learning in multiple languages. They thrived on multimodal experiences such as writing greetings cards in English, making New Year cards in Chinese, singing songs in Arabic, inventing rhyming songs in English, copying pictures from Japanese cartoons with self-written comments, telling stories from the Qur’an, and playing computer games in English. Children, their siblings and parents also took advantage of every possible space and instrument in everyday life to engage in meaning making. Yazan and his mother’s Arabic shopping lists and Sadhana and her cousin’s writing on a steamed-up window in the kitchen are typical examples. In chapter 1, immigrant parents displayed their determination to cultivate their children’s biliterate skills at home and in community language schools. They were aware of the importance of being bilingual and biliterate in the increasingly multilingual and multicultural world. They also noted the close tie between languages and identities. Accordingly, the community schools provided platforms, such as the annual Chinese New Year celebration and the annual Arabic Festival, for these bilingual and biliterate children to keep up links with their heritage communities.</p>
<p>In this research project, Kenner encouraged the six children to direct peer teaching sessions and show their ‘pupils’ how to write in different languages. In chapter 2, Kenner describes scenarios when these multilingual children taught their peers and clarified their understanding of how various language systems operate. In the teaching sessions, the children explicitly tapped their metalinguistic knowledge of differences and relations between various writing systems. Chapter 2 exemplifies a social semiotic perspective that conceives of children’s understanding of literacy as socially situated. For example, Tala noticed the principles of joined-up writing in Arabic. Yazan demonstrated his knowledge that Arabic and English follow different patterns of directionality. Ming recognized the stroke patterns of Chinese and understood that Chinese language is different from alphabetic language and is sometimes pictorial and largely logographic. Brian tried to explain to his peers the key role of vowels in Spanish. He said:‘The M on her own doesn’t say anything – just “mmm” – you have to put it together’ (p. 51). Kenner’s social semiotic perspective also views children as active literacy agents who ‘re-interpret’ (p. 35) and rework the input from their socially constructed practices. The opportunity of teaching peers socially constructed symbols in their heritage languages added ‘new dimensions’ (p. 40) to these young children’s literacy learning. It also motivated them to reflect upon the differing principles of various written languages and look for the right ‘metalinguistic terminology’ (p. 51) to clarify the differences. In chapter 2, children's writing practices in English show these young English language learners’ desire and capacity to use available resources to make meanings in English as a second language. Their monolingual and bilingual peers also turned out to be avid learners and beneficiaries of this extended language learning approach.</p>
<p>In chapter 3, Kenner captures the nuances of these biliterate children’s literacy practices and knowledge to prove that handwriting is not ‘a purely mechanical skill’ (p. 74). Different acts of writing pertaining to different writing systems embody distinctive ‘cultural philosophy[ies]’ (Sassoon, 1995, cited in Kenner, p. 74). These children acquired the cultural philosophies through learning the visual and kinaesthetic aspects of writing. Kenner defined children’s knowledge of ‘designing symbols and using the graphic space of the page, and the physical process of writing’ as ‘embodied knowledge’ (p. 103). Children’s embodied knowledge of cultural philosophies pertaining to Chinese, Arabic, Spanish and English are exemplified in their conceptual awareness, such as the importance of dots in Arabic; the writing accents in Spanish; the shape, length and sequence of strokes in Chinese characters; and the left–right directionality of English. Such embodied knowledge expanded these biliterate children’s literacy options. It also enabled them to be adaptable to different contexts and different writing systems. In chapter 3, Kenner probes how children drew on a variety of modes to produce different written graphic symbols. Using pen on paper, cutting out shapes with scissors and engaging their bodies in writing all linked to children’s conceptual, cognitive, aesthetic, affective and kinaesthetic enrichment. Kenner also displays how children’s multimodal experience was shaped by culturally situated pedagogies. Their multimodal experience is also the embodiment of children’s agentive roles in reworking various linguistic and cultural resources in their writing and peer teaching. For instance, children incorporated their own preferred styles when they produced their signatures. Brian’s insistence on the upper-case ‘N’ in his signature is a typical example. Yazan’s creative experiment with writing his name in English but with an Arabic right–left directionality exemplifies these biliterate children’s ‘visual and actional flexibility’ (p. 97) with different directionalities.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 focuses on biliterate children’s ‘simultaneous worlds’ (p. 107) where they differentiated the co-existing symbols and concepts from both their heritage languages and second languages. Children made connections of the languages and ‘thrive on simultaneity’ (p. 110). For instance, Brian drew on the simultaneous resources of letter–sound correspondences in both Spanish and English and wrote the caption ‘losokwle’ (‘un osoquevuele’ [‘a bear which flies’]) for his drawing (p. 117). After writing her name in Arabic from right to left, Tala spelled her name in English from right to left, wiped it out, and rewrote it from left to right. Kenner interprets the moments when these biliterate children transferred from one system to another as ‘moments of transitions’ (p. 117) instead of as language confusions. Selina’s creative Chinese texts about ‘Love’ (‘<inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798412467925-img1.tif"/>’) and ‘Girl Power’ (‘<inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798412467925-img2.tif"/>’: a notion from western popular culture) (p. 119) exemplify the powerful synthesis that these biliterate children made out of the co-existing linguistic and cultural resources. Tala and her siblings’ chalking of coloured messages in the car park – ‘Come on English’ – demonstrates that they felt at ease about their multiple identities as co-inhabitants of the simultaneous worlds (p. 123). As Kenner comments:‘there was no contradiction between the different aspects of their cultural lives, from supporting the English football team to studying the Qur’an or participating in Arabic community celebration’ (p. 123).</p>
<p>In chapter 5, Kenner elaborates on the literacy learning resources provided by the immigrant families as ‘literacy eco-systems’ (p. 130). For Kenner, the metaphor of ‘literacy eco-systems’ would enable a better understanding of how ‘family members are mutually inter-dependent and adjust their roles to best accomplish the children’s bilingual learning… and the linguistic survival of their family and community’ (p. 130). Drawing on data on different bilingual families’ different ways of approaching literacy learning, Kenner identifies factors that affect the dynamics of literacy ecosystems. These factors include gender, age, family size, family’s migration history, family members’ personality, and their knowledge and expertise in literacy education in both English and heritage languages. In this chapter, Kenner also offers rich descriptions of how parents, grandparents and siblings acted as literacy learning resources and played various roles in supporting younger ones’ biliteracy development. The young children themselves are also depicted as linguistic and cultural mediators who helped adults in the household to learn English. In Kenner’s view, a better understanding of the dynamics of these literacy ecosystems will help school teachers make home–school connections to enhance children’s biliteracy development.</p>
<p>From time to time, Kenner reiterates a ‘wealth model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798412467925">Pahl and Rowsell, 2005</xref>, p. 54) that celebrates non-mainstream parents’ and educators’ funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798412467925">González et al., 2005</xref>) of literacy and biliteracy education in the home and community school settings. Kenner contrasts these settings with a ‘monolingual and Anglocentric’ (p. 124) milieu in the mainstream English primary school. Hence, she upholds an extended language learning curriculum against the globalized multilingual and multicultural backdrops. Such a curriculum favours interactive and reciprocal connections among immigrant families, community schools and mainstream English primary schools to enrich children’s biliteracy development. She exemplifies how the literacy learning practices at community schools complemented and reinforced what was taught at the primary school. Kenner foregrounds the Arabic community school’s inclusive approach of holding regular meetings with parents to discuss the curriculum. The peer teaching components in Kenner’s research project also opened up children’s literacy learning at community schools to teachers at the mainstream primary schools. It provided mainstream educators with insights into young children’s biliteracy learning. As a result, teachers from community schools and primary schools came together and shared their knowledge of literacy education.</p>
<p>Kenner’s work offers an important vantage point for literacy educators to perceive children’s biliteracy practices at home and communities. It celebrates the wealth of immigrant families’ and community school teachers’ funds of knowledge in supporting biliteracy development. Kenner also offers ideas and resources for literacy educators to harness the richness of students’ biliteracy practices. There are also recommendations for policy makers to develop an extended language learning curriculum that intends to mobilize the links between immigrant families, community schools and mainstream English schools.</p>
