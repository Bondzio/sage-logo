<abstract>
<p>This study examined critical features of secondary special educator’s experiences with transition professional development to predict variables most likely to influence performance of transition planning and services. Results included the extent to which secondary special educators are prepared to perform transition practices, the relationship between preparation and the frequency of performance, and specific variables predictive of higher levels of implementation. The results confirm that training matters if special educators are to implement transition interventions and services. Professionals with formal transition coursework and high rates of professional development were more likely to implement transition practices. Implications are offered for establishing specialized professional development originating from established course content sustained and supported with ongoing professional development.</p>

<body>
<p>Since 1990, and with subsequent amendments in 1997 and 2004, the transition provisions of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) have been a strong impetus for special educators to assume a coordinated approach to delivering transition services. The mandate contains language identifying special education teachers as having primary responsibility for overseeing the planning and facilitation of school to adulthood transitions. Despite such legislative mandates, students with disabilities continue to face postschool outcomes in which they are unprepared and unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0888406412474022">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, &amp; Knokey, 2009</xref>). One reason students with disabilities face such challenges may be due in part to secondary special education teachers’ feeling unprepared to plan for and deliver transition services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0888406412474022">Li, Bassett, &amp; Hutchinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0888406412474022">Wolfe, Boone, &amp; Blanchett, 1998</xref>). Effectively preparing personnel requires providing training on specific knowledge and competencies often beyond what is included in most special education teacher preparation programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412474022">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>). Special education teachers have reported a lack of knowledge of transition competencies, and that this hinders their abilities to implement effective practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412474022">Blanchett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412474022">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>). Consequently, teachers who are unprepared to plan and deliver transition services may be contributing to poor outcomes for students with disabilities.</p>
<p>Given the changing roles of secondary special educators, it stands to reason that teacher education programs would respond accordingly. Unfortunately, this has not yet proven to be the case. In fact, findings from a national survey of special education personnel preparation programs revealed that less than half of the special education programs offered a stand-alone course devoted to transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412474022">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>). Whether special education teacher education programs offer transition content and coursework is often dependent on state licensure requirements as well as federal and state funding and incentives promoting specialized content. Personnel development has been recognized as a central strategy for improvement among state educational agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406412474022">Blalock et al., 2003</xref>), yet clear guidance has yet to emerge for ensuring high-quality methods.</p>
<sec id="section1-0888406412474022">
<title>Implementing Transition Practices</title>
<p>Because all secondary special educators should be involved in transition planning, it is critical that they possess core knowledge and skills to enable them to effectively plan and deliver services. Research findings over the past decade, however, indicate teachers are well aware of whether or not they have acquired in-depth transition knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412474022">Blanchett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0888406412474022">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0888406412474022">Wolfe et al., 1998</xref>). Possessing limited knowledge and skills impacts the use of effective practices, in that teachers who are not confident of their transition skills are less likely to implement transition activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412474022">Benitez, Morningstar, &amp; Frey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of actual practices, special education teachers have reported possessing a general understanding of transition planning and mandates. Teachers have rated their level of involvement in transition and Individualized Education Program (IEP) planning as moderate to high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412474022">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>). Almost a decade later, a national study found similar results. Teachers rated being most prepared to implement transition planning. Secondary special education teachers, however, were less likely to implement activities in other domains (e.g., transition assessment, interagency collaboration, transition-focused curriculum and instruction, and instructional planning; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412474022">Benitez et al., 2009</xref>). Such findings suggest that typical teacher education programs have armed secondary special educators with the skills needed to plan but not deliver transition services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0888406412474022">
<title>Limited Transition Training</title>
<p>Most secondary special educators report their transition training was on-the-job, rather than through comprehensive teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0888406412474022">Greene &amp; Kochhar-Bryant, 2003</xref>). State priorities for transition personnel development and training can impact the acquisition of transition competencies among practicing special educators. The present state of transition professional development is illustrated by a lack of clear policies as well as limited systems for planning, delivering, and evaluating professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0888406412474022">Morningstar &amp; Liss, 2008</xref>). In addition, the field has yet to agree on the critical content for transition professional development, with most training focused on discrete knowledge and skills outside the broader context of secondary educational systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406412474022">Morningstar &amp; Clark, 2003</xref>). In addition, little effort has been placed on teaching emergent evidence-based interventions or systems-level factors leading to change.</p>
<p>The field is aware of the problems associated with limited educator competence and the impact this has to support students for the transition to adulthood. As described previously, the relationship between level of knowledge and skills and the likelihood of implementing effective transition practices is evident. Both barriers and facilitative factors supporting transition-specific content within teacher education and professional development have been identified. Less is known about strategies and approaches toward increasing transition competencies. A better understanding of critical factors and influences on effective methods for teacher education and professional development is needed. Within our current constraints of reduced budgets for teacher professional development, distilling essential and impactful approaches will strengthen outcomes for students.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to more closely examine the critical features of secondary special educators’ experiences with transition professional development to predict which variables were more likely to influence the frequency with which special educators perform activities related to transition planning and services. The research questions guiding this study were as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0888406412474022" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: To what extent do secondary special educators and transition specialists feel prepared to and with what frequency are they performing effective transition practices?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Is there a relationship between preparation experience and the frequency with which they perform transition practices?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: Are certain preparation variables more likely to predict how prepared secondary special educators feel and how frequently they perform effective transition practices?</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0888406412474022" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The results of this research were part of a larger study designed to more broadly examine the transition competencies of secondary special educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0888406412474022">Benitez et al., 2009</xref>). The focus of this study is to specifically examine the factors most likely to influence the frequency with which secondary special educators implement transition activities. In particular, we examined the influence of a teacher’s preparation experience on frequency of implementing transition competencies. A “preparation experience” construct was created as a composite variable consisting of years teaching, certification/licensure levels, number of transition courses, and hour of professional development in transition. Data were collected from a national sample of 557 secondary special educators who responded to a survey of 46 transition competencies in which participants were asked to report levels of preparation as well as the frequency with which they performed the competencies.</p>
<sec id="section4-0888406412474022">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants included middle and high school special educators from 31 states. Using a national educational marketing database of more than 35,000 secondary special educators, approximately 6,200 participants recognized as responsible for teaching youth with learning disabilities (LD), intellectual disabilities (ID), emotional and behavioral disabilities (ED/BD), and high-incidence (noncategorical) students were identified and randomly selected. The researchers employed a stratified random sampling procedure to select a representative sample of teachers responsible for teaching students from four disability groups matching the categorical proportion of students in special education as reported to the Department of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0888406412474022">U.S. Department of Education, 2008</xref>). From this stratified pool, 1,800 participants were randomly selected using the following stratification among certain disability categories: (a) 1,200 (67%) from the LD category; (b) 200 (11%) from the resource classroom category; (c) 200 (11%) from the ED/BD category; and (d) 200 (11%) from the ID category.</p>

<sec id="section5-0888406412474022">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The <italic>Secondary Teachers’ Transition Survey</italic> (STTS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0888406412474022">Benitez &amp; Morningstar, 2005</xref>) was developed specifically for use in this study, primarily due to the paucity of research in this particular area, as well as the dated content of previous surveys available at the time of the initial research. In particular, we were interested in ensuring that the most current transition requirements under the IDEA 2004 were reflected in the survey, as well as competencies identified by national organizations offering special education and transition teacher standards. In addition, the STTS incorporated current issues facing the secondary special educators as well as the field in general that had emerged since previous standards were developed. For example, items specific to cultural responsiveness to families and students, assistive technology, access to the general education curriculum, and accountability measures were included in the STTS item pool and incorporated into the final items. To develop the instrument and ensure content and social validity, the researchers conducted a thorough review of the special education transition literature to identify (a) effective transition planning and service delivery practices, (b) the provision of transition-related content within teacher preparation programs, and (c) teachers’ perceptions of their own delivery of transition services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412474022">Blanchett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406412474022">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412474022">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>). In addition, national certification standards were examined to identify transition-related competencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406412474022">Council for Exceptional Children’s [CEC] <italic>Standards for All Beginning Special Education Teachers in Individualized General Curriculum</italic>, 2009b</xref>, and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412474022">CEC <italic>Standards for the Preparation of Transition Specialists</italic>, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section6-0888406412474022">
<title>Selecting Transition Domains and Competencies</title>
<p>The investigators reviewed several research articles addressing transition competencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412474022">Blanchett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0888406412474022">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412474022">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>). The competencies contained in these articles were combined with the CEC General Curriculum Standards for Beginning Teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0888406412474022">CEC, 2009b</xref>), as well as the CEC Advanced Standards for Transition Specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412474022">CEC, 2009a</xref>) which yielded a total of 289 possible transition-related teacher competencies. A matrix was developed using the CEC General Curriculum standards serving as an initial, preexisting taxonomy into which the 289 competencies were grouped. Items selected for the STTS were determined through a content analysis and data-reduction method that resulted in the classification of certain competencies most often identified as critical for secondary special education teachers. The selection of a competency was determined if it was present in at least 90% of all sources of research/competency standards. The end result was the identification of 46 competencies that fell within six domains: <italic>Instructional Planning, Curriculum and Instruction, Transition Planning, Assessment, Collaboration, and Additional Competencies</italic>. Each domain included approximately seven competency statements.</p>
<p>The STTS collected a variety of demographic information, of which this study was most interested in (a) number of years teaching, (b) number of transition courses taken, (c) number of transition staff development hours, (d) level of certification for teaching, (e) classifications of students taught, (f) types of educational classrooms, and (g) community setting. The second part of the STTS was designed to elicit respondent perceptions regarding levels of preparation as well as frequency with which participants performed the 46 transition competencies. For every listed competency statement, the participants responded to a 4-point Likert-type scale regarding their level of preparation (1 = <italic>very unprepared</italic> to 4 = <italic>very prepared</italic>) and frequency of performance (1 = <italic>never</italic> to 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>). Item consistency across the two rating subscales was determined using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient; demonstrated alphas of .96 and .94, respectively, indicated high reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0888406412474022">Santos, 1999</xref>). In addition, internal consistency reliability estimates (coefficient alpha) for each of the seven subscales were computed and ranged from .83 to .95, indicating good to high reliability.</p>
<p>Survey packets were mailed to participants that included the STTS; a cover letter explaining the purpose of the study; self-addressed, postage-paid envelope; and a teabag as well as opportunity to enter a drawing for a DVD player, as an incentive to complete and return the survey. Approximately 20 days after the first mailing, a postcard reminder was sent to those individuals who had not yet responded. Several weeks after the postcard reminder, a second survey packet was sent. After 2 months, researchers completed a third round of mailings resulting in a total of 557 returned surveys.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the original 1,800 surveys sent, 643 were returned, with 86 deemed unusable (participants were not special educators), thereby decreasing the total number of possible surveys from 1,800 to 1,714. In total, 557 valid surveys were completed and returned, generating a 33% response rate.</p>
<sec id="section8-0888406412474022">
<title>Demographic Results</title>
<p>Respondents indicated the types of students whom they taught: (a) 51% students with LD, (b) 11% students with ID, (c) 9% “Transition” as their primary teaching responsibility (e.g., transition specialists), (d) 6% students with ED/BD, and (e) 3% “low-incidence” students (e.g., deaf/blind, significant ID, other health impairment). In addition, a “Combination” group comprising 20% of the respondents was calculated based on teachers checking more than one disability category. The majority of respondents taught at the secondary level (66% high school and 23% middle school). Ten percent taught across grade levels. The type of settings in which they provided instruction included 39% resource room, 21% self-contained special education classroom, 20% multiple settings, 10% co-teaching in general education, 5% “other” classrooms, 5% special schools, and 4% special education consultant services. The type of community in which they worked included 20% urban, 32% suburban, 46% rural, and 3% combination of geographic locations.</p>
<sec id="section9-0888406412474022">
<title>Level of Preparation Experience</title>
<p>To calculate a “preparation experience” variable, participants were asked to respond to items pertaining to teaching and professional development experiences (years teaching, highest degree, number of transition courses, number of professional development hours). The mean for total years teaching was 17 years (range = 1-41 years), with educators falling into three groups: 1 to 10 years teaching (33%), 11 to 21 years teaching (34%), and 22+ years teaching (33%). Thirty-two percent indicated highest degree was a bachelor’s, while 63% held master’s degrees, 0.7% doctoral degrees, and 4.3% other degrees (e.g., associate of arts degrees). Twenty-one percent of the respondents indicated that they were working on additional degrees.</p>
<p>The mean number of transition-related courses was 1.07, with an unusually wide range of responses (0-70); therefore, all responses above 6 or more courses were analyzed as missing data, leaving the total number of respondents for this item at 486. The average number of transition-related staff development hours was 28 hours, with almost 14% reporting no professional development in transition. The preparation experience variable was calculated by first computing <italic>Z</italic> scores for the four variables (i.e., certification, years teaching, transition courses, and professional development). These scores were then summed to compute a single score reflecting “preparation experience.”</p>

<sec id="section10-0888406412474022">
<title>Levels of Preparation and Implementation of Transition-Specific Competencies</title>
<p>Respondents rated their overall level of preparation to perform the 46 transition competencies as <italic>somewhat unprepared</italic> to <italic>somewhat prepared</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 2.69, <italic>SD</italic> = .65) on a scale of 1 = <italic>very unprepared</italic> to 4 = <italic>very prepared</italic>. A one-way between-groups ANOVA was conducted to determine differences in preparation levels between special educators working with specific student disability groups (i.e., LD, ID, ED/BD, combination, low-incidence, and transition). We found significant differences between groups, <italic>F</italic>(5, 543) = 5.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with a small effect size (η<sup>2</sup> = .046) accounting for 5% of the variance. Post hoc tests using the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test demonstrated the mean score for preparation levels of the Transition group (<italic>M</italic> = 3.08, <italic>SD</italic> = .08) was significantly higher than certain other teacher groups: (a) LD (<italic>M</italic> = 2.61, <italic>SD</italic> = .62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .00), (b) low-incidence (<italic>M</italic> = 2.53 <italic>SD</italic> = .64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .03), and (c) combination (<italic>M</italic> = 2.66, <italic>SD</italic> = .66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .002).</p>
<sec id="section11-0888406412474022">
<title>Level of Implementation of Transition Activities</title>
<p>Respondents indicated the frequency with which they performed transition practices along a scale of 1 = <italic>never</italic> to 5 = <italic>frequently</italic>. Average frequency fell within the range of <italic>rarely</italic> to <italic>occasionally</italic> (<italic>M</italic> = 2.70, <italic>SD</italic> = .56). One-way ANOVAs comparing student groups revealed that differences were statistically significant, <italic>F</italic>(5, 545) = 6.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, with a moderate effect size (η<sup>2</sup> = .053). Post hoc comparisons using Tukey HSD indicated significant differences for frequency of implementing transition activities among the Transition group (<italic>M</italic> = 3.03, <italic>SD</italic> = .51) and certain subgroups of teachers: (a) LD (<italic>M</italic> = 2.62, <italic>SD</italic> = .53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), (b) low-incidence (<italic>M</italic> = 2.54, <italic>SD</italic> = .66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and (c) combination (<italic>M</italic> = 2.71, <italic>SD</italic> = .56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Thus, transition specialists were more likely than certain teachers to implement transition activities. In addition, post hoc comparison of means were significantly different among teachers of students with ID (<italic>M</italic> = 2.87, <italic>SD</italic> = .63,) and teachers of students with LD (<italic>p</italic> = .02), indicating that teachers of students with ID were more likely to perform transition competencies than were teachers of students with LD.</p>

<p>An initial analysis determined the relationship between levels of preparation and frequency of performance of transition activities. A Pearson correlation showed a significant and large positive correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) indicating that the more prepared teachers perceived themselves to be to plan and deliver transition services, the more frequently they reported performing these activities.</p>
<p>Correlation analyses were then computed to determine the relationship between the teacher preparation experience composite score (years teaching, number of courses, hours of staff development) and level of preparation. Preparation experience and level of preparation were significantly, positively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The strength of the relationship was moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0888406412474022">Green, Salkind, &amp; Akey, 2000</xref>) and indicated that the higher teachers’ preparation experience scores, the better prepared they reported themselves to be able to perform the transition activities. Correlation coefficients were also computed for the preparation experience variable and the frequency with which educators engaged in transition practices. Preparation experience was also significantly and moderately correlated with frequency scores (<italic>r</italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), with the results indicating that high scores on the preparation experience variables were associated with high levels of engagement in delivering transition services to students.</p>
<p>Based on these results, analysis of the preparation experience factors was completed to confirm relationships among factors and frequency of implementation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0888406412474022">Table 2</xref>). These results indicated significant moderate correlations among courses and staff development and a low but significant correlation with certification status and frequency of implementation. A regression analysis was conducted to examine which preparation experience factors were most likely to predict frequency of implementing transition competencies. The predictors were the preparation experience variables (i.e., certification status, years teaching, number of transition courses, staff development hours) and the criterion was frequency of implementing transition practices. The results indicated that preparation experience was significantly related to frequency of transition practice implementation, <italic>F</italic>(4, 467) = 25.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and accounted for 18% of the variability in frequency of implementation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .18). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0888406412474022">Table 3</xref> reports indices of the relative strength of the individual predictors, with “total years teaching” as the only factor not being significant.</p>

<p>A second regression model was analyzed removing “years teaching” with overall results remaining virtually the same, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .18, <italic>F</italic>(3, 468) = 33.96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, thereby supporting the conclusion that years teaching was not a factor influencing frequency of implementation over and above staff development hours, certification status, and number of transition courses. Squared semipartial correlations calculated in the second model revealed that number of transition courses (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and staff development hours (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) each contributed to the overall variance in frequency of implementing transition practices, and after accounting for any overlap among the predictors, appeared to be contributing equally. While certification status did not contribute meaningfully to the overall model, it was statistically significant (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). These results indicate that the factors significantly influencing the frequency with which educators implement transition activities were the number of transition courses completed and number of transition staff development hours enrolled.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this investigation was to identify critical features of secondary special educators’ experiences with professional development to predict variables most likely to influence the frequency with which special educators perform transition activities. We analyzed a multistate data set that targeted secondary special educators and their perceptions regarding levels of preparation and frequency of implementation of 47 transition-related practices. A “preparation experience” variable was calculated from among four variables (years teaching, highest degree, number of transition courses, and number of professional development hours) as a predictor of the frequency with which secondary special educators perform transition practices. The results of this analysis revealed that training matters when it comes to implementing transition practices among secondary special education teachers. The completion of transition courses and involvement in professional development significantly correlated with the degree to which teachers implement transition practices. Certification status was a significant influence but did not contribute to the overall variance, and number of years teaching was not a predictor. These results have implications for establishing models of both preservice and in-service transition professional development.</p>
<sec id="section15-0888406412474022">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>The results from this study offer noteworthy implications specifically for transition teacher education and systems of professional development, as well as more general perspectives for strengthening training of educators. One outcome of the research was to establish the differentiated roles among secondary special educators who primarily serve certain groups of students with disabilities, as well as to identify the critical role of the transition coordinator. In addition, the study clarified the types of professional development obtained by the respondents. Of import is the finding that transition teacher education and professional development are significant factors influencing the frequency with which secondary special educators implement required transition services and practices. Given these results, recommendations are offered for improving teacher education specific to content and methods for implementing transition teacher education. Finally, implications for professional development are offered. While the results are explicitly described within the realm of transition education and services, the implications for other specialized knowledge and skills should be noted, particularly with regard to understanding the relationship between ongoing training and the implementation of educational strategies and interventions.</p>
<sec id="section16-0888406412474022">
<title>Types of School Personnel Implementing Transition</title>
<p>Teachers of secondary students with LD made up more than one-half the entire group of respondents. This was expected as it roughly corresponds to estimates of national special education teacher representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0888406412474022">U.S. Department of Education, 2008</xref>) and parallels other transition competency research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412474022">Blanchett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0888406412474022">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>). Almost one-half the total respondents came from rural areas and held master’s degrees. Across all respondents, teachers had a mean of 16.6 years teaching experience, a number that is comparable with previous special education research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0888406412474022">Blanchett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0888406412474022">Carlson &amp; Schroll, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0888406412474022">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Garza, &amp; Levine, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Two types of school personnel are involved with transition education and services: (a) secondary special education teachers engaged in IEP transition planning and instruction and (b) transition specialists who ensure a coordinated set of activities as specified in the transition requirements of IDEA. Whereas, IDEA articulates that any special educator holding a valid special education credential and working in a secondary school is responsible for transition planning, the most effective programs have transition specialists who provide coordination and support across students, families, teachers, and outside systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0888406412474022">Noonan, Morningstar, &amp; Erickson, 2008</xref>). Differentiating the roles and responsibilities of secondary special educators and transition specialists is an important endeavor, in that such distinctions can support teacher training practices.</p>
<p>In particular, the results from this study comparing the levels of preparation and implementation among certain types of special educators support the conception that disparities do exist. The results revealed that those respondents identified as transition specialists were the most prepared, as well as more likely to implement transition practices. Among the other groups, teachers of students working with students with ID reported the next highest rates of preparation and implementation. Given the functional nature of curriculum for students with more significant disabilities, these results are not surprising. Nor are the data indicating teachers of students with LD reported the lowest levels of transition preparation and implementation. Given that, the duties of these teachers is often driven by the needs of students included in general academic classes. Transition planning and services, however, are equally critical for all types of students with disabilities, and ensuring that all secondary special education teachers have sufficient training to implement established practices should be a priority.</p>
<p>The position of transition specialist has emerged with the advent of transition-focused education and related legislation. This specialized position consists primarily of coordinating transition services, rather than providing direct services to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406412474022">Blalock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0888406412474022">Morningstar &amp; Clavenna-Deane, 2009</xref>). Transition specialists enhance transition by ensuring that teachers are informed of current information and methods for facilitating transition planning (e.g., identifying students’ postschool interests, preferences, strengths, and needs). Furthermore, transition specialists work as liaisons between students, parents, administrators, and staff to connect postsecondary goals with curriculum decisions that drive course content.</p>
<p>Transition specialists are expected to possess certain knowledge and skills as reflected in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412474022">CEC <italic>Advanced Content Standards for Transition Specialists</italic> (2009a)</xref>. The CEC standards address advanced knowledge of transition philosophy, practices, and legal requirements as well as competencies of knowledge and experience with transition assessment, diagnosis, and evaluation and instruction on community-based activities, vocational experiences, and academic preparation for postschool environments. Few studies have assessed transition coordinators’ knowledge and skills or implementation of transition practices. This study identified a subgroup of transition coordinators and, therefore, is able to provide at least preliminary results regarding their duties.</p>

<sec id="section17-0888406412474022">
<title>Content and Delivery of Transition Teacher Training</title>
<p>In terms of transition coursework, teachers in this study reported completing an average of one transition course at the undergraduate or graduate level, and almost one-half had no transition courses. This parallels previous research specifically focusing on universities’ offering of transition courses, with less than one-half offering stand-alone courses in transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412474022">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>). The results from this study seem to bear this in mind, with the highest ranked domains from the survey being transition planning, curriculum and instruction, and instructional planning, which are the most commonly taught preservice content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412474022">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>), whereas the domains of interagency collaboration and transition assessment are less likely to be taught to preservice students.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, researchers have investigated transition teacher education programs, with the Division of Career Development and Transition (DCDT) recommending that transition teacher education emphasize instructional content that aligns secondary curriculum and transition services, and includes principles, models, and strategies proven to support career development and transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0888406412474022">Blalock et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406412474022">Morningstar and Clark (2003)</xref> described five broad content areas for transition: (a) principles and concepts of transition education and services, (b) transition evidence-based practices for student-focused planning, (c) community-referenced curriculum and instruction targeting identified evidence-based practices, (d) promoting interagency collaboration, and (e) addressing systemic problems in transition service delivery. These five areas are consistent with research regarding effective practices and research leading to positive postschool outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0888406412474022">Alwell &amp; Cobb, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0888406412474022">Kohler &amp; Fields, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0888406412474022">Test et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0888406412474022">Morningstar and Clark (2003)</xref> described four types of transition personnel preparation programs: (a) transition master’s programs (30 or more hours toward an advanced degree), (b) transition specialization programs (15 or fewer credit hours, focusing on a state endorsement or licensure program for transition specialists), (c) transition class or classes, and (d) transition content infused within existing courses. <italic>Transition master’s programs</italic> have primarily been supported by federal personnel preparation grants, as well as higher education institutional commitment to faculty specialization. <italic>Transition specialization programs</italic> have emerged in response to federal preparation grants, or because of state transition certification standards. Little data exist to articulate what courses and competencies are included, and how programs are sustained. Anecdotally, however, it appears that transition specialization programs typically consist of 3 to 4 classes and are based on the CEC standards for transition specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0888406412474022">CEC, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Offering a <italic>transition course</italic> is the most common form of transition content delivery, with 45% of institutions of higher education (IHEs) reporting this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412474022">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0888406412474022">Hu, 2001</xref>). Unfortunately, offering single courses in transition are often tied to faculty interest and knowledge of transition. Finally, <italic>infusing transition content within existing courses</italic> is the most common approach to offering transition content when training special education teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412474022">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>). As states move toward K-12 noncategorical teacher standards, the increased pressures on higher education faculty to cover the breadth of information will mean that less time can be devoted to transition content. In addition, faculty who possess limited knowledge are less likely to embed transition content into existing coursework.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section18-0888406412474022">
<title>Professional Development</title>
<p>It is interesting to consider that high levels of implementation had less to do with whether the educator was a veteran or beginning teacher. This was somewhat surprising, as it would be expected that teachers who recently graduated from a teacher preparation program would have had more opportunities to learn about transition education and services. Unfortunately, teacher preparation has not caught up to the realities of secondary special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0888406412474022">Anderson et al., 2003</xref>). The “transition” mandates have been legislated for more than two decades, and it is evident that secondary special educators require specialized knowledge and training in this area. From this study, those who have had the opportunity to enroll in at least one transition course or for whom professional development opportunities were provided were much more likely to feel prepared and to implement specific transition competencies on a more frequent basis.</p>
<p>Respondents indicated a mean of 28 hours of transition staff development, with approximately 14% indicating they had acquired no transition staff development hours throughout their careers. Conversely, almost three quarters of the respondents reported they had between 1 and 50 hours of transition in-service training. Such inconsistencies in the data imply that professional development opportunities are erratic at best. Given the constraints associated with teacher education models, the importance of highly effective and ongoing professional development is even more pressing. Furthermore, states identify that a primary method of transition training takes place on-the-job rather than through comprehensive or systematic professional development efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0888406412474022">Kochhar-Bryant, 2003</xref>). In the past, states have targeted transition personnel development as a priority within special education state improvement grants and statewide planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0888406412474022">Kochhar-Bryant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0888406412474022">Storms &amp; Sullivan, 2000</xref>), often without significant impact over time.</p>
<p>Regrettably, transition professional development is often illustrated by a lack of clear policies as well as limited systems for planning, delivering, and evaluating its impact. Transition professional development has been defined as a comprehensive system of training and technical assistance that can take many formats (i.e., in-service training, mentoring systems, online; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0888406412474022">Morningstar &amp; Kleinhammer-Tramill, 2005</xref>). Comprehensive professional development requires transition-related competencies to be identified and instructed across both preservice and in-service levels as well as through a variety of methods and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0888406412474022">Morningstar &amp; Bassett, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A first element in such a model is to ensure that teachers acquire specific transition knowledge to improve instructional practices. This notion also requires teachers to develop an understanding of how they can incorporate transition-related content into subject matter and class activities. For some time, effective professional development models incorporate coaching or mentoring to ensure mastery of skills and implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0888406412474022">Porter, Garet, Desimone, Suk Yoon, &amp; Birman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0888406412474022">Sparks, 2002</xref>). This approach must also be replicated for transition in-service training so that we move away from the “one-shot” workshops and toward a model that incorporates effective knowledge generation combined with ongoing support and technical assistance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0888406412474022">Morningstar and Lattin (2012)</xref> have offered a model for enhancing professional development through a blend of online self-directed learning, combined with participant facilitated learning using both face-to-face and online engagement. This approach is similar to the concepts inherent in the “flipped classroom” where acquiring information through reading, online modules, webcasts, or audio presentations occurs independently (i.e., homework), and classroom time is devoted to applying knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0888406412474022">Bennett, Kern, Gudenrath, &amp; McIntosh, 2011</xref>). For transition professional development, this approach lessens the costs associated with a workshop or conference, where professionals travel to learn new information. Instead, district teams learn about new interventions, policies, or strategies using guided and self-directed learning modalities. Then the teams come together (face-to-face or online) to plan for program improvements and problem-solve solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0888406412474022">Morningstar &amp; Lattin, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0888406412474022">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A limitation of this research was that respondents were asked to generate answers based on their own perceptions of transition competencies. Because of the nature of self-report studies, their answers may not reflect their true experiences. Another limitation was related to respondents’ answers to two of the survey items: total number of transition courses and total number of transition staff development hours. Specifically, respondents may have had difficulty understanding the questions’ intentions (i.e., to focus only on those courses and professional development hours that were specific to transition), or they may have had problems recalling and estimating these responses. A third limitation to the study related to possible nonresponse bias. This study could not obtain completed surveys from actual nonrespondents and, therefore, employed a technique of comparing early to late respondents. Thus, the investigators could not determine if those secondary special education teachers who responded to the survey were different from those who did not respond. The data collected in this research study are based on information from special education teachers from 31 states. Generalization to the broader population of secondary teachers from states not represented in this study must be made with some caution. Finally, close to 95% of the sample were fully certified to teach in the area in which they were teaching. This means that the sample population may not represent the general population of special education teachers, in that research indicates lower levels of certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0888406412474022">McLeskey, Tyler, &amp; Saunders Flippin, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Transition planning is not a new phenomenon; federal mandates have been in place since 1990, and initiatives to improve postschool outcomes were pronounced during the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0888406412474022">Will, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0888406412474022">Rusch, Szymanski, and Chadsey-Rusch (1992)</xref> described how “transition services” for youth with disabilities could be found as early as the 1930s for deaf students and the 1940s for students with mental retardation. It was not until the 1960s, however, that educational and vocational models were systematically developed to comprehensively address career education issues for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0888406412474022">Halpern, 1992</xref>). The early career development and vocationally orientated curricula are thought of as precursors to today’s efforts. Given the long history of research and policies regarding how to prepare and support youth with disabilities to achieve successful adult outcomes, there appears to be still work to be accomplished, particularly in ensuring that educators possess the knowledge and skills needed to implement effective practices. The results of this study offer a current understanding of secondary special educators’ competencies regarding essential facets of transition, as well as their ensuing enactment of practices. It would seem that training matters when expecting special educators to implement specialized interventions and services. Although certainly not a profound conclusion, these results do lend credence to the importance of systematic professional development that originates with established course content addressing specialized knowledge and skills, and is sustained and supported with ongoing professional development.</p>
