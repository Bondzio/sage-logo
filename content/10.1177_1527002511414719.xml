<abstract>
<p>The cartel view of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) implies that it creates an advantage for automatic qualifying (AQ) member schools relative to other Division IA/FBS schools in recruiting the best players and hiring other inputs. The resulting playing-field advantage should produce more wins over “outsiders.” Weaker AQ schools benefit relatively more because previously they had competed more closely with outsiders for players. The evidence generally supports the cartel view. The AQ BCS schools and conferences have significantly increased their win percentage against outsiders. Also, the weaker AQ schools have performed better against the top tier, and have shown the greatest improvement against outsiders.</p>

<body>
<p>The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) attempts to satisfy the long-standing demand for a clear-cut American college football champion. Its goal is to place the two best teams in an end-of-season game, with the winner declared national champion. The BCS is an agreement that (currently) includes all Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) conferences plus independent Notre Dame and four major bowls. These entities jointly determine the rules by which teams are selected to play in the BCS bowls and championship game.</p>
<p>The exclusive nature of the BCS model has been criticized since its first predecessor was created in 1992. Prior to 2004, only about half of the FBS conferences were parties to the agreement. While all 11 FBS conferences are now included, automatic qualification for berths in the lucrative BCS bowls is still limited to the six founding conferences. “Outsider” schools have been eligible under certain conditions since 1995, but such participation has occurred only since 2004. And only schools from automatic qualifying (AQ) conferences have played in the BCS championship game.</p>
<p>Outsider (non-AQ) conferences and schools argue that the BCS acts as a cartel that protects the superior market position of the select AQ conferences and their member schools. Membership in the AQ group allegedly creates an unfair advantage in recruiting top athletes and hiring other inputs that in turn creates a playing-field advantage. This constitutes a barrier to entry into the highest echelons of college football. Thus, competition for the putative national championship from outsider schools is significantly reduced, if not eliminated.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to examine these allegations. I develop hypotheses derived from the cartel perspective and test them using data on the outcomes of games among AQ schools and conferences, between outsiders and the AQ schools and conferences, and on the performance of the two groups in national poll rankings. I compare results for two periods: one before the 1992 creation of the initial BCS-like agreement and the other after the 1998 formation of the BCS itself. The evidence, although somewhat mixed, generally supports the cartel view.</p>
<p>There has been a public furor in the college sports community about the exclusionary character of the BCS. Much has been written in both print and online sports media; Congress has held hearings on the issue and proposed regulatory legislation; and various parties have requested antitrust action. Related academic work, however, has focused on economic and legal arguments on the viability of possible antitrust suits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527002511414719">1</xref></sup> Supporting empirical evidence has been limited to the oft-cited exclusion of apparently deserving non-AQ schools from BCS bowls, and their unequal earnings from BCS revenues (see below). The present article conducts new tests that focus instead on the competitive effects of the BCS.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows. The next section provides background information on the historical determination of collegiate football champions, the evolution of the BCS, and the related controversy. The third section presents the theory and hypotheses designed to test the cartel view. This is followed by statistical analyses of the hypotheses. The last section provides a summary and conclusions.</p>
<sec id="section1-1527002511414719"><title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1527002511414719"><title>National Champions Before 1992</title>
<p>The identification of a national champion has been important to college football fans, since the sport gained national popularity in the early 20th century. Unlike almost all other collegiate sports, however, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has never sponsored an end-of-season tournament at the highest level of football competition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511414719">2</xref></sup> And it apparently has no plans to do so, despite the fact that the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) and Divisions II and III have football championship playoffs. While all schools and conferences belonging to the BCS and its predecessors are NCAA members, and the NCAA licenses their bowls, these agreements never have included the NCAA.</p>
<p>Historically, attempts to determine national football champions similarly have been independent of the NCAA. The first ranking systems appeared in the mid-1920s. They usually involved numerical algorithms based on individual team game results and strength-of-schedule assessments, not unlike modern computer rankings. The first national poll of experts (sportswriters) appeared in 1936, followed by a second expert poll (coaches) in 1950. Both polls have been conducted continuously to the present day. Poll results were reported weekly during the football season, with the final polls originally held at the end of the regular season, before the bowl games. The bowl results, of course, often confounded the national championship determination. Thus, a major “refinement” in the process was to conduct the final polls after the bowl season, which occurred circa 1970. While the polls usually agreed regarding the number one team, occasional differences resulted in dual national champions. In any event, outcomes clearly were subjective and often close, factors that naturally generated controversy</p>
<p>Bowl games also date from the early 20th century, although most FBS bowls today originated in the last three decades. Football teams play relatively few games, currently a maximum of 12 during the regular season, per NCAA regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1527002511414719">3</xref></sup> Most games involve schools in the same region of the country, mainly because of traditional conference membership designed to take advantage of natural regional rivalries. Bowls were originally created to allow “intersectional” games among the top regional teams, including in particular the champions of leading conferences and the best independent schools. The top bowls often had agreements with leading conferences that committed the conference champion to that bowl, the earliest dating from the 1940s. Bowl games usually occurred during the traditional Christmas holidays, after the regular fall football season, with the most important held last, on New Years Day. In addition to matching top teams, bowl venues generally were in attractive winter vacation spots, that is, southern locations with mild weather. The games attracted large crowds and national media coverage, and generated significant revenues for their sponsors and the participating schools. The NCAA sanctions (“licenses”) bowl games but has never been involved in their organization.</p>
<p>From the perspective of selecting a national champion, however, the “system” of national polls and bowl games had drawbacks. Prior to 1992, the top two poll-ranked teams had met only eight times in a bowl game, thereby allowing a relatively clear-cut national champion. The main reason was the conference–bowl linkages that precluded meetings between most major conference champions. One catalyst for change may have been the consecutive shared national titles after the 1990 and 1991 seasons, in which different teams had the top spots in the writers and coaches polls. In both years, conference–bowl contracts either hindered or made impossible a “playoff” matchup. A second factor may have been the Fiesta Bowl (Phoenix) of January 1987 that matched the top two poll teams at the end of the regular 1986 season: Miami (Florida) and Penn State. This was possible because both schools were independents and the Fiesta Bowl had no conference affiliations. An all-time record TV audience made the game a huge financial success, a point not lost on bowl sponsors, conferences, and schools.</p>

<sec id="section3-1527002511414719"><title>The Evolution of the BCS<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1527002511414719">4</xref></sup></title>
<p>The BCS, created in 1998, had two prior “incarnations.” The first, the Bowl Coalition, was created in 1992 followed by the Bowl Alliance in 1995, each lasting 3 years. They had similar structures. Five of the seven major conferences in 1992 were parties to Coalition agreement, including the Atlantic Coast (ACC), Big East, Big Eight, Southeastern (SEC), and Southwest (SWC), plus independent Notre Dame. The initial Alliance agreement included the same schools, with the newly formed Big 12 replacing the Big Eight and SWC in 1996. The main participating bowls were the Fiesta, Orange, Sugar, and Cotton, the latter being dropped after the 1995 season.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1527002511414719">5</xref></sup> Probably the main feature that distinguished the Coalition and Alliance from the BCS was the absence of the Pacific-10 and Big Ten Conferences. They declined invitations to join, instead opting to retain their Rose Bowl commitments.</p>
<p>About three dozen other Division IA schools were not invited to join either the Coalition or the Alliance. Also excluded were several bowls, some long established, predating Coalition/Alliance bowls. Excluded schools were members of the Big West, Mid-American, and Western Athletic Conferences, plus Conference-USA (C-USA; founded in 1996) and about one dozen independents.</p>
<p>The key feature of the Coalition/Alliance agreements was a procedure for matching participating schools and bowls that superseded conference–bowl contracts and maximized the likelihood of the top two poll teams playing in the championship game. This was achieved three times during the 6 years of the Coalition and Alliance. The exceptions were due mainly to the Rose Bowl commitments of the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.</p>
<p>The Coalition and Alliance conference champions had guaranteed slots in the affiliated bowls. Under the Coalition agreement, other “at large” slots were filled with teams selected from among remaining members of Coalition conferences, plus Notre Dame and (nonchampion) members of the Pac-10 and Big Ten. Some three dozen other Division IA schools were ineligible for Coalition bowls regardless of their poll ranking. Under the Alliance, participating conferences also had guaranteed bowl slots. The remaining at-large slots, one in 1995 and two in 1996 and 1997, were now open to all Division IA schools that met certain performance criteria. As it happened, however, only members of the Alliance and the Big Ten were selected.</p>
<p>The BCS was formed in 1998, replacing the Alliance, and has continued to the present day. It finally included the Pac-10, Big Ten, and Rose Bowl. Again, other Division IA schools and conferences were not parties to the original agreement. The BCS thus included six conferences and four bowls. The participants in the championship game were to be selected based on a new “mathematical formula” called the BCS Standings, which combined existing expert polls and computer rankings. In 2006, a separate championship game was added, bringing the total number of BCS games to five and participating teams to 10. The championship game takes place in early January at one of the four bowl stadiums, on a rotating basis, after all other bowl games.</p>
<p>The six BCS conference champions automatically qualified for BCS bowl slots. While specific conference–bowl linkages existed, the agreement included a mechanism for assigning teams to bowls that assured a match between the top two teams according to the BCS Standings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1527002511414719">6</xref></sup> The remaining (few) at-large slots were again available to all FBS schools meeting certain performance criteria, although no outsiders were selected in the first 6 years. The first such participant was the undefeated Utah team of 2004.</p>
<p>Thus, for the first 12 years after the 1992 founding of the Bowl Coalition, only members of the Coalition, Alliance, or BCS, plus Big Ten and Pac-10 schools, participated in the top bowl games. And, as yet, no outsider has participated in the championship game.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1527002511414719"><title>The Controversy</title>
<p>Naturally, this generated controversy. The BCS has been widely criticized within the college football community by fans, the media, coaches, and university and conference administrators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1527002511414719">7</xref></sup> Also, the BCS has been called to testify about its operation before congressional committees, regulatory legislation has been proposed, and the possibility of antitrust action has been raised by the U.S. Department of Justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1527002511414719">8</xref></sup> Critics accuse the BCS of intentionally excluding outsiders to protect the market position of its founding schools, which are currently members of the AQ conferences.</p>
<p>The most often cited evidence of unfair exclusion is the fact that on many occasions since 1992 outsiders not selected for Coalition/Alliance/BCS bowls have had end-of-season (prebowl) poll rankings higher than selected Coalition/Alliance/BCS members. The first significant example occurred in 1994, when Colorado State and Utah were ranked higher than seven Coalition members invited to Coalition bowls, and Brigham Young was ranked higher than four such members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1527002511414719">9</xref></sup> Four of the invited Coalition members that year did not appear at all in the end-of-season (prebowl) rankings. The most recent significant example of exclusion occurred in 2008. While seventh-ranked (and undefeated) outsider Utah appeared in a BCS bowl, ninth-ranked (and also undefeated) Boise State and eleventh-ranked Texas Christian were not invited even though Boise State was ranked higher than three participating AQ schools and Texas Christian (TCU) was ranked higher than two. In seven other years since 1992, there was at least one outsider school ranked higher than at least one Coalition/Alliance/BCS bowl invitee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1527002511414719">10</xref></sup> Fans of the excluded schools suffer a welfare loss, as do fans in general from less desirable bowl matchups.</p>
<p>Because of the controversy, in 2004 the BCS began making changes directed toward accommodating nonfounding Division IA/FBS conferences and schools. First, the outsider conferences were added to its Oversight Committee, including C-USA, the Mid-American Conference (MAC), the Mountain West Conference (MWC), the Sun Belt Conference, and the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). These conferences are now guaranteed a share, albeit unequal (see below), of the annual BCS bowl revenue. In addition, the BCS Standings formula used to select schools for bowl invitations has undergone several changes in response to criticisms.</p>
<p>More important, participation in BCS bowl games has been expanded. Six non-AQ schools have played in BCS bowls since 2004, although six others with end-of-season (prebowl) Associated Press (AP) rankings higher than AQ bowl participants have been excluded. Also, general standards have been established to determine whether a conference qualifies for an automatic bowl berth for its champion, to be evaluated periodically and applied to all 11 FBS conferences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1527002511414719">11</xref></sup> The result of the initial evaluation, based on the 2004 through 2007 seasons, was that all six founding conferences retained their automatic berths, and none of the five outsider conferences qualified. Of course, the non-AQ schools can argue that such a process creates a “catch 22.” Their outsider status since 1992 has reduced their competitiveness vis-à-vis members of the six AQ conferences, making it difficult, if not impossible, to meet the AQ standards.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527002511414719"><title>Theory and Testable Hypotheses</title>
<p>Critics of the BCS system argue that it is a cartel that creates a barrier to entry into the highest level of college football competition, thereby protecting the generally superior positions of incumbent AQ schools and conferences. Public demand for a national championship game could have been satisfied by a NCAA-sponsored playoff among FBS members, like those that have been conducted for many years for the FCS, Division II, and Division III.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1527002511414719">12</xref></sup> An FBS playoff presumably would have been open to all FBS schools on an equal basis, like the lower-level football playoffs and the highly successful “March Madness” Division I basketball tournament. But the AQ schools and conferences instead chose the exclusive Coalition, Alliance, and BCS structures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1527002511414719">13</xref></sup> Even if a main motivation was a sincere desire for a clear national champion, the competitive implications of these exclusive agreements could not have been lost on member schools and conferences. Of course, their effects on outsiders obtain regardless of motivation.</p>
<p>The key anticompetitive impact is to undermine the ability of outsider (non-AQ) schools to obtain the inputs necessary for national championship contention. Probably, the most important are the athletes themselves. For example, outsiders are at a disadvantage in recruiting top high school prospects because they can offer, at best, only a remote chance of competing for the BCS championship. The NCAA’s enforcement of “amateur” status on all college athletes, including football players, essentially restricts pay to tuition, room, board, and books.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1527002511414719">14</xref></sup> Thus, an ambitious outsider school cannot overcome its recruiting disadvantage with higher monetary or other compensation without becoming liable for severe penalties, including the “death penalty” (program cancelation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1527002511414719">15</xref></sup> The possibility of competing for the national championship is, of course, a “legal” form of nonmonetary compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1527002511414719">16</xref></sup> But this can be effectively offered only by AQ schools.</p>
<p>MWC Commissioner Craig Thompson emphasized this point in his 2009 congressional testimony:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1527002511414719">17</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>Non-AQ Conferences are harmed in recruiting not only by the monetary differences but also by the lack of access to the national championship game. Some AQ Conference coaches have told recruits that if you go to a Non-AQ Conference school you’ll have no chance to play in a national championship game.</p>
</disp-quote>Empirical evidence supports this assertion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002511414719">Dumond, Lynch, and Platania (2008)</xref> use multiple regression to analyze factors that affect college selection decisions by top high school football prospects. They find that membership in an AQ BCS conference significantly increases the likelihood of selection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002511414719">Langelett (2003)</xref> reports evidence that success in obtaining top high school prospects leads to higher national rankings, which in turn aids future recruiting.</p>
<p>The non-AQ recruiting disadvantage also impedes the hiring of top coaches. Although player pay is restricted, the NCAA allows coaches to compete in a free, competitive labor market. Thus, an ambitious outsider school can attract a talented coach by outbidding other schools as part of a plan to invest in the development of a top-level football program. This, however, would likely involve paying a premium to compensate for the recruiting and other disadvantages.</p>
<p>These problems are exacerbated by the unequal BCS bowl revenue distribution system. Of course, prior to 2004, outsiders received no revenue. While the BCS now includes all FBS conferences, non-AQ conference shares in bowl revenue are still significantly less than AQ shares. For example, in 2010 the three AQ conferences with two BCS bowl teams received $27.2 million each and the other three with a single bowl team received $21.2 million each. In contrast, the only non-AQ conference with a BCS bowl team (MWC) received less than $13 million.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1527002511414719">18</xref></sup> This creates an additional disadvantage for non-AQ schools in recruiting players and hiring coaches. Less revenue also limits their ability to invest in first-class athletic facilities, a further hindrance to both recruiting and hiring. As MWC Commissioner Thompson put it in his above referenced testimony: “With respect to the football programs, this tremendous [BCS bowl] revenue disparity greatly impacts Non-AQ Conferences institutions' ability to compete effectively in the areas of recruiting, facilities, coaches' salaries and scholarships.”</p>
<p>The core implication of the cartel view of the BCS is that outsider (non-AQ) schools, disadvantaged in obtaining inputs, should become less competitive on the playing field. This allows the specification of various testable hypotheses. The first is that outsiders should fare worse in direct competition against BCS AQ teams following the creation of the Bowl Coalition in 1992. Stated alternatively, competitive balance within Division IA/FBS, between AQ schools and outsiders, should decline. This can be measured by examining the results of games played between the two groups. A related hypothesis is that outsider schools should be less visible in the national polls, a natural consequence of poorer performance against AQ schools.</p>
<p>A third hypothesis is that the weaker AQ BCS schools benefit relatively more than the traditional football powerhouses. The latter could always claim to be potential national champion contenders, and so their recruiting advantage would not have been enhanced significantly by the BCS. The weaker AQ schools, however, prior to 1992 were more likely to have been in close competition with non-AQ schools for high school players. The implication is that the weaker AQ schools should improve their performance relative to the stronger ones, both against outsiders and within the AQ group. Thus, while competitive balance declines between the AQ and non-AQ groups within the FBS, it should improve within the AQ group.</p>
<p>Last, cartels tend to block entry to protect incumbents, which in the present context means restricting membership in the AQ group. This can be measured by simply counting AQ BCS schools and conferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1527002511414719"><title>Comparison of Pre-coalition and Post-BCS Periods</title>
<p>To examine the cartel hypotheses, we will compare performance measures in periods before the 1992 creation of the Bowl Coalition and after the 1998 creation of the BCS, which finally included all current AQ conferences. The precoalition period is 1980-1991 and the post-BCS period is 1998-2009, both 12 years in length to avoid possible statistical problems associated with comparing periods of unequal lengths.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1527002511414719">19</xref></sup> The 6-year transition between the two periods allows sufficient time for the hypothesized recruiting effects to be fully realized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1527002511414719">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The analysis includes all schools classified as Division IA or FBS during the two periods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1527002511414719">21</xref></sup> The Coalition included 5 of the 10 Division IA conferences extant in 1991. I place the Pac-10 and the Big Ten in the Coalition group as they were invited to join, later joined the BCS, and were universally recognized as major conferences during the precoalition period. The eight schools that began Big East football competition in 1991 are shown as a group for the entire 1980-1991 period to facilitate comparison with the post-BCS period.</p>
<p>Since BCS membership is defined primarily by conference, conference-level analysis is desirable. However, between 1980 and 2009 old conferences disappeared and new ones were created, and many conferences had significant membership changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1527002511414719">22</xref></sup> This undermines to some extent empirical analysis at the conference level. Thus, we compare performance both at the conference level and aggregated over individual schools. The use of multiple measures has the added advantage of providing a robustness check.</p>
<sec id="section7-1527002511414719"><title>Between-Group Aggregate School Win Percentages</title>
<p>The most general measure of relative competitiveness is the overall success of Coalition and BCS AQ schools in direct competition against outsiders. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511414719">Table 1</xref>
 shows the aggregate win percentage of Coalition schools against outsiders for the precoalition period (top-right panel), including Pac-10 and Big Ten members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1527002511414719">23</xref></sup> Of all 1,146 games against non-Coalition Division 1A schools, Coalition members won about three quarters (a percentage of 0.756).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1527002511414719">24</xref></sup> The cartel view predicts that these schools should fare better after the BCS formation, that is, their win percentage should increase. The bottom-right panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511414719">Table 1</xref> shows the aggregate win percentage of AQ schools for the post-BCS period. Of all 1,474 games against non-AQ Division IA/FBS schools, AQ schools won more than four of five (a percentage of 0.809), an increase over 1980-1991 (top-right panel).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1527002511414719">25</xref></sup> A difference-between-proportions test indicates that the win percentage increase is statistically significant at better than the 1% level (<italic>z</italic> = 3.25). Thus, the overall performance of Coalition/AQ schools versus outsiders improved and parity between the two groups declined, consistent with the cartel view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1527002511414719">26</xref></sup></p>

<p>Note that the Coalition/AQ superiority does not simply reflect top school domination, hiding parity between weaker schools and outsiders. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511414719">Table 1</xref> also shows the top third, middle third, and bottom third of Coalition/AQ schools in each period ranked by win percentage against other Coalition/AQ schools, including conference games. All three groups show a clear superiority over outsiders in both periods. For example, the bottom third, with aggregate win percentages of 0.300 and 0.330 against other Coalition/AQ schools, has win the percentages of 0.634 of games against outsiders in 1980-1991 and 0.695 in 1998-2009.</p>
<p>Of course, the scheduling process does not randomly match schools. For example, the increased win percentage against outsiders for BCS AQ schools could be caused by relatively more games between outsiders and the top-level AQ schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1527002511414719">27</xref></sup> In fact, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511414719">Table 1</xref> indicates an increase in the proportion of outsider games involving the top third of Coalition/AQ schools, from 31.4% (=360/1,146) during 1980-9191 to 34.9% (=515/1,474) during 1998-2009. This partly explains the improved Coalition/AQ record versus outsiders. Had the proportions for each third remained unchanged, holding constant the 1998-2009 win percentage for each third, the AQ win percentage versus outsiders would have been 0.802 instead of 0.809. The difference-between-proportions test, however, is still significant at better than the 1% level (<italic>z</italic> = 2.84).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511414719">Table 2</xref> shows the <italic>annual</italic> record of the Coalition/AQ schools against the outsider IA/FBS schools in both periods. A difference-between-means test indicates that the post-BCS mean annual win percent is higher by a statistically significant amount (<italic>p</italic> = .006). It is also worth examining the time trend, as the continuation of a positive pre-1991 trend unrelated to the BCS could be an alternative explanation for higher post-1998 win percentages. A simple time trend regression for 1980-1991 yields a positive sign, and has marginal statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = .073). However, for the last 8 years, 1984 through 1991, the time trend is actually negative, albeit insignificant (<italic>p</italic> = .23).</p>

<p>Note the disparity in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511414719">Table 3</xref> between the Coalition/AQ and outsider conferences, which becomes more pronounced in the post-BCS period. In 1980-1991 the lowest Coalition conference win percentage is the SWC’s 0.376 (top-left panel), compared to the highest non-Coalition conference win percentage of 0.310 (WAC, bottom-left panel). Similarly, in 1998-1909 the lowest win percentage among AQ conferences is 0.472 (Big East, top-right panel), compared to the highest non-AQ win percentage of 0.372 (MWC, bottom-right panel).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1527002511414719">28</xref></sup> Thus, there is no overlap in either period; the best-performing outsider conference has a win percentage less than the worst-performing Coalition/AQ conference by a sizable amount. The lowest AQ conference for 1998-2009 is exactly 100 percentage points above the highest non-AQ conference and 262 points above the second highest. For 1980-1991, the comparable differences between the weakest Coalition conference and the top two non-Coalition conferences are 66 and 113 percentage points. Clearly, the disparity between the two groups within Division IA/FBS has increased, that is, competitive balance has declined.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the top outsider conferences in the two periods, the WAC and MWC, had the same core group of 7 schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1527002511414719">29</xref></sup> The “WAC/MWC” was in an intermediate position, significantly improving “its” record from 0.310 to 0.372 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511414719">Table 3</xref>, bottom panels). In 1998-2009, it was actually closer to the AQ conferences than to the other non-AQ conferences. This is due primarily to the recent success of three members: Brigham Young, Texas Christian, and Utah (see below). The latter two schools have recently joined AQ conferences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1527002511414719"><title>Competitive Balance Among Coalition/AQ Schools</title>
<p>Another implication of the cartel view is that the traditional football powerhouses benefit the least from the BCS arrangement, as they always could claim to be national championship contenders. Comparing the top-right and bottom-right panels of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511414719">Table 1</xref>, note that the top third of Coalition/AQ schools had the least improvement against outsider schools, increasing their win percentage by only nine points (from 0.904 to 0.913). In contrast, the middle and bottom thirds had increases of over 60 percentage points each. Difference-between-proportion tests indicate that the precoalition and post-BCS difference for the middle third is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .020), for the bottom third is marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.051), and for the top third is insignificant. This supports the idea that the weaker Coalition/AQ schools benefited the most from the BCS agreement, as they had been the closest competitors to outsider schools in recruiting players.</p>
<p>A relative improvement against outsiders for the weaker Coalition/AQ schools implies increased parity within the group. Compare the top-left and bottom-left panels of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511414719">Table 1</xref>. Note that, within the Coalition/AQ group, the top third’s win percentage declined (from 0.684 to 0.661), while the bottom third’s increased (from 0.300 to 0.330). A difference-between-proportions test indicates that the top third’s decline is marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> = .071) and the bottom third’s increase is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = .025). This suggests a “compression” of the distribution, that is, increased parity among Coalition/AQ schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1527002511414719">30</xref></sup> In fact, the variance of school win percentages within the group declined by 20%, from 0.0287 to 0.0228, although an <italic>F</italic>-test indicates that the difference is not significant at conventional levels (<italic>p</italic> = .17).</p>
<p>Greater parity among Coalition/AQ schools should also be apparent at the conference level. Comparing the top-left and top-right panels of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1527002511414719">Table 3</xref>, note that the range of Coalition/AQ conference win percentages is considerably less for 1998-2009 (0.053) than for 1980-1991 (0.240). In fact, the variance of conference win percentages for 1998-2009 is less than one tenth of the variance for 1980-1991 (0.00039 vs. 0.00449).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1527002511414719">31</xref></sup> An <italic>F</italic>-test indicates that the difference is highly significant (<italic>p</italic> = .008). While increased parity among conferences supports the cartel view, the interpretation is clouded by conference membership changes.</p>
<p>In the context of national rankings, increased parity means more Coalition/AQ schools ranked, and less concentration in poll appearances and “ranking points” earned. We look at performance in the AP poll, using the top 20 schools in all years because prior to 1989 only the top 20 were reported.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1527002511414719">32</xref></sup> First, the number of <italic>different</italic> Coalition/AQ schools appearing in the top 20 increased from 49 in 1980-1991 to 56 in 1998-2009, despite the (slightly) lower total number of schools in the AQ group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511414719">Table 2</xref>). Second, appearances are less concentrated. Concentration is measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), based on individual Coalition/AQ schools' shares of the total appearances or points earned by all such schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1527002511414719">33</xref></sup> The HHI of appearances decreased from 291 in 1980-1991 to 273 in 1998-2009. The HHI of points earned, however, was unchanged at 353 for both periods. Thus, the poll results are generally consistent with greater parity (balance) among Coalition/AQ schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1527002511414719"><title>Between-Group National Rankings</title>
<p>The cartel view implies that the Coalition/AQ schools should improve their position in the national polls. As noted above, we focus on the AP top 20. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511414719">Table 4</xref>
, top panel, compares the performance of Coalition members, including the Big Ten and Pac-10, and other Division IA schools in the precoalition period. The bottom panel shows the same comparison for AQ and other Division IA/FBS schools in the post-BCS period. In both periods, the Coalition/AQ schools clearly dominate. Nevertheless, the outsider schools more than doubled their ranking point total.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1527002511414719">34</xref></sup> This is somewhat misleading, however, because the mean annual number of outsider schools increased by more than one third between the two periods, while the mean number of Coalition/AQ schools declined slightly. Accordingly, the last column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1527002511414719">Table 4</xref> reports the number of points earned per school in each group. For the outsider schools, the mean points-per-school increased from 2.5 in 1980-1991 to 4.6 in 1998-2009. However, the increase is small in magnitude and a difference-between-means test for the annual points-per-school (not shown) yields nonsignificance at standard levels (<italic>p</italic> = .11). Nevertheless, there clearly was no <italic>decline</italic> in outsider poll performance, as implied by the cartel theory. The Coalition/AQ points-per-school decreased slightly from 36.2 in 1980-1991 to 35.4 in 1998-2009 (not statistically significant) but remained much higher than for outsider schools.</p>

<fn id="table-fn9-1527002511414719"><p><italic>Note</italic>. In 1998-2009 the total ranking points exceeds 2520 because in 2007 two schools were tied at the tenth rank and each received 11 points.

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The increase in outsider poll representation, however, was mainly due to the success of four schools: Boise State, Brigham Young, Texas Christian, and Utah.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1527002511414719">35</xref></sup> These schools accounted for 15 of the 24 outsider poll appearances (62%) during 1998-2009, and about two thirds of the total points (162 of 241). By contrast, the top four AQ schools accounted for only 16.7% of AQ appearances and 21.5% of the AQ point total. The access to BCS bowls granted in 2004 may have helped the leading non-AQ schools in the rankings. In the second half of the post-BCS period (2004-2009), non-AQ schools had 1.7 times the appearances and 2.3 times the points as in the first half (1998-2003).</p>
<p>A contributing factor to the unimproved poll performance of AQ schools might be the above noted compression of AQ win percentages. In particular, the reduced win percentage of the top third of AQ schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1527002511414719">Table 1</xref>) likely produced somewhat lower poll rankings for the best among these schools, leaving additional room for outsiders. A related factor might be the post-1991 introduction of the conference championship game with the advent of the 12-team two-division format among some AQ conferences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1527002511414719">36</xref></sup> This guarantees an additional loss for one involved team, and (usually) a lower poll ranking.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1527002511414719">Table 5</xref>
 summarizes national rankings results by conference, shown in descending order by mean ranking points per school. In both periods the Coalition/AQ group dominates. The lowest Coalition/AQ conference, the ACC, scores substantially higher than the highest outsider conferences, the WAC and MWC. Comparing the two periods, the outsider conferences improved slightly, as in the individual school analysis. Again, changes in conference membership confound the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section11-1527002511414719"><title>Entry Into AQ Group</title>
<p>Another measure of cartel success is its ability to restrict entry. First, the core group of AQ conferences has remained unchanged. Second, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1527002511414719">Table 2</xref>, the number of schools in the Coalition/AQ group actually is somewhat lower in 1998-2009 than in 1980-1991. It dropped from 67 circa 1990 to 63 in 1996 when the Big Eight and the SWC merged to form the Big 12. During 1998-2009, there was a net increase of three AQ schools as four new schools were “admitted” and one lost AQ status. This was driven, however, not by a desire of the BCS to expand but by individual conference membership changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1527002511414719">37</xref></sup> In sum, the evidence suggests successful entry restriction.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1527002511414719"><title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>The cartel view of the BCS implies that AQ schools gain an advantage relative to non-AQ Division IA/FBS schools in recruiting the best players, hiring the best coaches, and obtaining the other inputs necessary for superior on-field performance. This should create a playing-field advantage for the AQ schools, leading to more wins over outsiders. The advantage would be relatively greater for the weaker AQ schools that had competed more directly with outsiders for players prior to 1992. Thus, competitive balance should decline between the two groups within the FBS but increase within the AQ group.</p>
<p>The evidence generally supports the cartel view. The AQ BCS schools and conferences have increased their dominance of non-AQ schools in head-to-head competition in the post-BCS period; that is, parity within the FBS between the two groups has declined. In contrast, there is evidence of increased parity within the AQ group. The weaker schools have improved their performance against the top tier, and the greatest improvement in competition against outsiders has been among the weaker AQ schools. In the national poll rankings, AQ schools have retained their dominance, but the success of a few outsiders has produced a small increase in overall non-AQ performance. This might be explained by increased parity among AQ schools, the advent of the conference championship game, and outsider participation in BCS bowls since 2004. Regarding entry, no outsider conference has been granted AQ status and the number of AQ schools is slightly lower after 1998, consistent with successful restriction. And only AQ schools have played in the championship game.</p>
<p>The BCS system ostensibly was created in response to the long-standing demand by college football fans, players, and coaches for a clear-cut national champion. Regardless of intent, however, the exclusive nature of the underlying agreement can produce adverse competitive effects. While the BCS championship game might create a social benefit, outsider non-AQ schools bear a cost in terms of reduced on-field competitiveness and effective exclusion from the championship. Consequently their fans suffer a loss of consumer welfare, and fans in general suffer a loss from less desirable bowl matchups. The cumulative effects on performance since 1992 may have already relegated non-AQ conferences to permanent outsider status. An additional long-term outcome might be to undermine the NCAA’s FBS classification, as the evident dominance of AQ schools over outsiders continues to expand. Aside from possible antitrust issues, the decline in competitive balance within the FBS caused by the BCS partition should be of concern to the NCAA.</p>

<p>The NCAA is the principal governing body for U.S. collegiate sports, including football. It places schools into divisions based on the level of competition. In football, the highest level is the FBS (formerly Division IA), followed by the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly Division IAA). The FBS and FCS together comprise Division I, and there are also two lower levels: Divisions II and III. Within these groups, competition is organized into conferences (leagues), plus unaffiliated or independent schools. At this writing, the FBS includes 120 schools organized into 11 conferences, plus 3 independents.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1527002511414719"><label>3</label>
<p>Prior to 2006, the maximum was 11, established in 1970. These limits exclude conference championship games and postseason bowl games.</p>

<p>On several occasions an AQ conference champion that received an automatic bid had a low poll ranking. For example, in 2008 ACC champion Virginia Tech had an end-of-season (prebowl) AP rank of 21, lower than non-AQ schools Utah (7), Boise State (9), Texas Christian (11), and Brigham Young (17).

<p>Member institutions must initiate a proposal for an NCAA-sponsored playoff; the NCAA cannot act unilaterally. Within the FBS, AQ BCS members clearly prefer the BCS approach and thus constitute an obvious (majority) antiplayoff voting bloc.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-1527002511414719"><label>13</label>
<p>The reluctance to initiate a FBS football playoff has been attributed to a desire to maintain the traditional postseason bowl system. But the BCS significantly disrupts the old system by excluding nonmember bowls, creating a sharply defined two-tier bowl system.</p>

<p>Many observers have long argued that such restrictions constitute cartel behavior by the NCAA designed to artificially reduce the cost of athlete labor input.
