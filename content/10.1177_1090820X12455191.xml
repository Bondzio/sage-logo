<title>Background:</title>
<p>Commonly used chin implants are made of silicone, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE), or high-density porous polyethylene (MEDPOR). Although MEDPOR is an effective implant for chin augmentation, modification of the external aspect of the implant is recommended, particularly for Asian patients, to create an appropriate shape for the new chin. It is often difficult to contour the inner aspect of the implant to conform to the patient’s mandible. Without modification, a gap may exist between the implant and mandible. To address this problem, a modified augmentation technique was developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X12455191">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors describe their modified technique for MEDPOR chin augmentation, which includes removal of the genial tubercles and, if necessary, the mental protuberance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X12455191">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Ninety-five patients underwent the modified MEDPOR technique of chin augmentation. Before placement of the contoured implant, a drill was used to remove the patient’s genial tubercles. If the mental protuberance was deemed too prominent, it was removed as well. The implant was inserted and fixed to the mandible with 2 titanium screws.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X12455191">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Results were satisfactory in 90 cases. Chin shape was too “strong” in 4 patients, and another patient had poor transition between the implant and mandible. Complications were minimal. The most common complication in this modified technique was lower lip numbness, which was transient in all cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1090820X12455191">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The MEDPOR chin implant can be effectively contoured to the mandible by removing the genial tubercle and/or mental protuberance. This technique is less invasive than chin osteotomy. Successful results can be achieved with minimal risks.</p>

<p>High-density porous polyethylene (MEDPOR; Stryker, Inc, Kalamazoo, Michigan) is a popular product for chin augmentation, which achieves good results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455191">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455191"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12455191">3</xref></sup> MEDPOR implantation is less invasive than osteotomy. However, modification of the external aspect of the implant may be necessary, particularly for Asian patients, to create an appropriate shape for the new chin. Because MEDPOR implants are designed for Caucasian chin contours, the inner aspect of the implant usually does not conform to the mandible of the Asian patient, primarily due to the genial tubercles and mental protuberance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455191">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, it is difficult to contour the inner aspect of the implant. Without appropriate modification, a gap may exist between the implant and the chin. Discrepancies between the mandible and inner aspect of the implant may increase the incidence of implant displacement, deformity and poor transition between the mandible and the implant. Poor transition and implant displacement are major reasons for implant removal. Some surgeons have prevented these problems by contouring the distal part of the implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455191">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>In the present report, we describe our modified technique for MEDPOR chin augmentation, which entails removal of the patient’s genial tubercles and mental protuberance (when necessary).</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X12455191" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>From January 2005 through March 2009, chin augmentation with MEDPOR was performed in 95 Chinese adults.</p>
<sec id="section7-1090820X12455191">
<title>Physical Examination</title>
<p>Physical examination is the most important procedure in preoperative assessment and planning. In this series, preoperative evaluation of the chin included symmetry, contour, anterior/posterior projection, height, and occlusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455191">4</xref></sup> The projection of the chin was assessed in the context of surrounding facial features, including projection of the nose, relationship to the lips, and depth of the labiomental sulcus.</p>
<p>Two vertical lines were drawn, which extended downward from the nasion and subnasale, while the patient’s head was in the Frankfurt position. Normally, the anterior projection of the mentum approaches approximately the vertical line from the subnasale in men and is slightly anterior to the vertical line from the nasion in women. A previous study documented that when the aesthetic plane is formed from the nasal tip to the pogonion, both the upper and lower lips should lie 1 to 2 mm posterior to the aesthetic plane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455191">5</xref></sup> The height of the lower face (from subnasale to mentum) should equal that of the midface (from glabella to subnasale). The height of the lower face is often subdivided into an upper third (between the subnasale and lip contact [stomion]) and lower two-thirds (between the stomion and mentum).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455191">4</xref></sup> The ideal height of the lower face to the head and face were determined objectively. After careful evaluation of these regions in our patients, the size and position of the implant were determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1090820X12455191">
<title>Implant Selection and Contouring</title>
<p>The anthropometric measurements obtained from the physical examination were helpful for determining the correct implant size. An implant with small projection was selected for 20 patients (21.06%), medium projection for 66 patients (69.47%), and large projection for 9 patients (9.47%). Before insertion, the implant was contoured (including its height and width) in accordance with the dimensions determined during each patient’s preoperative assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1090820X12455191">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The area to be dissected was marked with methylthioninium chloride. The operation was performed with the patient under local or inhalational anesthesia. A mixture of 1% lidocaine and 1:100 000 epinephrine was infiltrated into the chin area. A transverse incision, approximately 4 cm long, was made 1 cm above the buccal sulcus, in the midline. An appropriately sized subperiosteal pocket was created in accordance with the marked area. The mandible’s anterior portion was fully exposed, including mental neurovascular bundles, genial tubercles, and mental protuberance. Precautions were taken to avoid injury to the mental neurovascular bundles. The genial tubercles and mental protuberance (when indicated) were removed with a drill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X12455191">Figure 2</xref>). The bony material removed from the chin did not exceed 2 mm in thickness.</p>

</fig>
<p>The previously contoured implant was inserted into the pocket. Two titanium screws (each 6-8 mm long) were used to precisely and securely fix the implant to the mandible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1090820X12455191">Figure 3</xref>). Careful examination was required to ensure proper transition between the implant and mandible.</p>

<p>The wound was irrigated and closed in 2 layers. A chin dressing with mild compression was placed for 48 to 72 hours. Antibiotics were administered for 3 days.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The study population comprised 69 women and 26 men (age range, 18-42 years) of Asian descent. The follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 51 months (average, 35 months). All patients with microgenia had normal or near-normal occlusion.</p>
<p>Postoperative photographic results were evaluated by the surgeon and the patient at least 3 months after the procedure. Good results were achieved in 90 patients (95%). The chin shape was too “strong” in 4 patients, and 1 patient had poor transition between the implant and mandible. Among the 4 patients with a “strong” chin, implants were removed in 2 cases and revised in 2 cases. The implant was refixed in the case with poor transition.</p>
<p>One patient whose result was good asked to have her implant removed because her family disagreed with the surgery.</p>
<p>Lower lip numbness, which occurred in 46 cases and was the most common complication with this technique, was transient and resolved within 3 to 6 months. There was no incidence of infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>MEDPOR is a popular implant in facial reconstruction because of its high tensile strength and firm consistency that resists material compression. The firm consistency of the chin implant allows it to be easily fixed with screws and to be contoured without fragmenting. The intramaterial porosity, which ranges from 125 to 250 µm, allows for more extensive fibrous ingrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455191">5</xref></sup> Soft-tissue ingrowth can lessen the implant’s tendency to migrate, reduce capsule formation in the surrounding fibrous tissue, and prevent erosion of the underlying bone. Tissue ingrowth also helps to prevent bacterial infection. In a large study by Yaremchuk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455191">2</xref></sup> of facial skeletal augmentation with porous polyethylene implants, there were no reports of bioincompatibility, and the complication rate was low.</p>
<p>The contour of the MEDPOR chin implant typically requires modification for effective use in certain patients, particularly Asians. Because the MEDPOR implant was designed for Caucasian chin contours, its inner aspect usually is not a suitable match for the mandible of the Asian patient. Moreover, it is difficult to contour the inner part of the implant. However, the external aspect of the implant can be carved to create a new chin of appropriate size and shape. Although the implant material is somewhat flexible and can be carved easily, a gap may still exist between its inner aspect and the patient’s mandible because of the presence of genial tubercles and excessive mental protuberance. The discrepancy in contour between the implant and the chin may result in deformity of the implant, displacement of the distal part of the implant, poor transition between the mandible and the inner aspect of the implant, and/or compression of the mental neurovascular bundles. Therefore, we modified the mandible by removing the genial tubercles or mental protuberance before inserting the implant. This allowed the implant to better conform to the mandible, minimizing the likelihood of these complications and reducing the risk of hematoma and infection.</p>
<p>Although good outcomes can be achieved with MEDPOR chin augmentation, other implants (eg, silicone, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [e-PTFE]) do not require removal of genial tubercles or the mental protuberance. MEDPOR’s firmness may necessitate removal of the mental protuberance and genial tubercles because, when the implant is fixed with titanium screws, it is forced to conform to the contour of the chin. Thus, the implant (particularly its ends) would be displaced, resulting in poor transition between the implant and chin. Silicone and e-PTFE implants are much softer than MEDPOR and, after shaping, both wings typically are very thin and soft. These characteristics, in conjunction with pressure from the overlying soft tissue of the chin, allow these implants to conform more readily to the patient’s original chin. Because the amount of bony material removed from the patients’ chins was minimal (approximately 1-2 mm thick), this alteration did not impair the integrity of the mandible, nor did it cause exposure of tooth roots.</p>
<p>Transient lower lip numbness is a relatively common complication in patients who undergo this technique of chin augmentation. To remove the genial tubercles and mental protuberance, wide subperiosteal dissection is required. Injury to the mental neurovascular bundles may occur from the “pulling” force applied during surgery, which may lead to paresthesia. However, this effect is usually transient. In our study, paresthesia resolved in all patients by 6 months postoperatively.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Chin augmentation with MEDPOR is less invasive than osteotomy, and recovery is more rapid. In some patients, particularly Asians, the implant will conform better to the patient’s mandible if the genial tubercles or mental protuberance (when appropriate) are removed. Successful outcomes can be achieved, with minimal risk of complications.</p>
