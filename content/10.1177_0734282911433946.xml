<abstract>
<p>The Talent Search model, founded at Johns Hopkins University by Dr. Julian C. Stanley, is fundamentally an above-level testing program. This simplistic description belies the enduring impact that the Talent Search model has had on the lives of hundreds of thousands of gifted students as well as their parents and teachers. In this article, we compare the Talent Search model to school-based models of gifted education. The comparisons are both broad and narrow. Broad contrasts are made in the discussion of the historical impetus, whereas specific differences are presented in the discussion of numbers of students served and costs. Bridging the Talent Search model and K-12 gifted education models is addressed. Assessment information from Talent Search above-level testing offers valuable information for parents and teachers and recommendations for advocacy are presented. Finally, we highlight major findings from Talent Search research emphasizing that Talent Search research has made a significant contribution to our understanding of gifted and talented students. We conclude with a strong endorsement to recognize the founder of the Talent Search model, Julian C. Stanley, by referring to the impact of the Talent Search model as the Julian Stanley Effect.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This short title includes several paradoxical concepts, all of which revolve around the broad topic of identification for educational programs. Although talent search and gifted identification are not necessarily a contradiction of terms, nor are they specifically at odds with each other, the fact remains that talent searches and gifted program identification have different foci and sometimes seem to operate in two parallel worlds. In the gifted program world, the focus of gifted identification is <italic>selecting</italic> students for a gifted program in a K-12 school setting. In the Talent Search world, the focus is on <italic>discovering</italic> students with specific aptitudes (e.g., verbal or quantitative), and developing their talent, often through programming offered in a university or college setting. The nuance between discovery and selection is infused throughout our discussion.</p>
<p>The paradoxes, delineated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734282911433946">Table 1</xref>, provide a backdrop for the comparisons: historical impetus, focus, selection measures, setting and type of program, as well as numbers of students served and associated costs. We also present the multiple benefits of Talent Search programs especially with respect to parent advocacy for in-school programming. A summary of research highlights confirms the uses and effect of the Talent Search model, which leads to our concluding recommendation to refer to the Talent Search model’s large-scale impact on the national educational scene as the Julian Stanley Effect, in recognition of Julian C. Stanley, founder of the Talent Search model.</p>

<title>Paradox 1, Historical Impetus: Education Versus Psychology</title>
<p>In 1972, Commissioner of Education Sydney Marland spearheaded a report, <italic>Education of the Gifted and Talented</italic> (The Marland Report), to Congress. In addition to bringing national attention to gifted education, the Marland Report offered a definition of gifted and talented that is still widely used in today’s schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734282911433946">National Association for Gifted Children [NAGC], 2010</xref>), and indicated that 3 to 5% of the K-12 population could be considered gifted and talented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734282911433946">Colangelo &amp; Davis, 2003</xref>). A few years after the publication of <italic>Education of the Gifted and Talented</italic>, a University of Connecticut Professor, Joseph Renzulli, started field-testing the Enrichment Triad Model in schools around Connecticut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0734282911433946">Reis &amp; Renzulli, 2009</xref>). Today, in addition to the Renzulli Enrichment Triad Model, there are many models of gifted education (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0734282911433946">Renzulli, Gubbins, McMillan, Eckert, &amp; Little, 2009</xref>, for a comprehensive treatment of several gifted program models including Gagne’s Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent; VanTassel-Baska’s Integrated Curriculum Model, and Feldhusen’s Purdue Three-Stage Model). The enrichment model (and especially Renzulli’s approach) is implemented in schools throughout the world.</p>
<p>The Talent Search model originated in the 1970s when Julian Stanley, a professor of psychology at Johns Hopkins University, was searching for a systematic means of identifying talented young people and documenting their abilities. Right around the same time the Marland Report was released, Dr. Stanley was hard at work devising and perfecting the Talent Search approach. He was familiar with Leta Hollingworth’s use of above-level testing, in which a young student takes a test designed for students several years older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734282911433946">Stanley, 1990</xref>). He pilot-tested his ideas with several math prodigies by giving them the mathematics section of the <italic>Scholastic Aptitude Test</italic> (now SAT-I); soon after, he held the first large-scale testing of seventh and eighth graders under the auspices of the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) in 1972. At the time, using the SAT college-entrance exam, which was designed for college-bound 11th and 12th graders, was a radical idea. Stanley and his team of doctoral students soon realized the SAT was a powerful means to identifying advanced mathematical and verbal reasoning abilities in middle school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911433946">Lupkowski-Shoplik, Benbow, Assouline, &amp; Brody, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0734282911433946">Stanley, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The Talent Search model has been called “elegant in its simplicity.” In its early phase, Stanley referred to a 3-D Model: Discovery, Description, and Development, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0734282911433946">Stanley, Keating, &amp; Fox, 1974</xref>). The first “D,” Discovery, involves inviting young people scoring in the top 3% to 5% on grade-level standardized tests to take another test that is designed for older students. The younger students whose grade-level test scores placed them in the upper percentiles demonstrate they have reached, or almost reached, the ceiling of those tests. They need to take a more difficult test to have their abilities measured accurately. The SAT was chosen as the first Talent Search test because it demonstrated that very bright junior high students, who had not been exposed to the high school curriculum, could use their reasoning abilities to solve the problems, even though the content was not familiar. Building on the concept of “reach,” Stanley often adapted Browning’s quote, “A [person’s] reach should exceed his [or her] grasp, or what’s a heaven for?” as a metaphor for the Talent Search model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911433946">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing that discovering talent was necessary, but not sufficient for talent development, Stanley and his team formulated academically challenging programs and educational procedures for implementation. For example, they developed the Diagnostic Testing -&gt; Prescriptive Instruction (DT-&gt;PI) model for identifying math-talented students and tailoring instruction to their needs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911433946">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2011</xref>, for a detailed description of how the process works).</p>
<p>Soon, summer programs were blossoming at sites throughout the nation and highly talented students at last had access to programs that promoted and encouraged the study of mathematics and other subjects at a rapid pace, which was commensurate with very high abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1986</xref>). The program goal was to match the curriculum to the students’ abilities and to allow them to move through the curriculum at a systematic pace. Thus many students completed 1 or more years of mathematics in a 3-week summer program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911433946">Brody &amp; Benbow, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911433946">Kolitch &amp; Brody, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0734282911433946">Stanley, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Within a few years of Stanley’s early 1970s “Talent Searching” at Johns Hopkins, several other universities had embraced the model and began providing their own systematic Talent Searches for seventh and eighth graders, using both the SAT and the ACT Assessment. Today, more than 300,000 students from every state and many countries around the world participate in annual Talent Searches run by university-based or regional programs, including Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, The University of Iowa, Carnegie Mellon, the University of Washington, California State University, and the Center for Bright Kids in Denver. (For a more detailed discussion of the history of the Talent Search model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911433946">Lupkowski-Shoplik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0734282911433946">Stanley, 2005</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1986</xref>.)</p>
<p>Researchers and program planners recognized the value in discovering academically talented students in middle school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734282911433946">Benbow, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734282911433946">Cohn, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734282911433946">Mills &amp; Barnett, 1992</xref>) and applied the concept of Stanley’s Talent Search model to younger students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734282911433946">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734282911433946">Lupkowski-Shoplik &amp; Assouline, 1993</xref>). The Elementary Student Talent Search, in which third through sixth graders take the EXPLORE test, is one example of a successful adaptation of the Talent Search model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911433946">Lupkowski-Shoplik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911433946">Lupkowski-Shoplik &amp; Swiatek, 1999</xref>). Up to 20,000 students each year take the EXPLORE test as part of the Elementary Student Talent Search and more than 5,000 young students participate in subsequent programs offered by the University of Iowa, Northwestern, Carnegie Mellon, and Duke Universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734282911433946">Lee, Matthews, &amp; Olszewski-Kubilius, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The Talent Search Model originated at Johns Hopkins, which houses the Center for Talented Youth (CTY), the original Talent Search Program. In addition to the testing and program opportunities for junior high students, they offer similar programs for young students. For talented second through sixth graders, CTY uses the <italic>School and College Abilities Test</italic> as its Talent Search instrument. Fifth through 11th graders can also take the <italic>Spatial Test</italic> Battery (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cty.jhu.edu/ts/spatialability.html">http://cty.jhu.edu/ts/spatialability.html</ext-link>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0734282911433946">
<title>Paradox 2, Focus: Distinguishing Between Identification and Discovery</title>
<p>The psychometric terms identification and assessment are often used interchangeably; although they are related, they are distinct concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911433946">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2011</xref>). An assessment is a broader concept, which encompasses identification. The relationship between these two terms is prominent in the general description of the Assessment Standard of the National Association for Gifted Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734282911433946">NAGC, 2010</xref>) <italic>Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Programming Standards</italic>: “Assessments provide information about identification, learning progress and outcomes, and evaluation of programming for students with gifts and talents in all domains” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734282911433946">NAGC, 2010</xref>, p. 2). The NAGC Assessment Standard delineates six student outcomes and specifies 22 evidence-based practices, two of which refer specifically to “off level” (synonymous with above-level) testing. Above-level testing is the primary method of discovery used in the Talent Search model.</p>
<p>In the typical school’s gifted program, students are identified and selected for a program that offers greater challenge than provided in the regular classroom setting. A primary method of identification includes the administration of group-administered tests such as the <italic>Iowa Tests of Basic Skills</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734282911433946">Hoover et al., 2003</xref>) and/or the Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734282911433946">Lohman &amp; Hagen, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to many K-12 identification methods for gifted education programs, the procedures for implementing the Talent Search model commence with grade-level, group-administered, standardized tests (e.g., the <italic>Iowa Tests of Basic Skills</italic>), which are usually administered as part of the school district’s regular testing program. From then on, gifted identification <italic>selection</italic> for gifted programs and talent <italic>discovery</italic> for talent development, diverge. Because our topic is the Talent Search model, we describe that model in detail.</p>
<p>The Talent Search Model involves a two-step process, as delineated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734282911433946">Figure 1</xref>. Step 1 is to review the performance on a grade-level achievement test, which is typically a group-administered test such as the <italic>Iowa Tests of Basic Skills</italic> (ITBS). Students who earn scores that yield national percentile rankings between 95 and 99 for one or more of the subtests for math, language, vocabulary, reading, or science, or for the composite, have hit a ceiling on that test. In other words, there are not enough challenging questions on the grade-level test to suggest how accelerated or enriched their instruction should be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734282911433946">Swiatek, 2007</xref>). These students are represented by the shaded portion of Bell Curve A.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0734282911433946" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption>
<p>Steps 1 (Bell Curve A) and 2 (Bell Curve B) of the Talent Search model</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734282911433946-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>Step 2 involves students taking an above-level test. When these same students take an above-level test, the scores from the clustered group (see the shaded portion of Bell Curve A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734282911433946">Figure 1</xref>) spread out to create a new bell curve (Bell Curve B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734282911433946">Figure 1</xref>). Scores on the above-level test help researchers and program planners make practical suggestions to students and their families about educational options. Bell Curve B reveals two important observations. First, students at the upper end of Bell Curve B have performed very well on the above-grade level test and likely will need programming that is more accelerative. Second, students at the lower end of Bell Curve B did not perform as well on the above-level test and likely were more challenged by the above-level test. Therefore, they might be frustrated by an accelerative approach but would benefit from an enrichment approach.</p>
<p>The recommended 95th or higher percentile often begs a question posed by parents and educators regarding the option of inviting students to participate in above-level testing even if they have earned scores lower than the 95th percentile on the grade-level test. Although not a strict cutoff, the 95th percentile is a research-based guideline designed to balance the concern that students might be unnecessarily frustrated by more challenging tests with the goal of giving bright students a more challenging experience. Research has shown that the 95th percentile is an appropriate recommendation for talented third through sixth graders taking the EXPLORE test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911433946">Lupkowski-Shoplik &amp; Swiatek, 1999</xref>) and the 97th percentile is appropriate for talented seventh graders taking the SAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734282911433946">Ebmeier &amp; Schmulbach; 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734282911433946">George, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Brody, 1989</xref>). These students have already demonstrated that they can do very well on tests designed for their age group. In fact, percentiles of 95 to 99 suggest that the student has reached, or is near, the ceiling of the grade-level test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734282911433946">
<title>Paradox 3, Measures: General Ability/Achievements Versus Specific Aptitude</title>
<p>Students who earn scores in the upper percentiles on grade-level achievement tests may appear to be academically similar when in fact they may have very different needs for challenging curriculum. This is revealed in the score distribution for the above-level tests. To learn more about the specific needs of students, additional testing of a diagnostic nature is useful. The first Talent Search organization, The Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University, established a testing center for more diagnostic testing of individual students. Several other Talent Search centers offer similar services, which are designed to facilitate tailoring accelerated instruction to the above-level test results. When working with individual students, the diagnostic assessment centers use a system known as Diagnostic Testing -&gt; Prescriptive Instruction (DT-&gt;PI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911433946">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The validity in using this information for diagnosis and evaluation is fueled by the power of the Talent Search process, which discriminates <italic>exceptionally talented</italic> students from <italic>talented</italic> students. When students take the above-level test and their scores are spread out in the new distribution (in part B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734282911433946">Figure 1</xref>), the process “also discriminates well within the group tested so that students with exceptionally advanced reasoning abilities can be identified and their educational programs adjusted to include more advanced content” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911433946">Brody &amp; Mills, 2005</xref>, p. 98; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734282911433946">Swiatek, 2007</xref>). That is really the point of “Talent Searching”—finding those exceptionally talented students who need truly differentiated programming.</p>
<p>In addition to the guidelines recommending the 95th percentile (for elementary students and the 97th percentile for middle school students) for participation in the above-level testing, many of the university-based Talent Search programs set cut-scores for students to enter fast-paced classes. These programs have carefully conducted research to evaluate the appropriateness of these cut-scores. The above-level test scores have been shown to be valid predictors of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911433946">Brody &amp; Mills, 2005</xref>, p. 98; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0734282911433946">Swiatek, 2007</xref>), and it is possible to distinguish among the students scoring in the top 1% of the population. Even 10 years after participation in a Talent Search, the top-performing students in the Talent Search outperform, on many important variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734282911433946">Benbow, 1992</xref>), students who earn lower Talent Search scores. For example, students with the very highest Talent Search scores are 50 times more likely to pursue doctoral degrees than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911433946">Lubinski, Webb, Morelock, &amp; Benbow, 2001</xref>). These examples illustrate how powerful and useful the Talent Search test results can be.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911433946">Assouline and Lupkowski-Shoplik (2011)</xref> developed a Pyramid of Educational Options to help school personnel and families understand the students’ Talent Search test scores in the context of different educational options. Their pyramid ties earning the highest scores on the above-level test with the need for the most accelerative educational options (grade skipping, early entrance to college, etc.), and the relatively lower scores on the Talent Search test with more enrichment-oriented options (participation in math competitions, enrichment-oriented summer programs, etc.) for gifted students. The tip of the pyramid represents accelerated options (appropriate for a smaller number of students), whereas the base represents the broad array of enrichment options (appropriate for a greater number of students).</p>

<title>Paradox 4, Program Setting and Type: In-School Enrichment Versus Extracurricular Program</title>
<p>Gifted programs in many public schools are designed for an “all-around gifted” student demonstrating high intelligence, as measured by an individualized IQ test or a group ability test. University-based Talent Searches have shifted the focus from “gifted education” (the all-around gifted student) to “talent development” (focusing on identifying specific talents and abilities and nurturing them). Rather than looking for globally gifted students, the Talent Search model identifies talents in specific domains and provides information for devising strategies to develop those talents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734282911433946">Subotnik, Brody, Sheffield, &amp; Assouline, 2010</xref>). Thus university-based Talent Searches seek to discover mathematically, verbally, or scientifically talented youth and to provide programs specific to those subject areas. Many of the Talent Search programs feature accelerative learning opportunities, whereas enrichment programming is the primary approach used in many K-12 settings.</p>

<title>Paradox 5, Number of Participants and Costs: Limiting the Number of Students Versus Including as Many Highly Able Students as Possible</title>
<p>In a K-12 gifted program, there is typically no required action on the part of the parent, nor is there any required payment. However, through administrative necessity, a K-12 gifted program identification system has to be concerned with limiting the number of students who are selected.</p>
<p>Talent Searches, by virtue of their “discovery” approach, attempt to cast a broad net to find as many students as possible needing challenging experiences to develop their academic talent areas. Talent Search programming typically takes place outside of the K-12 setting and students’ parents usually pay a fee for the testing as well as for the program or courses. The scores earned by Talent Search participants are used as guidelines in selecting classes according to the level of challenge.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-0734282911433946">
<title>Benefits of Talent Search Participation</title>
<p>Over the past 40 years, Talent Searches have opened myriad options and advantages for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0734282911433946">Rotigel &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 1999</xref>), not the least of which is the “true peer group.” Even in the era before easy access to information via the Internet, university-based Talent Search programs sent booklets describing educational opportunities, encouraged students to challenge themselves in special educational programs, and listed students’ successes in their newsletters as a way of inspiring other students.</p>
<p>Special classes on university campuses, which are tailored to the students’ academic and psychosocial needs have been developed especially for academically talented students participating in Talent Searches. Julian Stanley and his colleagues recommended an entire “smorgasbord” of educational options, indicating the need to have a wide variety of options available for students demonstrating a range of levels of ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734282911433946">Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911433946">Lupkowski-Shoplik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether the students live together in a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 6-week University-based summer program; attend a 1-day class; or read each other’s names in a program-sponsored newsletter, Talent Searches show their participants that they aren’t alone: other students also have extraordinary academic abilities. For young people who are still developing their sense of self, recognizing that they aren’t “odd” or “weird” is critical. For students who truly love to learn, it is rewarding to find others like themselves. Talent Searches have recognized the power of the peer group, and they have found ways to develop social support networks through informal gatherings, social media, and outside-of-class activities at residential programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734282911433946">Subotnik et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Talent Search programs have continued to provide resources in the traditional manner, and they have also developed distance-learning programs, online communities, and social media sites for gifted students. In addition to special programs devised by the Talent Searches themselves, Talent Search personnel have advocated for curricular flexibility in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0734282911433946">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1986</xref>). Not only do Talent Search programs consistently offer opportunities to their participants, but their Talent Search program staff are tireless promoters of many different educational options in schools, including subject matter acceleration, grade skipping, Advanced Placement courses, and online courses.</p>
<p>Talent Search programs also offer educational counseling and information tailored to special needs. Many school officials do not have specific training in gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0734282911433946">Wood, 2010</xref>); gifted students benefit tremendously from the opportunity to work with experts in the field who understand the unique needs of talented youth and who can give them access to resources and educational programs specifically designed for them. Career guidance relevant to their high abilities is also especially important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734282911433946">Lubinski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0734282911433946">Subotnik et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734282911433946">
<title>Talent Searches and Parent Advocacy</title>
<p>University-based Talent Search staff members constantly work with students and their schools. After students return home from successful participation in a Talent Search summer program, they and their parents may meet with school officials to request appropriate credit and placement in the next level of a subject. Immediately, schools must deal with issues of acceleration and proper placement of gifted students. Talent Search Programs have developed many tools to assist parents and school personnel in this process. For example, the Center for Talented Youth produced an excellent document, <italic>Parents’ Guide to Requesting Credit and/or Placement for Your Child’s Course Work</italic> (retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cty.jhu.edu/bin/q/h/parentguide.pdf">http://www.cty.jhu.edu/bin/q/h/parentguide.pdf</ext-link>), which walks families through the process of working with their schools after their student takes a Talent Search summer course. They give parents the tools to work with the schools directly. This empowers parents and results in successful educational placements for many students. The strategies CTY recommends include meeting with school personnel before the summer program to discuss issues of credit and placement and make concrete plans for the upcoming school year. Once the student has successfully completed a summer course, CTY recommends four steps:</p>
<list id="list1-0734282911433946" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Gather data about the student’s academic strengths</italic>. This would include information about the above-level testing the student completed with the Talent Search as well as grade-level tests and anecdotal information from teachers in the student’s current school.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Learn about educational options for the student</italic>. “Credit” means the Talent Search course would count toward successful completion of a certain grade level and/or graduation from high school. “Placement” means the student has learned the material covered in the class and the school has agreed to place the student in the next most appropriate course. Placement includes subject matter acceleration options, release time for guided independent study, taking a course through a community college, and so forth. In-school testing might be required to document what the student has learned and to make decisions about credit and placement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Learn about the courses offered in the Talent Search program</italic>. Documentation about the Talent Search course will help school personnel make informed decisions about credit and placement. For example, school personnel might want to know how many hours of supervised study were included in the Talent Search program and the qualifications of the teachers. Talent Searches often provide written evaluations of student performance in their courses in addition to standardized test scores.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Meet with appropriate school personnel</italic>. Focus the meeting on sharing information and options and asking for help, rather than on what the school has not done. CTY also tells parents that school personnel often say things like, “Everyone will want to skip Algebra I” and prepares the parents with appropriate responses. (If the school sets reasonable entrance standards for the course, others who meet those criteria would be able to take those courses. If school personnel are concerned that too many students will be eligible for this special treatment, this is grounds for offering such opportunities to all students who are eligible.)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Once these strategies are used successfully by one family, they can help pave the way for other high-ability students in the school. Julian Stanley often called this process of working with schools as a parent advocate as “benignly insidious,” meaning that parents and Talent Search personnel advocating for one child at a time can eventually change entire programs for a later group of students. Even though schools might not embrace the Talent Search concept as a whole, they are faced with decisions about what to do with individual students who have successfully completed a Talent Search summer program and now need a more advanced course. Successful Talent Search students demonstrated that they could benefit from taking advanced classes and accelerating their educational programs. Schools often develop policies based on their experiences with one or two Talent Search participants, and these policies benefit future students. Talent Searches have in effect raised the bar for educational programming for all talented youngsters. They have changed the national landscape for gifted students, even for those who haven’t participated in the Talent Search programs themselves.</p>

<title>Bridging the Talent Search Model and K-12 Gifted Education</title>
<p>The Talent Search model focuses on discovery of talented students’ specific academic strengths, which lead to further assessment that can determine the level of academic challenge needed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734282911433946">Olszewski-Kubilius (2004)</xref> considers four specific features of Talent Searches: (a) diagnosis/evaluation; (b) educational placement; (c) talent development through talent-related opportunities; and (d) research that informs professionals about best practices for gifted students. These features also correspond to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0734282911433946">NAGC (2010)</xref> Assessment Standard. Although this may not have been the intent, we interpret it as a connection between the K-12 gifted and talented world and the world of university-based Talent Searches.</p>
<p>Talent Searches are usually conducted by university centers for academically talented precollege students; however, university-based centers do not aspire to be the sole purview of the Talent Search model. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734282911433946">Table 2</xref> delineates several actions that K-12 educators of gifted students can take to incorporate the benefits of the Talent Search programs into their school.</p>

<title>Research Highlights</title>
<p>A comprehensive discussion of the Talent Search model involves consideration of the “how” and “why” for the model. Above, we’ve discussed how to implement Talent Search programs in the university precollege setting as well as how to integrate the Talent Search model into a K-12 gifted education program. The “why” of Talent Searches is detailed in the extensive research that has been conducted over the past four decades; below we answer three broad research questions.</p>
<list id="list2-0734282911433946" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Does it work?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This question is answered by the data collected annually by the testing companies, that is, ACT, Inc. and the Educational Testing Service (ETS). For example, the scores earned by academically talented third through sixth graders who took the eighth-grade EXPLORE test in an Elementary Student Talent Search are spread out along the entire continuum of the test scores. The average scores of the fourth- and fifth-grade Talent Search participants are similar to those of the eighth graders in the standardization sample. The EXPLORE test effectively discriminates among the third through sixth graders taking the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911433946">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734282911433946">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Lu, 1994</xref>). Similar findings have been described with the SAT taken by seventh and eighth graders (Brody &amp; Benbow, 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911433946">Brody &amp; Mills, 2005</xref>). Not only do these Talent Search tests discriminate <italic>talented</italic> from <italic>exceptionally talented</italic> students, but also, the test scores are useful in making long-term predictions about student performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911433946">Bartkovich &amp; Mezynski, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911433946">Lubinski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0734282911433946">Olszewski-Kubilius, Kulieke, Willis, &amp; Krasney, 1989</xref>). The DT-&gt;PI assessment and Talent Search above-level testing provide information that can be used for placement purposes as well as for specific school-based programming. Nevertheless, schools rarely use the testing information available through Talent Search above-level testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0734282911433946">Swiatek &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2005</xref>). This is unfortunate because such information can provide direction regarding an individual student as well as groups of talented students.</p>
<p>Perhaps equally as important as demonstrating that the Talent Search identification process is robust, the Talent Search programs have done an impressive amount of research on the effectiveness of the educational opportunities they have devised. For example, several research studies have shown that these students excelled in subsequent mathematics courses after their fast-paced summer experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734282911433946">Mills, Ablard, &amp; Lynch, 1992</xref>), eliminating the concern about “gaps” in their knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911433946">Brody &amp; Mills, 2005</xref>) and reinforcing the connection between the discovery and development of talent.</p>
<p>As a group, intellectually talented youth achieve on an impressively high level. However, they do not achieve at such high levels if deprived of an appropriately challenging education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734282911433946">Benbow &amp; Stanley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911433946">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734282911433946">Csikszentmihalyi, Rathunde, &amp; Whalen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0734282911433946">Swiatek &amp; Benbow, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0734282911433946">1992</xref>). Years of research on academically talented students clearly indicates that accelerated students perform better than equally able but nonaccelerated students. Academically talented students thrive when academic experiences are tailored to their needs, as in the Diagnostic Testing-Prescriptive Instruction process advocated by the Talent Search programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911433946">Assouline &amp; Lupkowski-Shoplik, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911433946">Colangelo et al., 2004</xref>). So the answer to the “Does it work?” question is “Yes.” Talent Searches both effectively identify gifted students and provide research-supported educational programs for talented youth.</p>
<list id="list3-0734282911433946" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Does it help us better understand gifted students?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282911433946">Benbow (1988)</xref> reported the consistent findings regarding gender differences in the scores earned by Talent Search participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0734282911433946">Olszewski-Kubilius and Lee (2011)</xref> reported that the differences observed 30 years ago are still in existence. Specifically, males outperform females in math and science and females outperform males in the verbal areas. Such ability profiles can lead to important understanding regarding course selection and career choice.</p>
<p>In addition to a better understanding regarding aptitude profiles, research conducted with Talent Search participants can help us better understand psychosocial aspects of their performance. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734282911433946">Assouline et al. (2006)</xref> demonstrated that Talent Search participants do not attribute school failure to ability. This is an important finding as it refutes a common hypothesis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734282911433946">McNabb, 2003</xref>) that gifted students form an identity based on ability and therefore would doubt their ability when faced with “failure.”</p>
<list id="list4-0734282911433946" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: Does it point us to additional areas of investigation?</p></list-item></list>
<p>As university-based researchers, the obvious answer is, “yes.” However, we need to bear in mind the need to better understand multiple aspect of the Talent Search model including the continued gender differences in scores earned by participants; the role of psychosocial factors; and the interplay between Talent Search and school-based experiences.</p>

<title>Summary: The Julian Stanley Effect</title>
<p>The approach that Julian Stanley founded when he began testing precocious seventh and eighth graders using the SAT in the early 1970s has evolved into a systematic process that involves huge numbers of students annually. Hundreds of thousands of students take the SAT, the ACT, the EXPLORE, and other above-level tests each year through a regional university-based Talent Search. Tens of thousands of students participate in challenging summer, weekend, and distance-learning programs. More than demonstrating an impact on literally millions of young people over the past 40 years, the “Julian Stanley Effect“ has given us specific, research-based tools to use to identify talented students and devise appropriately challenging programs for them. As a result of Stanley’s work and systematic “Talent Searching,” more students take Algebra I in eighth grade or younger, more students take advantage of Advanced Placement courses, and more school personnel understand that academically talented students can and should be allowed to advance into challenging courses at a younger age. Stanley’s research taught us that a one-size gifted program doesn’t fit all. Not only did Julian Stanley’s commitment to helping young people develop their talents fully change each one of their lives, it changed the American educational landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734282911433946">Benbow &amp; Lubinski, 2006</xref>).</p>
