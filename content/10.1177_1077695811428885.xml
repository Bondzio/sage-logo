<abstract>
<p>To carry out their mission of preparing students to be successful journalism professionals, educators make important decisions on the core curriculum: the common courses that all journalism students must take to graduate, no matter their area of emphasis or academic constraints. This national study of U.S. journalism program directors shows they agreed that training in writing and reporting is still considered the bedrock of journalism and that knowledge about visual communication has become an increasing priority. After that, however, these respondents disagreed on which specific courses take precedence for all journalism students. The authors offer several hypothetical models of core curricula.</p>

<p>For democracy’s sake, journalism, as best we can teach it, as best our graduates can practice, it needs to strive for a perhaps unattainable excellence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695811428885">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The world of journalism never stops moving. Certainly the economic climate and innovative technology have had a great impact on the industry in recent years. For example, in 2010, about half a dozen U.S. daily newspapers closed, while Patch, an AOL initiative, opened eight hundred news sites with professional reporters, editors, and photographers. While news consumers are continuing to get their news regularly, they are not as loyal as they once were to a particular organization. And about half of all Americans get their news habitually from four to six different platforms—online and offline—with a little over a quarter of U.S. citizens reading their news from a mobile device.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695811428885">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>No matter the technology and format, the principal tenet of journalism has remained the same—using good news judgment to give people the news and information they need to make good decisions to lead productive lives. How to do this best in an industry that is questioning its traditional economic model and in a changing society that is experiencing innovative technologies is a great challenge.</p>
<p>Educators help future journalists overcome challenges wherever they carry out their profession—at their desk in a news organization as a traditional journalist; in their car at a news scene as a mobile journalist (mojo); or in front of their computer at their breakfast table at home, as a freelancer. Instructors train students on what to expect to survive the pressures in a newsroom or as an independent backpack reporter, or both. And faculty members train them on the different skills that are needed to complete assignments differently, but still efficiently and effectively. For all of these reasons and more, programs at U.S. colleges have a paramount obligation to guide their students to acquire competence in reporting and critical thinking.</p>
<p>The academy always strives to offer the best education to their students to become the next Pulitzer Prize winner, but sometimes it is hard to know when, or even if, a curriculum should be changed. This issue has prompted widespread discussion about the role and responsibilities in higher education for training journalists, especially in a period of time with rapid technological changes. Notably, educators continually try out new ways to create the ultimate curriculum to serve their undergraduates while they struggle to find the right formula to implement skills and theory courses, among other studies of the liberal arts. Because this is a difficult task, the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) recently offered a conference for administrators on “Staying Current When Everything Around Us Is Changing,” with an opening session of “Curriculum in a Changing Age” and “Working Together to Find Answers: Practitioners and the Academy.”</p>
<p>Thus, the objective of this study is to examine current thought—what courses U.S. journalism program directors consider most important for <italic>all</italic> journalism majors to take in preparation for an entry-level job in journalism, regardless of the form (e.g., text, visual, or auditory) or platform (e.g., TV, radio, print newspaper, or online magazine) in which it appears, or the reporting specializations (e.g., international, environment, or sports reporting). Directors could also disregard internal and external constraints.</p>
<p>Directors of schools and chairs of departments gave their personal opinions as to what they thought—regardless of constraints or what their department currently offered—were courses that should be required for all majors. This study focused on the required courses (core curriculum) because this unique set of courses requires a sophisticated balance on what modules eventually make the required list.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695811428885">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The role of higher education in preparing reporters and editors for the job has grown quickly since the first writing courses were offered at U.S. colleges in the nineteenth century and the start of the first journalism department in 1908.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695811428885">3</xref></sup> Pioneers in journalism in higher education, such as Michigan State University, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Kansas State University, and the University of Missouri at Columbia, were experimenting at the time with the right type of journalism courses. Different approaches were visible from the early days, and soon journalism education became an interdisciplinary mix of the humanities and the social sciences. Some institutions focused primarily on hands-on training, while at other colleges, social scientific courses had a far more prominent place in the overall curricula. As a result, the field became both professional and academic in nature, leading to competing visions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695811428885">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>With so many constituents, it could be expected that some are more content than others with the way things are moving in journalism education. For instance, Stephen Reese concluded that journalism education “clearly” provides “a hybrid degree, serving diverse needs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695811428885">5</xref></sup> While some critics believe it is an advantage for journalism degrees to be an entry to many different professional fields, others see this as negative and think that the discipline “suffers from ambiguity of purpose.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695811428885">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The field gets heat from many directions for its performance. For instance, recruiters from news organizations are not always satisfied with the qualifications of recent graduates. It is difficult to please everyone, and schools get the blame for making some courses more important than they allegedly should be, while ignoring other essential skills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695811428885">7</xref></sup> Happily, this is not always the case. For example, only last year one of the authors met with a recruiter from a daily newspaper who was exuberant about the great news judgment and multimedia skills the students possessed. Within two weeks, another recruiter from a syndicated news service complimented the students’ multimedia skills, but wanted to see more writing.</p>
<p>While a number of studies have concluded journalists and educators have different priorities, other scholars indicate considerable agreement on certain content areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695811428885">8</xref></sup> Still, small discrepancies could have large implications, because priorities set by educators might not be the same as those set by professionals. Critical thinking, personal well-roundedness, and journalistic practical skills for various media platforms must all be considered, in addition to the belief that students need to learn about the world to cover it.</p>
<p>Journalism professionals are not the only ones to criticize. Many academics—within and outside the journalism discipline—have been skeptical and worried about the value of journalism degrees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695811428885">9</xref></sup> As the adage goes, getting faculty to agree is like herding cats.</p>
<p>In 1983, Everette Dennis warned that journalism education “appears to be on the ragged edge of being so hopelessly outdated that its usefulness may soon be severely questioned.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695811428885">10</xref></sup> Such warnings have been made often throughout the years and signal the lack of “great prestige” of the journalism discipline in comparison to schools of law, medicine, and engineering, among others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695811428885">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since then, several commissions, scholarly efforts, and task forces have forewarned the devaluation of journalism education because of the lack of “developing specialized expertise”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695811428885">12</xref></sup> and overly focusing on teaching “how” instead of “why.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695811428885">13</xref></sup> For example, Columbia University President Lee Bollinger in 2002 suspended the search for a journalism school dean because of the need to first “clarify the vision for a modern school of journalism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695811428885">14</xref></sup> And in 2010, University of Colorado Chancellor Phil DiStephano announced the decision to reconfigure and integrate the journalism and mass communication program into a larger interdisciplinary program of new information, communication, and technology because of the changing needs of the society and the rapid evolution of the media technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695811428885">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite varying efforts, proposals for change are often broad frameworks rather than concrete example syllabi. Therefore, even with the additional guidance and recommendations from review committees, it is still up to the faculty to build the curriculum content as they see fit to develop students as individuals, as members of society and as professionals who may work in different journalistic formats and media platforms.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077695811428885">
<title>Critical theory versus practical skills</title>
<p>Philip Gaunt identified several essential levels of journalism education, including the following: (1) understanding the media system in which journalists work; (2) basic skills, such as writing and editing; (3) the use of technical equipment; (4) understanding social, cultural, and economic issues in society; and (5) specialized training for certain areas in the profession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695811428885">16</xref></sup> The categories boil down to the two different visions in journalism training: <italic>practical skills</italic> and <italic>content and theory</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695811428885">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Journalists learn skills to aptly complete assignments. In essence, students are trained to gather different pieces of information from multiple sources and translate them quickly in clear news accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695811428885">18</xref></sup> Wilkins argued that practical newsgathering skills should be the core of journalism education: “At its heart lies person-to-person contact: reporters talking to sources, reporters spending hours a day on the telephone, reporters scribbling hurriedly in notebooks in corridors after press conferences.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695811428885">19</xref></sup> To do so, they ought to have a solid grounding in methods of reporting, evidence-gathering, and fact assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695811428885">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>But there is much more to the journalism profession than the ability to craft messages that serve as comprehensible accounts of the day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695811428885">21</xref></sup> For instance, journalists present causes of and reasons for particular developments in public affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695811428885">22</xref></sup> Reporters can provide a thoughtful context on political events if they are familiar with political history and are knowledgeable about the judicial system, among other elements that make up society, including diversity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695811428885">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Tom Jacobson maintained, “Social complexity has multiplied dramatically. . . . It seems reasonable to expect that the liberal education traditionally expected of journalists must now go beyond the ability to write, beyond a skepticism towards given truth and beyond a sense of the drift of modern history.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695811428885">24</xref></sup> Hence, to be able to serve an important role in society, aspiring journalists should be taught critical-thinking skills in addition to practical skills to create comprehensive and intelligent news messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695811428885">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is, therefore, not surprising that some recommend a thorough liberal arts background for journalists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695811428885">26</xref></sup> After all, journalists report on life, not necessarily on the topic of journalism. Additionally, there have been calls for increasing attention for the scholarship of critical and reflective thinking and its implementation in journalism curricula. Special courses in these areas would allow future journalists to “understand the social, cultural, economic and political worlds they inhabit.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695811428885">27</xref></sup> There are indications that journalism students in the past decades may have graduated with fewer analytic skills than desired, while the opposite is essential for the press to continue its important role in society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695811428885">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mark Deuze asserted that what is needed is to change the paradigm of modern journalism education, and he proposed to abandon the theory versus practice discussion. Instead of centering the debate on the question of which area is most important, educators should focus on how to integrate those two missions in individual courses as part of one curriculum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695811428885">29</xref></sup> Journalism courses should integrate skills and content. Training students in storytelling techniques often happens with examples of colorful public affair debates, while allowing students to get some exposure to the political system and related matters. Although existing courses often address both areas, usually one is emphasized. Consequently, there is still often a need to balance the two areas within the core of training programs.</p>

<sec id="section3-1077695811428885">
<title>Creating the core curriculum</title>
<p>Recruiters would be thrilled to select from a large pool of rookie reporters with qualifications reflecting great breadth and width: news judgment, writing/reporting skills, knowledge of media law and ethics, visual literacy, broad liberal arts backgrounds, Internet research skills, specialized knowledge (science, business, etc.) and the ability to write across media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695811428885">30</xref></sup> Unfortunately, not enough time exists to prepare students to the satisfaction of everyone in all competencies within a four-year degree program.</p>
<p>Journalism schools attempt to create strong curricula while grappling with a maximum number of credits undergraduates can take within their educational career. Universities require all students to take a minimum number of liberal arts, science, and math classes. Then colleges and departments require students to take certain core and required courses in their major. In addition to internal influences, some programs are affected by external constraints on the number and type of courses offered. Schools accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC), for instance, have limits on the amount of journalism classes their students can take.</p>
<p>Most curriculum committees struggle with determining acceptable credit limitations and identifying educational priorities within those limitations. For example, law and ethics have always been important, but as the digital revolution allows for more instant distribution of information messages to mass audiences, reporters and editors increasingly make instant judgments with ethical and legal implications (what information should be passed along and with which details?).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695811428885">31</xref></sup> Also, the growth and ease of searching for information online and information-sharing capacities have led to increased plagiarism and copyright infringement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695811428885">32</xref></sup> Therefore, media law and media ethics education is increasingly important in developing analytical skills and to encourage good moral judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695811428885">33</xref></sup> This is particularly important for the growing number of professional independent or citizen journalists who have no organizational gatekeepers to catch a mistake or safeguards to defend expensive lawsuits on intellectual property misuse, copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and invasion of privacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695811428885">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Continuing with the law and ethics example, journalism programs have several choices to address these areas in their curriculum. They can offer two individual courses (one ethics and one law); combine the two in one course; or not offer it as stand-alone courses, but as part of other journalism (reporting and editing) courses with the hopes that all instructors will take time to discuss these issues. For many schools, this is not a trivial question, as they have limited financial and personnel resources. And it leads to a serious dilemma when faculty wants each subject as a standalone course in the core curriculum. On one hand, including two courses may mean that another important course (e.g., history, mass communication research, editing) has to be dropped from the core, unless the number of courses in the core can be expanded. On the other hand, combining the two areas for one three-credit class may mean less time within one course to thoroughly learn an ever-increasing body of media law and examples of ethical issues that now include evolving technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695811428885">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible to offer additional courses outside the core as electives, but, of course, it is up to the students to take those classes, in addition to other essential courses they want. It cannot be expected that all students will recognize the importance of taking both ethics and law. This example illustrates the “catch-22” and angst of creating a core within a curriculum to ensure that students are exposed to what a faculty perceives as priority content areas.</p>
<p>Choices have to be made on the type and number of core and required courses in a robust curriculum—taking into consideration important contextual topics and critical thinking development in addition to the interests of all students’ desires, such as in the type of skill (e.g., writing or design) and the format (e.g., text or visual) and the platform (e.g., online or TV), among other relevant factors. In essence, this study explores what journalism program directors consider the most important journalism courses to educate all students in a journalism bachelor’s degree program.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077695811428885" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to find out what directors of journalism programs think are important courses for all journalism majors to take. Program directors usually have a bird’s-eye view of the industry and conscientiously watch changes in the discipline as a context for the characterization of their programs. They would know the courses that they feel are most important.</p>
<p>The authors decided that a content analysis of programs’ required courses might not be up to date. Many programs are in the midst of changing their curriculum, and it can take a year for a revised curriculum to appear in final catalog copy—electronically or in print. The process entails undergraduate curriculum meetings; committee consensus; and department, college, and university committee approvals—depending on their meeting schedules. Furthermore, a review of websites shows that not all programs list their requirements online.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077695811428885">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A universal sample of about four hundred directors of journalism undergraduate programs within the United States was approached. The directory of the AEJMC has information on schools with journalism programs and lists the names of the corresponding directors. Follow-up searches of individual school websites were conducted to verify the information from the directory, find the names of the directors not listed in the directory, and clarify school’s description when it was not clear from the directory if the school had a bachelor’s degree program in journalism or a similar field, such as broadcasting.</p>
<p>About 158 directors responded (38 percent). Twelve of them provided information that their schools offered journalism courses, but not toward a standalone journalism degree (for instance, the journalism courses were part of an organizational communication degree). Twelve other persons skipped over essential parts of the survey without providing information. Their data were discarded. The findings below were based on the opinions of 134 journalism directors who voluntarily filled out the entire questionnaire, leading to an overall response rate of 32 percent. Respondents represented several types of institutions: very high research activity (12 percent), high research (19 percent), doctoral/research (7 percent), master’s large program (9 percent), master’s medium program (18 percent), master’s small programs (15 percent), baccalaureate (19 percent) and other (1 percent). The schools had 260 undergraduate journalism students on average, ranging from 10 to 1,500, and a median of 195. Twenty-one schools had more than 500 students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077695811428885">
<title>Data gathering</title>
<p>A web survey was created for the purpose of this study. Directors received an e-mail inviting them to participate and could click on a hyperlink that took them to the survey website. The hyperlinks were personalized for each individual. Only readers of the e-mails were able to make contact with the website host. Those who did not respond received another request by e-mail a few days after the first delivery. This was repeated one more time about a week after the second round.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077695811428885">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The program directors were asked to make explicit choices from a list of courses as to what ones to include or exclude from a hypothetical curriculum. This design was preferred over asking the respondents to indicate the importance of each course individually, because prior studies with such design found that educators often considered most, if not all, courses presented by the researchers as “extremely important.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695811428885">36</xref></sup> It is unrealistic to implement all those highly valued courses in one undergraduate study program, let alone designate them as required classes, also called the core of the curriculum.</p>
<p>To arrive at the number and types of courses to list, dozens of websites of journalism schools were visited to collect course titles and descriptions. This led to a large list with many courses with related titles. For example, one school would name a course “media ethics and responsibilities,” but another school would call it “journalism ethics and diversity,” while they had similar course objectives and descriptions. The result of the visit to the websites was about thirty-six different courses appearing in all of the different core curricula. Simultaneously, these thirty-six courses were common in topics across the programs. The title of the course appearing on the survey represented the title that programs used most often or that most closely reflected the concept. The list of thirty-six courses was shown to five seasoned journalism educators, all with years of experience in news organizations. They agreed that the list reflected journalism courses commonly included in a core curriculum and could not think of additional courses.</p>
<p>Also by visiting the websites of journalism programs, it was estimated that the core curriculum in journalism programs averaged twenty-four credits. All websites listed a three-credit introductory course to the journalism and mass media fields. As including this type of course in a program was not considered an issue, it was not one of the 36 courses listed on the survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695811428885">37</xref></sup> This left twenty-one credits (seven spots) for additional courses in the hypothetical curriculum of this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695811428885">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence, the respondents were asked to select from the list seven courses (twenty-one credits) they considered the most important for all journalism students to take, without considering specific areas the students want to specialize in. The intent of the study was for directors to choose ideal courses regardless of what their programs offered. Respondents could propose courses that they considered important but were not on the list. They also could indicate if a certain course should be spread over two semesters.</p>
<p>Respondents made their choices based on the course titles only. Neither extended course descriptions nor syllabi were available to them. On one hand, lack of information could be considered a drawback because respondents might have different ideas on the content for a certain course. Differing opinions might have happened anyway if larger explanations were presented. On the other hand, this strategy could be considered an advantage because more information would make the task of selecting seven courses more complex and time-intensive, which likely would have led to much lower participation rates.</p>
<p>The courses were presented as individual semester-long courses. For certain administrators, this could be an issue because some choices would be appealing as part of a class but not for an entire course that would last for a semester. Therefore, in deference to this thinking, some choices consisted of multiple content areas. For instance, the respondents could select a combined media law and ethics course or instead an individual media law course and/or an individual media ethics course.</p>
<p>The same strategy was proposed for writing and reporting courses. Three courses had “reporting” in the title—one on newsgathering exclusively, another on storytelling, and one that combined the two. Other examples included advanced reporting courses (such as investigative reporting and computer-assisted reporting), multimedia and storytelling, and feature writing.</p>
<p>The results section first describes the scores for the individual thirty-six courses. Then, the writing and reporting courses are collapsed into one category to provide a more thorough analysis of what other types of classes would be considered part of the top seven and also what courses lacked support to crack that list. Based on these results, six ranking models emerged, and their compositions are discussed.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>No clear consensus emerged about all classes to be included as core courses in a hypothetical journalism undergraduate curriculum. No identical set of seven courses emerged among the entire sample; all respondents had a unique view on what should be included in a bachelor’s program if they had no constraints. No one course was chosen by everyone, and almost all courses were selected by at least 5 percent of the respondents. Twenty-one courses were picked by more than 10 percent of the respondents (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695811428885">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>This table does not reflect whether a course is important, because courses can be offered as an elective outside the core curriculum. The mass media and social groups category is an overall number for different minority group coverage courses that were available, but only one got all attention while the others were picked rarely. <italic>Other</italic> includes proposed courses such as data presentation, freelance writing, and photography.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The seven most selected options were media ethics and law (58 percent), reporting—newsgathering and storytelling (55 percent), multimedia and storytelling (47 percent), reporting—newsgathering (40 percent), visual communication (36 percent), and feature writing (34 percent). This may mean that courses such as mass communication research, critical thinking, journalism history, mass media and social groups, web publishing, and sociology of news are less valued by journalism directors as an independent course for all journalism students. Or it may mean that some program directors assume that some proficiencies, such as critical thinking, are so paramount that they are integrated throughout all courses in a curriculum. Some directors may feel that journalism history or social groups is automatically included in that introductory course, which was not offered on the list since many schools require it.</p>
<sec id="section9-1077695811428885">
<title>Models</title>
<p>Writing and reporting skills classes appeared in the top seven courses most frequently. However, multiple writing and reporting courses were available that were not considered mutually exclusive. Seven of them were similar in their emphasis on reporting, storytelling, and newsgathering. Only one respondent choose all those courses as a complete curriculum core, but most of the other participants selected two (32 percent), three (39 percent) or four (18 percent) of those classes with other kinds of combinations.</p>
<p>A comparable observation can be made about the individual and combined media law and/or ethics courses. More than half the respondents chose the combined version as one of the seven core options, but a quarter of the sample preferred them as two separate classes within the hypothetical curriculum. Another 12 percent choose only one of the two.</p>
<p>The results are interpreted as six different models of the core of a hypothetical curriculum made up of seven courses, in addition to an introductory mass media course (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077695811428885">Table 2</xref>). Analyzing these models might prove more fruitful than analyzing the percentages of the individual courses as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695811428885">Table 1</xref>. The six models are based on three writing and reporting options (two, three, or four of such courses within the core) and two ethics and/or law options (combined or both as individual courses within the core) and a visual communication course (which also made the original top seven with support of more than one-third of the sample). The fewer writing/reporting and ethics/law courses in the top seven, the more room there is for additional options in these hypothetical core curricula.</p>

<p>An introductory course is understood to be included in all models. Results translated in six different core curriculum models that vary on the number of chosen writing and reporting courses (two, three, or four courses) and media law and/or ethics courses (combined or two separate courses). Potential (“open”) courses to fill up the models are mass communication research, critical thinking, journalism history, publication editing, and mass media and social groups. Model 3 most closely reflects the survey results.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>That leaves three spots for non–writing or other reporting, visual communication, law and/or ethics courses in model 1, because it has one combined law/ethics course and two writing/reporting courses. But there is no additional room in model 6, because all seven spots are filled with writing/reporting, ethics, law, and visual communication courses. All other rankings allow only one or two other (“open”) options. This could include any of the courses with support of more than 20 percent of the sample, which are all content/theory classes (mass communication research, critical thinking, journalism history, and mass media and social groups), except for publication editing, which received only one vote less than journalism history but nine more than the media and diversity option.</p>
<p>Based on those rankings, mass communication research would be present in all but one model, and critical thinking would be part of half those models. Journalism history gets a spot only in model 1. Because the majority of the respondents favors three writing and reporting courses and a combined media law and ethics course, model 3 seems to best represent the preferences of the entire sample, leaving out journalism history from the core.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Core knowledge has been debated since the early days of journalism education and warrants additional examination in light of new and varied innovations and rapid technology changes, and other pressures to overhaul training programs in the upcoming years, while maintaining emphasis on journalism principles. There are several struggles going on in an effort to stretch and grow. Some departments are tweaking their curriculum by adding multimedia skills courses and cutting back on other classes (What to remove?), while others are overhauling their curriculum (With current resources, who can teach it?). Furthermore, some faculties may feel that sweeping changes to teach multimedia skills will be removed in another five years as new generations of students already know the hardware and software before entering college (Can we wait it out?).</p>
<p>Instruction is typically one of three missions for faculty (scholarship and service being the other two), and faculty strive to be successful. Assessment is important to show if faculty and a curriculum are indeed successful in their teaching mission. Thus, the results of the study would benefit directors and faculty struggling to balance required courses to prepare students for this evolving industry. Core courses reflect a school’s teaching philosophy and have an impact on students acquiring the knowledge level needed to perform well in the industry and to achieve successful marketability.</p>
<p>This study was intended to answer one important question: what do journalism program directors think are the most important courses to educate all students in a journalism bachelor’s degree program, regardless of internal or external constraints? In a period in which changing economic models, technological advancements, and evolving consumer needs lead journalism programs to review the applicability of their course work, it is valuable to gain knowledge on how journalism directors would like to shape programs to provide the best education possible for their undergraduates no matter what type of journalism they would like to do.</p>
<p>Although directors agreed that reporting and writing courses belong in the core, they might have differed on the content. Journalism directors today debate the best way to train students. Some programs have core courses that train students to think about good news judgment, news elements, and how to gather and write news in one medium—usually print. The thought is that once students understand the basics of good reporting, they can adapt it to other media in other required or elective courses. Other programs introduce students in beginning writing and reporting courses to presenting and disseminating information in multiple formats and platforms. The thought here is that many news formats are important and students need to start thinking immediately about being multimedia journalists to survive in today’s industry.</p>
<p>A relatively large proportion of the respondents included a visual communication course in their hypothetical core. This is a formal nod to the notion that we are a visual world. In an era gone by, “journalism” meant newspapers, so students were trained in writing only. Eventually, photography and broadcast became elective courses. Students could graduate from an old journalism program without having experienced a visual communication course. Today, with the introduction of the Internet and its multimedia capabilities, all types of visual communication are important, such as photography, design, and information graphics—animated and 3D. With these survey results of core courses, directors seem to affirm that journalism appears in many forms beyond text and video and that visual communication is important to understand.</p>
<p>If model 3 correctly can be used as best representing the opinions of the sample (with three reporting and writing courses, a combined law and ethics course, and a visual course), then the next courses that directors appear to agree on are mass communication research and critical thinking. Both are interesting choices, as these seminar courses give variety to the skills classes. The choice of these courses reflects that directors think it is important for students to think about mass communication theories and what they are doing as they go about gathering, organizing, presenting, and disseminating information in different formats to thousands of news consumers from local to global levels.</p>
<p>Few journalism schools have a standalone course in critical thinking, although most, if not all, educators would agree that this is an important attribute. Critical thinking might be included in the introductory and other courses. But perhaps directors chose this as a course to make a statement that critical thinking should be pervasive in a curriculum and not be regarded as an indication that critical thinking can be left out of other courses. Thus, results from this survey indicate that a sizeable number of program directors advocate for a large presence of critical thinking.</p>
<p>This survey focuses on courses to be included in the core of journalism education early in today’s world; however, it also indicates courses of less importance not included in a core (but perhaps still a requirement for the journalism degree). More than a dozen courses were picked by at least one-fifth of the sample, while many programs have room for only six to nine required classes. As a result, programs struggle whether to designate courses such journalism history as a core, as part of a requirement or as an elective.</p>
<p>The results also indicate that journalism history, publication editing, and diversity in the media courses would not be considered core courses, if random sampling error has not interfered with providing an incorrect priority ranking. Again, choices are difficult. For those who want students to understand how journalism became what it is today, the loss of history would be considered a mistake. Furthermore, the course reflects the development of media, but also the entire political history of the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695811428885">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>As many schools have recently revamped their curriculum to accommodate more online and convergence elements, it is interesting that the six models do not overly emphasize this trend. There was some interest within the sample in web publishing and media technology courses, but it did not reach the level of others, such as mass communication research and critical thinking. And the program directors also did not use the write-in option of the survey to state the need for social media courses. Thus, while directors chose standalone courses whose topics could be folded into other courses (e.g., law, ethics, critical thinking, and history), they did not choose new technologies.</p>
<p>Some journalism directors might feel that they are caught between a rock and a hard place. Programs may need courses to train today’s college students to use cameras for online visual news, Twitter for texting, and Wordpress for blogs, for example, that have become useful tools for journalists. And what about mobile apps? Thus, the curriculum is tweaked and stretched to accommodate the training of those skills. Yet middle school students now are being taught how to write blogs for online news sites and shoot video for their school cable news shows. Perhaps in the future, journalism courses will shift again to remove the instruction of basic hardware and software and instead concentrate on applying these techniques to journalism. Also, media entrepreneurship, economics, and management courses might become more common as the Web makes it possible to implement new ideas without investing a fortune (which was once the case if one wanted to start a newspaper or TV station).</p>
<sec id="section11-1077695811428885">
<title>Future research and limitations</title>
<p>Generally, journalism research literature has focused on describing the skills and content debate, but less attention has been paid to productively combining the two. As results of this study indicate, educators would like to include more critical and historical context but clearly have to deal with practical limitations to the distribution of credits in generally 120-credit undergraduate degree programs and requirements beyond the journalism program in today’s multimedia industry. This is especially the case for the one-quarter of U.S. journalism and mass communication programs that are bound to accreditation limitations on the size and content of the curriculum.</p>
<p>Future research should focus on more in-depth analyses of how the two competing areas can be combined so that students get the most comprehensive education possible and that allows them to apply critical thinking while being competent in journalism routines and practices. In addition, it would be beneficial to better understand why certain courses are critical to the core while others are excluded.</p>
<p>Several limitations to this study have been discussed in the Methods section, such as items consisting of titles only (with no descriptions) and being non–mutually exclusive. The models were proposed to address some of the methodological shortcomings. Additional future investigations might ask educators to select a number of models rather than provide an exhaustive list. Also, this study chose not to include some skills classes, such as magazine writing, design, and TV news, because they were considered areas of specialization. This study focused on courses that were thought to be suitable for all journalism undergraduates, and as noted in journalism program websites.</p>
<p>The selected sample was limited to journalism directors, because they usually have extended experience in both journalism and academia. Because their task is to oversee the curriculum and potential changes, they have more experience with the larger picture of putting together the puzzle pieces of course offerings, credit limitations, and myriad other constraints. However, directors form only a very small part of all educators in the journalism field and they might have different priorities and interests than instructors. Future research should broaden the scope to include all faculty.</p>

<p>In addition, there was no option to include internships for course credit in the study. However, respondents were able to use a write-in option. One program director did so.</p>

<p>The average number of courses and credits was slightly higher than was expected in advance. Schools on semester schedules (<italic>n</italic> = 118) had, on average, 8.75 required course. The median was 8, which is similar to what was anticipated. In addition, the number of average credits was slightly higher than presumed (26), with a median of 25 credits. It should be noted that some outliers had a large influence on the averages. Importantly, some of the required courses and credits could be related to skills courses (e.g., broadcasting), which were out of the scope of this study. The five most “demanding” schools required 18 to 22 courses (48 to 60 credits). Only one school had no core classes.</p>
