<title>Methods</title>
<p>Review of all patients treated between 2004 and 2012 with EPCSCG placement in 3 academic and multispecialty group settings. The main outcomes measured include indications, complications, and outcome (need for additional procedures, decannulation rate).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812472435">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 28 patients underwent EPCSCG. Age range at time of surgery was 1 month to 15 years (mean, 56 months). Overall, 25 of 28 were decannulated or never required tracheostomy, and 24 of 28 had adequate symptom control with mean follow-up of 25 months. Twenty-two patients had resolution of their symptoms without additional procedures. Sixteen patients had SGS in isolation or in combination with cricoarytenoid fixation, glottic stenosis, or vocal fold immobility. Decannulation and/or symptom control was achieved in 14 of 16. Three patients had isolated PGS or cricoarytenoid fixation with all achieving decannulation. Nine patients had isolated BVFI with 7 being able to achieve resolution of their airway symptoms, 5 without additional procedures.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This descriptive series shows a consistent outcome in more than double the number of cases previously reported in the previously published series. We believe that EPCSCG is an important option to have in the management of pediatric glottis/subglottic stenosis and bilateral vocal fold immobility.</p>

<p>Expansion of the posterior aspect of the cricoid with costal cartilage grafting as a component of laryngotracheal reconstruction in children has been extensively described in the literature, including an exhaustive review by Robin Cotton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812472435">1</xref></sup> In 1994, Gray et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812472435">2</xref></sup> first described the use of isolated posterior cricoid split and costal cartilage graft placement for bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP). In 2003, Inglis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472435">3</xref></sup> introduced a method for creating a posterior cricoid split with endoscopic division and then endoscopic posterior cricoid split and costal cartilage graft (EPCSCG) placement. This new minimally invasive technique was described in 10 children who had posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) and/or subglottic stenosis (SGS), 3 of whom did not have preexisting tracheostomies. This new ability to expand the posterior glottis and posterior subglottis has become an attractive potential option in the management of bilateral vocal fold immobility (BVFI), PGS, and SGS. We presented our initial experience with 2 young children treated for BVFI using EPCSCG to avoid the need for tracheostomy placement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472435">4</xref></sup> These children are included as a subset of this current series. More recently, Provenzano et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472435">5</xref></sup> described the use of EPCSCG in 12 children with BVFI, glottic, or subglottic stenosis with a success rate of 67%. The purpose of this article is to present our series of patients undergoing EPCSCG for managing BVFI, PGS, and SGS.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>NorthShore University HealthSystem, Weill Cornell Medical College, and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients treated with EPCSCG between June 1, 2004, and September 1, 2010, at 3 separate institutions. Each patient underwent extensive evaluations, including flexible awake laryngoscopy to assess vocal fold mobility as well as a thorough endoscopic evaluation with cricoarytenoid joint palpation, prior to reconstruction to assess the location(s), severity, and dynamic characteristics of the airway obstruction. Assessment of any subglottic stenosis with endotracheal tube sizing and classification of stenosis severity was done using the modified system described by Myer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812472435">6</xref></sup> in 1994 (0%-50%: grade I, 51%-70%: grade II, 71%-99%: grade III, 100%: grade IV). The information gathered from the charts included age at time of reconstruction, surgical indications, preoperative presence of tracheostomy, outcome in terms of decannulation, symptoms in terms of voice and airway, and duration of follow-up after the initial surgery.</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812472435">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The operative techniques have been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472435">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472435"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472435">5</xref></sup> With 1 of 2 lead surgeons for all of the cases (M.E.G. [18] and V.K.M. [10]), the technique used for each case was similar but not systematically standardized as follows: a metal tracheostomy tube is placed as part of laser precautions. When no tracheostomy is present, spontaneous ventilation with insufflation is used to allow for adequate visualization of the posterior glottis. A Lindholm or Parsons laryngoscope is used with the laryngeal spreader placed in an inverted fashion and suspended from the laryngoscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812472435"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). The CO<sub>2</sub> laser at a 4- to 8-watt super-pulse mode is used to make a vertical midline incision in the posterior cricoid plate. Posterior and inferior pressure on the upper aspect of the posterior cricoid is important to obtain an adequate angle for the laser on the posterior cricoid plate and avoid injury to the interarytenoid musculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812472435"><bold>Figures 2</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812472435"><bold>3</bold></xref>). The length and width of the split are measured and the patient is removed from laryngeal suspension and the airway secured while the cartilage graft is harvested. The graft size is based on the measurement of the length of the cricoid and width of the expanded posterior split. After creating a lateral trough approximately 1.5 mm deep in the graft, the inner 1-mm edge of each side of the trough is removed, giving the final keyhole shape of the graft similar to that initially described by Ward et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812472435">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599812472435"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). A monofilament suture is temporarily placed through the superior part of the graft to assist manipulation during placement. With the patient back in suspension and the vocal cord spreader in place, the graft is positioned. The spreader is removed and the graft is “locked” in place. The adequacy of the position is checked with a Hopkins rod-lens telescope and a right angle probe prior to removal of the temporary suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599812472435"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). Accurate sizing of the graft is important. If it is too large to fit in place, it can be trimmed. In our experience, we have been careful to avoid too small of a graft. A graft that is too small would have the potential to not be secure in between the cut ends of the cricoid plate and, therefore, have a higher risk for extrusion and possible airway obstruction. If this were to occur, a longer period of intubation/stenting or consideration for converting to an open approach to secure the graft with sutures would need to be made. If there is an existing tracheostomy, it is secured, and the patient is awakened and brought to the recovery room. If there is not an existing tracheostomy, the patient is left intubated until there is a leak around the endotracheal tube.</p>

<p>Overall, there was an excellent success rate, with 25 of 28 (89%) either averting the need for tracheostomy or achieving decannulation and 24 of 28 (86%) having adequate symptom control (absence of significant dysphonia, swallowing difficulties, stridor, or shortness of breath with exertion). For purposes of this review, we divided the patients into those with SGS, PGS, and BVFI.</p>
<p>There were 16 patients with significant involvement of the subglottic larynx (SGS). Six had isolated subglottic stenosis, and the other 10 also had glottic involvement with cricoarytenoid fixation, glottic stenosis, and/or vocal fold immobility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812472435"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Eleven of 14 (80%) who had preexisting tracheostomies were decannulated. One of the failures was in a patient with predominately posterior grade III SGS following partial cricotracheal resection, and the endoscopic division of the posterior cricoid remnant was not able to achieve enough of a release. Another was a child with a very active larynx who initially was able to be decannulated but required tracheostomy replacement when he had return of symptomatic stenosis. The third patient who was not decannulated actually had an excellent result from the EPCSCG with a widely patent larynx and is able to cap the tracheostomy all day long. However, he has residual obstructive sleep apnea associated with micrognathia/glossoptosis and is scheduled for this to be surgically corrected in the near future. Ten patients did not require any additional intervention following EPCSCG. Four patients required additional early manipulation to manage symptoms or achieve decannulation. One patient required replacement of a displaced graft 1 week after surgery, and 3 required dilations (of these, 1 had endoscopic stenting for 1 month). Two patients required additional surgery. One of these had a patent glottis, but residual obstruction from epiglottic prolapse was thereafter treated successfully with epiglottopexy. The other had anterior costal cartilage graft placement to treat residual anterior subglottic stenosis after the EPCSCG. Both of these patients were able to achieve decannulation. The 1 patient who was stented for a month is the child who was only briefly decannulated before becoming symptomatic again enough to require tracheostomy replacement.</p>
<p>Three patients had isolated PGS or cricoarytenoid joint fixation (CAJF), 1 of whom also had a thick anterior glottic web that required a revision procedure with endoscopic keel placement to maximize his vocal outcome following the EPCSCG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812472435"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). All 3 have been decannulated with good symptom control.</p>
<p>Nine patients had isolated BVFI—3 confirmed paralysis by electromyography (EMG) testing prior to surgery and the other 6 suggested on physical exam by palpating the cricoarytenoid joint, which demonstrated good arytenoid mobility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812472435"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Two of the 9 had failed prior laryngeal surgeries (1 cordotomy and 1 suture lateralization). Four of the 9 did not have tracheostomies at the time of their EPCSCG (1 of whom had a residual tracheocutaneous fistula that was cannulated during the perioperative time frame of the EPCSCG). Three patients required additional procedures following EPCSCG to manage residual symptoms. One underwent cordotomy 7 months later and has since been decannulated. The 1 patient who underwent EPCSCG at 1 month of age did well for a few years but presented at 4 years of age with new-onset exercise limitation that was successfully treated with unilateral vocal fold suture lateralization. The third was decannulated 3 months after the EPCSG but then had return of exercise-induced stridor months later and sought care at another institution. Further follow-up was not available on this patient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The treatment of SGS, PGS, and/or BVFI in the pediatric population remains a difficult problem. Surgical treatment needs to be individualized to each case. Posterior cricoid split with costal cartilage grafting has been well established as one option in the management of laryngeal airway obstruction in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812472435">1</xref></sup> This study provides additional confirmation that the procedure can be safely performed with a minimally invasive endoscopic technique, which appears to have equal effectiveness without increased surgical risk. Twenty-five of our 28 (89%) patients were able to be decannulated or avoid tracheostomy placement, and 22 of the 28 (79%) required no additional major laryngeal procedures following the EPCSCG. At the glottic level, EPCSCG allows for expansion of the airway without any disruption/destruction of the arytenoids or vocal ligaments. At the subglottic level, by only dividing the posterior aspect of the cricoid cartilage, the elasticity of the cricoid ring is preserved similar to placement of an isolated anterior graft, resulting in less destabilization when compared with dividing the anterior and posterior cricoid as part of the same surgery. Therefore, when performing EPCSCG, stenting is not generally needed. However, when this technique is used, there is a risk of the graft becoming dislodged, especially if it is not appropriately sized. For this reason, we caution new adapters of the technique to initially use it in children with existing tracheostomies, place a temporary tracheostomy, or use a longer period of intubation.</p>
<p>Our study population of 28 patients included 9 patients with BVFI. In contrast to cricoarytenoid joint fixation, which can have a similar appearance on flexible awake laryngoscopy, the diagnosis of BVFI was either confirmed by electromyography or presumed based on endoscopic exam that included arytenoid palpation. The treatment of BVFI is based on the etiology of dysfunction and respiratory status of the patient. In cases of acute BVFI due to iatrogenic injury, control of a temporary airway is established either through intubation or high-flow air delivery, and frequently, a tracheotomy is placed. Definitive surgical approaches to the vocal folds are usually delayed until permanence of injury has been determined. The ideal procedure to treat BVFI would open the airway enough to allow for an adequate airway and at the same time minimize any potential adverse affect on voice and swallowing. Surgical options for managing BVFI have included both endoscopic and transcervical approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812472435">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472435">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472435">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812472435">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812472435">9</xref></sup> No one option is clearly superior. Most techniques are destructive in that permanent distortion of a portion of the vocal fold and/or arytenoid occurs to achieve an adequate airway. In contrast, expanding the posterior cricoid with costal cartilage grafting allows for separation of the arytenoids without otherwise distorting them or the vocal folds. A prior report of this technique done via a transcervical approach has shown excellent success in opening the airway but with a 15% incidence of aspiration (2/13 patients).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812472435">8</xref></sup> In our study, 6 of 9 patients with BVFI had resolution of the upper airway obstructive symptoms, and none developed clinical signs or symptoms of aspiration following surgery. As subjectively assessed, there were also no patients who had worsening of their vocal quality. Clearly, these are small numbers, and as has been demonstrated with our series and those previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812472435">8</xref></sup> more than 1 procedure may be necessary to achieve adequate results. We had 2 patients successfully managed by EPCSCG following failure to control symptoms with unilateral cordotomy in one and suture lateralization in the other. On the other hand, we had 1 patient who had successful control of symptoms using suture lateralization when symptoms returned nearly 4 years following EPCSCG. A second had early return of symptoms following EPCSCG and 7 months later had successful control of the recurrent symptoms after unilateral cordotomy was performed. One additional patient had return of symptoms months following EPCSCG and has since sought treatment at another institution.</p>
<p>Treatment options for the management of PGS also include both endoscopic and open approaches. For the more severe cases, open techniques that include posterior cricoid expansion and grafting have been shown to be effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812472435">10</xref></sup> Our 3 PGS patients were successfully managed without additional surgeries in this study, lending additional support that posterior costal cartilage grafting can be done for isolated PGS via a less invasive endoscopic approach.</p>
<p>Posterior cricoid split with costal cartilage graft expansion is a well-established technique in the management of subglottic stenosis. The procedure has been successful as an isolated technique and as part of management of more severe stenosis with anterior and posterior grafting or as part of an extended partial cricotracheal resection. The technique for performing this surgery has continued to evolve. Early surgeries were being done via complete laryngofissure and more recently via an anterior infraglottic approach, keeping the anterior commissure intact. The methodology for securing the graft has changed from buried sutures to carving the cartilage to allow for sutureless locking in of the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812472435">10</xref></sup> Endoscopic posterior cricoid split and costal cartilage graft placement now is an additional less invasive option to accomplish posterior glottic and subglottic airway expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472435">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472435"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472435">5</xref></sup> Our experience with the use of EPCSCG in 16 patients with subglottic and transglottic stenosis illustrates that EPCSCG can be successfully used for select subglottic and transglottic lesions. Fourteen of the 16 patients in our series were successfully decannulated, with 1 patient requiring an additional open procedure (anterior graft) and 4 others undergoing more mild endoscopic manipulation. Nine of the SGS patients had grade III SGS, which previously was suggested to not be amenable to isolated expansion of the posterior cricoid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472435">3</xref></sup> However, this series suggests that in select patients, it is a reasonable option to consider as 5 of the 9 were decannulated without additional laryngeal procedures. Of those who required additional procedures, 1 underwent a single postsurgical dilation/radial incision of a residual scar. Another (with a transglottic lesion) had significant postsurgical edema develop, leading to placement of an endoscopic stent for a month followed by serial dilations prior to achieving decannulation—only for a short time and thereafter requiring revision tracheostomy placement. One patient with grade III SGS underwent placement of anterior costal cartilage graft placement after EPCSCG.</p>
<p>The potential advantages of the endoscopic approach for expansion of the posterior cricoid include avoidance of an external scar, reduced pain, and decreased infection risk. Keeping the anterior cricoid intact avoids having 2 points of destabilization that require stenting and prevents anterior commissure and vocal fold injury. Decreased intensive care unit utilization and duration of hospitalization was found in the reports by Inglis et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472435">3</xref></sup> and Provenzano et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472435">5</xref></sup> Although comparative surgical times could not be done in this study, we did note that the majority of the procedures took 2 to 2.5 hours, including the time for harvesting and carving the costal cartilage graft.</p>
<p>Complications and limitations of EPCSCG were limited but encountered. One patient who was not included in this series presented with laryngeal pathology that appeared to be amenable to EPCSCG but required an open approach because the severity of micrognathia limited endoscopic exposure. One patient had a slipped graft, which was identified and able to be replaced with a better fit obtained after trimming 1 mm from the width. For this reason, when using EPCSCG and no tracheostomy is in place, at a minimum, there should be additional intraoperative manipulation of the larynx to check stability of the graft after placement as well as a period of postoperative inpatient observation and repeat laryngoscopic confirmation of graft position prior to planned discharge home. Given the potential for a graft to slip out of position, prolonging the period of intubation or temporary tracheostomy placement should be considered, especially if there is any concern that the graft size or stability is anything less than perfect. Similar to when there is any surgical manipulation of the larynx in patients with tracheostomies, postoperative humidification and suctioning efforts should be increased. In our series, 2 patients developed tracheostomy plugging, requiring immediate tracheostomy replacement within the first 2 days after surgery.</p>
<p>The incidence of aspiration in posterior graft procedures has been documented as high as 15% in transcervical techniques when used for the treatment of BVFI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812472435">7</xref></sup> However, the same procedure when used for posterior glottic/subglottic stenosis has not had any significant incidence of aspiration problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812472435">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812472435">9</xref></sup> Aspiration was not noted with the endoscopic approach in the previously reported series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472435">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472435"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472435">5</xref></sup> In our study, only 1 patient with transglottic stenosis had thin liquid aspiration issues that were present prior to and remained unchanged after EPCSCG.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This is a descriptive series with a consistent outcome in more than double the number of cases previously reported with EPCSCG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812472435">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812472435"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812472435">5</xref></sup> We did not attempt to design a comparative study due to the multi-institutional nature of the study and the relatively small numbers. On the basis of the results of this experience as well as that which has been previously published, we believe that EPCSCG is an important option to have in pediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction. The technique should be considered when managing children with posterior glottic stenosis, subglottic stenosis, and bilateral vocal fold immobility.</p>
