<p>The recommendations from the Bercow Review of services for children with speech, language and communication needs (DCSF, 2008a) have significant implications for the training of pre-service teachers who will be expected to be more able to meet the needs of such children. This article explores the potential within the Standards for Qualified Teacher Status, the key framework for the development of pre-service teachers in England, to support the implementation of the Bercow Report. The discussion focuses on three recommendations: that language is central, a human right; the need for early identification and intervention; and the development of a continuum of services around the family. The article reflects on a successful and an unsuccessful implementation of policy within pre-service teacher training to better illustrate the issues entailed in realizing Bercow Review recommendations within pre-service teacher education.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>The Bercow Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>) was commissioned by the former Labour Government in the UK to seek ‘a review of services for children and young people (0–19) with speech, language and communication needs’ (SLCN). It is the most extensive review ever conducted for this group in England. Delay in language development is the most common childhood disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265659012450896">Law et al., 2000</xref>) with potentially far reaching and stark consequences for children’s social, emotional, behavioural and academic well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659012450896">Botting and Conti-Ramsden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659012450896">Clegg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659012450896">Conti-Ramsden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265659012450896">Lindsay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0265659012450896">Stothard et al., 1998</xref>). The rationale for the review was twofold: first, the moral imperative that as a society we should be seeking to provide the best for vulnerable groups of people; and, second, the pragmatic acknowledgement that the nation’s interests would be served economically, socially and educationally by ensuring all children and young people reach their potential in communication. The report made recommendations to the UK Government about the steps needed to ‘transform provision for and the experiences of children and young people with SLCN and their families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>: 6). It was welcomed by relevant bodies, such as the UK’s Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, as the most significant policy document to emerge offering the greatest opportunity to have a real and long lasting impact on the futures of children with SLCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0265659012450896">RCSLT, 2008</xref>). Interestingly the response from, for example, the UK’s Teacher Development Agency (now the Teaching Agency) was more muted, stating that there are ‘no contradictions between the work of the TDA and that of the Bercow Review’ (personal communication, December 2010). The report concludes by referring to five key areas for development:</p>
<list id="list1-0265659012450896" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Communication is crucial.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Early identification and intervention are essential.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A continuum of services designed around the family is needed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Joint working is critical; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The current system is characterized by high variability and a lack of equity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The implementation of these policy recommendations will, given the nature of the support offered to children and young people, necessarily rely on a range of professional groups. Within England all individuals working with young children whether employed by health, social services or education operate under the guidance and expectations of the Department for Education (DfE). Provision for speech and therapy services is ultimately the responsibility of the National Health Service (NHS) but, where support is not forthcoming for children who have specific and significant special educational needs (SEN), then the responsibility lies with the Local Education Authority. One of the key issues in working with children who have SLCN in the UK is the integration of these service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265659012450896">Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265659012450896">Mroz and Letts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265659012450896">Mroz et al., 2002</xref>), and this will continue to be an important factor in the successful implementation of the report recommendations.</p>
<p>The focus in this article is the implications of the Bercow Report’s recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>) with the requirements for preparing pre-service teachers for qualified teacher status (QTS) set by the Teaching Agency (TA) (formerly the Training and Development Agency) in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0265659012450896">TDA, 2007</xref>). The issues are explored through a case study of the interplay between the recommendations from the Bercow Report and the standards for QTS, which is the Government’s licence to teach in England. Within teacher education, and in education more widely, the translation of policy recommendations into practice is often problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659012450896">Galton et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265659012450896">Pollard, 1985</xref>), not least due to the way different policies interact in the fields they are intending to shape. Thus, although the possibility exists for an integration of the Bercow Report recommendations and the standards for QTS, there is the potential for gaps both within the interpretation of the recommendations in relation to the standards and between the interpretation and implementation of the recommendations.</p>
<p>The article begins by describing the current model for acquiring QTS in England. It then presents a brief example of a central policy recommendation on the teaching of early reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659012450896">DfES, 2006a</xref>) that was effectively implemented in Initial Teacher Training (ITT) in order to provide an insight into what factors influenced this outcome. This discussion is a key introduction to considering why the Bercow Report recommendations, despite its worthy intentions, the will of professional bodies and the demands and needs of parents and children with SLCN, may not be realized. The next section describes how three of the five themes of the Bercow Report may successfully align with QTS standards. Reference is made to an earlier policy recommendation on classroom interaction that was not successfully implemented and discusses the potential reasons for this. The final section of this article reflects on the wider context of the Bercow Report within the education system and considers what factors might result in a positive outcome and which may lead to continuing challenges.</p>
<p>This article, therefore, addresses an important issue in considering children with SLCN and reflecting on how the school and the teacher are key factors in an individual’s development. The article offers an opportunity to consider how the integration of the standards for QTS with the Bercow Report recommendations could be pivotal for the education of children with SLCN. For SALTs (speech and language therapists), knowledge of the standards for QTS will be useful in exploring the potential for more coherent, embedded working practices with teachers.</p>
<p>Whilst the article is centred on the system for training teachers in England, there are global resonances. Developments in ITT impact on what teachers may foreground in their practice and result in implications for how children with SLCN are supported in school settings. Where SALTs work alongside teachers, their role and influence can also be affected by changes in ITT.</p>
<sec id="section2-0265659012450896">
<title>1 Pre-service teacher education in England</title>
<p>There are numerous routes into teaching in England including for example, Bachelor of Education degrees and Post Graduate Certificates in Education based in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), and school-centred initial teacher training such as the Graduate Teaching Programme. Increasingly there is a move towards school-centred training such as Teach First (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265659012450896">Freedman et al., 2008</xref>: the English version of ‘Teach America’). However, 83% of primary teachers in England are currently trained within HEIs (Universities’ Council for the Education of Teachers, 2011, personal communication). Regardless of the training context the unifying factor for gaining QTS is a competence model. Within this approach, detailed within the ‘Professional standards for qualified teacher status and requirements for initial teacher training’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0265659012450896">TDA, 2007</xref>), trainees have to demonstrate that they have met all 33 standards. The standards are designed to ensure that trainees understand, interpret and teach the National Curriculum and the content of the Primary National Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265659012450896">DfES, 2006b</xref>) in addition to a wide range of other features related to teaching and learning. The ITT curriculum is driven by the need to ensure that all trainees are enabled to meet the standards dictated, and the award of QTS is a joint responsibility between the HEI and the schools where the pre-service teachers are placed. These standards for QTS remain important throughout a teacher’s career and are built upon in the induction (post qualification) year and into later continuing professional development.</p>
<p>The limitations of the standards system, which was drawn up with no explicit reference to research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659012450896">Alexander, 2010</xref>), and the resultant prescription for teacher education courses, is acknowledged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659012450896">Ellis (2010)</xref>. In addition there are issues identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659012450896">Ellis (2010)</xref> in working with the complexity and number of standards and the ‘Guidance to accompany the standards for qualified teacher status’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>; for an example, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0265659012450896">Appendix 1</xref>). These factors include the tension associated with a competence approach to teaching rather than an acknowledgement of the complexity of the teaching situation: ‘at best [it] represents a severely limited vision of teaching, and at worst actually contradicts much of what is, potentially at least, valuable in the experience of teaching and learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0265659012450896">Stevens, 2010</xref>: 187).</p>
<p>In addition, there is concern about how much and what quality of evidence is sufficient to ensure that the standards have been met. A further issue relates to how this standardized approach to teacher education coheres with the individual reflection required by student teachers on their unique and diverse teaching experiences. Whilst the standards for QTS have been reviewed and streamlined for implementation from September 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659012450896">DfE, 2011a</xref>; see example in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0265659012450896">Appendix 2</xref>) the competence approach is maintained.</p>
<p>The education of pre-service teachers is also impacted upon by policies that are centrally passed down from the TDA, through the annual priorities letter and through OFSTED (Office for Standards in Education). Interestingly, within the 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 OFSTED priorities communications (Jeff Williams, Head of Quality and Inspection, 2008, 2009, 2010, personal communication) there was no specific mention of the Bercow Report, although specific expectations were identified for working with children with special educational needs. OFSTED inspections of HEIs (the outcomes of which determine the number of places allocated for pre-service training) and judgements made with reference to the stated annual priorities also exert considerable influence on whether and how policies are implemented. Again no specific focus is made to the Bercow Report during OFSTED inspections of ITT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265659012450896">OFSTED, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>2 An examination of successful policy implementation: The case of the Independent Review of the Teaching of Early Reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659012450896">DfES, 2006a</xref>)</title>
<p>Following the Rose Review of teaching of early reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659012450896">DfES, 2006a</xref>) HEIs (and schools) were required to adopt the review recommendations, with a particular focus on the teaching of Systematic Synthetic Phonics (SSP) for reading. A systematic approach means that the letter sounds are taught in a specific sequence and the synthetic aspect refers to a teaching approach that encourages children to convert letters (graphemes) into sounds (phonemes) and to blend them to form recognizable words. These recommendations were controversial and contested by, amongst others, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0265659012450896">United Kingdom Literacy Association (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0265659012450896">Wyse and Styles (2007)</xref>. Despite the professional disquiet at the imposed changes to the teaching of reading, the translation of this particular aspect of policy to practice in HEIs was successful due to a number of factors. First, the requirements were stated in the priorities’ communications sent out by the TDA (Jeff Williams, Head of Quality and Inspection, 2006, personal communication) and were a major focus for OFSTED inspections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265659012450896">OFSTED, 2008</xref>). Second, resources were allocated for mandatory training and directives, and support for course content was supplied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2007</xref>). Third, a named person in each HEI was responsible for implementing policy changes. A fourth factor that will have contributed to the success of the imposition of SSP in HEIs is the discrete nature of the demand, i.e. there is a prescribed body of knowledge to be learnt. Thus, for example, adding on workshops or tasks related to SSP was, to some extent, unproblematic. A fifth aspect that contributed to the implementation within HEIs was the rewriting of the reading aspect of the curriculum for English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0265659012450896">Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, 2006</xref>) and the associated media coverage that focused on the increased emphasis on phonics within the curriculum. The final factor that ensured compliance and successful implementation for teaching SSP was unprecedented in teacher education and involved a direct approach from the Parliamentary Secretary for the DfES at the time, Lord Adonis, who contacted the vice chancellors of all universities anticipating their support (2006, personal communication). In summary the synergies between curriculum, assessment and inspection were evident.</p>

<title>II Mapping the Bercow Report recommendations on to the standards for Qualified Teacher Status</title>
<p>The following subsections begin by directly relating some of the Bercow Report recommendations to the relevant standards for QTS. Each sub-section then discusses issues that may influence the potential for successful integration.</p>
<sec id="section5-0265659012450896">
<title>Theme 1: The importance of an understanding that communication is vital, central: a human right</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The ability to communicate is an essential life skill for all children and young people and it underpins a child’s social, emotional and educational development. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Inevitably key aspects of the QTS standards implicitly relate to language and communication as the basis for much, if not all, later learning. In parallel, however, it has been argued that in teacher education understanding of the development of communication is not sufficiently fore-grounded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265659012450896">Mroz and Hall, 2003</xref>). The development of Theme 1 in trainee teachers can be linked to two ITT standards (the preface Q shows that the standard referred to is for pre-service teachers who are working towards qualified teacher status):</p>
<list id="list2-0265659012450896" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Q4: ‘communicate effectively with children, young people colleagues, parents and carers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 14);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Q14: ‘have a secure knowledge and understanding of their subjects and curriculum areas and related pedagogy to enable them to teach effectively across the age and ability range for which they trained’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 26).</p></list-item></list>
<p>The expectations of standard Q4 are further specified through key questions used to determine whether a trainee has met this standard, such as: does the trainee ‘use questioning effectively?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 14) and ‘use effective and appropriate non-verbal communication?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 14). In order to meet standard Q14 relevant questions include:
<disp-quote>
<p>Does the trainee demonstrate that they ‘can break down ideas and concepts, and sequence them logically to support the developments of learners’ knowledge and understanding? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 27).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The implication of this standard is that the pre-service teacher has the ability to conduct whole-class, group and individual teaching mediated through spoken language.</p>
<p>However, whilst a potential relationship might exist between the Bercow Report recommendations and standards for QTS, research has demonstrated the general difficulty of policy implementation in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659012450896">Galton et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265659012450896">Pollard, 1985</xref>). As a specific example of this issue the Bercow Report found that the central nature of language to all aspects of life was poorly understood by policy makers and service providers. This is of great concern given that the evidence-base surrounding the central role of language in education has been widely acknowledged for very many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659012450896">Barnes, 1976</xref>). Classroom interaction has been a major focus of national (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659012450896">Galton et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659012450896">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265659012450896">Mroz et al., 2000</xref>) and international research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659012450896">Alexander, 2004</xref>) and has been frequently referred to in policy and practice in primary education with exhortations to use talk partners, small group work and to employ dialogic methods of teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659012450896">Alexander, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265659012450896">Mercer and Hodgkinson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0265659012450896">Wegerif, 2006</xref>). This dialogic approach, when accompanied by feedback offered by the teacher and peers, can invite pupils to:
<disp-quote>
<p>use talk to explore understandings, to speculate, hypothesize, reason and evaluate, and to consider a range of possible answers … [and] are more valuable in helping pupils construct and reconstruct knowledge and understanding. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0265659012450896">Smith and Higgins, 2006</xref>: 486)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However the case of classroom talk provides a very clear example of where policy recommendations are not necessarily being enacted in the classroom. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265659012450896">Mroz et al. (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659012450896">Alexander (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0265659012450896">Smith et al. (2004)</xref> has demonstrated the continued predominance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0265659012450896">Sinclair and Coulthard’s (1975)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0265659012450896">Tharp and Gallimore’s (1988)</xref> recitation script in which there is an initiation (by teacher) a response (by pupil) and feedback (by teacher) (I–R–F). This script is extremely resistant to change. If one contrasts the successful implementation of the Rose Review recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659012450896">DfES, 2006a</xref>) to ineffective changes in classroom interaction, a number of key issues combine to make the latter more challenging. One factor is that, over the last 10–15 years, OFSTED and the TDA have placed the emphasis on the development of reading and writing skills rather than speaking and listening, and the accompanying assessment regime has aligned with this focus. For example, high-stakes National Curriculum tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659012450896">DfE, 2010</xref>a) report on the reading and writing components of the English curriculum and do not formally assess nor report on speaking and listening. New assessment materials (Assessing Pupil Progress; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008c</xref>) to assess reading and writing were introduced prior to those for speaking and listening. The above factors result in a lack of coherence between the curriculum, assessment and inspection regime in speaking and listening and the Bercow recommendations thus constraining effective implementation. In addition, an important consideration is the task itself, which asks teachers to change their classroom interaction patterns, with subsequent implications for all teaching. In order for teachers to demonstrate these changed interaction patterns, on-going reflection and metacognitive awareness are required. The expectation on teachers and the underlying skills associated with changing patterns of discourse are considerably more demanding than those imposed from the Rose Review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659012450896">DfES, 2006a</xref>). In order to meet the demands of the latter, early years and Key Stage 1 teachers (teaching 5–7-year-olds) were required to teach 20 minutes of discrete SSP each day using a prescribed programme, a far simpler requirement than that of altering their style of interaction. Thus, the complexities of ensuring that policy becomes practice are evident, particularly where proposals are more diffuse, and complex, as demonstrated in the lack of change in classroom interaction styles. This might also apply to the integration of the Bercow Report recommendations.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265659012450896">Mroz et al. (2002)</xref> have demonstrated that teachers of 3–5-year-old children (where considerable SALT input is targeted) recognize the importance of early identification of speech and language difficulties and indeed prioritize it as their most important training need, although teachers and other early-years practitioners – such as nursery nurses and teaching assistants – also perceive that they lack the necessary knowledge and skills to identify these children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265659012450896">Mroz, 2006</xref>). Within schools, assessment will be key to identifying children with SLCN. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265659012450896">Mroz et al. (2002)</xref> found that a significant minority (29%) of early years teachers working in school nursery or reception classes self-report that they have no means to assess speaking and listening; an important issue given the importance of early SALT intervention. This absence of consistent practice might suggest that implementation of assessment processes is the issue here.</p>
<p>More recent changes in the assessment of speaking and listening through detailed fine grained assessment of national curriculum levels and the publication of Assessing Pupils Progress materials for speaking and listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659012450896">DCSF/PNS, 2010</xref>) could help in early identification, and in meeting the Bercow Report’s recommendations. Since SLCN is the most common childhood disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265659012450896">Law et al., 2000</xref>) teachers – the professionals who will have most interaction with children of school age – need to be trained first in the typical development of speech and language in order to identify atypical language development. They also need to have the tools available to begin to raise questions about a child’s developing speech and language. The tools developed should ideally not be onerous and should, where possible, integrate with other assessment strategies within schools. The training implications for ITT in typical and atypical development would be considerable to ensure that it was both manageable and meaningful to the students. The challenge is exacerbated by the fact that pre-service teachers would be working in schools where experienced teachers are concerned about their own knowledge of working with children with SLCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265659012450896">Dockrell and Lindsay, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>a Collaboration and multi-disciplinary working:</title>
<p>Recommendation 20 from the Bercow Report states that ‘professionals from across the children’s and young people’s workforce undertake pre-qualification training in collaborative and multidisciplinary working, alongside professionals from other backgrounds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>: 9.)</p>
<p>In principle the introduction of the Every Child Matters agenda in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659012450896">DfES, 2003</xref>), with its focus on joined-up working between different departments, together with changes in the health and education service, should have led to considerable developments in this area. Evidence to the Bercow Review suggested otherwise: ‘coherent strategies for children and young people using a joint commissioning framework, shared goals and integrated service delivery’ were described as rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>: 53). The current standards for ITT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0265659012450896">TDA, 2007</xref>) have strengthened collaborative working in detail and in scope, although not specifically in relation to training alongside other workforce members:</p>
<list id="list4-0265659012450896" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Q6: ‘Have a commitment to collaboration and cooperative working’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 15); links most closely to collaborative and multidisciplinary working.</p></list-item></list>
<p>This standard requires that trainee teachers understand the processes and issues related to working with other colleagues and are expected to develop skills to work collaboratively. There will be a huge variation in how these standards are enacted by pre-service trainees; some will be required to attend workshops on this theme, others to work practically on this standard whilst on teaching placement, and others to take part in self-study or directed tasks in the training centre or the school. There are also clear links from this Bercow Report recommendation with standard Q5 ‘recognize and respect the contribution that colleagues, parents and carers can make to the development and well-being of children and young people and to raising their levels of attainment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 15). Both standards 6 and 5 are underpinned by the teacher’s ability within Q4 to ‘Communicate effectively with children, young people, colleagues, parents and carers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 14). The important overarching skill for all three standards is the on-going development of trainees’ communication skills and to ensure that these are appropriate for the disparate audiences they will be working with.</p>
<p>The issue of training in pre-service multi-professional collaborative working requires careful management. Whilst working alongside teaching assistants (TAs) would not be difficult, the logistics of delivering an equitable experience for all pre-service teachers would be extremely challenging if the expectation related to other specific professionals such as SALTs. If the more ambitious aim was to focus on building working relationships between pre-service SALTs and pre-service teachers then the systemic barriers alone, such as timetabling, funding, competing agendas and communication, are likely to mirror those evident in serving teachers and SALTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659012450896">Baxter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265659012450896">McCartney, 1999</xref>). The Better Communication action plan on the implementation of the Bercow Review acknowledges these issues and states that ‘multi-agency training will be encouraged where it is practical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008d</xref>: 40).</p>

<sec id="section9-0265659012450896">
<title>b Understanding the needs of children with SLCN:</title>
<p>Recommendation 22 suggests that ‘the standards for Qualified Teacher Status ensure that students develop a better understanding of children and young people’s SLCN and of how to address those needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>: 9). Within the QTS standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0265659012450896">TDA, 2007</xref>) knowledge of children with SLCN includes knowing how support is provided and how it is coordinated with other provision. This recommendation can potentially be addressed through standard Q18 ‘understand how children and young people develop and that the progress and well-being of learners are affected by a range of developmental, social, religious, ethnic, cultural and linguistic influences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 34). Standard 18 includes the need to ‘understand the range of influences that have an impact on learning and well-being, and how any barriers to progress can be overcome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 34). Research evidence demonstrates that qualified teachers feel ill-prepared to work with children with SLCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265659012450896">Dockrell and Lindsay, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265659012450896">Mroz, 2006</xref>), and thus pre-service teachers are likely to find this standard very challenging as the expertise may not be available in their placement schools.</p>
<p>A further standard that might help to improve trainees knowledge of SLCN but that is no less demanding is Q19 ‘know how to make effective personalized provision for those […] who have special educational needs or disabilities, and how to take practical account of diversity and promote equality and inclusion in their teaching’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 35). Standard Q20 ‘Know and understand the roles of colleagues with specific responsibilities, including those with responsibility for learners with special educational needs and disabilities and other individual learning needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0265659012450896">TDA, 2009</xref>: 36) provides a potential context for working with children with SLCN. Standard 20 could also potentially act as a mediator between improving understanding of SLCN (Theme 3b) and developing collaborative working practices (Theme 3a). The overarching aim of comprehending SLCN, scrutinized via the standards, is for pre-service teachers to develop their knowledge of the developmental needs of the child and to find the best ways of ensuring that child can progress, working with and learning from whoever is appropriate to achieve that end.</p>

<title>III The implementation of the Bercow Report: The wider context and its interaction with Initial Teacher Training</title>
<p>This scrutiny of the standards for QTS in relation to the Bercow Report recommendations has considered how these standards might be used to better equip pre-service teachers to work with children who have SLCN. However, clearly these recommendations do not exist in a vacuum and the wider context surrounding the implementation may have an influence on how ITT is more able to engage with and be supportive of the key themes. These influences may be situated directly within the ITT institution or more widely in the school system where pre-service teachers are placed as part of their course.</p>
<p>A number of outcomes have directly followed from the Bercow Report, which have influenced the wider context in which pre-service teachers are trained in England. These include:</p>
<list id="list5-0265659012450896" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>the publication of ‘Better communication: An action plan to improve services for children and young people with SLCN’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008d</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the appointment of a Communication Champion for two years, 2009–11;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the creation of a Communication Council; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the introduction in 2011 of a national year of speech, language and communication, led by the Champion, to share effective strategies and leave meaningful long-term benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012450896">Gross, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The report ‘Two years on: final report of the communication champion for children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012450896">Gross, 2011</xref>) summarized key impacts and findings in the period following the Bercow Report to determine the extent to which the recommendations have been met and to indicate what further developments need to take place.</p>
<p>There are positive indicators within ITT that will have a direct bearing on the potential for pre-service teachers to address the Bercow Report recommendations. First, there is the continued emphasis on inclusion in the curriculum promoted by the standards for QTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0265659012450896">TDA, 2007</xref>) and the forthcoming standards for 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659012450896">DfE, 2011a</xref>). Within the forthcoming standards there is also a requirement for teachers to promote articulacy (which is as yet, however, not clearly defined). The inspection regime of HEIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265659012450896">OFSTED, 2008</xref>) mirrors the curriculum focus on inclusion, and this is further sustained in the consultation to the revised framework for inspection of HEIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265659012450896">OFSTED, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the schools where pre-service teachers are placed there are a number of potential developments that might be beneficial to furthering the aims of the Bercow Report. One example is the application of the wave model of intervention within the National Literacy Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265659012450896">DfEE, 1998</xref>) and National Numeracy Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659012450896">DfEE, 1999</xref>) which provides a graduated response to identifying and meeting any special educational needs (SEN) advocated by the SEN Code of Practice used in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659012450896">DfES, 2001</xref>). The model is recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012450896">Gross (2011)</xref> and operates as follows for children with SLCN:</p>
<list id="list6-0265659012450896" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Wave 1 provides classroom and subject teaching that promotes all children’s communication skills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wave 2 provides targeted small group interventions from trained teaching assistants for children with language delay.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wave 3 ensures effective partnership with specialists that might include having a very highly trained teaching assistant able to work under the direction of a speech and language therapist to implement intervention programmes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An additional positive development is the revised OFSTED framework for school inspection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0265659012450896">OFSTED, 2012</xref>), which includes a new judgement on ‘how well teaching enables pupils to develop skills in reading, writing, <italic>communication</italic> and mathematics’ (p. 15) and ‘how well pupils develop a range of skills, including reading, writing, <italic>communication</italic> and mathematical skills, and how well they apply these across the curriculum’ (p. 14; emphasis added). The inspection framework also ensures a focus on different groups of pupils including those with special educational needs and disabilities and ‘how well gaps are narrowing between different groups of pupils in the school and compared to all pupils nationally’ (p. 14). This emphasis ensures that teachers will be required to make appropriate provision for all pupils with SEN to make enhanced progress. Within education there is continued attention on raising standards for all pupils with special reference to literacy, particularly reading. This emphasis on reading, coupled with output from the Cambridge Primary Review, which acknowledges that ‘language development, along with perceptual and spatial development, underpins children’s progress in reading’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265659012450896">Goswami and Bryant, 2010</xref>: 97), affords possibilities to promote the Bercow Report recommendations alongside wider priorities in education. The review of the National Curriculum for England could also act as a major influence when this is introduced in 2014 as it reiterates that speech and language should play a key role across the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659012450896">DfE, 2011b</xref>). This view echoes the expectations of the Bercow Report.</p>
<p>There are also potentially positive influences on schools through the specific events targeted at teachers from the national year of speech, language and communication, e.g. the <italic>Hello campaign</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659012450896">The Communication Trust, 2011a</xref>). Key outcomes that may impact indirectly on pre-service teachers include the receipt by all primary and secondary schools in England of posters detailing the ages and stages of typical children’s language development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659012450896">The Communication Trust, 2011b</xref>) and the production of a special supplement on communication and language for the Times Educational Supplement (the UK-based newspaper written for teachers) in 2011. Those resources and further materials are now all available to teachers via The Communication Trust website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thecommunicationtrust.org.uk">http://www.thecommunicationtrust.org.uk</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Thus, there are factors that may align to support the implementation of the Bercow Report recommendations. However, a number of issues that impact both on ITT directly within HEI and the placement of pre-service teachers in schools continue to make full implementation problematic. A key factor is the absence of mandatory training in working with children with SLCN, which would allow opportunities to share reflections with colleagues within and beyond the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265659012450896">Mroz, 2006</xref>). So whilst materials are available on SLCN and on the development of language to support training in these issues (such as the Inclusion development programme for primary and secondary: dyslexia, speech, language and communication needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265659012450896">DCSF/TDA, 2010</xref>), this is difficult to achieve in practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012450896">Gross (2011)</xref> identifies the importance of ‘sustained professional development that changes adults’ interactions with children and helps them to provide communication – supportive environments’ (p. 7). However, evidence from research into classroom talk highlights how resistant to change interaction patterns in the classroom are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659012450896">Alexander, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659012450896">Galton et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>A further potential threat to meeting the needs of children with SLCN might be the Government’s drive to expand school-based ITT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265659012450896">DfE, 2011c</xref>). This approach implies a more acquisition view of learning, reported and critiqued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659012450896">Ellis (2010)</xref>. This contrasts with the model of teacher development evolved in HEIs, which is based on reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0265659012450896">Schon, 1983</xref>), and enquiry into one’s own practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0265659012450896">Stenhouse, 1975</xref>). The more reflective theoretical stance potentially allows pre-service teachers to consider a breadth of factors and scenarios alongside a range of possible resolutions, thus preparing them for the complexities of their future career. An additional contextual feature that may hinder the response to the Bercow Report recommendations includes the future expansion of free schools and academies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265659012450896">DfE, 2011c</xref>). These schools are not under the jurisdiction of the Local Authority, thus again raising questions about who is responsible for meeting the needs of children with SLCN within them.</p>
<p>A further issue that militates against the successful integration of the Bercow Report recommendations relates to the complexity of its demands. These differ significantly from the discrete, yet universally-applied, demands for the teaching of SSP for early reading. In contrast, the Bercow Report proposals are both more diffuse (relating to all teaching and learning experiences) and more marginalized: the expectations relate to children with SLCN who constitute between 5.95% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265659012450896">Law et al., 2000</xref>) and 13% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265659012450896">Klee et al., 2000</xref>) of the school population. Thus, whilst inclusion is a focus within education and there is a particular emphasis on narrowing the gap between the most and least able pupils these factors may still not translate into particular actions for children with SLCN. Furthermore, whilst there are proposals to increase the emphasis on speech and language in the revised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659012450896">DfE, 2011b</xref>) the implementation of this new curriculum has been postponed from 2012 to 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265659012450896">DfE, 2012</xref>). Thus, despite the introduction of an articulacy standard for QTS and the school inspection focus on communication, the delay in curriculum reform may significantly lessen the impact of the other changes.</p>
<p>However, perhaps the biggest threat to meeting the Bercow Report recommendations for pre-service teachers is the economic climate in England. Budget cuts to councils who provide services to schools via the Local Authority and the removal of inflation-proof budgets to schools will mean a real reduction in school income. These cuts have also had an impact on the employment of SALTs and of specialist advisory teaching services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012450896">Gross, 2011</xref>). In addition from 2012 a further devolved school budget allows schools to determine when and whether to purchase, for example, the expertise of educational psychologists who are often directly involved in the identification of, and support for, children with SLCN. This potential current and future loss of expertise will necessarily impact on how teachers can be provided with detailed knowledge of the difficulties children with speech language and communication needs face and the factors that may impact on their learning. The loss may well further weaken the consistency of provision for children with SLCN. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659012450896">Gross (2011)</xref> advocated the wave model for intervention and also recognized how few schools adopt this. She further recommended schools use their resources to meet the needs of children with SLCN. As the pressure on resources intensifies neither scenario is likely to be realized consistently. A final impact of reduced resources in schools may directly influence how HEIs enable pre-service teachers to successfully meet professional standards in multi-professional working. An example would be the loss of teaching assistants who were employed to carry out specific programmes of work provided by SALTs.</p>
<p>Thus, whilst it is recognized that addressing the needs of pupils with SEN, including SLCN, is central to school improvement, key obstacles remain. These can be summarized as the availability of appropriate expertise and the resources required to support the children’s workforce and young people themselves. Both of these central factors will also specifically impact on the extent to which the standards for QTS can be harnessed in order for pre-service teachers to fulfil the recommendations of the Bercow Report.</p>

<title>IV Conclusions</title>
<p>The focus of this article has been on the initial training of teachers in England and the potential implementation of a specific set of recommendations within the Bercow Report. It does, however, have implications for pre-service teachers globally whenever new policy initiatives are formulated; the subsequent success of implementation is contingent on the interactions between policy makers, education institutions and other relevant agencies. The extent to which the aims of the Bercow Report are met will depend on the support it receives now, and in the future, in ensuring that policy becomes practice. The preparation of pre-service teachers through the standards for QTS and the interaction of the standards with the Bercow Report recommendations are crucial to the success of children with SLCN. Whilst there is possible alignment between the recommendations and the QTS standards, the degree to which this is realized will be determined by the potential synergies between various policies in curriculum, assessment and inspection processes and other factors such as the prevailing economic climate.</p>
<p>Despite the potential discussed, there is currently insufficient evidence that the necessary synergies are in place to ensure that the Bercow Report recommendations can be supported by harnessing the standards for QTS. The difficulties identified include the diffuse nature of the task and the need for direct and coordinated links between assessment, the curriculum in HEIs and schools, appropriate, mandatory training and the associated resources to access this so as to ensure that all of the workforce understand and can act on the recommendations.</p>
<p>We know that childhood language delay is the most common disability at primary age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265659012450896">Law et al., 2000</xref>), and we know that language is central for learning for all pupils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659012450896">Barnes, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659012450896">Galton et al., 1980</xref>). It is the marrying of these two concepts that needs to be fully understood and acted upon. All children could benefit from the recommendations, and for children with SLCN the Bercow Report offers ‘an unbreakable determination to seize the opportunity that this review offers to help some of our most vulnerable children and young people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659012450896">DCSF, 2008a</xref>: 64).</p>
