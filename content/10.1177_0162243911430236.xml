Researchers have documented the pervasiveness of new technologies, but neither demonstrate how technological change is experienced by faculty nor collect data that permit assessment of consequences for professional control. Drawing on a sample of interviews with forty-two professors at three research-intensive universities, this research makes two contributions to existing research. First, in contrast to existing depictions of technological change in higher education, the findings reveals that academics perceive instructional technologies to have limited value in enhancing education and that technology use is rarely motivated by pedagogical innovation. Second, the study suggests that a relationship between technological change and “unbundling” of the academic role may be overstated. These data indicate that technological change threatens professional autonomy through exclusion from decision-making processes, increased workloads, and delimited teaching and research roles.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>professoriate</kwd><kwd>technological change</kwd><kwd>unbundling</kwd><kwd>higher education</kwd><kwd>professions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Over the past two decades, scholars have shown an increased interest in the relationship between technological change and the social organization of academic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911430236">Rhoades 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243911430236">Gumport and Chun 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162243911430236">Rhoades and Maitland 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911430236">Trow 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911430236">Persell 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911430236">Tomlinson-Keasey 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911430236">Smith and Rhoades 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243911430236">Lin and Ha 2009</xref>). In particular, scholars have questioned the extent to which adoption of information-based instructional technologies may lead to “unbundling” or the use of technology to either separate teaching from research or divide the teaching function into constituent parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911430236">Schuster and Finkelstein 2006</xref>). It is argued that bureaucratic implementation of technology into academic work will redraw the boundaries of professional control, either as a result of managerial attempts to control the work of faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911430236">Rhoades 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911430236">Smith and Rhoades 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162243911430236">Hanson 2008</xref>) or the spread of rational organization to academic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911430236">Persell 2002</xref>). In short, scholars hypothesize that technology will erode professional control.</p><p>Existing evidence, however, says more about the regularity of technology use than what technological change means for academic work or how it is experienced. Moreover, we possess little knowledge of faculty perceptions of new instructional technologies, which is crucial to understanding whether implementation could contribute to the erosion of professional control. Most surveys have focused on the use of e-mail and the Internet in instructional activities and show that such practices are now standard among most US faculty (US Department of Education 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162243911430236">Green 2002</xref>). In addition, scholars and journalists have used illustrative cases of instructional technologies such as globally linked classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911430236">Tomlinson-Keasey 2002</xref>), hand-crafted courseware (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911430236">Trow 1997</xref>), and “virtual” teaching contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911430236">Duderstadt, Atkins, and Houweling 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243911430236">Foster 2007</xref>) to demonstrate curricular possibilities of new technologies. We thus know much about the pervasiveness of technology and its curricular potential, but we know little about what these dynamics mean for academic work and the configuration of the academic role. What remains to be determined is the extent to which technological change transforms the nature and meanings of academic work and whether it increases faculty workloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911430236">Schuster and Finkelstein 2006</xref>).</p><p>The goal of this article is to provide an understanding of technological change from the perspective of the professoriate. The study seeks to make two contributions. First, whereas empirical work in this literature primarily describes patterns of technology use quantitatively, this article utilizes qualitative analysis to demonstrate motivations commonly underlying these patterns. Second, the article seeks to provide a more complete account of the consequences of technological change for academic work than can be found by focusing exclusively on unbundling.</p><p>The analysis focuses on three questions: How do professors perceive instructional technologies? How do they perceive administrative initiatives to encourage the adoption of instructional technologies? What work outcomes do professors experience when they employ technology in their work? The answers to these questions, I argue, provide an understanding of the consequences of technological change based on the individuals who are subject to it. To address the questions, I draw upon interviews with forty-two professors at three research-intensive universities. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In the first section, I review existing arguments and provide the rationale for the three research questions specified above. The second section describes the method, design, and sample of the study. In the third section, I turn to the empirical analysis of the research questions. In the closing section, I draw on these findings to consider the trend toward incorporation of technology into the teaching role and its implications for professional control.</p><sec id="section1-0162243911430236"><title>Theoretic Background</title><p>Characterizations of why colleges and universities have engaged in initiatives to adopt instructional technologies commonly emphasize the notion of “pressures” derived from a disjuncture between changes in the institutional environment of higher education and traditional methods of instruction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911430236">Tomlinson-Keasey (2002</xref>), for example, examines factors such as the emergence of a knowledge-based society, population increases, rising education costs, and the needs to meet new demands such as lifelong learning that “[compel] us toward technological solutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162243911430236">Tomlinson-Keasey 2002</xref>, 134). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162243911430236">Gumport and Chun (1999</xref>) argue that because universities are susceptible to educational policy pressures and institutional imperatives for legitimacy, colleges and universities turn to technologies to satisfy demands to improve the efficiency, access, and quality of education. According to these arguments, stakeholders in the institutional environment of higher education view traditional modes of instruction as impractical, inadequate, or illegitimate.</p><p>Sensitive to these dynamics, researchers have called for studies of the implications of technological change in instruction for academic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911430236">Schuster and Finkelstein 2006</xref>). The dominant hypothesis is that incorporation of technology into the academic role will erode professional control through “unbundling” as members of other occupations (e.g., Web-designers, assessment specialists) perform aspects of the work of professors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162243911430236">Paulson 2002</xref>). Scholars have arrived at this proposition by different theoretic avenues. Drawing on Weberian thought, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162243911430236">Persell (2002</xref>) argues that technologies are part of a profit maximization rationality that will challenge professional expertise and delimit the scope of academic work. From a neo-Marxist perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911430236">Smith and Rhoades (2006</xref>) argue that fully unbundled modes of instruction constitute a “virtual assembly line” in which academics’ autonomy, academic freedom, and claims to the products of their labor are restricted by administrative efforts to control the conditions of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911430236">Smith and Rhoades 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite their theoretic merit, these arguments are incomplete absent an understanding of professors’ perceptions of new technologies. For instance, it is difficult to conclude that technology erodes professional control if professors perceive new technologies as effective. Similarly, it is difficult to conclude that technologies enhance instruction if professors adopt tools for reasons unrelated to these goals. In short, existing approaches do not sufficiently consider the extent to which professional judgments about technology influence technological change. Nor have quantitative studies sufficiently explained technology adoption from the perspective of the individuals who would use such tools.</p><p>We must therefore address the following question: how do university professors perceive instructional technologies? A well-established theoretic precedent illustrates the importance of analyzing workers’ perceptions of technology to understanding implications for work, beginning at least with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162243911430236">Simon’s (1965)</xref> encouragement for organizational scholars to understand technology in organizations symbolically. Indeed, research demonstrates that professional workers’ beliefs about their work are a central contingency in the process of technological change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911430236">Hiddinga and Plume 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162243911430236">Perrin 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162243911430236">Novek 2002</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162243911430236">Hiddinga and Plume (1992</xref>) indicate, the implementation of any technology entails a process of asking how much more effective a new technique is. If new technologies contribute to the erosion of professional control, a key indicator of this potential would be that professors perceive them as illegitimate or ineffective, as implementation under these circumstances would be indicative of the loss of control over conditions of work.</p><p>A second, and related, question also merits our attention: how do professors perceive administrative initiatives to encourage the adoption of instructional technologies? Research suggests that the incorporation of technology into work is motivated by managers’ interest in: separation of conception and execution of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162243911430236">Braverman 1974</xref>); replacement of skilled labor with tools that permit lower-skilled workers to perform craft-like work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162243911430236">Marx 1906</xref>); deskilling of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162243911430236">Noble 1979</xref>); and reduction of the collective power of workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162243911430236">Bennett 1977</xref>). Faculty members’ perceptions of administrative motives and their own ability to participate in decision-making processes related to instructional technologies therefore provide an important measure of conflict between professional and bureaucratic motives. They indicate the ways in which professors perceive administrations as enabling or constraining their ability to fulfill the academic role. Such perceptions are one-sided definitions of the faculty–administration relationship, but these views are nevertheless consequential, for individuals act on beliefs, not necessarily facts.</p><p>Some evidence suggests that administrations do draw upon the availability of technology to control the organization of academic work. Examining distance education and community colleges, Rhoades and colleagues analyzed faculty contracts and collective bargaining agreements and show that technology provides a means by which university administrators increase part-time faculty, limit full-time faculty, and increase the number of technical personnel in the instructional division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911430236">Rhoades 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162243911430236">Rhoades and Slaughter 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911430236">Smith and Rhoades 2006</xref>). There is thus some support for the argument that technology is a tool by which university administrations control the conditions of academic work, but we do not fully understand this process beyond the context of community colleges. Nor do we understand how faculty members’ perceptions of administrative motives influence their own technology use.</p><p>Finally, we must ask what work outcomes do professors experience when they employ technology in their work? Survey data indicate that the use of instructional technology is now widespread. The National Study of Postsecondary Faculty surveys conducted in 1999 and 2003 showed that in both years, approximately 70 percent of faculty used e-mail to communicate with students, whereas about 40 percent reported used course Web sites for class activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162243911430236">US Department of Education 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162243911430236">2005</xref>). Beyond these and other quantitative studies, however, we possess limited knowledge of its impact on academic work. Scholars postulate technology will unbundle the academic role, but only one study of a community college offers support for this argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162243911430236">Smith and Rhoades 2006</xref>). Moreover, we know little of the other potential work outcomes, such as increased workloads, requirements for the development of new skills, or informal sanctions that result from the adoption of instructional tools. We must therefore look more closely at the context of work as it is experienced and seen through the eyes of those exposed to pressures for technological change.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0162243911430236"><title>Data and Method</title><p>The data I used to address these questions are a subset of a broader study of information-based technologies in academe. I analyzed data from interviews with forty-two professors selected from anthropology, biology, chemistry, and chemical engineering departments at one private and two public doctoral research-intensive universities in the United States. The primary requirement by which universities were selected was evidence of organizational commitment to technology use. At one public university, the mission statement framed instructional technologies as key ingredients of a superior university, a force transforming education, and more sophisticated than prior approaches to instruction. The “Office of Technology” at the other public university had as its goals the creation of a tech-intensive learning environment, the creation of standards for classroom technology, and increased faculty attendance at forums showcasing learning technologies. Although official statements of the private university did not provide similar rhetorical overtures, its central research emphasis on science, technology, and engineering suggested a technology-intensive environment that was later confirmed in interviews. I also delimited the sample to professors at research universities to be able to assess the influence of an orientation to research on technology adoption and the potential for unbundling of teaching and research roles.</p><p>The selection of academic fields was motivated by exploratory research that identified field-specific on-line simulations and pedagogical resources in chemistry, biology, and chemical engineering. I wanted to optimize the potential for inclusion of participants who employ innovative teaching strategies. I thus focused on fields in which innovative instructional technologies were available. Although anthropology uses IT products, it has not been as technologically intensive as the other fields and thus was selected as a potential basis of comparison.</p><p>The study employed nonprobability sampling to identify “typical” technology use. Department heads were contacted to identify faculty known to employ instructional technologies. This approach risked selecting only professors with favorable views of technology, but the findings will show that the technique avoided positive bias. Scholars agreed to participate after being contacted by e-mail. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162243911430236">Table 1</xref> presents the resulting sample by university, rank, field, and gender.</p><table-wrap id="table1-0162243911430236" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Sample Composition, by University, Rank, Field, and Gender.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table1-0162243911430236" xlink:href="10.1177_0162243911430236-table1.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th>University</th><th/><th>Rank</th><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Public I</td><td>16</td><td>Full</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td> Public II</td><td>20</td><td>Associate</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td> Private I</td><td>7</td><td>Assistant</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td/><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Field</td><td/><td>Gender</td><td/></tr><tr><td> Anthropology</td><td>15</td><td>Male</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td> Biology</td><td>10</td><td>Female</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td> Chemistry</td><td>9</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> Chemical Engineering</td><td>9</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The analysis for this research is derived from faculty members’ responses to questions about the extent and nature of use of instructional technology, perceptions of organizational support, and incentives and rewards. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed and averaged one hour. I employed inductive analysis to code the data. My goal was not to prove or disprove theories of scholars whose work has influenced mine, but I was sensitive to concepts stressed in the literature. Ultimately, I sought to anchor the analysis around the themes stressed most by participants. Next, I analyzed the broader theoretical implications of the coded data and sorted findings comparatively to assess central tendencies by rank, institutional type, field, and gender. No systematic distinctions were evident along these dimensions. I consider this finding in the discussion.</p><p>The operational definition of technology employed in this research is derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162243911430236">Tornatzky and Fleischer (1990</xref>, 11), who define it as “knowledge-derived tools, artifacts, and devices by which people extend and interact with their environment.” I delimit the focus of this article to instructional technologies because debates have overwhelmingly focused on the integration of information-based technologies and instructional tasks. Instructional technologies include but are not limited to chalk, audio/video systems, laboratory equipment, computers, personal response systems, the Internet and course Web sites, software (e.g., modeling and analysis programs, and resources that accompany textbooks), and distance learning. The technologies analyzed in this article are limited to those utilized by participants.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162243911430236">2</xref> presents descriptive characteristics of participants’ use of instructional technologies. Because participants were not surveyed about specific tools, it is possible these measures underestimate actual usage. This is unlikely because interviews commenced with a description of the study’s focus on instructional technology, followed by a direct question on the types of technologies employed. A striking characteristic is the limited extent to which scholars employ instructional tools, in light of a sampling strategy that identified known users of instructional technologies. That the modal rate of usage for all tools aside from PowerPoint falls near or beneath 25 percent of the sample portrays a picture of technology use that starkly contrasts characterizations of the technology-intensive university one finds in much of the literature. To be sure, many of these technologies can be substitutes for one another. For example, a professor may use e-reserves or a self-designed Web site in lieu of course management software. Examining such overlaps, I found that of the eleven professors who utilize course management software, five also used e-reserves. Only two of the eleven professors had Web sites set up apart from on-line aspects of the course management software.</p><table-wrap id="table2-0162243911430236" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Instructional Tools Employed, by Field.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table2-0162243911430236" xlink:href="10.1177_0162243911430236-table2.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th/><th>Anthropology (%)</th><th>Biology (%)</th><th>Chemistry (%)</th><th>Chemical Engineering (%)</th><th>Total (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of Professors</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>PowerPoint</td><td>73.3</td><td>30.0</td><td>44.5</td><td>25.0</td><td>47.7</td></tr><tr><td>Course management software</td><td>30.0</td><td>50.0</td><td>11.1</td><td>12.5</td><td>26.2</td></tr><tr><td>E-reserves</td><td>20.0</td><td>20.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>25.0</td><td>19.1</td></tr><tr><td>Field-specific software</td><td>6.7</td><td>10.0</td><td>55.6</td><td>25.5</td><td>19.1</td></tr><tr><td>Class Web site</td><td>20.0</td><td>30.0</td><td>11.1</td><td>50.0</td><td>19.0</td></tr><tr><td>Personal response system</td><td>0.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>33.3</td><td>12.5</td><td>12.0</td></tr><tr><td>Class Listserv</td><td>20.0</td><td>10.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>7.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Four of the scholars interviewed for this study did employ innovative uses of technology in instruction, including on-line interactive simulations, digitized laboratory measurement systems, computerized tests, and personal response systems to measure variation in student achievement. More moderate use of technology was found among chemists who teach upper-division undergraduate classes, who use field-specific analytic software, as it is integral to socialization in that field. The most common use of technology is PowerPoint, which professors noted as helpful for the visualization of content, such as cell structure in biology, artifacts in anthropology, and the display of dangerous experiments in chemistry. Whereas <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162243911430236">Table 2</xref> characterizes the extent to which participants employ technologies, to understand the meaning of technological change for academic work we must turn to professors’ perceptions of technology, administrative motives, and work outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0162243911430236"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="section4-0162243911430236"><title>Faculty Perceptions of Instructional Technologies</title><p>Faculty members are divided about the legitimacy of instructional technology. When asked about the factors motivating technology use, professors commonly cited the gains derived from enhanced visualization of content described above. Aside from this rationale, few responses suggested that employment of instructional technology in one’s work is derived from the knowledge base of one’s field or a claim to innovative pedagogy. Rather, as evidence presented in this section will show, faculty who use instructional technologies often do so for reasons of limited or no relation to pedagogy.</p><p>As scholars have documented the call for the professoriate to employ technologically intense forms of instruction, it is illustrative to draw upon a specific case to highlight the divergence in views of the legitimacy of doing so. In <italic>Higher Education in the Digital Age</italic>, the authors depict “a course in archaeology augmented by virtual reality tours of various excavation sites around the world” to argue for education that is not “restricted” by face-to-face contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911430236">Duderstadt, Atkins, and Houweling 2002</xref>, 59). This scenario mirrors other examples that advocate instructional technologies but diverges from the views of study participants. For example, when asked about his awareness of instructional technologies in his field, an anthropologist commented:<disp-quote><p>Our field of archaeology is subject to a lot of gimmicky tech. For example, three-dimensional models of ancient houses that you can tour virtually like a computer game. It is kind of fun if you're at a middle school level and it could be useful for public education, but it has very little value. Well-trained people are what we thrive on. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In contrast to arguments that universities should adopt instructional technologies to be innovative or to supplement face-to-face instruction, study participants perceive such tools as lacking an obvious function or value. Instead, they emphasize the centrality of training as the basis for enhancement of instruction. The following quotes are representative of professors’ skepticism of the gains derived from instructional technologies:<disp-quote><p>I went to [a course management software workshop] and came away with the idea that the greatest thing you could do with that is put your syllabus on the web and that’s an awful lot of technology to hand the students a piece of paper at the start of the semester and say keep track of it. (Chemist)</p><p>What are the gains for students by bringing IT into the class? There isn’t any. You could teach all of chemistry with a whiteboard. I really don’t think you need IT or anything beyond a pencil and a paper. (Chemist)</p><p>We don’t have any virtual things because we don’t think it’s the best way to teach them. It’s unreal. It’s like watching television. To learn on a virtual basis is not the same as actually working on the real stuff… [The best way] is the actual interaction with the material. (Biologist)</p></disp-quote>Not only did professors perceive new technologies as of limited value, many viewed technologically rich instruction as detrimental to student learning. They believe that students view course management software, presentation software, and the Internet as substitutes for learning. Technology as a substitute takes two forms. The most common view is that technology-rich classes relieve students of the need to attend:<disp-quote><p>From the student perspective, the students love having all the PowerPoints and all the notes and stuff like that [online]. They can sleep in class as far as they’re concerned. It’s sorta like sperm donation … who needs you anymore? (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Professors also believe technology presents a problem for learning when students perceive it as a substitute for understanding the fundamental components of analysis. This sentiment emerged among professors who teach upper-division undergraduate classes where information-based technologies are commonly used for analytic purposes:<disp-quote><p>[Students] want to have the machine do the thinking for them. They don’t want to have to process it—‘oh give me the software and the software will give me the answer’—without understanding what the problem is. We’re continually fighting that issue. It’s, ‘teach me the package and that will do my homework for me’. No. (Chemist)</p><p>Technology has a problem. The slide rules we used to use were wonderful because they gave an intuitive understanding of what you’re trying to do. The calculators spit out numbers and there’s an incredible loss of intuitive understanding about what you’re doing … That problem is really magnified when you get to computers. You have to really know what’s going on and to make sure you don’t lose an intuitive understanding. (Biologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>According to one participant, this problem emerges from the fact that faculty primarily use computers to synthesize solutions to problems, whereas students relate to computers differently. As one anthropologist put it, students are “weaned on MTV, Nintendo, and Gameboy.”</p><p>Professors reject most instructional technologies on the basis that such tools are perceived as ineffective. This suggests that bureaucratic efforts to implement new technologies could undermine the conditions of work that faculty seek to maintain, thereby threatening professional control. Coercion to adopt a tool one regards as illegitimate contradicts the notion of autonomy. If faculty were enthusiastic about the use of technology in teaching, by contrast, there would be no contest for control over this aspect of work.</p><p>Faculty motivations to adopt instructional tools are noteworthy specifically because they do not frame their usage as motivated by pedagogy. Some professors, in contrast to those who view students’ prior socialization to technology as problematic, claimed it was the reason they employ instructional technologies in their work:<disp-quote><p>You can’t expect to keep kids attention by standing there talking to them any longer. It just doesn’t work. You have to keep bombarding them with visual material even it’s only peripherally related. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>In this pattern, technology is employed to attract student attention. The perception is that students will disengage if instruction lacks entertainment value. This belief holds true both in the use of common technologies (e.g., PowerPoint) and more innovative tools such as personal response systems, which allow professors to poll students in the classroom. Two professors discuss their motivation for experimenting with these systems:<disp-quote><p>We decided to try it out on one of our big lectures … to try to keep the students awake. (Chemical Engineer)</p><p>They’re undergraduates—you need to attract their attention before you can teach them anything. In my mind that’s the name of the game … With video game culture or anything, you know, I think that will get ‘em involved, you know, a little remote control. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>If the reason for instructional technologies were pedagogical, we might assume professors employ tools such as personal response systems to assess student learning in contexts such as large classes that challenge measurement of student progress. Adoption of these tools as a ploy to attract attention, however, is inconsistent with the characterizations of superior learning framed in university mission statements and by advocates of technological change.</p><p>These accounts suggest that instructional technology is not motivated by expertise. Academics perceive new technologies as of limited or no functional relevance to instruction, which suggests that initiatives for professors to adopt instructional technologies contradict professional values. When technology is employed in instruction, the objectives are typically enhanced visualization or attracting student attention. Whereas using technology to enhance visualization of educational content is consistent with the notion of digitally enhanced higher education, the use of technology to attract students’ interest strongly departs from this image. Such divergences in views of technology are also suggested by professors’ perceptions of administrative technology initiatives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section5-0162243911430236"><title>Perceptions of Administration</title><p>At each of the universities, technology is centrally managed under a chief information officer who oversees organizational units connected to various missions, including instruction. Departments either have their own information technology staff worker or access to workers dedicated to their school or college within the university. The responsibilities of these workers were not directly related to instruction and focused more on hardware and software maintenance. Professors invariably expressed positive views of these workers, but their views of administration were much less favorable. Although faculty–administrator relationships clearly vary (Del <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162243911430236">Favero and Bray 2010</xref>), professors referenced the administration in general rather than specifying individuals in their accounts.</p><p>Administrations have greater influence than the professoriate over instructional technologies. To be sure, professors typically have access to computers, software and information-based resources that accompany textbooks (such as packaged lecture materials or Web sites). Nevertheless, technological infrastructure decisions related to what hardware and software is purchased and where they are installed are the purview of university administrations. For example, at one of the public universities, professors noted difficulty employing basic tools such as the Internet or PowerPoint across different sections of a course due to inconsistent technology platforms across classrooms. Moreover, academics’ abilities to acquire costly technologies are limited to competition-based internal funding awards that are evaluated according to criteria of relevance to priorities of the university, such as the number of students who benefit. Professors therefore exercise partial but not complete discretion over instructional tools and the conditions of their use.</p><p>Professors believe that administrative motivations to employ instructional technologies may be driven by marketing and economies of scale. The following excerpts, for example, are representative of perceptions that cast administrative technology initiatives as ornamental:<disp-quote><p>Our previous dean was very much in favor of all this IT and bringing all this technology in the classroom and sometimes I think it’s just technology for technology’s sake. Just to say … we have technology in the classroom.… I’ve never seen anything that is actually good for the students. (Chemist)</p><p>They think that you can attract more students by having all this ‘razzle-dazzle’ setup because it’s modern … it’s cutting edge teaching. (Anthropologist)</p><p>We get a very clear sense as faculty by just the number of activities, workshops, special sessions, other things that we’re continually getting memos about, that we should be, you know, if you’re not there, you haven’t gotten <italic>there</italic> yet. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote>As far as such faculty are concerned, “there” constitutes a symbolic destination to which administrations attempt to take their faculty and their institutions, where “razzle-dazzle” technology becomes a prop in a dramatic enactment of the socially constructed notion that legitimate universities are on the “cutting edge” of technology. The push for technologically intensive instruction is part of a ceremonial myth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162243911430236">Meyer and Rowan 1977</xref>) that communicates legitimacy to external audiences, such as parents, students, and prospective employers of university graduates. To the extent that this perception represents the view of university administrations, it points to managerial and professional conflict, as the two groups disagree about the appropriate role of technology in instruction.</p><p>Professors also perceive that administrations use technology to increase economies of scale. The belief is that initiatives to implement instructional technologies are motivated by a desire to teach more students with fewer professors, ultimately increasing the workload of individual professors. An anthropologist explains:<disp-quote><p>What they’re asking you to do is what American business is asking: self-exploitation. You’re being told that you have to shoulder a larger and larger share of the burden and here’s some technology that will help you do it. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>A boundary is drawn between the professional and the proletariat, a symbolic divide between the instructional techniques derived from the knowledge base of one’s field versus technology use to rationalize or industrialize the teaching process to increase revenue. The same anthropologist continues:<disp-quote><p>I’ve been very disturbed at the way this university has tried to ram these technologies down our throats. My belief is that we should have a wide range of choices for teaching technologies, but what goes on here is the higher administration has decided what’s best for us in a very paternalistic fashion. I’ve become hardened in my resistance to these attempts to impose the adoption of technologies. And even though I once might have been more receptive to some of them, I’m now saying no, I’m not going to do it. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Even in instances in which members of the faculty are interested in using instructional technologies, perceptions of administrative motives or feelings of exclusion from decision-making processes related to instructional technology can lead to eschewal of technology. Moreover, this pattern suggests that a key means by which a university may draw upon technology to control conditions of faculty work is indirect, vis-à-vis class size.</p><p>Participants more commonly expressed unawareness or disinterest in decisions about instructional technologies; perhaps, because they perceive instructional technology as illegitimate. Nevertheless, interview data illustrated a lack of coordination between administrations and professors as to if and how technology should be implemented. As one anthropologist noted:<disp-quote><p>Nobody from the university has ever come to the department to talk about [instructional technologies]. Things just appear in the classroom and I don’t recall us discussing it as a department. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Whereas most participants in the study did not indicate an interest or opportunity to contribute to the implementation of technology in the classroom, there was no indication at any of the universities of an organizational policy stipulating the use instructional tools. Even in the absence of such policies, administrations are able to create contexts that foster technology use. This finding figured prominently in the narratives of faculty members who teach large lower-division undergraduate courses:<disp-quote><p>I teach a huge intro class, it’s kind of a circus, actually. Last semester there were 305 students in that class which is really a lot. I feel like if I don’t use PowerPoint all the time, you know the screen is only this big. The chalkboard, there’s no possible way to write anything that they can see. (Anthropologist)</p><p>What student response system we use isn’t important, it’s the interaction of the students that’s key and how the heck you do that when you have 350 students sitting in front of you. (Chemist)</p><p>But still [despite the technology], the biggest problem is we have more students than I wish we had. I think that [the technology] is working. I just wish I was doing it with 100 students instead of 700 each fall. (Biologist)</p></disp-quote>In this context, the motivation to employ technology is driven by the need to manage logistics of instruction, not by innovative pedagogy. Professors turn to technologies to cope with large enrollments that limit interaction between faculty and students. By creating technology-rich classrooms and expanded enrollments, administrations subtly coerce the adoption of instructional technology without an organizational policy that stipulates its use.</p><p>Again we find a departure from an implementation of technology rooted in professional expertise. Faculty are skeptical of or reject their administrations’ motives in implementing instructional technologies, they perceive themselves as excluded from decisions related to technology, or they are uninterested in influencing technological change. Even if such beliefs are misguided, they result in behavior that rejects the use of instructional technologies or implements the new tools for reasons unrelated to innovative instruction.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0162243911430236"><title>Outcomes of Adopting Technology into Instruction</title><p>These data provide limited support for the unbundling hypothesis. Two departments in the study established teaching track positions in which promotion and tenure are awarded on the basis of teaching achievements and pedagogical research. Faculty members who occupy these roles rely upon instructional technologies to collect data that permit research on student learning. A chemist, for example, collects data using laboratory software to understand how lab partners influence student achievement. This pattern suggests that unbundling is not limited to the division of research from teaching or the fragmentation of components of instructional work. Unbundling also entails the delimitation of the scope of one’s research to analysis of pedagogy.</p><p>The biologist and chemists who occupied teaching track positions offered different accounts of their career. The biologist rejected the notion that the teaching track is a lower status career path. For her, it is simply “an alternative.” The chemists had a more negative outlook:<disp-quote><p>Those who are in chemical education are looked down upon … by those who do hard core research. There is a hierarchy. We’re beneath them somehow. You could talk to most chemical educators across the country and it’s going to be that way. The hard core research faculty see you as something the department needs to train and teach all these undergrads, but “as long as I don’t have to go in there and teach and I can do my research, fine.” (Chemist)</p><p>I think in terms of promotion it’s probably held me back … because it’s too controversial … It’s not the way it’s supposed to be done.</p><p>What is the way it’s supposed to be done?</p><p>On a chalkboard and with paper tests. (Chemist)</p></disp-quote>Despite the establishment of a reward system that creates incentives to use technology innovatively in instruction and research on teaching within a field, scholars who perform these roles perceive themselves as being denied recognition for their accomplishments. The perception of being looked down upon by one’s peers for using instructional technology, however, is not limited to individuals on the teaching track, it also emerged among faculty with regular appointments who use instructional tools.</p><p>The most systematic finding pertaining to outcomes of technology adoption is derived from questions participants were asked concerning incentives and rewards for using various forms of technology in the classroom. Because the reward system at these universities is principally shaped by research productivity, faculty view the workload that accompanies incorporation of instructional technologies as a constraint to research productivity. This burden forms a basic rationalization by which rejection of such tools is constructed:<disp-quote><p>The colleges have over the years offered quite a few courses trying [to increase attendance] with small honorariums for taking the course and learning about things. I’ve occasionally shown up for that. The disincentive very frankly is the amount of work that is required. (Chemist)</p><p>I strategically avoid a lot of that technology because I think it would increase my work- load. (Anthropologist)</p><p>Are you going to spend your time making a PowerPoint or getting an article out? And that’s an easy one. (Anthropologist)</p></disp-quote>Faculty who eschew instructional technology perceive it as a threat to research productivity or as an excessive burden that bears few rewards. These perceptions are confirmed in the accounts of faculty members who actively employ instructional technology in their work:<disp-quote><p>Time spent on this kind of material is time spent away from research and that can be your meal ticket and so that can be a definite disincentive. (Chemist)</p><p>It’s a hell of a lot of work. It’s much more work. And it wouldn’t be if I just stuck with old paper. (Chemist)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Professors who adopt instructional technologies thus do so against the operation of the academic reward system, as the scarcity of time that may be allocated to instruction strains the ability to be a productive researcher. Ultimately, a threshold is reached at which diminishing returns may lead faculty members to abandon technology-related practices. For example:<disp-quote><p>We were attempting to get the students to teach themselves how to use particular types of computing tools: Matlab, Mathematica, Excel, Maple, things like that by setting up sort of interactive web-based tutor sessions. And I think the reason we gave that up is … the amount of work a professor would have to put in—to come up with good tutorials, keep them running, get them working on every platform—was heavy. (Chemical Engineer)</p></disp-quote></p><p>At the individual level, the key consequence of adopting technology in one’s instructional work is the impact on one’s workload, which influences the allocation of effort to research. Those who do employ technology on a pedagogical basis either find the workload is excessive and abandon intensive use or they are located in positions in which the scope of their research is delimited to research on field-specific pedagogy. In general, work burdens, informal sanctions by peers, and delimited career paths suggest that negative consequences define the outcomes that result from adoption of instructional technologies.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0162243911430236"><title>Discussion</title><p>I argued that the answers to three questions provide an understanding of the consequences of technological change for professional control. Having presented the views of forty-two university professors who utilize instructional technologies, I consider the implications of the data patterns for our understanding of the impact of technological change on professional control in the professoriate.</p><p>The first question considered was how do professors perceive instructional technologies? These data show that faculty view technology as of limited or no functional relevance to instruction. When technology is used, it is rarely driven by expert knowledge and is more frequently employed either to attract the attention of students or to cope with constraints of large classes. New instructional technologies could therefore erode professional control. This is not simply because of a potential for a drastic reconfiguration of the academic role as suggested by the unbundling hypothesis, but because control over the conditions of work—in this case what tools one uses and when—is the hallmark of professional autonomy. The adoption of instructional technologies under coercion, without influence, or for objectives unrelated to pedagogy erodes professional control because these circumstances ignore professional expertise.</p><p>We next considered the question: how do professors perceive administrative initiatives to encourage the adoption of instructional technologies? The data patterns related to this question suggest that a struggle over the technological conditions of work is more a potential than a current reality. Even though some faculty question the motives of their administration or perceive a hostile climate, it seems that professors at research-intensive universities are not required to employ instructional technologies.</p><p>Data patterns, however, do suggest that technology provides a means with which university administrations’ approaches to education may erode professional autonomy. There is no indication that administrations consult faculty about the technological infrastructure of education, despite the fact that it is professors who would ultimately employ such tools. The potential for the professoriate to lose control over the conditions of work is thus heightened to the extent that professors do not influence such decisions. Moreover, administrations can create technologically intensive teaching environments without consulting faculty through large class enrollments and creation of technology-rich learning centers. Universities thereby foster an environment in which professors reluctantly turn to technology to cope with class management. Such organizational strategies contribute to the erosion of professional control by constraining the ability of the professoriate to teach in ways professors believe to be superior to approaches that require “high-tech” tools.</p><p>What work outcomes do professors experience when they employ technology in their work? The findings indicate that technology implementation increases one’s workload and threatens research productivity. Social-psychological consequences result, too. Because of collective skepticism of instructional technology within departments, faculty members who do embrace these tools at best perceive no support or recognition from their peers for their efforts. At worst, they perceive themselves to occupy a lower-status position. Such sanctions thus pose a substantive constraint to the goals of individual professors or administrations to implement instructional technology. The combined effect of these outcomes suggests that environments that require or compel the use of technology may foster job dissatisfaction among faculty members. Additionally, the creation of academic appointments structured solely around teaching large courses using technology illustrates a new basis of stratification within the professoriate. That the work of professors in these positions is delimited to particular areas of research and particular classes stands in stark contrast to faculty who are unconstrained in selecting research topics and classes to teach. To the extent that administrations do see technology use as enabling instruction in large classrooms and justify expanded enrollment on this basis, this dimension of technological change could exhibit the greatest potential for the erosion of professional autonomy.</p><p>The results of this study make two contributions that build on related research. First, whereas existing theoretic approaches propose consequences of technological change through organizational and environmental analyses, this study has focused on the meanings professors assign to their work. In doing so, we gain insight into professional ideologies that constrain environmental and organizational effects such as institutional beliefs about technology as providing a superior means of delivering instruction. This insight builds upon existing research by highlighting the importance of academe’s status as a profession as a source of influence in technological change, rather than presenting it as a passive object of the effects of technological change.</p><p>Furthermore, the use of interviews in this study has revealed meanings of technology use (or rejection) previously unknown in the literature on technological change in academe. Consequently, we possess a better understanding of how technological change is interpreted by the individuals who experience it. A vast gulf exists between the meanings that faculty assign technology use and the characterizations of what technology means for higher education as advanced by its advocates (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162243911430236">Ashby 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162243911430236">Trow 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162243911430236">Duderstadt, Atkins, and Houweling 2002</xref>) or as it appears in publications such as <italic>The Chronicle of Higher Education </italic>(cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162243911430236">Foster 2007</xref>). The study suggests that the professional expertise of the individuals who would presumably employ technology in their work is challenged by advocates in and out of university administrations who believe it will enhance student learning. The fundamental difference in views between the professoriate and administration about how technology should be implemented in academe thus constitutes a fault line for future conflict. Moreover, by including professors’ accounts of technological change, we are able to peer into the process and understand its inner workings, such as factors that constrain (e.g., pedagogical beliefs or time demands) or foster (e.g., perceptions of students or class size) adoption of technology in one’s work.</p><p>The findings produced by this approach stand apart from what existing studies have shown. A general distinction between this work and some studies is the limited influence that properties such as institutional type, rank, field, or gender have on technology use. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162243911430236">Lin and Ha (2009</xref>) find that subculture played a role in the adoption of technology at a small state university, whereas I found no disciplinary differences among the participants in his study. Moreover, there is a perception that there are gender differences in technology use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162243911430236">Mossberger, Tolbert, and Stansbury 2003</xref>), but this study produced no support for this argument, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243911430236">Meyer and Xu’s (2007)</xref> analysis of the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty Data showed only minimal support. Consistent with the findings of this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162243911430236">Meyer and Xu's (2007)</xref> research also showed that institutional type (public vs. private) had no effect on the adoption of technology. Given the wealth of studies that focus on distance education and community colleges, and in light of the impact of new workloads on research, it is likely the case that the reward system at research-intensive universities outweighs the influence of properties such as field or gender on technology use in other contexts.</p><p>This research builds on, and stands apart from, existing knowledge in a second way. Whereas the unbundling hypothesis postulates the fragmentation of academic work, this study suggests a more subtle dynamic by which professional control is challenged and provides a more nuanced account of technology’s impact on academic work. The findings show that the erosion of professional control proceeds along quiet lines, such as disregarding the prerogatives of faculty members or through the creation of environments that essentially require instructional technologies. Through such environments, administrations essentially place tools in the hands of scholars without having to stipulate use. Moreover, the study suggests that unbundling, too, may proceed subtly. Whereas scholars who have advanced the hypothesis depict new occupations on the turf of professors or the complete severance of teaching and research, data in this study show that the reconfiguration of the academic role may also delimit the scope of one’s work. Technological change in academe, then, does not proceed through drastic changes that have characterized other occupational contexts such as craft work where assembly lines may be more easily substituted for traditional tools and practices. However, coupled with broader efforts of states and universities to alter university missions, organization, and instructional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162243911430236">Rhoades 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911430236">Schuster and Finkelstein 2006</xref>), it is evident that the decisions administrations make about instructional technology may have powerful consequences for autonomy within the professoriate. Coupled with other patterns of fragmentation such as the use of part-time faculty, technology clearly holds the potential to unbundle teaching from research by separating career paths into segments that primarily conduct research and train graduate students and those who use technology to teach large undergraduate classes. A systematic analysis of the presence of such tracks would be an important first step in future research.</p><p>In <italic>The American Faculty</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162243911430236">Schuster and Finkelstein (2006</xref>) emphasize the unknown or unpredictable nature of information technology in higher education, calling it a “wild card” (p. 107) that may transform the meaning and form of academic work. It is by revealing the interpretations of the members of the professoriate, a step taken by the present study, that technological change in academe becomes more knowable and predictable.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>I thank Vern Baxter, Joseph C.
