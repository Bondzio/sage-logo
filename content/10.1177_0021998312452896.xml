<abstract>
<p>The effect of carbonization temperature on the electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness, electrical resistivity, and mechanical performance of medium density fiberboards carbonized in a vacuum furnace under a gas flow of nitrogen (200 mL/min) between 400℃ and 1500℃ was investigated. The medium density fiberboards specimens carbonized below 700℃ showed stable and low electromagnetic interference values (1.3–7.6 dB) between 10 MHz and 1 GHz frequency. The electromagnetic interference (average 43.1 dB) of the MDF specimens carbonized at 800℃ were suitable for industrial applications. However, the MDF specimens carbonized above 900–1500℃ showed high electromagnetic interference values (66.8<bold>–</bold>84.6 dB). When the carbonization temperature increased from 600℃ to 700℃, the electrical resistivity of the specimens greatly decreased (180.9 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 137.5 Ω-cm). A further increment in the carbonization temperature (1200℃) had a small effect on the electrical resistivity (5.8 Ω-cm) of the specimens and no effect between 1300℃ (0.5 Ω-cm) and 1500℃ (0.5 Ω-cm). The carbonized specimens showed lower modulus of rupture and internal bond strength values than the untreated specimens but the differences between the strength values of the untreated specimens and the carbonized specimens decreased with increasing carbonization temperature. The modulus of elasticities of the specimens carbonized above 800℃ were higher than the untreated specimens.</p>

<p>Uses of electrical and electronic devices have been increased rapidly in recent years. Most of devices such as AC motors, televisions, cameras, calculators, digital, computers, microwave ovens, cellular phones are capable of emitting radio-frequency energy, which is commonly known as electromagnectic radiation in living environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312452896">1</xref></sup> Electrical devices by nature produce electromagnetic waves when in operation because electric machines produce an electric field and electric current that generate a magnetic field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312452896">2</xref></sup> The emitted electromagnetic waves from one electric part or device may also be potentially damaging to another electrical devices. For this reason, it can be highly desirable to protect electrical devices from damaged by external electromagnetic waves. To prevent such damage, a shield can be used to diminish the transmission of electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>Wood charcoal is characterized by attractive features that include good corrosion resistance, renewable material, and low cost. These properties are desirable ones for a shielding material against electromagnetic interference (EMI). Considerable research on the EMI shielding effectiveness and electrical resistivity (ER) of charcoal has been studies for decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312452896">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312452896">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312452896"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312452896"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312452896"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312452896">7</xref></sup> Charcoal is the chief product of wood pyrolysis, and the main uses of charcoal can be divided into fuel, metallurgical, and chemical purposes. The application of electromagnetism is one use in the metallurgical field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312452896">2</xref></sup> According to the research findings of Ishihara<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312452896">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312452896">5</xref></sup> and Wang and Hung,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312452896">2</xref></sup> when wood is heated to a temperature reaching the stage of carbonization temperature (800–1700℃), the resulting charcoal can be used as an electromagnetic shielding material.</p>
<p>Carbonized wood gains lots of public interests due to its availability, cost, and renewability. However, carbonized wood is typically laced with macrocracks due to the rate at which carbonization is performed. Those cracks have problems for industrial and commercial application. Kercher and Nagle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312452896">8</xref></sup> made crack-free carbonized medium density fiberboard (MDF) for electrical application. But there is no information relating to the electromagnetic shielding effects of the carbonized MDF panels. The main objective of this study was to determine the EMI shielding effectiveness, electric resistivity, and mechanical performance of the crack-free carbonized MDF. A new carbonization technique was performed in this study to produce crack-free carbonized MDF. The homogeneity and consistency of MDF result in the formation of a consistent, low-cost hard carbon suitable for industrial applications. The homogeneity of fiberboard allows for a much faster carbonization schedule that substantially reduced processing time. The effect of changing the carbonization schedule on the above-mentioned properties was analyzed.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0021998312452896"><title>MDF panels</title>
<p>Commercial MDF panels (thickness: 12 mm and 4.5 mm, density 650 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) were supplied by Sunchang corporation in Inchon, South Korea. The 12 mm thick panels were used for the ER and strength tests whereas the 4.5 mm thick panels were used for the measurement of the EMI shielding effectiveness. The urea–formaldeyhde resin bonded MDF panels were manufactured from a mixture of softwood and hardwood fibers produced using traditional thermo-mechanical refining process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998312452896"><title>Carbonization of MDF panels</title>
<p>The commerical size MDF panels were cut into 400 mm × 400 mm samples. They were then conditioned in a chamber at 23℃ and 65% relative humidity (RH) until no changes in the weights were detected. The boards were carbonized in a vacuum furnace without oxygen. The carbonization of the MDF samples was performed in an inconel-lined retort under a gas flow of nitrogen (200 mL/min). Each MDF samples was carbonized between graphite weight loading sheets to obtain an uniform specimen temperature and crack<bold>-</bold>free board (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312452896">Figure 1</xref>). The basic thermal schedule was as follows: rate of temperature rise 100℃/h, carbonization temperature between 400℃ and 1500℃, and maximum temperature maintained for 2 h. The thicknesses of the carbonized MDF samples decreased from 12 to 8.5 mm and 4.5 to 2 mm as a function of the carbonization temperature. The replicates for a given test were obtained from the same samples (400 mm × 400 mm).

<sec id="sec5-0021998312452896"><title>Measurement of EMI shielding effectiveness</title>
<p>The flanged circular coaxial transmission line method was used to detect the EMI of carbonized MDFs according to ASTM D 4935-10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312452896">9</xref></sup> A Network Analyzer (HP 8720C) was used throughout this study to assess the electromagnetic shielding effects of the modified boards. The shielding effectiveness measurements were performed in frequencies ranging from 10 to 1000 MHz. The specimens were cut into ‘doughnut’ shape with dimensions of inside diameter 76.2 mm (±0.01 mm), outside diameter 133.10 mm (± 0.01 mm), and thickness 2 mm. Dimension of the original (untreated) MDF specimens for the EMI test was 400 mm × 400 mm × 4.5 mm. Thickness of 4.5 mm MDF decreased to about 2 mm when the specimen was carbonized for proper size of EMI test. A total of five measurements were made for each type of treatment. EMI shielding effectiveness is described as the attenuation of an electromagnetic wave produced by its passage through a shield and is measured as the ratio of the shield strength before and after attenuation and is expressed in decibels (dB). The EMI shielding effectiveness of the specimens conditioned at 23℃ and 65% RH was calculated according to the following equation.

<sec id="sec6-0021998312452896"><title>Measurement of electrical resistivity</title>
<p>The specific ERs of the carbonized specimens were measured using two-probe technique with a digital multimeter DM-332 (range: 0.1–400 MΩ.) of EZ Digital Co. Ltd in South Korea. Dimension of the original MDF board for the ER measurement was 400 mm × 400 mm × 12 mm (thickness). After the carbonization process, the thickness of the specimens decreased to about 8.5 mm. For preparing the ER specimen, the carbonized board was precisely cut by cutting machine. The dimension of the ER specimens was 50 mm × 100 mm (machine direction) × 12–8.5 mm (thichness). The EMI values of the carbonized specimens were calculated from the averages of the different frequencies between 0 and 1000 MHz. Both ends of the specimens conditioned at 20℃ and 65% RH were coated with polymer-type copper conducting paste, then interconnected by a solder joint method. Each measurement was conducted in 10 s. A total of 3 measurements were made for each type of specimen. Since each specimen has different area and length, the measured electirical resistivity values were converted to the specific electric resistivity by following equation

<p>The modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the carbonized MDF specimens conditioned at 23℃ and 65% RH were performed according to EN 310.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312452896">10</xref></sup> A total of five replicate specimens were tested for each type of the carbonized MDF. The flexural tests were conducted in accordance with the third point loading method at a span-to-depth ratio of 20:1. Dimension of the original MDF board for the mechanical properties was 400 mm × 400 mm × 12 mm (thickness). After the carbonization process, the thickness of the specimens decreased to about 8.5 mm. The span of all the carbonized specimens was varied to keep the 20:1 ratio because the thicknesses of the specimens decreased as a function of the carbonization temperature. The crosshead speed was adjusted so that the failure would occur within an average of 60 s ± 10. The specimens were tested on Instron testing machine (Model: 4482) equipped with a load cell with a capacity of 10 kN. The internal bond strength test was conducted on the specimens (50 mm × 50 mm × 8.5 mm) cut from the carbonized MDF panels according to EN 319.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312452896">11</xref></sup> Six replicate specimens from each type of the carbonized MDF were used to determine the internal bond strength.</p>

<p>The shrinkage in the thickness direction was greater than that in the length and width directions because the shrinkage in the horizontal direction depends on the decrease in the space of the board, while the shrinkage in a parallel direction depends on the shrinkage of the fiber. The volumetric shrinkage of the specimens increased by 56.4% when the carbonization temperature rised to 1000℃ whereas further increment in the carbonization temperature (1500℃) decreased the volumetric shrinkage to 50.1%. The result show that the apparent density increase with increasing the carbonization temperature, which lies in that the weight loss rate is lower than volumetric shrinkage rate with increasing carbonization temperature. This was confirmed by the results of strength tests. In general, the strength values of the specimens increased when the volumetric shrinkage increased.</p>

The EMI values of the MDFs carbonized at 900–1500℃ were above average shielding and consequently these boards could be used in industrial applications requiring a high EMI. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312452896">Table 2</xref>, the EMI values of the MDFs carbonized at 1000℃ (79.29 dB) and 1100℃ (80.55 dB) were very close to each other. A similar result was observed for the specimens carbonized between 1200 (83.07) and 1500℃ (84.62). The difference between the EMI values of the specimens carbonized at 1000–1500℃ decreased with increasing frequency, particularly above 600 MHz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312452896">Figure 2</xref>). The EMI values of the carbonized MDFs were 80 dB at 1100℃, 83 dB at 1200℃, 83 dB at 1300℃, 84 dB at 1400℃, and 84 dB at 1500℃.</p>
<p>The MDFs carbonized at 900–1500℃ showed remarkable electromagnetic shielding characteristics in the frequency range from 10 to 1 GHz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312452896">Figure 2</xref>). In particular, the frequency changing between 0 and 800 MHz had a significant effect on the EMI of the specimens carbonized above 900℃. The EMI values of 1000℃ were 55 dB at 10 MHz, 60 dB at 100 MHz, 68 dB at 200 MHz, 78 dB at 400 MHz, 86 dB at 600 MHz, 93 dB at 800 MHz, and 100 dB at 1 GHz. The EMI values of the specimens carbonized below 900℃ were not significantly affected by the increment in the frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312452896">Figure 2</xref>). As compared with solid wood, the carbonized MDFs showed higher EMI values. For example, Wang and Hung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312452896">2</xref></sup> reported that maximum EMI values of 8 mm thick carbonized western hemlock, fortune paulownia, and red oak specimens were 36 dB, 61 dB, and 27 dB at 1000℃ in a frequency range from 1.5 to 2.7 GHz, respectively.</p>
<p>Carbonized wood is typically laced with macro-cracks due to the rate at which carbonization is performed by traditional carbonization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312452896">2</xref></sup> This is due to shrinkage stresses developed because surface of the material decomposes faster than its interior. However, the resulting carbonized MDFs in this study did not show any crack. This was mainly attributed to the manufacturing process because the MDF panels were carbonized between graphite weight loading sheets in the furnace apart from traditional. A typical scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the specimens carbonized at 800℃ are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312452896">Figure 3</xref>. The SEM image revealed that the carbonized wood fibers were interwoven each other. This structure resulted in substantial increases in the internal bond strength, MOR and, MOE of the carbonized MDFs as a function of increasing the carbonization temperature.

<p>The ER of the MDFs as a function of the carbonization temperature are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312452896">Table 2</xref>. The ER of the MDFs carbonized below 400℃ was not measured. When the carbonization temperature increased from 600℃ to 700℃, the ER of the specimens greatly decreased (180.9 × 10<sup>3</sup> to 137.5 Ω-cm). A further increment in the carbonization temperature (1200℃) had a small effect on the ER of the specimens (5.8 Ω-cm) and no effect between 1300 (0.5 Ω-cm) and 1500℃ (0.5 Ω-cm) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312452896">Table 2</xref>).

In other study, Okabe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312452896">12</xref></sup> determined that the ER of wood ceramics ranged from 10<sup>10</sup> to 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312452896">−3</xref></sup> Ω·cm at 400–2800℃.</p>
<p>The higher EMI values of the MDF specimens carbonized at high carbonization temperatures was mainly the result of a decrease in the ER. In general, materials exhibiting lower values of ER had larger EMI values. This is because when the ER decreases significantly the materials change from insulating material to semiconducting material; they thus become conducting materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312452896">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>The MDF specimens carbonized at 500–1500℃ showed lower MOR values than the untreated MDF specimens but the differences between the MOR values of the untreated specimens and the carbonized specimens decreased with increasing the carbonization temperature. Since the span was adjusted according to specimen thickness (span-to-depth ratio of 20:1), in the mechanical test, difference in the specimen thickness was compensated automatically by soft program. The MOE values of the specimens carbonized above 800℃ were higher than those of the untreated specimens. The carbonization of the specimens resulted in significantly decreases in the MOR and MOE values with increasing temperature up to 500℃, followed by the significant increases as the temperature increased from 600℃ to 1200℃. The increments and decrements in the MOR and MOE values of the carbonized specimens were mainly due to changes in the densities of the specimens. The relationship between the flexural properties and densities of the carbonized specimens are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312452896">Figure 4</xref>. As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312452896">Figure 4</xref>, despite considerable scatter in the data, there is a trend of increasing strength with the increase of the density.

<p>Like other wood materials, MDF loses weight and shrinks during carbonization. As woods are carbonized, they lose volatile matter. With increasing the carbonization temperature up to 600℃, the decreases in the MOR (81% of the untreated group) and MOE (65% of the untreated group) were mainly attributed to the loss of volatiles, breakage of C–H bonds, and decrease in the density of the MDF. In the carbonization temperature range of 600–1200℃, the MOR and MOE increased due to condensation of carbon microcrystallites, deposition of pyrolytic carbon (occurring as a result of cracking of hydrocarbons), and loss of porosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312452896">13</xref></sup> This result was confirmed by the results of the internal bond strength test. Although the internal bond strength values of the carbonized specimens were significantly lower than those of the untreated specimens, due to degredation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, the differences between the internal bond strength values of the untreated specimens and the carbonized specimens decreased with increasing carbonization temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312452896">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>The EMI values of the specimens carbonized below 700℃ were less than 8 dB and and stable over a wide frequency range. However, the EMI values of the specimens significantly increased when the carbonization temperature increased to 800℃. The EMI values of the specimens significantly increased with increasing the frequency when the carbonization temperature ranged from 900℃ to 1500℃. The ER of the specimens greatly decreased above 700℃. When the carbonization temperature increased from 600 to 700℃, the ER of the specimens greatly decreased. A further increment in the carbonization temperature (1200℃) had a small effect on the ER of the specimens and no effect between 1300℃ and 1500℃. The carbonized specimens showed lower MOR and internal bond strength values than the untreated specimens but the differences between the strength values of the untreated specimens and the carbonized specimens decreased with increasing carbonization temperature. The MOE of the specimens carbonized above 800℃ was higher than that of the untreated specimens.</p>
