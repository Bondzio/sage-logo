<abstract>
<p>Documenting instances of model-rendering amongst the Gurung communities of central Nepal (and, also, now in London), the article considers issues relating to information-transfer in non-/subliterate and past archaeological circumstances. It variously reflects upon ‘play’, craft reproduction and the limitations of memory, as well as scientific/technological representation and, particularly, Himalayan modes of ritual substitution.</p>

<p>Memory does this: lets the things appear small, compresses them. (Walter Benjamin, <italic>Archive</italic>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359183512459629">Marx et al., 2007</xref>: 49)</p>

<p>Growing up in Canada, amid the butter sculptures and cut-away beaver lodges that featured in the annual exhibition-fairs of my youth were working models of hydro-electric dams and nickel mines, with the local museum similarly having a small Parthenon and miniature Indian villages. Prior to computer visualisation, such model-rendering provided a common visual language for the display of information. Understanding what my own railway set, Lincoln Log buildings, toy soldiers or Meccano bridges represented, I could comprehend their real-life counterparts. Maturing, these things have an increasing anachronistic (and nostalgic) pleasure of minute gadgetry and amateur precision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359183512459629">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article concerns ‘indigenous’ modelling practices: in particular, it documents examples recorded whilst undertaking joint ethnographic and archaeological fieldwork with the Tamu-mai/Gurung of central Nepal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359183512459629">Evans, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512459629">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459629">Evans et al., 2009</xref>; see also e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359183512459629">Macfarlane, 1976</xref>) and, subsequently, participation with their recent migrant communities in Britain. As such, and indicative of what is now their dispersion in the world – from traditional Himalayan highland villages, first to Pokhara and then London and other metropolitan suburbs – this is simultaneously a matter of both ethnoarchaeology and modern material culture study (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359183512459629">Buchli and Lucas, 2001</xref>). Its primary focus, however, remains with the replication and miniaturisation of material culture in essentially non-literate circumstances, and it duly reflects upon modes of both religious and technological/craft representation. In short, in its concern with <italic>the carrying and reproduction of knowledge</italic>, this is a matter of the greater implications of ‘small things’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359183512459629">Evans, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This topic is intrinsically visual, and the things that are detailed here have not been recorded before. Accordingly, this must be more graphically heavy than most journal contributions as modelling and seeing/picturing (and writing) are, after all, among its themes and are deeply bound up with each other. While, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512459629">Lévi-Strauss (1966</xref>, see below), acknowledging the apparent universality of reduced-form representation, this article does not aspire to a global theory of ‘the miniature’. Indeed, appropriate to the subject’s ‘rag-bag’ or <italic>bricoleur</italic> qualities, it is both inherently anecdotal and discursive (it is no coincidence that Britain’s pre-eminent model store is Oxford’s attic-like Pitt Rivers Museum). A degree of contradiction even looms behind this. Models seem both readily accessible to non-literate/pre-Enlightenment modes of comprehension; but at their root – like memory itself – they involve <italic>perspective</italic>: near/distant or big/small. Along with the craft-practice implications of small-form representation, such cognitive themes will be explored in the article’s final section. Otherwise, after first outlining instances of Gurung model-building, its second part considers what might have been its origin and also addresses questions of ritual substitution and knowledge transfer (and its failure).</p>

<sec id="section2-1359183512459629">
<title>A model tradition</title>
<p>The documentation of model-building amongst the Gurung only occurred as an adjunct to the main Kohla Project programme. Largely arising from the author’s general interest in model-based practices and, particularly, as a historical means of representation in European archaeology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512459629">Evans, 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512459629">2008</xref>), it was not a core element of the fieldwork. These ‘small devices’, nevertheless, provide a vehicle for considering modes of information transfer amongst what are/were largely non-literate groups. Crucial here is what seems to be their general undeveloped graphic skills, and this raises issues of how complex information is/was conveyed. In the communication of material culture-form or technological ideas, a basic distinction must be made between mobile objects (e.g. pots or tools) and the ‘large’ (e.g. a house- or oven-type). Often of complex design, the latter are/were either ‘rooted’ (i.e. earthfast) or simply too bulky for physical displacement. If lacking graphic capability, how was their design and knowledge about them conveyed to others some distance away? Pots and metalwork move, but not houses. It is not, therefore, surprising that the former are more sensitive markers of typological development/expression.</p>
<p>Gurung shamans chant long oral texts that outline settlement genealogies along their (pre)historic migration routes southward from either Tibet or China into the Himalayas. Among their prodigious memory feats are also compendia of medicinal plant types and other long ritual texts: essentially list-sequences of places and things. While holding detailed repetitive knowledge, their oral recitals – that can last up to nine hours – seem to have limited capability for conveying ‘new’ information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1359183512459629">2</xref></sup> That said, at one time they must have been relatively ‘new’, when the decision was made to rhetorically/formally commit their contents to ‘specialist-group’ (i.e. shamanic) memory. In that moment, there would have been perspective: things variously ‘fresh’ and those in more distant hindsight. The Gurung ‘texts’ reflect this as there is a marked decline of settlement detail northward, with description over the more recent, southern length being more nuanced and having greater enumeration, which can in part be archaeologically corroborated.</p>
<p>Similar great historical trek-events to those of the Gurung have been documented, such as those of the Zulus or Aztecs, and among comparable memory feats would of course be Homer’s <italic>Iliad</italic> and <italic>Odyssey</italic>. Of equal significance must also have been the extraordinary mnemonic skills of Polynesian navigators – their vast knowledge of tides, currents and stars – that were abstractly rendered in stick-chart devices that effectively amounted to ‘environmental models/maps’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512459629">Ingold, 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359183512459629">Lewis, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359183512459629">Mack, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>During the course of our Nepalese fieldwork, instances of model-portrayal were observed <italic>en route</italic> through the highlands. One example arose from the frequent discovery of single cup-holed stones (<italic>Chuni-holden</italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512459629">Figure 1</xref>). Evidently intrinsic to the operation of millet-husking mortars, these can still be seen in operation in many villages. Upon finding these stones while surveying upland sites and asking our local workmen to describe their use, instead of verbally relating or drawing them with the materials we offered, in a matter of minutes a functioning, approximately third-scale version was mocked-up in wooden poles. This certainly conveyed the basic principles of their operation more readily than any spoken account or sketch could have done.</p>

<p>Later, when recording ruins that extend along the length of a high alpine meadow at <italic>Chikre Toh</italic>, northeast of Pokhara (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459629">Evans et al., 2009</xref>: 9–13), our attention was again drawn to local modelling. Lying at circa 3500 m OD, the park-like plain was dotted with recently occupied pastoralist shelters. These are constructed with low stonewalls and have a bamboo superstructure to which thatch/mat roofs are added during their seasonal utilisation; at other times, the framework is left standing until the next visit. There is no need to detail their construction except to note that they are of two main types: a long-plan design for buffalo stalling, and more squat ones relating to shepherding (pp. 157–158). Amid the campsites were miniature versions of the shelters that were up to around 70 cm long. These were observed at three locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359183512459629">Figure 2</xref>). Built of rhododendron twigs and involving as many as 40 pieces, there were accurate renderings of both forms of shelter. What was surprising was their pristine quality. Complete with interior fixtures (e.g. above-hearth drying racks) and delicate in their fabrication, they could not have survived in this manner had they been for play. From this and the accuracy of their design, it was posited that these miniatures were intended to demonstrate to younger members of the camp group how to erect the complicated framework of their full-size counterparts. During a later season, when fieldwork was specifically undertaken with the pastoral sector of the local villages to investigate their specific landscape attitudes, this interpretation was confirmed. They are, indeed, <italic>tools for teaching</italic>.</p>

<p>Such an ethos is also reflected in what few formal toys children possess in Gurung villages. Apart from makeshift rolling hoops and today, of course, footballs, common presents for boys are miniature ploughing sets – accurately carved wooden scale-replicas of the ard and all its associated fixtures – and, in a similar vein, girls’ loom sets have been observed elsewhere in Nepal (A de Sales, personal communication).</p>
<p>In one of the villages, a day-care centre had recently been established. There, amongst the very few items for instruction, were farming/household miniatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1359183512459629">Figure 3</xref>). Although of varying scale, they were clearly a related set and all the items were approximately ‘hand-sized’. The bamboo-woven implements included a winnowing tray, a porter’s or storage basket and a <italic>skyaku</italic> winged cape for protection from the rain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359183512459629">Macfarlane, 1976</xref>: 6.I); rendered in wood alone, there was again a plough set. Without accompanying doll figurines, these would have limited ‘play’ potential; their value is instructional and within a Himalayan village context can be considered emblematic of traditional rural life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1359183512459629">3</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359183512459629-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>Amongst the equipment of Gurung shamans are sets of miniature iron tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1359183512459629">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359183512459629">Evans, 2004a</xref>: 173–175; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459629">Evans et al., 2009</xref>: 189–190). They are considered to be ‘friends’ and therefore kept together in small bags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359183512459629">Herle, 1994</xref>: 3). Of diverse scale (circa 4–10 cm long) and quite crudely rendered, they include types commonly found in daily use – tongs, sickles, picks and axes – and also a range of weaponry (long knives and archery equipment) for fighting witches/evil spirits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1359183512459629">4</xref></sup> Lacking, for example, replica guns, they are prescribed/conservative groupings and take their place within the shamans’ ‘arsenal’: quivers of porcupine quill ‘arrows’, a ‘fighting hornbill’ (variously a hornbill’s head or stork’s skull) and a ‘sounding horn’ (e.g. conch shells, ram’s horns or even a drilled human long bone). Noteworthy of the miniatures is both the use of iron and the blacksmith’s tongs, with the picks arguably also attesting to mining. This potentially reflects the integrating role of the shaman, as Gurung villages are bound by blacksmith/tailor caste distinctions, and the Gurung <italic>per se</italic> do not practise metalworking today, nor have they done so in historical memory. This may be significant, given that slag was found on the main ancestral highland village-ruin site – <italic>Kohla Sombre</italic> – which suggests that such restrictions may not have been applicable in the distant past (i.e. pre-Hindu contact).</p>
<p>The final modelling instance involves a more complex trajectory. The project’s origins ultimately sprung from Nepal’s 1990 democracy movement; some years later, we were approached by the <italic>Tamu Pye Lhu Sangh</italic> (TPLS), a local Gurung cultural association then solely based in Pokhara, to work with them to explore their past and, in particular, to investigate <italic>Kohla</italic>. At that time, one of their main aims was to identify culture-specific architectural templates – specifically shamanic training schools – that could inspire their present-day buildings. However, in the interval it took to raise the necessary research funding, they went on to invent their own architecture (TPLS’s membership at the time included a professional engineer). The result was extraordinary, and when the Pokhara <italic>Kohibo</italic> cultural centre was finished there was certainly nothing else like it in the country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1359183512459629">Figure 4</xref>). While having distant affinities with the shell-like forms of the Sydney Opera House, this was entirely coincidental; rather, the direct source of its inspiration was their ritual <italic>Chop</italic> moulded rice figure (some grave markers have also taken this as their model). Over the last decade, nine other <italic>Kohibos</italic> have now been built by other Gurung communities in the Pokhara district. Though of varying size (reflecting the strength of the local group’s fund-raising abilities), all essentially follow the Pokhara/<italic>Chop</italic> ‘model’.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1359183512459629-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>A last twist to all this took place in July 2009 when, on publication of the project findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459629">Evans et al., 2009</xref>), we presented the volume at a festival event of the TPLS’s recently formed British chapter, held at Farnborough in Kent. There, in a school hall rented out for the purpose, more than a thousand Gurung and their guests assembled from around the country. The Home Counties setting certainly seemed incongruous as over a dozen fully attired shamans spent most of the day chanting, drumming and performing rituals in the hall. Placed at the front of the gathering was a table heaped with various shamanic and/or cultural regalia. In pride of place was a foil-covered model of a <italic>Kohibo</italic> around whose sides were photographs of the many other ‘homeland’ versions of similar <italic>Kohibo</italic> currently in existence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1359183512459629">Figure 5</xref>; the local London community now wanting to have their own centre). This, then, describes a complex series of transformations: a form of ritual rice figure that has become the model for an entirely new mode of culturally specific architecture – the <italic>Kohibo</italic> – with the Pokhara building now acquiring an iconic status and literally serving as the model-prototype for the spread of <italic>Kohibos</italic>. Although their design would have no parallels whatsoever with the 800–1000-year-old village-ruin sites that were investigated in the local highlands, this seems completely irrelevant. Rather, the last two decades have seen the birth of a vibrant past-referential architectural style and in which various ‘models’ have clearly played a significant role.</p>

<title>Toys, failures and effigies</title>
<p>There are remote archaeological parallels for at least some of the modes of modelling described above, which would invariably be ascribed to ritual/symbolic practices. The shaman’s small tool/weaponry ensemble has vague affinities to European later Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman votive ‘miniatures’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359183512459629">Harding, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359183512459629">Kiernan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1359183512459629">Stead, 1998</xref>). Equally, in regard to the reduced-form pastoralist shelters, there would be southeast European Neolithic ceramic house models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359183512459629">Bailey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359183512459629">Hodder, 1990</xref>). While the Gurung day-care instructional farming/household set would have its clearest parallel with various forms of toys (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359183512459629">Baxter, 2005</xref>: 41–49; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359183512459629">Park, 1998</xref>), what is without obvious comparison is the husking mortar. Yet as a ready demonstrative piece – not so much an artefact as an immediate ‘mock-up’ – this kind of construction would never leave any discernible material trace.</p>
<p>Other modes of near intangible modelling could also be cited. This would extend to landscape-mapping tableaux that have been observed among hunter-gatherers. With lumps of bark and stones variously representing rivers and mountains (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359183512459629">Ingold 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359183512459629">2007</xref>: 84–90 on indigenous modes of mapping and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459629">Evans et al., 2009</xref>: 75–77 for Gurung visual representation), these would even have a ‘grounded’ resonance with military terrain modelling, similar to that used as instruction for battlefield deployment during the last Iraq War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1359183512459629">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not being claimed here that the Gurung constitute any manner of pristine ethnographic community, and they are certainly not a surrogate ‘primitive’. Aside from their recent overseas migration, almost two centuries of Gurkha service have ensured sustained exposure to foreign culture and the Gurung, themselves, have also been much studied by visiting scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359183512459629">Macfarlane, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359183512459629">Messerschmidt, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359183512459629">Pignède, 1993[1966]</xref>). Indeed, over the last decade, in common with many of the world’s ‘indigenous’ peoples, they have now become an electronic community, hosting their own websites (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459629">Evans et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1359183512459629">Figure 5</xref>.8). This erodes any simple literate/non-literate divide and, given the degree of change they are now experiencing, firmly situates our original fieldwork findings within a distinct time and place (i.e. central Nepal, 1994–2002).</p>
<p>Although there is no basis on which to establish any confirmed ancestry to the Gurung’s modelling formats, two sources of influence could be proposed. The first would be Western 19th-century practices and the experience of empire. Apart from scaled scientific table-top experiments, this would include patent prototypes and museum/exhibition tableaux, as well as various architectural, ship-hull and wagon models such as those regularly employed by the East India Company or the British Army abroad (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359183512459629">Altick, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359183512459629">Baker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1359183512459629">Schaffer, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1359183512459629">2004</xref>). Equally, by way of generic example, upon his return to Britain from Singapore, Sir Stamford Raffles brought back a series of doll-like figurines illustrative of local ‘social types’, as well as miniature sets of contemporary weapons and the instruments used by gamelan orchestras. These were commissioned as, in effect, a means to transmit information and provided the basis for ‘as-if-from-life’ illustrations in his <italic>History of Java</italic> of 1817 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359183512459629">Barley, 1999</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1359183512459629">6</xref></sup> At that time, ethnography also began to develop, acquire and/or commission its own range of reconstruction models: variously, in relation to technological renderings of types of ards (ploughs), boats and houses, and also stereotypic village settings that feature in museum collections (O’Hanlon, personal communication; see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359183512459629">Bowden, 1991</xref>, Figure 47).</p>
<p>Deeper Asian/Himalayan traditions could also have influenced the Gurung’s modelling. To a certain extent, moulded rice/dough figurines – ranging from stylistic depictions of sacrificial animals to, variously, conically shaped food offerings and abstract renderings of area gods – are common to both Tibetan-Buddhist and shamanic practices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359183512459629">Pignède, 1993[1966]</xref>, Plate 46). Superficially amounting to little more than shaped ‘lumps’, these figurines can also be arranged in group settings to approximate a ritual cartography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359183512459629">Diemberger, 1997</xref>: 313–316, Figures 6.3 and 6.4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359183512459629">Mumford, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1359183512459629">Figure 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359183512459629">Höffer, 1999</xref>: 226). <italic>Substitution</italic> is the paramount factor here, as miniature ‘stand-ins’ for the real thing, whether it is a god or a sacrificial animal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1359183512459629">7</xref></sup> Bound-up with concepts of material/spiritual ‘reincarnation’ (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359183512459629">Evans and Humphrey, 2003</xref>), it is in this generic Himalayan/Buddhist context that the impetus behind Gurung modelling probably lies and, ultimately, has its roots in ritual practices. In fact, their key rite – the three-day <italic>pae</italic> death ceremony that occurs a month or more after burial – involves a half life-size effigy of the deceased (<italic>plah</italic>); clothes of the deceased are dressed around a wooden framework and, thereby, the dead effectively attend their own death feast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1359183512459629">Pignède, 1993[1966]</xref>: 371–378, Figure 33, Plate 41).</p>
<p>There is, of course, much overlap between notions of ritual substitution and more pragmatic replication modelling. Both can ‘operate’ within the world. Technological models do by virtue of the fact that they can either duplicate the form of their larger prototype (through scaling further full-size versions) or replicate real-life forces, such as gravity or water-flow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1359183512459629">8</xref></sup> With the intervention of the divine/belief, it is equally held that ritual models/effigies act upon ‘the real’; in this instance, Tibetan-Buddhist ‘war magic’:<disp-quote>
<p>Large numbers of ritual experts would gather for performances that could last for several days, if not weeks. Legions of effigies of the enemy soldiers would be fashioned, so that the practitioners in effect recreated the battlefield within the confines of the ritual space. Sokdokpa describes many of his own ritual performances for which up to 250,000 paper effigies (<italic>ling ga</italic>) were created.

<p>The ‘world in small’ is inherently ambiguous and often when miniatures are found on sites this raises questions of whether they are of ritual significance or toys. This is a fitting dichotomy as both ultimately involve socio-cultural performance and instruction. Yet, however deeply engrained in current academic rhetoric, there is nothing especially challenging in such oft-rehearsed ‘ambiguous’ material culture interpretations. The same, though, is not true of the Gurung husking mortar ‘mock-up’, as it effectively blurs boundaries between formal scientific trials and embodied craft-knowledge practices. Operating according to applied force and gravity, this was a <italic>working</italic> ‘real-life’ demonstration model (i.e. not requiring any ritual or symbolic transformation) and, paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359183512459629">Geertz (1983)</xref>, a ‘knowing your ass-from-your-elbow’ technology. That said, although clearly demonstrating the operational precepts of its full-size versions, it was not an exact replica. Consider <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512459629">Figure 1</xref> again: the ‘mock-up’s’ pivot arm is held by twine, whereas in reality it turns on a dowel passing through it and the flanking uprights. With its stripped-down form and materials determined by immediate trail-side contingency, the ‘mock-up’ rendered <italic>the soul of the machine</italic> (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512459629">Lévi-Strauss, 1966</xref>: 22; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359183512459629">Ingold, 2000b</xref> on science/technology and art). As such, this piece reflects upon fundamental issues of past/non-literate information-transfer and even, in addition, questions of ‘agency’ and failure. Crucially, lacking written instruction or drawn blueprints, one might ask: under these circumstances, was the spread of ‘earthfast’ technological innovation embodied through necessity? That is, was such knowledge only spread by travelling specialists – variously itinerant potters and metalsmiths – or could ‘the flow’ have been two-way? In other words, could past actors/agents have seen some artefact and tried to bring the knowledge of it home with them? Related to this is the question of how past craft activity and the role of its practitioners are envisaged. Was it a matter of blind acceptance of their respective traditions or was such activity subject to experiment, effectively testing the limits of the day’s technological capabilities and available materials? Though surely a compromise between the two, it is difficult to engender the past with ‘knowing agents’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359183512459629">Dobres and Robb, 2000</xref>) and not admit an element of ongoing experimentation, by at least some.</p>
<p>Acknowledging this, there is then the problem of archaeology’s bias towards repetitive pattern and, <italic>de facto</italic>, typological ‘success’: the one-off pottery form that does not readily fit an established sequence or the faulted bronze casting that over-stretched the available technology and was duly recycled – such things are unavoidably invisible. Equally, there are the larger ‘rooted’ constructions – house- or kiln-forms – all invariably assumed within ‘types’, but what of the associated failed attempts?</p>
<p>The problem is that excavated data are often so partial that we invariably span the gap between what is left in the ground and what once stood/operated in a manner that makes them ‘work’. Though, ironically, in time everything is bound to do so as it/they will eventually be superseded, <italic>failure</italic> is something difficult to comprehend in the archaeological record. After more than 30 years of practising field archaeology, I know of only one convincing example of such one-off failure (pottery wasters aside), but even this could only be distinguished because of its contrast with the much more simple ‘successes’ that framed it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1359183512459629">9</xref></sup> It was found in the course of the excavation of a later Iron Age compound at Haddenham in the Cambridgeshire Fenlands (HAD V; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359183512459629">Evans and Hodder, 2006</xref>, chapter 5). There, in its final phase, a succession of ovens had been inserted into the backfilled eavesgully of a large roundhouse. The series both started and concluded with the usual flat-floor types (p. 167, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1359183512459629">Figures 5</xref>.26 and 5.30–31). Between these, however, was an incredibly elaborate version with an underfloor heating chamber connected to a flue and for which no direct parallels could be established. The crucial point was that the flue turned upward in a right-angle along its length; little wonder then that its draught capabilities failed and the household duly went back to a simple-floor type. What the sequence suggests is that someone had gone somewhere, witnessed a presumably successfully elaborate oven-form in operation, come home and, so inspired, attempted the same. Yet clearly one key bit of information had either been missed or forgotten: a flue cannot bend downwards. This is not a matter of adjudicating failure/success, but that the merits of the ‘non-success’ need to be appreciated in their own right. For me, bound up with the Gurung’s remarkable husking mortar ‘mock-up’, this instance tells us that in the past some people ‘pushed things’ and, on occasion, tried something different. The alternative is to see the past as only evincing slow-/uniform-accrued change or ‘tinkering’ and as directly comparable long-term biological evolution.</p>

<p>We next went to the School of Languages, where three Professors sat in Consultation upon improving that of their own Country.</p>
<p>The first Project was to shorten Discourse by cutting Polysyllables into one, and leaving out Verbs and Participles; because <italic>in Reality all things imaginable are but Nouns</italic>.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>As chronicled above, the Iron Age oven’s ‘failure’ suggests that a failed or partial information transfer may lurk behind excavated data. Certainly, without such intermediary devices as the Gurung’s ‘mock-up’ mortar, the passage of technological information would then have been reliant upon various ‘Kim’s games’ – the direct memory of things seen/experienced – and, if not mnemonic specialists like their shamans, this we know to be inherently faulty.</p>
<p>This was further brought home by a colleague’s recent anecdote. Some years ago, the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History was approached by a Tlingit craftswoman asking to view their Pacific Northwest Coast cedar-bark hats. Wanting to revive their manufacture, she apparently could not determine how their interior headbands were woven in without causing the hat to bulge. The museum’s pieces were duly laid out on a table and, turning his back, the curator to his surprise found that water was leaking from her carrier bag. It held soaked bark strips and, using them, she then went on to replicate how the band element was applied, making the relevant portion of the hat’s structure, which she then took home. She apparently remarked that having the actual object portion was the only way she could reproduce it; a textual account and/or a drawing would obviously not suffice (S Loring, personal communication). This emphasises the fact that, at the level of craft production, knowledge of material culture is something you <italic>do</italic>, rather than abstractly describe. In this capacity, miniaturisation/modelling – and ‘mocking up’ – can all potentially be considered as a means of <italic>doing</italic>.</p>
<p>The phenomenology of miniature-form representation – our many <italic>Lilliputs</italic> – has received scant attention. Certainly, examples of past small-form representation are widespread; ranging from Palaeolithic painting and figurines, Roman anatomical votive statuary to Bronze Age rock art and both Egyptian and Chinese Han dynasty mortuary tableaux, the currency of ‘the small’ is extensive. In a later Western European canon, aside from various building models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359183512459629">Morris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1359183512459629">Wilton-Ely, 1969</xref>), 16th- and 17th-century bird’s-eye renderings of towns and monuments could be cited.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1359183512459629">10</xref></sup> Occurring prior to the advent of mechanical flight (i.e. later-18th-century ballooning; e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359183512459629">Holmes, 2008</xref>: 125–162), in at least some instances this may not just have been a matter of ‘imaginings’ but arguably that non-extant models provided their source (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359183512459629">Evans, 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359183512459629">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Depth perception has been argued to be environmentally sensitive (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359183512459629">Mangan, 1978</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1359183512459629">11</xref></sup> Yet relating to the frequency of reduced-form representation, if in the past it was not comprehended that a thing ‘in small’ registered depth/distance – be it a human raider or a mammoth (as opposed to a dwarf version thereof) – you would soon be dead, and this would have been a phenomenological lesson quickly learnt. Perhaps most telling, by way of extreme, is that even the rock paintings of Australian Aborigines (despite their ‘world without surface’/‘X-ray’ perception) involve reduced-form imagery. While, as in the case of the dough figure area-gods/landscape trays, reduced-form representation can obviously involve symbolism, generally the appeal of miniaturisation is its directness. Though entailing scaled abstraction, it is still open to one-to-one readings without, for example, needing the conventions of modern mapping or those of archaeological site graphics. The doll figures that still depict Nepal’s ethnic groups within Kathmandu’s National Museum, including the Gurung, provide an obvious instance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359183512459629">Evans et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359183512459629">Figure 1</xref>.6). Seemingly appreciated as costumed and ‘typed’ humans regardless of the viewer’s degree of literacy, they further attest that the ‘small’ can be inherently comprehended.</p>
<p>It is only through reduction, in its many guises, that we gain perspective and achieve a ‘bigger view’. Without it, representation would amount to a one-to-one mapping of the world and thereby equate with direct daily experience (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359183512459629">Küchler and Melion, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1359183512459629">Ricoeur, 2004</xref>). Experience invariably privileges or ‘enlarges’ the viewer/representation and diminishes ‘others’ – fore- and backgrounding – with the world effectively overviewed by the socio-cultural ego. Indeed, in relationship to ‘bricoleur knowledge’, this was appreciated by no less than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359183512459629">Lévi-Strauss (1966</xref>: 23–24):<disp-quote>
<p>Now, the question arises whether the small-scale model or miniature, which is also the ‘masterpiece’ of the journeyman, may not in fact be <italic>the universal type of the work of art</italic>. All miniatures seem to have intrinsic aesthetic quality – and from what should they draw this constant virtue if not the dimensions themselves?</p>
<p>… What is the virtue of reduction either of scale or in the number of properties? It seems to result from a sort of reversal in the process of understanding. To understand a real object in its totality we always tend to work from its parts. The resistance it offers us is overcome by dividing it. Reduction in scale reverses this situation. Being smaller, the object as a whole seems less formidable. By being quantitatively diminished, it seems to us qualitatively simplified … <italic>In the case of miniatures</italic>, in contrast to what happens when we try to understand an object or living creature of real dimensions, <italic>knowledge of the whole precedes knowledge of the parts</italic>. (emphases added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given these properties, miniaturisation and model rendering could rank as an ‘external storage’ strategy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1359183512459629">Renfrew, 1998</xref>). As such, they share attributes of their scalar opposite – gigantism or monumentalisation – that is ‘the world writ large’, but which often involve a reduced version of an even greater ‘whole’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1359183512459629">12</xref></sup> Such is certainly the case of the Gurung’s <italic>Kohibos</italic>: originally derived from a ritual figurine/moulding, they now model a complex cosmology.</p>
<p>The instances of ethnographic modelling otherwise outlined here amount at best to modest ‘artefacts’ and, aside from the shamans’ fighting-set miniatures, would be unlikely to survive within any site’s material record. Yet, their potential archaeological register is not what is being stressed, but rather the insights they provide into the nature of non-literate information transfer. In relationship to Swift’s ‘carrying things’ passage above, in addition to ‘words’, <italic>people in the past carried knowledge</italic>. Amongst the means/media – including memory, embodied craft practices and, eventually, drawing/writing – by which this knowledge was variously conveyed were surely various modes of modelling: ‘small devices’ facilitating greater concepts and constructs.</p>

<p>When I was about eleven, I was taken to visit Salisbury Cathedral … What I do remember, though, very vividly, is a display which the cathedral authorities had placed in some dingy side-chapel, which consisted of a remarkable model of Salisbury Cathedral, about two feet high and apparently complete in every detail, made entirely out of matchsticks glued together; certainly a virtuoso example of the matchstick modeller’s art … I could not but pay tribute to so much painstaking dexterity in objectified form. At one level, I had perfect insight into the technical problems faced by the genius who had made the model, having myself often handled matches and glue, separately and in various combinations, while remaining utterly at a loss to imagine the degree of manipulative skill and sheer patience needed to complete the final work … Here the technology of enchantment and enchantment of technology come together.
