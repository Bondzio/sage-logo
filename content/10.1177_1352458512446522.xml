<title>Rebuttal</title>
<p>What would a cure of multiple sclerosis look like?</p>
<p>Well, with a course of <italic>MSmiracure</italic> all inflammatory activity would be stopped; damage accrued until that point would be completely repaired; there would be no possibility of late disease recurrence or progressive disease, even decades later; all with an acceptable safety profile; and with no further treatment ever required.</p>
<p>I doubt we will never achieve this, let alone within 10 years. I have five arguments.</p>
<p>First, could we ever prevent <italic>all</italic> further inflammatory activity, without understanding the cause of multiple sclerosis? Here we are doing pretty well, both in terms of controlling the disease and understanding its cause. The recent magisterial genetic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512446522">1</xref></sup> demonstrate that the immune system is at the heart of the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, and we have a large armamentarium of drugs and manoeuvres that affect the immune system. In terms of a ‘cure’, we would first look to those treatments that permanently remould the immune system to a more benign form: autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and (in my potentially biased opinion) alemtuzumab (Campath-1H). These are undoubtedly effective therapies, at the cost of significant side-effects, but even they do not stop <italic>all</italic> further inflammatory activity in <italic>all</italic> patients. For instance, in a small trial where both treatments were combined, 5/21 patients relapsed at some point after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512446522">2</xref></sup> In theory, more specific therapies, might lead to better benefit–risk ratios. But the current selective approaches (for instance, altered peptide ligands or TCR/T cell vaccination) are not terribly effective, no doubt limited by our ignorance of quite which pathways we should interfere with. And there is a nagging worry that Hans Lassman might be right: and that some of the inflammation underlying multiple sclerosis might be trapped behind a closed blood–brain barrier, which is a problem because this cannot be crossed by nearly all of the drugs we currently use in multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Second, we will not be able to repair damage already accrued, at least not in the near future. Currently, we identify people with multiple sclerosis when the CNS is damaged, causing symptoms and /or MRI scars. We will never be able to predict who will get multiple sclerosis before such damage has occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512446522">3</xref></sup> So, even if we had the perfect immunotherapy to prevent all subsequent disease activity, we will always be faced with how to reverse the scars of demyelination, axon and neuronal loss and gliosis. We are making progress on understanding the mechanisms of remyelination, leading to rational drug targets,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512446522">4</xref></sup> but there is little understanding of how to re-grow neurons.</p>
<p>Third, and perhaps most worryingly, it is possible that even if we stop inflammation as early as possible, the progressive phase would emerge nonetheless. Personally I doubt this. But there is a respectable body of opinion, mainly from Lyon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512446522">5</xref></sup> that progression is due to non-inflammatory mechanisms and is entirely independent from the inflammation which produces relapses. If that turns out to be true, then we are in real trouble: we have little idea of the mechanism and almost no idea how to start with treatment. Perhaps one of the current ‘neuroprotective’ drugs might, by accident, do the job (and, of these, my favourite is amiloride, from Lars Fugger’s work).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512446522">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point, which is pragmatic: even if a target was identified today that could lead to a cure for multiple sclerosis, it would not be available to people with multiple sclerosis in 10 years. In the US (where things are speedier than the EU) it takes on average 13 years to get a drug into the clinic. There are numerous road blocks to developing drugs. In response to this, Francis Collins’ first move, when he became director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was to set up the US$723-million National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. Our own David Cameron has also responded by promising, in November 2011, £180 million to set up a government Biomedical Catalyst Fund to invest in U.K. health and life sciences companies, and to accelerate access of seriously ill patients to novel drugs.</p>
<p>Finally, no other autoimmune disease can be cured, so why expect multiple sclerosis to be? In medicine, we only talk about a cure in surgical and infectious diseases, and sometimes in cancer therapy; but not in autoimmunity. Despite the great advances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a PubMed search on ‘cure’ and ‘rheumatoid arthritis’ gets just 21 hits, which are either rhetorical or barmy. Even with the most radical treatment, autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, disease breaks through in 50% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512446522">7</xref></sup> But, also I am signed up to the view that autoimmune diseases are the cost of our increasingly hygienic and infection-free environment; so, as we push development and clean industrialization, so we will see yet greater incidence of autoimmunity.</p>
<p>So, I am afraid, multiple sclerosis is with us for more than 10 years. In fact, I predict that the disease, or variants of it, will be modern humans’ constant companion. And our predicament will continue to be the pressure to diagnose early and treat aggressively, being held back by concern for adverse effects.</p>
