<p><italic>The Theological Turn in Youth Ministry</italic></p>
<p>Andrew Root and Kenda Creasy Dean</p>
<p>Downers Grove: IVP, 2011. 264 pp. $18.00</p>
<p>The only thing more loaded with anxiety and tension than the teen years may be youth ministry itself. Pizza parties and ski outings or mission trips and Bible studies? Lone Ranger leaders or collaborative Youth Teams? Ordained pastors or volunteers? Are youth groups even a valid form of ministry, or would youth be better served by deeper involvement in the whole life of a congregation? Is youth ministry something that church leaders even do, or is youth ministry what the youth themselves are doing in the name of the Gospel? If these tensions permeating youth ministry are not enough, Kenda Creasy Dean and Andrew Root have introduced a few more, all having to do with what they identify as a theological turn in youth ministry. And nothing in the church or scholarship turns without some resistance.</p>
<p>First of all, the authors are clear that youth ministry should not be approached from within the field of Christian education (a typical mainline or Catholic approach) or evangelism (a typical parachurch approach). Nurturing discipleship, catechesis, or conversion are insufficient platforms for taking on the full task of ministry with youth. As Root sees it, youth ministry, as taught in seminaries, “has slowly matured over the last two decades” and has been “released from its long incubation as a subdiscipline under Christian education, where it received its essential theoretical nourishment from the social sciences.” Youth ministry scholarship sees itself now “as a practical theological activity” (218). But what does this mean?</p>
<p>A good portion of the book is devoted to describing precisely what practical theology is. At times this is done through example: how to handle difficult conversations about sin or sex with youth, a discussion of the eschatological significance of church camp, a reflection on whether mission trips are just global tourism, or how to handle the place of doubt in confirmation classes. In nearly all of these practice-oriented discussions there is a heavy dose of critique for the ways in which the Church, the theological academy, or youth ministers themselves have approached such territory. In addition, a significant portion of the book is devoted to a discussion of practical theological method of the type you could expect in an advanced seminar, such as: a hermeneutical comparison of Bultmann’s existentialism and Levinasian ethics of obligation, the difference between neo-Aristotelian praxis and Kierkegaardian absurdity in schools of youth ministry thought, and interdisciplinary methodologies for dealing with the relationship between theology and the sciences.</p>
<p>The strength of this work is found in nesting youth ministry within the larger field of practical theology and showing what difference it makes (ultimately that work with youth and the lives of youth are best approached with the kind of deep theological reflection that we exercise for understanding the sacraments or the nature of sin). And not only are they calling for youth ministers to be practical theologians, but as Deans puts it, “God calls youth to become ‘practical theologians’ in their own right” (77).</p>
<p>A couple of challenges. At times the arguments verge on overstatement, especially in relation to earlier work in youth ministry and Christian education. For example, the notion that youth ministry, two decades ago, was cocooned by Christian education dominated by social sciences hardly seems fair to key voices of Christian education in the 1980s: Thomas Groome, Maria Harris, James Loder, Freda Gardner, Craig Dykstra, Sara Little, David Ng, or Bill Myers for example. Many of these same figures have been crucial to the emergence of practical theology as a sturdy academic field.</p>
<p>In addition, the book is written with two different voices—some chapters are from Dean (and identified as such), others are from Root. While they are in the same general territory of how they approach youth ministry, they are not identical thinkers, and they have distinctive writing styles. All the work has apparently been published before in other forms, so the book represents a kind of compilation, and the style of writing changes dramatically at times. On the other hand, two voices and varieties of style bring some benefits as well. For example, Root will speak to those particularly concerned with methodological questions and some of the schools of thought behind methodological decisions; Dean will speak to those who love metaphor and enjoy reflecting upon the intersection of culture, theology, and the lives of young people.</p>
