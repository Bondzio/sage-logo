<abstract>
<p>This article is based on data obtained from an investigation of the needs of the elderly living in the suburbs of Katutura, Windhoek, Namibia. The theoretical framework utilized in this study is the human scale development approach of Manfred Max-Neef. Primary data were collected by means of face-to-face interviews with 383 elderly men and women living Katutura. It was found that many of the subsistence and protection needs of the elderly are not being met and that although the elderly are increasing in number, they continue to be a forgotten population.</p>

<p>Most Namibians, as is the case with most Africans, enter old age after a lifetime of poverty and deprivation. With the aged making up an increasing proportion of the population of developing societies, it is clear that this demographic reality poses a major challenge to countries still dealing with basic development issues. The well-being of the elderly in developing societies necessitates urgent policy attention, and one area that has to be investigated is the needs of the elderly. In this regard, the development framework of Manfred Max-Neef was used to analyze the needs of the elderly in Namibia.</p>
<sec id="section1-0164027512439071">
<title>Research Problem</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027512439071">Kalasa (2001)</xref> notes that many African countries are not ready for the changes occurring in the age structures of their populations and also argues that development programs have typically ignored population aging and have failed to emphasize the rights and needs of older people. Ironically, development agencies have contributed to accelerated population aging through fertility control and effective maternal and child health care but seem to neglect a symbol of their long-term successes, the elderly.</p>
<p>In addition, most research in developing countries is focused on infants, the youth, and maternal well-being, whereas few national studies have been conducted on the needs and satisfaction of the elderly. Given the fact that old age holds many challenges for individuals in sustaining their basic needs, it is necessary to investigate the needs of the elderly to adequately address them within a broader development framework.</p>
<sec id="section2-0164027512439071">
<title>Study Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in Namibia, an African country situated on the west coast of Africa (surrounded by the neighboring countries Angola, Zambia, Botswana, and South Africa). Namibia was previously known as South West Africa, and when the country won its independence in 1990, the name was changed to Namibia. The population was estimated at 2.2 million in 2010, of whom 4% are 65 years of age or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027512439071">Population Reference Bureau 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Unemployment and poverty are major problems confronting Namibian people today, with an unemployment rate of 51% (2008) and more than half (55.8%) of the population living below the poverty line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027512439071">Central Intelligence Agency 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027512439071">Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This study was carried out in the city of Windhoek, in a suburb located northwest of the city center, known as Katutura. Windhoek, the capital city of Namibia, is the economic and political center of the country. The building of Katutura (which is Herero for “a place where we will never settle” or “we have no place to stay”),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0164027512439071">1</xref></sup> began in the late 1950s and was based on the apartheid principle of dividing people according to ethnicity. Thus, people were allocated their own areas, known as <italic>lokasies</italic> (locations), with large letters painted on the doors of houses to denote ethnicity: O for Owambo, H for Herero, and so on. Katutura also housed the migrant workers from the north of the country. It is currently home to more than half of the city’s population and is made up of the poorest and most vulnerable factions of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027512439071">Frayne 2000</xref>). It should be noted that the name <italic>Katutura</italic> is used to refer to both the formal area of the township as well as the informal surrounding areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0164027512439071">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>The theoretical framework utilized in this study is the human scale development approach of Manfred Max-Neef. Max-Neef, together with coworkers Elizalde and Hopenhayn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027512439071">1991</xref>), developed a taxonomy of human needs and established what became known in development literature as the Human Scale Development School. This approach questioned the one-dimensional perspective of economics and development theory, which, according to Max-Neef, focused too narrowly on <italic>chrematistics</italic> or the monetary aspects of being. His approach, on the other hand, stresses the multidimensional aspects of human well-being and emphasizes <italic>oikonomy</italic>—the art of living well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027512439071">Cruz, Stahel, and Max-Neef 2009</xref>). The theorists stress that central to this paradigm is “an inquiry into the nature of human needs and the way different societies have chosen different sets of satisfiers in order to fulfil them, attaining varying degrees of well-being and autonomy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027512439071">Cruz et al. 2009</xref>:2025). According to this framework, humans have nine fundamental needs that are universal, and the only variation occurs in how people satisfy these needs over historical time periods and across cultures. The needs operate on different existential levels: being, having, doing, and interacting (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027512439071">Table 1</xref>). Satisfiers of the needs may satisfy one or more needs, and a need may also require more than one satisfier to be fulfilled.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>According to this framework, “being” refers to a personal or collective attribute (usually expressed as noun related to the subject’s intrinsic attributes such as biological constitution), “having” refers to the tools, mechanisms, institutions, and norms than can be utilized, “doing” has to do with action, and “interaction” makes reference to locations or milieus. The way that the different satisfiers are articulated leads to the satisfaction (or not) of specific human needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027512439071">Cruz et al. 2009</xref>). It was within this framework that the researchers approached the investigation into the needs of the elderly living in Katutura, operationalizing the satisfiers of subsistence and protection needs in a questionnaire and then measuring if and how the need was being satisfied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0164027512439071">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Although the broader study focused on the first three needs, subsistence, protection, and affection, this article focuses on the subsistence and protection needs of the elderly as they relates to health, food, shelter, work, income, clothing, being able to care for oneself, and safety.</p>
<sec id="section5-0164027512439071">
<title>Subsistence Needs</title>
<p>Subsistence needs can be likened to the physiological needs identified by Maslow. This need refers to the basic human need to subsist (exist), and this need is satisfied, according to Max-Neef, by the person being healthy, having food, shelter, and work, and being able to feed and dress himself or herself and engaging in productive activities.</p>
<sec id="section6-0164027512439071">
<title>Being healthy</title>
<p>Being healthy is an important satisfier of subsistence needs that has particular relevance to the aging process. With old age health usually declines, and this deterioration may negatively affect relationships if the elderly cannot take part in shared activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027512439071">Knipscheer et al. 1995</xref>). This, in turn, has consequences for the satisfaction and affection needs of the elderly. In addition, declining physical abilities can lead to a loss of self-respect as well as separation and solitude (intersecting with the freedom and identity needs) and are also associated with reduced capacity to be economically active, which intensifies poverty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0164027512439071">
<title>Having food</title>
<p>Food is a basic requirement for survival and is placed first in most need hierarchies. In this regard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027512439071">HelpAge International (2010)</xref> has found that more than half of the ill-health conditions suffered by elderly patients in developing countries was brought on, or aggravated by, malnutrition. In the face of scarcity, the elderly are often prioritized last by others and/or themselves. Although Max-Neef moved away from a strictly economic interpretation of development and even preferred to talk about “poverties,” one cannot deny the importance of money when satisfying subsistence needs, particularly when the need for food cannot be satisfied by an alternative (such as a food garden or charitable food provision).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0164027512439071">
<title>Having shelter</title>
<p>Shelter that is adequate and appropriate for the elderly is essential to their well-being. Many of the elderly in developing societies find themselves living in informal settlements or shanty towns with no access to electricity, clean water, garbage disposal, or flush toilets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027512439071">Tati 2009</xref>). In extreme cases the elderly may be homeless, with no fixed shelter. Adequate shelter is a synergistic satisfier, intersecting on many levels with other needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0164027512439071">
<title>Work</title>
<p>Free time and leisure are differentially distributed over the life cycle. During the adult years societal values dictate that an individual should be committed to work, and a sense of identity and self-respect often depends on this. Both paid work and unpaid work are relevant to the elderly. First, having work that is remunerated provides the elderly with an income that can satisfy other needs, and having had a paid job earlier in life makes it possible for the elderly to prepare for old age. Second, having work to perform, even if it is not remunerated, can lead to a feeling of well-being and satisfaction and can enhance social status because of their ability to make a meaningful contribution to the household or community.</p>
<p>The actual ability of elderly persons to <italic>feed</italic> and <italic>clothe</italic> themselves as well as having opportunities to <italic>rest</italic> make up another important dimension of subsistence needs. This too was included in the study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0164027512439071">
<title>Protection Needs</title>
<p>The need for protection is the second need identified by Max-Neef. This can be seen as the need to protect oneself from harm and the need to be and feel secure. It is satisfied by having personal autonomy and being able to adapt. In addition, this need is also satisfied by having social arrangements in place that protect the individual’s well-being and security (be it physical, emotional, or spiritual).</p>
<p>Following this line of reasoning, <italic>health care services</italic> should be in place and function well to address the health concerns of the elderly (thereby satisfying the need for subsistence and protection). In developing countries, a lack of specialized health care services for the elderly within the public health care sector, the negative attitudes of service providers, long distances to health care facilities, a shortage of supplies, a lack of physical and financial capacity of the elderly to reach the facilities, and the cost incurred for treatment are some of the factors that hinder older persons from accessing health care and thus negatively affect the satisfaction of needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027512439071">Najjumba-Mulindwa 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Social security, which falls under protection needs in the taxonomy, is usually provided to the elderly in the form of an old-age pension. Although pensions are relatively common in more developed societies, not many African countries have old-age pension schemes. Namibia, like South Africa, is one of the few countries in Africa offering social and welfare assistance programs for older adults. The old-age pension provision in Namibia is noncontributory, is means tested, and amounts to NAD450 (approx. US$65) per month. This money is supposed to be used for all the basic needs of the household including municipal water and electricity, food, medical expenses, transport, general support, and other general expenses.</p>
<p>What often happens is that this paltry pension is seen as a means of survival by other members of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027512439071">May 2003</xref>). In some instances then the old-age pension may act as a destructive satisfier, as it attracts desperate family members, often giving rise to a situation where the elderly do not have enough left to satisfy their own needs. On the other hand, any form of income in a poverty-stricken country confers a certain amount of power to the individual and in this case can act as a synergistic satisfier where the satisfaction of one need stimulates or contributes to the satisfaction of other needs, for example, an elderly person providing for grandchildren and in turn being cared for and loved by them (need for affection).</p>

<sec id="section11-0164027512439071">
<title>Purpose and Value of the Study</title>
<p>The primary aim of the study was to conduct a preliminary analysis of how the elderly in Katutura satisfy their subsistence, protection, and affection needs. The value of the study is believed to be twofold. First, the research project seeks to make policy makers aware of the needs of the elderly. Second, from a theoretical point of view, the theoretical framework of Max-Neef was applied methodologically, thus expanding the usefulness of this model for future researchers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0164027512439071" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This article is based on quantitative and qualitative data collected by means of a survey among the elderly living in Katutura. A questionnaire, which included both open and closed questions, was constructed around the taxonomy of needs identified by the human scale development approach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0164027512439071">2</xref></sup> The questionnaire consisted four sections: demographic information, subsistence needs, protection needs, and affection needs. Demographic questions included, sex, age, marital status, living arrangements, and home ownership and occupancy. The section on subsistence needs included questions that asked respondents to rate their own health and whether or not they experience certain ailments. “Having food” was measured by establishing how many meals the elderly ate per day and whether or not these meals were enough to satisfy hunger. In addition, sources of food were investigated by asking questions about who mainly provided food for the elderly and where this food was obtained from. The elderly were asked to describe and rate their dwellings in terms of hygiene, size, “elderly friendliness,” and whether or not basic services were available in the dwellings. With regard to protection needs, the elderly were questioned whether or not they received an old-age grant and whether this was enough to satisfy their needs. In addition, physical safety was measured by means of questions relating to how safe the elderly perceived themselves to be and what, if anything, they felt threatened by. Access to health care was measured by asking questions pertaining to affordability and accessibility of health care.</p>
<p>Data were gathered by means of face-to-face interviews as this method best caters to elderly people who are illiterate and/or have lost their sight. The interviews were all conducted in the mother tongue of the participants and took place at the end of 2010.</p>
<p>The target population was the elderly (65 years and older) residents of Katutura who were willing to be included in the study. According to the latest available census figures, there are 71,126 elderly residents in Katutura, and based on this a sample of 383 respondents was selected. Using multistage stratified sampling, the percentage of each constituency within Katutura was established, and according to this the number of respondents was selected. Then, based on the gender proportions of each area, this figure was further broken down into the number of male and the number of female respondents needed. This method was used so that the sample would be as representative of the elderly population in Katutura as possible.</p>
<p>Data cleaning was done by checking completeness and editing in the field prior to data entry. Detected errors were corrected immediately. Data obtained from the interview schedule were coded and entered using EpInfo software. Univariate (distributions, modes) and bivariate (subgroup comparisons) analyses were carried out.</p>
<p>The ethical principle of “informed consent” was adhered to in this study. Although informed consent stipulates obtaining the participant’s consent in writing, many participants were not prepared to sign their names to protect their identities. The participants were, however, fully informed about the nature and purpose of the study and what the value of their contribution would be. Participants were encouraged to contact the researcher if they had any queries or misgivings about the study. The purpose and procedures were briefly explained to both the elderly and their caregivers. This included the following aspects:</p>
<list id="list1-0164027512439071" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Participation was completely voluntary and could be terminated at any point in time with no penalty.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The participant’s right to refuse to participate in the study and their right to withdraw their participation at any stage were respected at all times. No respondent was forced to take part in the study.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regarding confidentiality, the interviewers pledged to hold the identities of all participants in the strictest confidence and never to reveal them to anyone but the researcher, who is also bound by a pledge of confidentiality. It was explained to the respondents that the information collected would be presented in a report that would be available to users but that it would refer only to a study conducted in the Katutura suburb and would not mention the names and/or house numbers of respondents. Relating to the aforementioned, respondents’ names were never mentioned, and they cannot be identified by outsiders through the research report.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition to the above, the proposal was submitted to the Research Management Committee of the Ministry of Health and Social Services in Namibia as a goal of the study was to collect information relating, in part, to the health issues of the elderly. Permission for the study was granted.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section14-0164027512439071">
<title>Profile of the Respondents</title>
<p>Of the respondents, 44% were 65 to 69 years of age, followed by 38% who fell in the 70 to 79 category; the age group of 80 to 89 years made up 16% of the sample, whereas those who were the oldest, 90 to 100 years or older, accounted for only 2% of the sample.</p>
<p>In Namibia the sex ratio of the general population is 97.4 men for every 100 females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027512439071">United Nations 2010</xref>). It is not uncommon for women to outnumber men in the older age groups. In this sample just more than half (54%) were female and 46% were male. The sample proportion compared well with the national figures, where 45% of people aged 65 and older are male and 55% are female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027512439071">United Nations 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the respondents interviewed, 33% indicated that they were married and 5% that they were living with a partner. Of the remaining respondents, 31% were widowers or widows, 17% were single, 8% were separated, and the remaining 5% were divorced. Thus, 38% of the elderly living in Katutura have a partner and 62% do not. Those who do not have life partners may be more dependent on help from children or the extended family, and it could be argued that if close relationships with friends or family members do not exist, these elderly individuals may experience social isolation (negatively affecting the satisfaction of several other needs).</p>

<title>Health of the elderly in the Katutura township</title>
<p>Health forms a crucial aspect of well-being. The health status of the elderly in Katutura was investigated by means of various questions that cut across both the subsistence and protection dimensions: subsistence as it relates to “having” health and protection as is relates to being able to access a health care system.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked to rate their health in general on a scale. Of the elderly, 54% rated their health as “very unhealthy” or “unhealthy” and 38% regarded themselves as “healthy” or “very healthy” (the rest being unsure). Taking into consideration that these are elderly individuals and that health declines with age, it is quite positive that almost 40% of this group report good health. The respondents were then asked to indicate whether or not they experienced the following health problems on a scale from 1 (<italic>almost all the time</italic>) to 4 (<italic>never</italic>). The findings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027512439071">table 2</xref>) reveal the following:</p>

<p>As far as heart problems, low blood pressure, and confusion go, the overwhelming majority indicated that they are not plagued by these conditions. Ailments that do appear to bother the elderly include joint pains, experienced often or almost always by 53% of respondents, and high blood pressure and backaches, experienced often or nearly all of the time by just more than half of the sample. The findings also reveal that diabetes has never been experienced by 75% of the elderly.</p>
<p>In terms of chronic diseases, high blood pressure seems to be the biggest risk factor; however, one must keep in mind that diabetes is a chronic disease that often goes undetected, and thus a self-reported absence of the disease may underestimate the actual prevalence. The other ailments are degenerative and are related to joint pains and backaches. In terms of poor hearing and eyesight, the findings reveal lower levels than would be expected.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the elderly were asked the following open-ended question to explore their own perceptions of how ill health affects life: “How does the life of an elderly person who is healthy, differ from that of an elderly person who suffers from ill health?”</p>
<p>From this study it appears that just more than half of the elderly respondents report poor health and mainly allude to the fact that this affects their ability to carry out roles:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now that I am old I cannot do everything for myself, for example, I cannot go to shops or do laundry.</p>
<p>I cannot clean my house or do laundry because of joint pain.</p>
<p>I was very hardworking and active, now I am unable to even clean the house because of pains all over.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In terms of Max-Neef’s taxonomy, health systems fall within the dimension of protection needs. Affordability of services is a crucial aspect of health care, as it influences the quality of care the recipient will be able to choose as well as the decision to seek health care. The elderly were asked to indicate whether they can afford medical care when they need it and whether they go without medical care because they cannot afford it. In all, 36% indicated that they could not afford it, and 33% have gone without medical care in the past because they could not afford it.</p>
<p>Sons or daughters and other family members are the main sources of help when it comes to paying for medical care, with 70% of medical costs being paid by these sources.</p>
<p>The findings indicate that the elderly feel more welcome at clinics than they do at hospitals, although the difference is not huge. What is concerning is that a quarter of the elderly feel unwelcome at clinics and hospitals, and this may discourage them from seeking medical attention when they need it.</p>
<p>Just fewer than half of the respondents (42%) indicated that the health care they receive is not of an acceptable quality, whereas 36% said they are receiving quality care (22% being uncertain). Of the elderly who voiced their dissatisfaction with care, many expressed needs for home-based care, transport to the facilities, clinics for the elderly only, and translation services.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They must have a section for the elderly people in the hospital.</p>
<p>Like me, have to go to hospital to collect tablets for high blood pressure. If they were delivered at our houses . . . . We go only to the hospital when we need to see the doctor.</p>
<p>At least they should have translators to translate for us . . . as most of the doctors do not understand our local languages.</p>

<sec id="section17-0164027512439071">
<title>Having food</title>
<p>Having food is an important subsistence satisfier, and in this regard the elderly were asked how many meals they eat a day and (in a separate question) whether or not they feel that they have enough food to eat at meals.</p>
<p>Of the respondents, almost half (47%) eat three meals per day, 37% eat two meals a day, and 5% are eating only one meal per day. Of the respondents, 11% indicated that they eat more that three times a day. Although these figures may make one optimistic, it is important to consider the above information in relation to the following: More meals does not necessarily mean more food; it may be that the meals are inadequate for the needs of the elderly. In this regard, respondents were also asked if their food was “enough” for them, in an attempt to find out if their need for food was being satisfied.</p>
<p>Of the respondents, 43% indicated that their food is seldom or never enough to satisfy their hunger. This is a large proportion of elderly people going hungry. When asked why they do not eat enough, the following reasons were given:
<disp-quote>
<p>I eat seldom because I have to feed the family.</p>
<p>Food is never enough, it’s expensive.</p>
<p>The pension is very little . . . food is never enough.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of those who stated that their food is never or seldom enough suggested the following to help satisfy this need: (1) government provision of food, (2) food aid or free food from an unspecified source, (3) an increase in the monthly pension, and (4) discounts on basic services (to free up more money for food consumption).</p>
<p>Sons and daughters were the main providers of food (42%), followed by the elderly person himself or herself (40%); other family members provide food in 11% of the cases and spouses in 5% of cases, whereas other non–family members provide food to 2% of the elderly. More than half of the elderly are dependent on someone else to provide them with food, indicating their vulnerability when it comes to satisfying this need.</p>
<p>Of the elderly who provide their own food, the overwhelming majority (98%) indicated that they get their food from the shops. The elderly in Katutura are mainly relying on purchased food, which is usually more expensive than food from any other source. For this reason elderly people indicate that the government should assist them in providing food for them by increasing the pension, providing free food, or discounting all services. In addition, even though food gardens are often thought of as a cheap alternative, this may not always offer a solution to the needs of the elderly, as demonstrated by one elderly resident:
<disp-quote>
<p>Water is expensive, I cannot afford a garden even if I want to have it in the yard.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of the respondents, 81% indicated that there are no food aid organization in Katutura to assist them, whereas 3% stated the opposite (16% of the respondents were unsure). This is an indication that there are very few or no food aid organizations in Katutura, and if they do in fact exist, they are relatively unknown. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority (88%) of respondents expressed their need for a food organization in Katutura.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0164027512439071">
<title>Housing conditions of the elderly in Katutura</title>
<p>The study revealed that 45% of the respondents live in their own houses, whereas 24% live with their sons or daughters, 12% live with other family members, 15% live in their partner’s house or a co-owned house, and 1% live in houses owned by unspecified others. This is a positive finding in terms of subsistence needs as it implies that at least 45% of the elderly in Katutura are not at the mercy of others when it comes to housing, which can positively affect their security needs.</p>
<p>A house should be comfortable, with enough space to foster privacy and free movement. In this regard, the elderly were asked to rate their house in terms of adequacy. Of the respondents, 55% indicated that the houses they live in are adequate or more than adequate for their needs. On the other hand, 23% of the respondents are of the opinion that their houses are slightly inadequate and 22% of the elderly feel that their houses are totally inadequate for their needs. Following up on those who regarded their houses as inadequate, the main reason for this sentiment was the size of the dwelling, with almost a quarter (22%) of the respondents being of the opinion that their house is too small. Other reasons included a lack of basic services and structural problems that make their houses unsuitable for an elderly person:
<disp-quote>
<p>The floor is so bad, I fell down badly and fractured my hip, it is now the second time.</p>
<p>This house is too old . . . there is no money to make it better.</p>
<p>I cannot move freely in this house and there is not enough space to store my belongings.</p>
<p>I wish I could stay somewhere else, it gets too hot and too cold in this house.</p>
<p>My shack does not have windows for ventilation.</p>
<p>This house is like a tin . . . is a shack, we are many living here.</p>
<p>Some people sleep on the floor in the sitting room.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One quarter of the elderly (26%) do not have electricity in their houses. It was also found that 40% are without piped water in their homes, forcing them to get water from sources outside the house, which is strenuous and time-consuming. Although 60% of the respondents indicated that they have water available in the house, only 57% of houses have flush toilets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0164027512439071">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with housing is evident, with three quarters (77%) of the elderly being of the opinion that the government does not provide decent housing for the elderly.</p>

<sec id="section19-0164027512439071">
<title>Financial care of the elderly</title>
<p>A reliable source of income fosters a sense of security and provides protection from deprivation. Of all respondents, 97% receive an old-age pension from the government, and the overwhelming proportion of these respondents (75%) feel that this pension of NAD450 is not sufficient to cover their basic needs. Once again, the sentiment exists that it is the responsibility of the government to increase the pension. Before retirement age, a large proportion (42%) of the elderly worked as domestic workers, and only 14% of the respondents did professional work (including as nurses, teachers, pastors, and soldiers), whereas 5% were never part of the labor force. These elderly did not (were unable to) establish a private pension, and consequently an overdependence on a state-provided old-age pension exists. With poverty so prevalent in Namibia, the families of the elderly cannot always care for the elderly as they themselves are destitute.</p>

<title>Clothing needs of the elderly</title>
<p>Apart from serving the basic function of protecting the body against the elements, looking good and dressing well contribute to maintaining self-esteem. To assess this aspect, the elderly were asked to indicate if they have enough shoes and blankets as well as clothing for special occasions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0164027512439071">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>A relatively large proportion (67%) of the elderly indicated that they do not have enough blankets, with 7% indicating that they have no blankets. The findings suggest that this basic need (to be warm when sleeping) is not being satisfied.</p>
<p>Shoes are important as they protect the feet and allow an individual to walk further without injury. A total of 65% stated that they have shoes but not enough shoes, whereas 7% of the respondents mentioned that they have no shoes. A similar pattern to the need for blankets emerges in the case of shoes—almost three quarters of the elderly do not possess these basic necessities.</p>
<p>With regard to clothes, the respondents were asked whether or not they had enough clothing for everyday use and whether or not they had clothing for special occasions such as weddings and funerals. As mentioned before, apart from covering the body, clothes also give a level of prestige or status to their wearer. Not having enough clothing could thus negatively affect the esteem needs of the elderly. Of the elderly, 70% feel the need for more everyday clothes (even though 7% of the respondents indicated that they do not have any clothing for everyday use, no respondents were without clothes while being interviewed—this may be interpreted as a dire need where the respondent has only one set of clothing for everyday use or that the respondent has to wear someone else’s clothes). Clothing for special occasions is clearly a luxury, with 28% indicating they have no “special occasion” clothes.</p>

<sec id="section21-0164027512439071">
<title>The ability of the elderly to care for themselves and to rest</title>
<p>Aging brings about changes that may hamper one’s ability to feed and dress oneself and to work around the house. Of the respondents, 82% indicated that they are able to feed themselves; the same percentage of the respondents were still able to dress themselves. These percentages reveal that a relatively large proportion of the elderly are able to satisfy the need for feeding and clothing themselves. As with feeding oneself, dressing oneself is also important as the elderly are able to decide which clothes to put on depending on the weather and special occasions. Only 2% of the respondents indicated that they are never able to feed or dress themselves.</p>
<p>Of the respondents, 63% said they are able to work around the house. The ability to carry out household chores is a prerequisite for someone to be able to take care of himself or herself, and with old age this ability is negatively affected by a host of factors such as loss of sight, limited movement because of pain, and so on. Although a smaller proportion are able to carry out household chores than are able to feed and clothe themselves, this stands to reason as it demands greater physical exertion.</p>
<p>The second part of Max-Neef’s “doing” aspect of subsistence involves the ability to rest. Having the chance and autonomy to rest is also crucial because otherwise the elderly will not be able to get enough rest. Rest can be affected by many factors such as noise, uncomfortable temperatures, and a lack of space and privacy. Of the respondents, 62% indicated that they are often able to rest when they need to do so, whereas 23% are able to rest sometimes and 10% are seldom able to rest when they want to. Of the respondents, 6% are never able to rest when they need to do so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0164027512439071">
<title>Safety</title>
<p>When it comes to safety the elderly are especially vulnerable as they are often not able to defend themselves when attacked. The findings indicate that the majority (69%) of the elderly in Katutura feel unsafe in their houses.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Today’s youth can do anything to you for money.</p>
<p>I cannot move around I am afraid of criminals.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This last comment by a respondent suggests that because the protection needs of the elderly are not being satisfied, other needs, such as those for friendship and affection, cannot be satisfied because of the fact that the elderly are afraid to move around the neighborhood. These safety concerns negatively affect the satisfaction of other needs. Of the 31% of the respondents who said they feel safe, many attribute this to their religious convictions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you don’t believe in God you fear, but if you believe in God you fear nothing.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study investigated the subsistence and protection needs and satisfiers of the elderly living in the suburbs of Katutura. It was found that many of these needs are not being adequately satisfied.</p>
<p>Just more than half of the elderly do not experience good health, and their relationship with the health care system is not positive. The children of the elderly are the main satisfiers of health care expenses, and this puts an added burden on already impoverished families. The elderly themselves regard health services as unaffordable, and some of the elderly do without health care when they need it. The standard of care received in public health institutions is regarded as substandard and not “user-friendly” for the elderly. Almost half of the elderly indicate that the provision of home-based care will make it easier for them to get medical care. It is clear that reaching the health care facility and engaging with the staff are problematic for the elderly.</p>
<p>The need for food appears to be addressed mainly by the elderly themselves and their sons and/or daughters. However, this need is not fully satisfied, as an unacceptable proportion of the elderly are going hungry. In this regard, the establishment of a sustainable food organization has to be investigated. Although the government provides the elderly in Namibia with an old-age pension of NAD450 per month, this is not enough to provide for all of their subsistence needs. The study revealed that the elderly themselves and their children are the main sources of satisfying home ownership needs. The supply of basic services to the elderly has to be addressed, as too many of the elderly are still without basic services. One aspect of subsistence needs that demands urgent attention is clothes, shoes, and blankets. The ability to care for themselves in terms of feeding and dressing appears to be a need satisfied mainly by the elderly themselves, with more than 80% of the respondents still being able to do this.</p>
<p>Policy makers need to recognize the fact that although family support is evident from this study, poverty may affect the ability of the family to adequately care for the elderly should they be unable to care for themselves. In this regard then, the historic role of government as a compassionate caregiver should be reemphasized and reflected in policy. In particular, the following areas can be addressed: a reevaluation of the old-age pension and the establishment of food aid agencies that will last in the long term and be sustainable. In addition, policy makers need to place the demographic reality of an increasingly aged population on the agenda to address the specific needs of this growing population.</p>
<p>The researchers believe that this study will make a modest contribution toward the establishment of support systems for the elderly, insofar as it provides evidence of unsatisfied needs. In addition, it is hoped that this study will stimulate other students, professionals, and government officials to conduct similar studies in geriatric care and support on a national level and to establish a comprehensive, updated database to inform government and NGOs when addressing the needs of the elderly.</p>
<p>The researchers have found the human scale development approach to be a very useful framework for analyzing the needs of the elderly. Further research in this area should endeavor to expand on the needs covered by this study and should also explore the functioning of the satisfiers by means of bi- and multivariate analyses.</p>
