<sec id="sec1-1741134311433377"><title>Barriers to generic competition must be eliminated</title>
<p>Although generic medicines are essential for the German pharmaceutical market, market entry for these high quality but affordable medicines is becoming increasingly difficult. This is not only a consequence of governmental health policy, but also a result of certain actions by health insurance companies. They are increasingly making contracts with manufacturers before patents expire in an attempt to save costs at the beginning, but in the long term, this leads to overspending. This is also proven by several scientific studies, which were commissioned by different sides.</p>
<p>A current report commissioned by the generic trade association Pro Generika shows how generic medicines competition is hindered in Germany, the largest European pharmaceutical market, and what impact this has on pharmaceutical expenditure.</p>
<p>Pro Generika is certain of one thing: Whoever wishes to permanently profit from sustainable generic medicines competition has to meet the necessary requirements. There is not a lot of time left to achieve this. Numerous patents with a potential profit of €3 billion will have expired by 2013. Massive savings are in danger. It is the time to act.</p>
<p>Germany is not only the largest pharmaceutical market in Europe. The most densely populated country in Europe is also a home to the largest generic medicines market within the EU. Since the introduction of the first generic medicines in Germany more than 30 years ago, these high quality but affordable secondary products, freed from the patents of their original suppliers, have begun a positive course.</p>
<p>In the beginning, doctors and pharmacists treated in particular the introduction of the new generic medicines with scepticism. Especially in relation to bioavailability, it was assumed that generic medicines would not have the same standard of quality as the initial suppliers, despite having approval from regulatory authorities.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741134311433377"><title>Generic medicines – unavoidable for a comprehensive supply of pharmaceuticals</title>
<p>Today, generic medicines are, without a doubt, of major importance for the supply of pharmaceuticals in Germany. Almost 70% of all medicines given to patients with statutory health insurance (SHI) are generic medicines. The health insurance companies must, in contrast, use only 22% of their pharmaceutical expenditure for generic pharmaceuticals (measured on exfactory prices). The reason for this is the low price of generic medicines, which are priced at about 56% below the average of all medicines prescribed at the expense of the health insurance companies. The prices of generic medicines have alone, since 2005, decreased on an average of about 20%. Only through the use of generic medicines was the German healthcare system able to save more than €10 billion in 2010.</p>
<p>This is a result of a healthcare system that is motivated by generic price competition. Its goal is to permanently treat more patients at a lower cost. The more the generic companies that enter the pharmaceutical market quickly after patent protection ends, the more intense the competition and the greater are the savings for the health insurance companies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1741134311433377"><title>Legal framework</title>
<p>Besides rethinking on the part of the medical profession in the direction of generics, the increasing participation of generic medicines is possible, amongst other things, because German pharmacies are obligated to substitute doctor-prescribed medicines for one of the three cheapest generic medicines (‘<italic>aut idem</italic> rule’). Requirements for the exchanged medicines are:
<list id="list1-1741134311433377" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the same active ingredient;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the same packet size;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the same dose;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the same pharmaceutical form as the prescribed medicine; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that the doctor has not excluded the substitution of the prescribed medicine.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Besides this ‘<italic>aut idem</italic> rule’, cost pressures were responsible for the constantly increasing market share of generic medicines. These are considerably more cost-effective at market entry level than the respective original supplier medicines. The instrument of force since 1989, the ‘Festbetrag’ (fixed reimbursement amount), also ensures that generic medicines are on the way to always being cheaper.</p>
<p>The fixed reimbursement amount establishes the price up to the amount that is reimbursed by the health insurance company for prescription medicines. If the medicine prescribed by the doctor costs more that the maximum allowable cost, then the patient must pay the difference out of his own pocket. Since 2006, patients in Germany have been exempt from the payment by the basic patient co-payment principal (according to package size €5, €8 or €10 per medicine), if this amount falls below at least 30%.</p>
<p>The introduction of these rules led to a real drop in prices for the generic medicines market. Both the maximum allowable cost system and the co-payment exemption limit are adjusted periodically to market trends. Constantly falling prices consequently means that these prices are permanently corrected downwards.</p>
<p>As a result of this development, there was a real price erosion in the German generics market, which in turn caused numerous manufacturers to relocate their production to lower wage countries. This trend was further accelerated by further cost-cutting measures.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741134311433377"><title>A new cost-cutting measure: discount contracts</title>
<p>In addition to the already long-standing portfolio of contracts, since 2007, the health insurance companies have put out tenders for individual agents as part of discount contracts. The contract is awarded, depending on the health insurance company, to one or more suppliers. To some extent, Germany is for this purpose divided into different territories. Quality and ability to deliver should naturally pay a part in the invitation to tender. Price is, however, the ultimate decider.</p>
<p>This creates a predicament for generic manufacturers. Since the pharmacies are obliged by existing discount agreements on prescription medicines to only supply the medicines of the respective discount partner, those companies which have not been awarded a contract are excluded for the entire term that the contract runs from this segment of the public healthcare market. Then again, the generic manufacturers who are willing to provide the best price are the ones who receive the contracts. This ‘logic’ has in recent years led to a hitherto of unprecedented undercutting, which dramatically minimized the earnings of the generics industry. Besides the loss of investment opportunities, such as the development of biosimilars (see below), this has led to the dismantling of structures and the relocation of production to low-wage countries.</p>
<p>Since the discount amount granted between the contracting parties (health insurance companies and manufacturers) is agreed in secret, the formerly transparent German pharmaceutical market has now become completely opaque. For several years, original manufacturers have also been using this instrument to extend the market exclusivity of their products beyond the patent expiration.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741134311433377"><title>Increasing barriers hinder competition</title>
<p>Sustained competition of generic medicines has been increasingly hindered by various barriers in recent years.</p>
<p>Because a real patent jungle of main and secondary patent holders prevails for many initial suppliers, market entry for generic medicines is becoming increasingly risky. Again and again, it comes to patent disputes before the courts, which have in the past meant that generic medicines that were already on the market have had to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>‘Secondary’ patents for galenical preparations, for example, force generic companies into internal development, which in turn lead to misinformation campaigns about the equivalence of generic medicines.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the original manufacturers try to get licence extensions or product adaptations in order to extend the patent protection, or at least to achieve a <italic>de facto</italic> extension of the exclusivity of their products beyond patent expiration.</p>
<p>The subsequent admission for children medicines was, for example, extended because of the EU Pediatric Regulation to protect market exclusivity by 6 months. A recent example is atorvastatin of Pfizer, which just received a prolonged market exclusivity of 6 months in the EU. Therefore, generic competition will not start before May 2012 in Germany.</p>
<p>Adjustments to the product include the already mentioned introduction of patented galenics as well as the introduction of new pack sizes shortly before patent expiry. The latter prevents the exchange for generic medicines in the pharmacy.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741134311433377"><title>Discount contracts before patent expiration cost the health insurance bodies more than they save</title>
<p>Discount agreements on patent expirations between health insurance companies and original manufacturers especially hinder sustainable competition. They accounted for 32% of all discounts after sales in April 2011.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the active ingredient olanzapine. About 125 health insurance companies with more than 41 million members have signed discount agreements by the end of September 2011 for the expired patent on the medicine Zyprexa<sup>®</sup>. Although the patent protection of the antipsychotic has come to an end, the generic competition is thereby hardly moving. Despite patent expiration, the discount contracts with the health insurance companies are still valid. The vast majority of the health insurance market is, therefore, blocked for the much cheaper generic olanzapine.</p>
<p>Although generic medicines are considerably lower in cost, pharmacies are obliged by German law to provide the product of the original manufacturer for the period of their exclusive discount contract. According to a current study by the Berlin IGES Institute<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741134311433377">†</xref></sup>
<fn id="fn1-1741134311433377"><label>†</label><p>Name of the IGES study: “Generika in Deutschland: Wettbewerb fördern – Wirtschaftlichkeit stärken”, October 2011.</p></fn> on behalf of Pro Generika, this heightens not only market concentration, but also means that initial savings by the health insurance companies will eventually lead to losses over time. This is especially true when long-term discount agreements to prevent the market entry of generic pharmaceutical companies are made and thereby weaken price competition.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134311433377"><title>Discount contracts increase market concentration</title>
<p>Even without the influence of originators, discount contracts increase market concentration and thereby hinder competition. In 2010, the top 10 generic medicines manufacturers had a market share of 75% of the entire discount market. The largest German health insurance provider (AOK) awarded more than 75% of the past few instalments of their discount contracts to just three to five suppliers. This also hinders competition through multiplicity of generic companies and ultimately leads to lesser savings for the health insurance providers.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134311433377"><title>More providers – lower prices</title>
<p>An IGES study based on 16 examined active ingredients and the intensity of their respective competitions shows dramatically how less generic competition affects the public health system. The institute distinguishes three competition classes.
<list id="list2-1741134311433377" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In the first group with effective competition (active ingredients tamsulosin, alfuzosin, pantoprazole, azithromycin, nebivolol, venlafaxine), the market share of the generic medicines was more than 85% after 2 years. This group was set as the reference group.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the second group, in which the institute could find only limited competition (active ingredients risperidone, fluvastatin, oxycodone, clopidogrel, oxcarbazepine, hydromorphone), only 40% to 85% of the generic market share was achieved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In Group 3, which included the active ingredients buprenorphine, leuprorelin, octreotide, escitalopram, severely limited competition led only to a generic market share of less than 40%.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>IGES measured the effects of absence of competition of generic medicines in correlation to market share and prices, as well as to the number of suppliers, consumption and sales.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741134311433377"><title>Obstacles to competition cost the health insurance companies money</title>
<p>In the reference group, an average of 26.5 of generic medicines providers held a market share of 96.7% after 2 years. Within generic medicines, prices fell by an average of 57.2% in 24 months, with the patent-free initial providers; however, it rose slightly by 2.2%. Overall, this has positive implications for health insurance companies. Although consumption of the active agents in Group 1 rose to 151.9% due to unmet medical need, total revenue grew only by 11.1%.</p>
<p>In Group 2, with limited generic competition, a different picture can already be seen. Here, only 20.7 providers could achieve a market share of 65.4%. The generic prices decreased by 50%, slightly less than in the reference group, and the initial supplier price increased only moderately, by 2.3%. Here too, can an overall positive correlation between consumption and revenue be seen, for while sales of products increased by 68.4%, revenue grew by only 7%.</p>
<p>However, a different picture can be seen in Group 3, with severly limited generic competition. Here, only an average of 4.1 providers could reach a market share of 5.4%. This had an impact on prices. Generics were only slightly cheaper (−10.8%). The initial supplier products rose in price, in contrast, by a whopping 16.4%. While consumption in the investigated 2-year period ‘only’ grew by 96%, health insurance providers had to pay more than 124.5% for these products.</p>
<p>According to the calculations of the IGES Institute, health insurance companies could have achieved with 10 active ingredients with limited generic competition alone additional savings of up to €665 million within 24 months.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134311433377"><title>Particular hazards for biosimilars</title>
<p>The negative effects of barriers to competition are particularly shown in the secondary products of biotechnologically produced pharmaceuticals, biosimilars.</p>
<p>As completely new production processes have to be developed for these medicines and extensive studies must be conducted before licences are granted, very high amounts need to be invested for the development and market launch of biosimilars. Accordingly, the number of companies who undertake this entrepreneurial risk is small. The cost-saving potential of these high-tech medicines is however enormous. According to an earlier study by IGES, the health insurance companies in Germany could save an additional €8 billion by 2020 through the use of biosimilars.</p>
<p>In the coming years, many highly effective and top-selling biopharmaceuticals will lose their patent protection, including, for example, interferon for the treatment of multiple sclerosis; monoclonal antibodies for use in rheumatology, oncology or autoimmune diseases; and insulin. Biosimilars could enter this market and provide for the first time, real price competition in this market segment.</p>
<p>However, discount agreements on patent expirations have especially serious consequences for biosimilars. Because development of these compounds is very expensive for pharmaceutical companies, there is the aforementioned problem that there are less generic companies available. If the market is further limited by the described discount practices, then original suppliers can completely eliminate competition. This effect has been detected by professors Glaeske, Wille, Ludwig <italic>et al</italic>. in their oncology report for the German Federal Ministry of Health in 2010. They conclude: ‘The possibility of discount contracts for patented medicines for the purpose of securing sales after the expiration of patents and governmental regulations, such as fixed reimbursment amount, creates obstacles for the introduction of biosimilars’.</p>
<p>It is clear from the latest pharmaceutical report of the German health insurance company BARMER GEK from June 2011 that ‘… the introduction of other biosimilars in the pharmaceutical market will have a cost reducing impact on the expenditure of the SHI’ It also sees significant market barriers for biosimilars after patent expiration in this discount contract practice for initial suppliers, which consequently leads to less savings for the SHI.</p>
<p>In the medium term, discount contracts for initial suppliers in this market segment do not pay off for health insurance companies. For the whole SHI, this practice leads to lower savings potential and rising pharmaceutical expenditure. In the area of expensive biopharmaceuticals, the losses to the health insurance provider are particularly dramatic.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741134311433377"><title>It is time to act</title>
<p>Especially against the above-mentioned backdrop of the coming years of above average numbers of patent expirations, we urgently need fairer conditions of competition. It is imperative that generic medicines have immediate access to the entire market after patent expiration. According to Pro Generika, the trade association of the German generic medicines industry, two key requirements must be met in order to eliminate barriers to competition:
<list id="list3-1741134311433377" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Discount contracts for patent-protected medicines may only apply until the patent expires. They become ineffective after the patent expiry.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A general 24-month contract-free phase of competition begins immediately after the entry to the market of the first generic medicine.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Only such a contract-free phase of competition allows for the opening of the entire health insurance market through fair and equal conditions of competition for all providers. This is, in turn, necessary for the establishment of broad-spread price competition between manufacturers, including original suppliers.</p>
<p>The stipulated time of 2 years is supported by various expert opinions. Both the Pharma Sector Inquiry of the EU Commission in 2009 and current IGES reports clearly show that it is during the first 24 months after patent expiry that most generic medicine companies enter the market. It is this diversity that triggers the corresponding intensive price competition. This information is supported by both of these reports.</p>
<p>Initial indications show that a readiness for dialogue exists within the coalition government. If the German healthcare system wishes to continue to profit from generic medicines competition, then it is time to deal with it politically!</p></sec>
