<p>It seems to me that it is more important now than at any time in the past for us to make sure that students, especially U.S. students, have a mature understanding of the relationships between advertising and society. <italic>Advertising, Society, and Consumer Culture</italic> could be the primary text in a required course for all undergraduates. This book by Roxanne Hovland of the University of Tennessee and Joyce M. Wolburg of Marquette University is designed to help students understand advertising from a number of perspectives that tend to be ignored in more traditional courses concerned with the form, content, and psychological impact of commercial messages.</p>
<p>James Carey provides the framework for the book’s institutionalist engagement with the industry’s development as part and parcel of the national culture. Vincent Norris’s insights regarding the nature of power and regulation within consumer culture help to establish a broad-based challenge to naïve assumptions about classical liberalism and the rational consumer. While I question the authors’ reliance on Kim Rotzell’s promotion of “neoliberalism” as the banner under which to challenge liberal values as a rationale and defense for the unregulated growth and global spread of advertising, they make it quite clear that some kind of banner will have to be raised.</p>
<p>The role of advertising in the evolution of consumer culture in the United States is examined in the second chapter. Unfortunately, nearly a third of the chapter is given over to a table that begins with 1750 B.C., and the “earliest reference to credit (in the Code of Hammurabi).” It later notes the emergence of the Master Charge card in 1966, and ends with a reference to a sizeable drop in consumer confidence in 2007. Each of these historical points of interest is dutifully referenced. The discussions within the chapter actually do an excellent job in highlighting many of the critical events that helped to shape the rise of consumer culture. Surely, an appendix would have served as well if not better than this ill-chosen design.</p>
<p>The third chapter takes a somewhat different path toward understanding just how it was that the institution of advertising could actually “transform citizens into consumers.” Communication theories, reflecting either the “transmission” or “ritual” perspectives of their paradigm leaders, are presented, with the ritual view being given greater emphasis as an institutionalist framework seems to require. George Gerbner’s cultivation perspective shares space with social learning theory, framing, and postmodernism as resources for understanding the underlying processes through which such a transformation was brought about.</p>
<p>Without referring to political economy as the framework they rely on for examining the “behind-the-scenes power of advertising,” the next chapter explores the relationships among consumers, advertisers, and the media organizations in a way that emphasizes the market for audience attention. This framework also allows them to examine the complex nature of media censorship as something imposed from above as well as exercised from within media organizations.</p>
<p>Although the book is focused primarily on advertising in the American context, attention is also paid to the problems that arise when the needs of multinational firms require the delivery of marketing appeals to potential consumers in other countries. Problems in translation as well as concerns about the impact of spreading consumerist culture into developing nations are explored in a nicely organized chapter.</p>
<p>After a somewhat underdeveloped discussion of the justification for the regulation of advertising, a more comprehensive review of the primary agencies of regulatory oversight is provided. Unfortunately, another multipaged table that could be placed in an appendix provides a list of Supreme Court decisions that shaped the relationship between advertising the protections for speech under the First Amendment. The Federal Trade Commission comes in for special attention, with extensive discussion of the regulatory responsibilities and resources that define the mission of each of the commission’s three bureaus.</p>
<p>A separate chapter is devoted to exploring the guidance that the major ethical theories might provide regulators, practitioners, and citizen–consumers who are being forced to adjust to continual changes in the institution of advertising. Although Hovland and Wolburg suggest that the advertising industry generally relies on utilitarianism for guidance and validation, they also suggest that the classical liberal model on which utilitarianism depends is simply not an accurate representation of the world as we experience it. Having introduced this critique, they merely hold out hope that a more “care-based” ethical position will emerge as a basis for more enlightened protection of consumers.</p>
<p>This somewhat untethered expression of hope for the future is set aside in the final chapter. As they see it, the institution of advertising not only has become ubiquitous and omnipresent but also has become omniscient with regard to what the industry has come to know about the consumer. After suggesting that the regulatory systems and ethical frameworks that we have in place are simply not capable of controlling this industry, they conclude by casting blame in all directions. As citizens and consumers we are labeled as codependent because we participate actively in our own exploitation.</p>
<p>While the authors don’t extend their critique of “continuous consumption” to encompass rising concerns about climate change and the environment, they provide enough of a platform to support the efforts of undergraduates who might be ready to explore those connections on their own. Instructors who use this book as a starting point for their engagement with the institution of advertising should consider devoting some time, perhaps through a final paper assignment, for exploring ways to bring this monster under control.</p>
