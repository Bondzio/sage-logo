<p>Research and literature on leadership in early years’ settings remains limited despite the widespread recognition that the nature and quality of pre-school experience has a significant impact on the educational outcomes and life chances of children and young people.   In addition, it is now widely acknowledged that effective leadership is essential to the quality of nurseries and children’s centres.</p>
<p>The first article in this issue, by Lynn Ang, addresses this issue by reporting her research on the impact of the National Professional Qualification in Integrated Centre Leadership (NPQICL), offered by the National College.  The author gathered data through e-mail surveys of 359 NPQICL participants from nine regions in England, and from telephone interviews with a sub-sample of 15 participants.   She concludes that leadership development programmes, such as the NPQICL, ‘can have a strong impact on children’s centres leaders, their practice and perceptions of leadership’.    </p>
<p>The second article by Georgia Prokopiadou, also focuses on early years’ settings.   The author examines how ICT is being used for administration in Greek kindergarten schools.  She conducted a survey of 230 kindergarten principals in 12 regions, with an excellent response rate of 79.6%.   These principals expressed strong support for ICT in kindergarten administration with 59% of respondents describing it as ‘vital’ and 39.3% regarding it as ‘important’.    The author concludes that ‘ICT usage in school administration is of vital importance’.</p>
<p>In the third article, Michelle Anderson considers the nature of collective leadership in a multi-campus secondary school in Victoria, Australia.  She conducted research with 32 leaders in eight such schools, adopting what she describes as an in-depth ethnographic approach.   She points to the challenges involved in ‘living out’ the values of one college when it is spread across three campuses, and concludes that teacher leadership is not a homogeneous concept and has to be contextualised.</p>
<p>Nicholas Pang, in the fourth article, examines strategic leadership skills as a way of distinguishing effective school leaders in Hong Kong.  He conducted survey research with up to three school leaders in 200 primary and 200 secondary schools, with a response rate of 45%.  The author states that the use of strategic thinking skills seems to distinguish between more and less effective leaders because it places a premium on synthesis and integration.</p>
<p>The fifth article, by Michael Burgess and Pauline Dixon, provides a rare insight into school effectiveness in Columbia, with a specific focus on the marginalised community of Aguablanca.  They administered questionnaires to both parents and teachers at all 25 schools which catered for both primary and secondary students.    They note that low-cost private schools compared favourably with the public sector and conclude that the private sector has a positive and constructive role to play in a community where as many as 100,000 children are not attending school.</p>
<p>In the sixth article, Uif Lundstrom examines the impact of the introduction of performance-related pay (PRP) for secondary school teachers in Sweden.  Drawing on interviews with 23 teachers in four upper secondary schools, the author presents and discusses their perceptions of the new pay scheme.   He concludes that PRP is counterproductive in that it does not function well and fails to meet its stated aims.  </p>
<p>The final article, by Fiona Mackay, explores the ways in which senior leaders in the Learning and Skills sector in England understand learning leadership.  Through a process of reflective practice, the author and her colleagues raised questions about what they were learning about this aspect of leadership.  Her approach was interpretive and based around story-telling.  She concludes that ‘learning to learn’ is an increasingly important ‘meta competence’ for leaders.</p>
<p>This issue of the journal further illustrates the global significance of educational leadership, with articles from six countries on four continents.      </p>
