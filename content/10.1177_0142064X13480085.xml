<p>In ‘The Roll, the Codex, the Wax Tablet and the Synoptic Problem’ (<italic>JSNT</italic> 35.1), John C. Poirier helpfully draws attention to the use of wax tablets in the Graeco-Roman world of the early Christians. These might seem to have allowed for more flexibility in the collation of literary sources than many (F. Gerald Downing and Robert A. Derrenbacker in particular) have allowed for: e.g., for Luke using Matthew and Mark. Poirier’s critical attention to other scholars, however, leaves a lot of relevant questions not only unanswered but unraised, and a range of these is here outlined.</p>

<p>Our attention is helpfully drawn by John C. Poirier, ‘The Roll, the Codex, the Wax Tablet and the Synoptic Problem’, to aspects of the physical processes of writing in the Graeco-Roman world of the early Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>). Wax tablets, whose prevalence at the time he is able to show is widely evidenced, could, at least in theory, allow for more flexibility in the collation of literary sources, speciﬁcally between the Synoptic evangelists, than has been allowed for by, among others, F. Gerald Downing and Robert A. Derrenbacker. Thus, for instance, ‘The wax-tablet model, in fact, goes a long way toward explaining how a Farrerian Luke was able to arrange the so-called travel-narrative material so freely. Once Luke had recorded this material on a set of tablets, he easily could have rearranged these tablets in any order desired’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>: 23). So far, so fair.</p>
<p>Unhappily, Poirier has dramatized his argument with serious misrepresentations of some of the writings with which he takes issue. The most egregious of these is his insistence that Downing bases an important argument on ancient writers’ supposed ‘search’ ‘apparently’ for ‘verbatim agreements’ in their sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>: 5, 9). This accusation is simply false (and no supporting quotation is offered). For sure it was pointed out by Downing that Josephus found verbatim agreements in some of his ‘biblical’ texts (as a ‘Farrerian’ Luke would have in his sources, though this was noted as itself remarkable); yet what Josephus produced was paraphrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X13480085">Downing 1980a</xref>: 48; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13480085">1980b</xref>: 33). Then it was made clear in the later article to which Poirier refers that the sources which Plutarch, for instance, used were already paraphrases of their own respective sources, so that what Plutarch is sometimes able to discern and retain ‘without much very close attention to the text’, was a common ‘story line’, a shared ‘narrative logic’ (no more than that is stated; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13480085">Downing 1988</xref>: 79, 81; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13480085">Downing 1992</xref>: 24).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13480085">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>What was by Downing argued to be remarkable was the fact that a Luke or any evangelist writing third should refuse to include even in paraphrase some of the most closely similar matter appearing in both the others, when ancient writers in practice and expressly were content to encounter, meet with, come across (not, so Poirier’s rephrasing, ‘having searched out’) general agreement in their sources for themselves in turn to paraphrase without more ado (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13480085">Downing 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13480085">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142064X13480085">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13480085">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>: 5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13480085">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Downing, it is averred, ‘has misrepresented numerous aspects of how the ancients wrote’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>: 24). The foregoing rebuts and would seem to refute ‘verbatim’, ‘search’ and ‘close attention’. If there are more on Poirier’s charge-sheet, they are not obvious. Downing is, however, also accused (at pedantic length? two pages in Poirier) of ‘pedantically’ misrepresenting Michael Goulder’s talk of a ‘marker’ in a scroll, when just allowing both ends to roll in on a column would sufﬁce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>: 5-7); but Goulder did speciﬁcally propose ‘a marker at 3.19’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142064X13480085">Goulder 1989</xref>: 346; cf. 197, 291, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13480085">Downing 1992</xref>: 18), which must denote more than just somewhere in an open column.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13480085">3</xref></sup> Poirier also makes much of the possible use of tables to take two rolls open together, but without then acknowledging that Downing had explicitly and at length allowed for that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>: 15-18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13480085">Downing 1992</xref>: 19).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13480085">4</xref></sup> (But see further, below.)</p>
<p>Poirier does, nonetheless, allow that Downing got some other things right; so, if Poirier had been less careless in his generalizations (well, frankly, misrepresentations) of Downing’s arguments, there might have been very little disagreement left between them. Unfortunately, however, Poirier would seem to have fallen for the quite common argumentative device of devoting most of a study to showing others in a bad light, paraphrasing their contentions to sound as vulnerable as possible, so as to leave the stage clear for the new writer’s own rather scanty main suggestion to shine more brightly, against the gloom induced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13480085">5</xref></sup> Perhaps for the future Poirier means to elaborate the application of his insight in greater and clearer evidenced detail than the scant amount vouchsafed in the piece here in question. For the present, he seems to have offered an effective reminder of an aspect of ancient writing practice that <italic>might seem to allow</italic> for much greater flexibility for a third evangelist using the other two as sources than many commentators, including Derrenbacker and Downing, have supposed and proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13480085">6</xref></sup> But that is as far as he gets. How in detail wax tablets could have been used to the end indicated, and whether anyone (other than an imagined ‘Farrerian Luke’) ever did so use them, is left not only unevidenced, but unquestioned.</p>
<p>The following are some at least of the issues that require attention. Reading desks that could support two scrolls are evidenced (Poirier and Downing), but from social contexts where Luke is <italic>not</italic> obviously at home, and the general use of even single-scroll reading desks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142064X13480085">Turner 1968</xref>: 7) is itself doubted by two of Poirier’s own witnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13480085">Small 1997</xref>: 136, 150; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X13480085">Winsbury 2009</xref>: 37, 73). What seems to be demanded is a desk wide enough for at least one open and one in double-roll, as well as, perhaps, room to support ‘Luke’s’ wax tablet, if he is making his own notes (and thus at least one scroll has props of some sort either side of the column lying open to be perused).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X13480085">7</xref></sup> Applications of common technologies are culturally formed, are they not? Are we now asking ‘Luke’ for cultural innovation – not in the technology of wax tablets, but in its application? Or is Alexandrian scholarly procedure common rather than in-group knowledge (for the latter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13480085">Small, 1997</xref>: 44), and is its specialised furniture available?</p>
<p>Then, what <italic>range</italic> of sizes of scrolls and of wax tablets is envisaged? For scrolls in general the range is known, and is very considerable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X13480085">Winsbury 2009</xref>: 46; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13480085">Downing 1992</xref>: 20). For wax tablets uncertainty seems to reign. <italic>If</italic> one were to imagine a close correlation between a fairly common papyrus column size <italic>and</italic> similar sized writing on wax, say, about 500 characters for each, then, on Poirier’s ﬁgure, his Luke would seem to have needed around 180-200 tablets, or at least 60-70 for each one-third successive section of his Gospel – yes, ‘a rather large stack’ as Poirer allows, but without hazarding a ﬁgure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13480085">Poirier 2012</xref>: 19-23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X13480085">8</xref></sup> Diogenes Laertius, <italic>Lives of Eminent Philosophers</italic>, records that ‘some say (ἔνιοι τε φασίν) that Philippus of Opus [a pupil of Plato] copied out <italic>The Laws</italic>, which were left on wax’, and on this estimate that would have involved between 800 and 1,000 tablets, and clearly even such a stack as that is at least imaginable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X13480085">9</xref></sup> But this suggestion of ‘some’ seems to be noted as noteworthy, not what one might expect. So, is there any evidence for anyone in <italic>any</italic> contemporary socio-cultural context using so many tablets, for anything, let alone for collating two sources – better, two narrative sources – to produce a third? We have individual quite brief poems instanced, and short notes, but there is nothing in the quotations otherwise appositely adduced by Poirier to suggest any such extensive deployment prior to inscription with ink on papyrus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X13480085">10</xref></sup> Of course, there is much we do not know of the ancient Mediterranean world, and we may have to put up with hypotheses. But we need to be made aware of something of the extent of the uncertainties involved.</p>
<p>Poirier’s ‘Luke’ actually seems in practice to be taking much more detailed notes than those ancient authors cited by Poirier would have done (as Downing and he would agree, in accord with many classical scholars).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X13480085">11</xref></sup> This ‘Farrerian’ Luke is also making quite detailed comparisons, whether from memory or visually. Sometimes he will write very freely, sometimes précis and paraphrase, sometimes he will reproduce much of one predecessor. But on occasion he seems then to glance back at the other source, ﬁnd both in 90 per cent or more agreement, and <italic>exclude</italic> exactly that passage: not précis it or paraphrase it, but either then exclude it (if he has noticed it in time) or erase it from his tablet (or have his secretary erase it), even though he had liked this source well enough up till then to include it in full or very nearly, and also to resume quite close reproduction immediately the two sources cease <italic>their</italic> close coincidence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X13480085">12</xref></sup> And this phenomenon seems too frequent to be by chance. A Farrerian ‘Luke’ does actually seem to be doing precisely what Poirier would ridicule others for even suggesting ancient collaters might do: Poirier’s Luke <italic>is</italic> on the lookout for verbatim agreements in his sources – albeit, to omit. It does seem appropriate to ask why.</p>
<p>We are left with an interesting proposal from Poirier, but with a great deal of apparently unnoticed and certainly unanswered questions about it and arising from it.</p>

<p>Might it be that Poirier was misled by cursory attention to the table in the second article cited, showing verbal parallels between Plutarch and Dionysius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X13480085">Downing 1988</xref>: 77)? But that is not a parallel found between Plutarch’s two sources, but evidence that he had used Dionysius here as well as Livy whom he explicitly acknowledges.

<p>Winsbury, <italic>The Roman Book</italic>, concludes that ﬁnding a place would be ‘devilishly difﬁcult’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X13480085">2009</xref>: 22; cf. 6, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13480085">Small 1997</xref>: chs. 4 and 5, and 188). Winsbury includes a reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142064X13480085">2009</xref>: 27) of an intriguing mosaic showing Vergil with scroll held open on its right by being folded back underneath.

<p>Downing is also accused, likely validly, of getting a modern author’s second initial wrong.
