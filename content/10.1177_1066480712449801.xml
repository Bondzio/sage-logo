<p>Initially while reading the title, <italic>The 10 Best-Ever Depression Management Techniques</italic>, it sounded a bit gimmicky, but Dr. Wehrenberg’s book ended up being a very pleasant surprise. The book is laid out in a very straightforward manner with the first chapter discussing the biological aspects of depression and the second explaining how psychotropic medications work. The depth and clarity of explanation was something that the general public or a beginning mental health professional would appreciate and understand. Dr. Wehrenberg consistently offers a balanced viewpoint on depression regarding the nature–nurture debate as she says “depression is always biological and biology is always affected by life experience” (p. 11). Chapters 3 through 12 are the 10 recommended techniques, a chapter each. It would be more accurate to call the “10…Techniques” the “10 best categories” of help, as a number of them are fairly broad. However, my previous comment is a slight critique of the format rather than the content, as the book is very comprehensive with dozens of evidence-based techniques presented.</p>
<p>The book assists the reader in helping to alleviate depression from numerous angles. Wehrenberg states “delaying thoughts about disappointment can eliminate triggers to feel depressed because often in the moment of <italic>expecting</italic> to be disappointed, your neural networks light up as if you <italic>already were</italic> disappointed, which leads to inaction” (p. 57). The author helps the reader work on identifying triggers for depression, plan healthy responses to those triggers, establish healthy self-care, end/diminish isolation, and numerous other approaches which are beneficial.</p>
<p>The “10 Best-Ever Depression Management Techniques” are: </p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>identify triggers, plan new responses;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>start where you already are;</p>
</list-item>

<p>increase flexibility;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>learn to live fully (p. viii).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The topics are somewhat broad, yet each chapter generously illustrates how to achieve each goal. For example, with technique #2, the author states “Doing what we are good at is a motivation booster—it helps us feel worthwhile and adequate at something, even if not in all ways” (p. 79). In regards to handling burnout, the author defines burnout, suggests self-care accountability, offers a self-care checklist, discusses sleep hygiene and related biological components, offers sleep regimen guidelines, as well as identifying and increasing rejuvenating activities. The chapter on technique #4 offers easy to understand cognitive behavioral therapy suggestions.</p>
<p>The author also offered timely advice on the potential benefits and detriments of online social activity, noting that “Many end up feeling more isolated than when they began their session on-line. Social-networking sites can increase feelings of loneliness as you see that others are interacting in person, attending activities, or dating” (p. 143).</p>
<p>The book had a hopeful and tentative approach toward depression treatment, repeatedly offering small ways to reframe and break out of repetitive dysfunctional behaviors. There were numerous appendices at the end, offering all kinds of exercises for the techniques mentioned throughout the book. Though the book was close to 300 pages, which might discourage some depressed readers, it was generally easy reading with helpful analogies and illustrations for the more complex topics. Most readers would benefit from the pragmatic and user-friendly approach of the book, and it warrants a positive recommendation. </p>
