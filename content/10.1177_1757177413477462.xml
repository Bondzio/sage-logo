<p>Writing the JIP Outbreak Column has necessitated that I read more outbreak reports, and read them in greater depth than I did before the column started. In doing so, what has surprised me most is that before I started on the column I thought I could easily and clearly define both an outbreak and a pseudo-outbreak – now I am not quite so sure. Indeed, in writing for this column I have found a series of what the authors called ‘pseudo-outbreaks’ that are not outbreaks, in that patients did not develop infections; however, they were exposed to and colonised with a common pathogenic micro-organism within a care environment. Consequently, I will argue in this column for a new category to be considered. The main topic for this outbreak column is pseudo-outbreaks, that is, alert signals that on investigation are not outbreaks – this of course includes the definition. The purpose of choosing pseudo-outbreaks for a column was to learn lessons on alert signal analysis that would help Infection Prevention and Control Teams (IPCTs). What I have discovered is that there are many lessons to be learned from pseudo-outbreaks and not just about alert signals. Indeed, such are the variety of pseudo-outbreaks that this is the first of two columns on the topic.</p>
<p>Every outbreak starts with an ‘alert signal’ from clinical, microbiological or surveillance data. The alert signal suggests there are more patients with a particular type of infection or specific alert organism than would be expected within a given time period. This is clearly illustrated in the Health Protection Scotland Hospital Outbreak Algorithm and Checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177413477462">Health Protection Scotland, 2012</xref>). The first task of the IPCT is to decide – is the alert signal a real or a pseudo-outbreak. To aid the decision-making process, the IPCT will review the patients’ clinical conditions, collect various time, place and person data and consider from all the available information whether the alert signal is more likely than not to be an outbreak. At the time of the assessment there may be insufficient evidence to be certain; when this is the case, the IPCT should still act as though it is an outbreak until there is sufficient evidence to prove otherwise. The second column will deal with pseudo-outbreaks that can be attributed to failures in specimen collection, processing, result interpretation and clinical diagnoses. This first column will focus on the categorisation of pseudo-outbreaks and discuss those pseudo-outbreaks that arise from surveillance, testing and chance. The newly proposed category, which for now I will call ‘no-infection outbreak’, will also be outlined in this column with more extensive discussion given in the second column.</p>
<p>To start, let us be clear what is meant by the term pseudo-outbreak.</p>
<sec id="section1-1757177413477462">
<title>Pseudo-outbreak – the definition</title>
<p>In a review of 20 pseudo-outbreaks that had been referred to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for assistance with investigation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177413477462">Weinstein and Stamm (1977)</xref> defined a pseudo-outbreak, or ‘pseudoepidemic’ was the term they used, as real clustering of false infections or artefactual clustering of real infections. This definition is still referred to today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757177413477462">Neulier et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177413477462">Wang et al, 2009</xref>). The pseudo-outbreaks in the Weinstein and Stamm (1997) article having been referred to the CDC can be seen as an unrepresentative sample of pseudo-outbreaks as a whole. The majority of pseudo-outbreaks are investigated successfully without recourse to the CDC’s experts. Consequently, classifying pseudo-outbreaks from this unrepresentative sample of 20 reports is somewhat limited – there will be more discussion on this later.</p>
<p>There are two issues with the definition of pseudo-outbreaks offered by Weinstein and Stamm (1997). The term ‘artefactual’ is presumably used to mean an ‘inaccurate observation, effect or result’. However, the cluster is real in time and place – it is just that the relatedness of the organisms, or infections, is not real or is yet to be established. If there was relatedness between the infections, then it would be an outbreak.</p>
<p>Therefore, for improved clarity, this definition could be modified to:<disp-quote>
<p>A related cluster of false infections or, an unrelated cluster of real infections.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The next definition issue relates to what is meant by ‘false infections’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757177413477462">Weinstein and Stamm, 1977</xref>). In their review of 20 pseudo-outbreaks Weinstein and Stamm (1997) identified only three sub-categories: specimen processing, surveillance artefact and clinical misdiagnosis. ‘Specimen processing and clinical misdiagnosis’ would meet the related cluster of false infection definition, and ‘surveillance artefact’ would meet the definition of an unrelated cluster of real infections.</p>
<p>Weinsetin and Stamm (1997) did not find examples of where patients were exposed to a common micro-organism and colonised but not infected. However, from my reading of the literature there seem to be two different sub-categories of unrelated clusters of false infection. The first sub-category includes a variety of specimen collection and processing failures where the result is itself false, i.e. the patient never was colonised with the organism, or the clinical diagnosis of an infection was erroneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413477462">Diederen et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177413477462">Heard et al, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177413477462">Kappstein et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757177413477462">Tschudin et al, 2011</xref>). In the second sub-category the result was true, i.e. the patient was colonised with, and exposed to, a common organism, but there was no infection present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177413477462">Lalande et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757177413477462">Serikawa et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177413477462">Wang et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757177413477462">Zhang et al, 2002</xref>). Clearly, there is little difference in the mechanics of patients being exposed and colonised in a care environment – even if infection was not present – from the circumstances that arise in an outbreak where patients are infected. What transforms the exposure from colonisation to infection can be the dose of the organism transmitted, the transmission pathway or the host response, i.e. an outbreak and a pseudo-outbreak of this type both result from one or more infection prevention and control system failures within a clinical area.</p>
<p>This differentiation between the two types of pseudo-outbreaks that are related clusters of false infections is crucial, because in the first type (where there was no patient exposure) the IPCT’s focus should be on the test, how the specimen was collected, how the test was performed, how the test was interpreted or the basis for the clinical diagnosis. In the second type the IPCT should focus on how the patient came to be colonised. Therefore, the IPCTs who are investigating pseudo-outbreaks where exposure to patients occurred need to follow a standard outbreak investigation process, including following up on the causes and the outbreak, and ensuring system changes are in place to prevent recurrence, if this is not done there may be a real outbreak at a subsequent date. The question that needs to be addressed by the infection prevention community as a whole, is whether this type of, what is currently classified as pseudo-outbreak, should actually be classified as a real, albeit ‘no-infection’ outbreak.</p>
<p>For this sub-category where patients have been exposed but no infection is present, I propose the term ‘no-infection outbreak’. I did consider the term ‘no harm outbreak’. However, in some of these events patients were treated for infections they did not have, appropriate treatment was stopped, unnecessary investigations (sometimes invasive) were performed, unnecessary infection control precautions were put in place and a myriad of tests were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177413477462">Faden et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177413477462">Heard et al, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177413477462">Neal et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757177413477462">Verweij et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757177413477462">Wang et al, 2009</xref>). Consequently, the term no-harm seemed inappropriate. The term no-infection outbreak implies, as is true, there were more colonised patients than would be expected with a particular organism and there was cross-transmission. The only problem with the term ‘no-infection outbreak’ is that, in many healthcare-related outbreaks, there are definite cases who have an infection, and patients who are colonised. It would be illogical to suggest that for such outbreaks the term ‘outbreak’ and ‘no-infection outbreak’ should be used concurrently. Ergo, if there are cases with infections, and cases who are only colonised, this should be termed an ‘infection outbreak’, even though not all the cases had infection. If there are only colonised patients, who do not require treatment or follow-up, then the term ‘no-infection outbreak’ should be used.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177413477462">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the descriptions given above. In essence there are two sub-categories of outbreak and pseudo-outbreak. The first sub-category of outbreak involves people who developed infections and may include some who were colonised – an ‘infection outbreak’. The second sub-category is a ‘no-infection outbreak’ and includes patients who were exposed and colonised but who were not infected. The two sub-categories of pseudo-outbreak include those where there was an ‘unrelated cluster of real infections’. And the final sub-category is where there was a ‘related cluster of false infections’, i.e. there were no infections and the patients were never exposed to or colonised with an outbreak organism, or the diagnosis was erroneous. The new category of no-infection outbreak is highlighted.</p>

<p>The second pseduo-outbreak column will focus on the ‘related clusters of false infections’ and provide more examples of no-infection outbreaks. This column will now focus on the pseudo-outbreaks that are ‘unrelated clusters of real infections’, the causes for which lie in change of surveillance or testing methods and chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177413477462">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1757177413477462">
<title>An unrelated cluster of real infections</title>
<p>In the main, the events that conspire to cause an alert signal that are an unrelated cluster of real infections involve changes in surveillance, in testing or just simply a chance occurrence. This includes changes in the test/surveillance method, or the frequency with which the test is applied. These changes, or system modifications, result in changes in the numerator, the denominator or both, all of which can yield alert signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757177413477462">Figure 1</xref>). Examples of how changing the system can result in changes in the numerator, denominator or both, and result in alert signals, are detailed below.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section3-1757177413477462">
<title>Testing artefact</title>
<p>There are two types of testing artefact, which are changing the number of tests or changing the test to one that is more sensitive.</p>
<sec id="section4-1757177413477462">
<title>More tests = more positive results</title>
<p>An increase in the number of tests performed can increase the number of infections detected. For example, when there is an emerging or re-emerging pathogen, a wider testing programme may be introduced. This will cause an increase in the number of cases identified, which is greater than the previous background level – this may be sufficient to be detected as an alert signal. This does not mean an outbreak has been detected, it means there is ascertainment bias, i.e. the change in the system of identifying cases has resulted in a change in the detection rate. The CDC reported an example of such an event causing a real alert signal where a sizable investigation followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413477462">Anon, 1995</xref>). The alert signal was identified in New Jersey and followed an increase in detection of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7. In 1994, 46 culture-confirmed cases of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 were reported, with only five cases reported in the same period in the previous year. Extensive investigations yielded multiple different possible outlets who could have sold contaminated meat – suggesting no common source. Also, additional laboratory testing identified 17 different strains amongst 23 isolates – suggesting no common strain. Investigations into a change in the system of testing identified that the number of laboratories testing for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 had risen from two (10%) in 1993 to 18 (90%) in 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413477462">Anon, 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177413477462">
<title>Better test = more positive results</title>
<p>In a similar way that a new test can increase the number of positives, changing to a new test with increased sensitivity can result in an increase in the number of infections detected – which is a result of the efficacy of the new test in detecting infections and not a true increase in the incidence.</p>
<p>Test modifications (changing [increasing] the number of tests performed, or changing to a more sensitive test) is like an iceberg, which could alter the amount of its mass that is above the water line. The iceberg itself does not increase its size, but the amount that would be visible would increase.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1757177413477462">
<title>Surveillance artefact</title>
<p>Four different types of surveillance artefacts were identified from the literature reviewed that could result in alert signals and which IPCTs need to be aware of.</p>
<sec id="section7-1757177413477462">
<title>More sensitive definitions = more patients with infections</title>
<p>A change in the surveillance definitions used to ones that are more sensitive will result in an increase in the number of infections detected, which would not reflect any true change in incidence. This may seem too obvious to mention, but all possible methods of surveillance artefact need listing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1757177413477462">
<title>More rigorous application of definitions = more patients with infections</title>
<p>Similar to the impact of a change in the definitions used, is a change in rigor with which the definitions are applied. Tests of inter-rater reliability are performed to ensure that people in different settings are applying the specified definitions in the same way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177413477462">Mor et al, 2003</xref>). This is to ensure that any differences detected in the results between centres or surgeons reflect true differences in infection rates and not differences in the application of surveillance definitions. Such an alert signal could arise when there was a change of surveillance personnel and the application of definitions was different to that done previously. One instance of such a change was found in the literature reviewed for this column. Doctors changed ‘the threshold with which they diagnosed an infection’ as a means to get around restrictions in a recently introduced antibiotic formulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177413477462">Calfee et al, 2003</xref>). The new formularly specified that certain antibiotics could only be prescribed if specific infections were diagnosed – the doctors wanted to prescribe the antibiotics as they had always done and therefore over-diagnosed the infections (or diagnosed differently to that which was done previously). As a result of over, or different diagnoses, a full-scale investigation was launched into this non-existent increase in infections detected by surveillance as an increase in diagnosed infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177413477462">Calfee et al, 2003</xref>). The investigations concluded that the increase was most likely owing to improved documenting by physicians of their rationale for antibiotic therapy. This type of impact is possibly facilitated by the CDC definition of surgical site infection, which includes diagnosis by surgeon or attending physician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177413477462">Horan et al, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1757177413477462">
<title>Reducing the denominator = increasing the rate of infections</title>
<p>An unrelated cluster of real infections could also theoretically be detected using bed days as a denominator, for example, if a hospital reduced its bed compliment without reducing its throughput, the number of patients and risks of infection could be expected to remain unchanged. However, the denominator of reduced occupied bed days would result in an increased incidence if data were presented as the number of infections over occupied bed days, i.e. incidence density. Such an increase in incidence would be another surveillance artefact resulting in an alert signal. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1757177413477462">Figure 2</xref>. In their investigation into an increase in the nosocomial infection rate discussed earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177413477462">Calfee et al. (2003)</xref> also note a simultaneous decrease in the denominator owing to a change in the one used to calculate infection rates.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section10-1757177413477462">
<title>Reducing infections (and reducing the denominator) = increasing the infection rate</title>
<p>Unlikely as it sounds, reducing infections can also result in an increased infection rate as measured by incidence density if, for example, an improvement affects both the numerator and denominator. Incidence density is different from surgical site infection surveillance, which uses an incidence rate (the number of infections over the number of procedures). As an example, in surgical site infection surveillance any system improvement, say an increase in optimal timing of antibiotics, should result in a decrease in infections (the numerator), but the denominator, the number of surgical procedures, would remain the same. However, if there was an improvement in the number of urinary catheters that were removed early, this could result in a decrease in the number of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), but also a decrease in the number of catheter days – the denominator. As incidence density measures infections over device days × 1000, then perversely an improvement in catheter care could lead to an increase or at best a non-significant decrease in CAUTI as measured by incidence density. This would happen even though care had improved and the number of infections had itself decreased. This was demonstrated by researchers who reduced urinary catheter usage, but did not significantly reduce CAUTI rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177413477462">Rothfeld and Stickley, 2010</xref>). However, these researchers achieved a significant decrease in catheter use, and in urinary tract infections they did achieve a significant reduction in CAUTI when the denominator of patient days was used. These researchers advocated using patient days as the denominator to provide a more reliable measure of performance improvement – using this denominator they did identify a significant reduction in CAUTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757177413477462">Rothfeld and Stickley, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section11-1757177413477462">
<title>Chance</title>
<p>The final reason that there can be an apparent increase in real infections is simply chance. There are several examples of chance resulting in complex investigations. For example, three cases of legionnaires disease in a three-week period within a small community area sparked a public health investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177413477462">Carr et al, 2010</xref>). However, only when the results from the laboratory were returned was it confirmed that the clustering of these were three unrelated strains was a result of chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177413477462">Carr et al, 2010</xref>). The investigation in this instance was wholly justified and proportionate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1757177413477462">
<title>Alert signal investigation</title>
<p>As the infections discussed in this column were real, and there was not, as will be discussed in the next column, unnecessary treatment or infection prevention and control precautions, the main way error was going to arise was through extensive, and at times unnecessary, investigations. However, there is hindsight bias in this assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413477462">Fischhoff, 2003</xref>). Inevitably and correctly IPCTs need to apply a precautionary approach to any and every alert signal. The time from knowing about an alert signal, to taking action to prevent more cases, can be used as a quality indicator akin to the ‘door-to-needle-time’ for clinicians treating stroke patients with tissue-type plasminogen activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177413477462">Ford et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The information I was looking for by reading these articles was this: what are the clues that indicate the alert signal is a pseudo-outbreak and not a real outbreak. Unfortunately, I did not find much that would identify short-cuts to the normal outbreak investigation process. The IPCT will wish to establish as the earliest opportunity whether the alert signal is a real outbreak. What will help them decide if it is an unrelated cluster of true infections involves looking for change(s) in the system, or having additional laboratory data that will confirm or refute relatedness of cases (if it is due to chance). It is only pseudo-outbreaks that arise from a chance occurrence that require no action – paradoxically, however, it is not until investigations are complete can it be confirmed that no action/investigations were necessary. If a change in surveillance or testing methods has resulted in an alert signal, it may well be that there needs to be a recalibration of what is considered natural and unnatural variation. Also, the IPCT will need to know if modifications that were introduced to the system will remain or will subsequently revert back.</p>
<p>Having confirmed that the patients’ infections are real, the focus of an alert signal investigation should be as follows.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section13-1757177413477462">
<title>Establish the baseline rate</title>
<p>Once you have established that the patients’ clinical conditions match the laboratory reports, the first investigation is to establish/confirm what the baseline rate is, for example, how many positives were there in the same period last year or last month. In addition, it is important to know by how much above the baseline rate this alert signals. What is important however, is not to wait for a significant increase from a baseline rate before investigations begin. It is much better to have addressed several false alarms than to delay detection of one real outbreak.</p>
<p>It is also important (and obvious) to ensure that the calculation of the baseline rate before the alert signal has been measured the same way (and by the same people) as the calculation of the rate for the time period of the alert signal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1757177413477462">

Therefore, it is important to find out quickly what, if anything, has changed from what went on before there was an alert signal, to the time period that involves the alert signal.

<title>Confirmatory microbiological testing</title>
<p>Additional microbiological testing should be able to confirm the relatedness or unrelatedness of strains (chance or an outbreak), but inevitably these will take time to complete. The time to confirmatory tests may be so long that it cannot prevent the need for detailed investigations and instigation of control measures. Therefore getting the samples for confirmatory tests, and getting them to where they need to be processed, as soon as possible is important. Many people will want to know when these results will confirm the issue. Planning any outbreak control meeting as soon after the results are known is also logical.</p>

<title>Is it happening anywhere else?</title>
<p>It is useful to check with colleagues if the alert signal is being mirrored in any other locality. This could arise as a consequence of national changes in testing, type of test or frequency of test being performed.</p>

<title>Preventing pseudo-outbreaks owing to unrelated clusters of real infections</title>
<p>Thinking and planning ahead it is possible to prevent some – but not all – pseudo-outbreaks causing alert signals. To do this the IPCT need to think about potential consequences (in particular, unintended consequences) when introducing a change to a monitoring system, or if the healthcare system itself changes (e.g. number of bed days). If a surveillance system is to change, running the old system alongside the new system for a period of time can enable differences in detection rates to be assessed. As a consequence, the alert signal trigger could be readjusted preventing the unnecessary false alarms. In addition, producing the number of infections and the number of infections over a changing denominator that is not procedure (e.g. bed days, catheter days) can differentiate the alert signals that need investigation from those that do not.</p>

<sec id="section18-1757177413477462">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>Pseudo-outbreaks, like real outbreaks, present initially as alert signals from laboratory, surveillance or clinical data; they must be promptly investigated by the IPCT. The IPCT will have insufficient information at the start of the investigations to establish whether the alert signal is an outbreak or owing to any of a multitude of pseudo-outbreak causes. The line between undertaking unnecessary instigations and appropriate investigation is a fine one – and always judged with hindsight bias after the event when more information is available.</p>
<p>Pseudo-outbreaks can be classified as either a ‘related cluster of false infections’ or, an ‘unrelated cluster of real infections’. For the latter category, having established the baseline rate, the key focus of infection should be on looking for a change and being aware that the alert signal could just be owing to chance. It is proposed that incidents, where patients were exposed and colonised with a common organism, are considered as no-infection outbreaks and not a sub-classification of pseudo-outbreaks.</p>
<p>Pseudo-outbreaks that are a related cluster of false infections, where the result or diagnosis was false, will be discussed in depth in the next outbreak column.</p>
<p>This is the 7th outbreak column – and I did not expect at the start that it would involve a proposal to change the definitions of outbreaks/pseudo-outbreaks. As in the first column. I would like to invite comment on the column’s content, and would warmly welcome outbreak columns written by colleagues.</p>
