<p>Political discourses on group rights in India acquired a complex character in the post 1990 period as several uneven claims of representation and social justice arrived on the scene. The book under review is an ambitious attempt to unravel some of these complexities in its revisit to the Indian debates on difference.</p>
<p>The exercise is an ambitious one because it addresses the debates around group rights from several simultaneous vantage points to develop a nuanced understanding of the working of Indian democracy, of liberalism and liberal multiculturalism and also of structuring of the ideologies.</p>
<p>The main argument of the book develops around two critical junctures in the history of the post independence Indian state—the late 1940s and the 1980s. It selects three landmark debates from these two phases—the constituent assembly debates of 1946–1949, the Shah Bano debate of 1986 and the Mandal debate of 1990 for detailed investigations of the discourses on group rights. The investigations are guided by a distinct methodological choice (what the author refers to as a ‘different route’ to track the postcolonial realities) of textual analysis of legislative debates. The focus is to understand how the construction of ideology occurs through practical engagement in policy making and in routine practices of political debates. The approach helps the author with an empirical study of ideology without essentially focusing on key individuals and without succumbing to instrumentalist accounts of ideology.</p>
<p>Instead, mainly following Michael Freeden’s framework of ‘ideologies as political resources’, the book develops a conceptual model to understand the dynamics of political ideology in the Indian context. The model is based on a set of inter linked concepts of secularism, democracy, social justice, national unity and development. Together they constitute the legitimizing vocabulary for the post independence Indian polity according to the author. She states that this vocabulary has been substantially democratic and liberal in character and argues that in spite of several serious contestations over group rights, the ideational framework embodied in the Indian constitution has endured.</p>
<p>The main chapters of the book unpack the nuanced ways in which the ideological legacy of congress hegemony at the time of constitution making survives despite the changes in the institutional coordinates and despite numerous negotiations. The moment of making of the constitution was about centralization of political power and of containment of group rights. The debates in the late 1980s on the other hand were about decentralization of power and expansion of group rights. The earlier commentaries on this phase have often suggested two things—one, was about the challenges posed by these claims to the fine thread of secular and democratic nationalism in India. The other was about the ways in which the Indian state manipulates these claims by way of serious compromises with its stated ideals. The book under review argues differently. By unpacking the ‘macro units of ideology into their conceptual components’ it tries to offer a more nuanced analysis of the changing terms of debates. It concludes that the rise of a new politics caste and religion since the 1980s represents discursive shifts in India’s founding ideals but not radical break. The work underlines how a wide range of liberal norms have informed debates over group rights and how the vernacular conceptions of social justice have drawn upon egalitarian notions of equality of opportunity for all individuals.</p>
<p>The idea of resilience of Indian democracy has already been much celebrated in several ways and in that sense the conclusions drawn by the book do not mark a radical departure from the earlier scholarship. Besides, given the contextual nature of democratic politics in India, it is hard to define the moment of complete failure or that of a fundamental break from the stated ideals of the polity. In that sense also it is always possible to claim the successes of liberal democracy in India in spite of the severe strains it faces.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of the work under review needs to be highlighted in two respects. The first is about its reading of legislative debates to decipher the nature of political ideology. This has been a completely neglected area so far. The constituent assembly debates were meaningfully revisited by a few earlier works in their fresh readings of the constitutional framework. However, the legislative proceedings of the later years have never been keenly attended by the scholars of Indian democracy. Bajpai’s book adopts a distinctive methodological approach in suggesting how political rhetoric matters in research of the ideas.</p>
<p>The second unique aspect of the exercise is its ability to link up the Indian debates on group rights to several key issues in liberal democratic theory. The author sees the post colonial contexts as an important site for assessment of the limits of liberal multiculturalism in particular and the liberalism as an abstract philosophy in general. For her, the Indian case shows how post colonial multiculturalism may adopt multiple patterns in its shaping and opens up a space for contextual assessment of the concept of multiculturalism. At another level, the book underlines the need to study liberalism as a political ideology rather than as an abstract philosophy. Comparative interpretative exercises, that try to explore the shaping of democratic and liberal ideas in different contexts, may prove crucial in the development of a normative liberal theory of multiculturalism. The concluding chapter of the book jots down a few possible pointers towards further research on these issues.</p>
<p>The work becomes an important useful resource for students of Indian politics as well as for those of liberal democratic theory.</p>
