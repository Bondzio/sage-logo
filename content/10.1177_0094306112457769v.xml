<p>The scholarly and public debate about hip-hop music has proliferated for well over two decades. Unfortunately, far too much of it has focused on the motivations or attitudes of the artists who produce this material, and less critical attention has been directed toward the audience. I suspect that this is because the audiences are too often regarded as simplistically embracing whatever messages emanate from that music. Yet anyone who has had even casual conversations with consumers of hip-hop music understand that they possess myriad opinions and attitudes about the messages disseminated in it. Moreover, some of hip-hop’s most dedicated consumers simply like to dance to what they find to be good music, irrespective of what the artists are saying.</p>
<p>As an African American male who was immersed in this genre while a teenager in New York City throughout the early 1980s, I immediately witnessed strong differences in opinion about the lyrical content of this music, even among its strongest afficionados. These differences were heightened when so-called gangster-rap and lyrical forms emerged during the 1990s that appeared to some as uncouth and objectionable. Yet, I also continued to see many people commit to the dance floor even when those lyrics blasted through sound systems. After I entered academia and began taking notice of the scholarly debate about hip-hop music, I immediately began longing for academic contributions that offered extensive commentary not about the artists, nor about their presumed politics or public demeanors, but about the audience (and, as hip-hop fully transcended race and class boundaries by the 1990s, especially about the diversity of audiences). In producing <italic>Thug Life: Race, Gender, and the Meaning of Hip-Hop</italic>, Michael P. Jeffries does just that (well, at least almost).</p>
<p><italic>Thug Life</italic> aims to put the artists on the shelf, so to speak, by turning toward the attitudes and opinions of the young adult male consumers of hip-hop music. Jeffries explores the views of 40 males on the racial and gendered imagery and lyrical content of hip-hop music. Half of the men are black Americans and half are white Americans. Both groups are further sub-divided into the socio-economic categories of privileged and less privileged. The author seeks to explore how these men respond to narratives about ghetto life, “thuggin,” courtship, and material access that are performed by black men in commercially successful hip-hop (p. 5). Ultimately, the aim of this inquiry is to provide some insight into the question of “whether black men’s hip-hop thug narratives and performances (should) be considered resistant to or compliant with black subjugation” at a time in which images of blackness are highly consumed by white audiences (p. 5). In pursuing this agenda, Jeffries directly confronts how members of these two audiences reconcile with the sexism and subjugation that, depending on the public response to the matter, such music represents, further advances, or sometimes aims to challenge.</p>
<p>Jeffries does not simply deliver a bevy of critical assessments and interpretations of why these males embrace hip-hop with the intensity that they do, nor does he pontificate on the profligate consequences that have been associated with Americans’ consumption of that music. Instead, Jeffries finds great complexity and nuance in some of what these men have to say. He also uncovers some seemingly obvious realizations as well.</p>
<p>In addressing the more obvious, Jeffries makes clear that the men do not express extensive hang-ups over sexism and the often problematic portrait of women in this music. They often rely upon the common argument that some women reflect the imagery promoted by some of this music, making the claims by some artists appear to be legitimate—but that many women do not, so there is little need for anyone to take such matters too personally. Otherwise, and more insightfully, Jeffries finds that both the black and white men who he interviews are preoccupied with authenticity as a factor in how they evaluate hip-hop artists. There are critical differences, however, in how they make such considerations. Race serves as a core trope in black males’ efforts to make sense of which artists they find to be authentic in the consideration of “real” blackness. In contrast, the white males adhere almost exclusively to interpretations of the artistic capabilities of the artists as a means of attributing authenticity. The divergence in racial logics in this and other ways are the major findings in this work.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on audience reception, Jeffries ultimately does spend considerable time analyzing the lyrics of various hip-hop artists. It is here that his work takes the form all too commonly found in other studies and commentaries on hip-hop (and here he does not articulate any novel or unusual arguments about how and why artists make the kind of claims that they do about hyper-masculinity or gender more broadly).</p>
<p>Jeffries does contribute important understandings of the thought processes underlying men’s response to hip-hop. He makes clear what many consumers of the genre realize, but which seems to have escaped the imagination of the more extreme critics of hip-hop: audience members are not, as he phrases it, “brainwashed or brain dead” (p. 109), but do think critically about the material they consume. How this ultimately may affect their behavior is beyond the purview of this book. Yet the knowledge about the audiences garnered here demonstrates that members of different racial groups do maintain highly differentiated logics about how they make sense of racially-inscribed cultural properties.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Jeffries does not extend his insight into the different logics that black and white males construe about hip-hop music toward a more robust assessment of the contemporary meanings of race in America. As a sociologist I am left wondering, therefore, if the consumption of cultural artifacts by white males who experience different patterns of access to poverty or inter-racial interaction has any significant bearing on future possibilities for race relations. The book does raise questions (and really leads to extreme doubt) about whether black and white males can ever think about race in the same ways, even if intensely committed to the same cultural resources. Yet a more thorough understanding of this prospect is the property of sociologists. Accordingly, in establishing this query, <italic>Thug Life</italic>, a work by a cultural studies scholar, becomes especially meaningful for sociologists and their students.</p>
