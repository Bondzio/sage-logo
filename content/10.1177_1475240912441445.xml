<abstract>
<p>The aim of this article is to explore the perceptions and attitudes of Turkish university students about to embark on a European exchange trip. This qualitative study sheds light on their hopes and fears about travelling to and living for a period of three months in a western country. The article shows how participants shared common aspirations for their trip to be self-developmental and culturally educational. However, it also reveals a high degree of trepidation about their immersion, as Muslim students, in a country in the developed western world. This study thereby makes an important contribution to the international education literature in its identification of concern in students resulting from the current tension between Islam and the west and from perceived discrimination over economic status. The important link between macro forces and the micro experience is revealed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>International education is a major export industry at university level, with fierce competition among the key markets of the UK, Canada, the USA, New Zealand and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1475240912441445">Ryan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1475240912441445">van Hoof and Verbeeten, 2005</xref>). Full-fee paying international students represent a significant contribution to receiving higher education institutions, as well as to the economy of the host destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1475240912441445">Ritchie et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240912441445">Llewellyn-Smith and McCabe (2008)</xref> note that international university students constitute around 20 per cent of all international travellers, making student travel a multibillion dollar business: as international travel has become more accessible, convenient and affordable, the number of students pursuing part or all of their academic qualifications overseas will continue to grow. Awareness of their consumer power is increasing, as is resentment over mistreatment given their economic contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240912441445">Brown and Jones, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A growing segment of the international student market is made up of exchange students who undertake a course of assessed study at an overseas university, usually for a period of one semester or one year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240912441445">Llewellyn-Smith and McCabe, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, exchange students have been identified as a segment of the international student market that has significant growth potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1475240912441445">Van Hoof and Verbeeten (2005)</xref> argue that it is important to analyse the perceptions of students involved in such programmes, in order to instigate changes in support where needed. Little research has been conducted into the exchange student population. It is here that our study helps to fill a gap by focusing on the perceptions and attitudes of Turkish students about to embark on a European exchange trip. A greater understanding of such factors will enable host countries and universities to attract more students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240912441445">Llewellyn-Smith and McCabe, 2008</xref>). There is also a dearth of literature on the Muslim international student population (which our study will look to address), despite the recognition that faith may impact on the travel experience. Muslim students face specific challenges owing to global tensions that affect host receptivity and intergroup relations, and it is arguable that the impact and experience of the international sojourn will be different for this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1475240912441445">Zamani-Farahani and Henderson, 2010</xref>) than it may be for other groups.</p>

<title>Transformative power of travel</title>
<p>The international sojourn, defined as temporary between-culture contact for a duration of 6 months to 5 years by migrants, students and tourists, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240912441445">Jandt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240912441445">Hottola, 2004</xref>) is widely acknowledged to consist of an initially stress-inducing but ultimately enriching experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240912441445">Giddens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240912441445">Hofstede, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240912441445">Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912441445">Brown 2009a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240912441445">Giddens (1991)</xref> portrays loss and self-actualization as being intertwined; if an individual risks entering a transition in life, they will face stress, but they will develop internal strength as a result. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240912441445">Adler (1975)</xref> states, the international sojourn evolves from a confrontation with a new culture into an encounter with the self. Indeed, it is commonly claimed that sojourners undergo a journey of self-discovery, as removal from the comfort of the familiar forces them to test and stretch their resourcefulness and to revise their self-understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240912441445">Berry, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240912441445">Kim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1475240912441445">Milstein, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1475240912441445">Taylor (1994)</xref> uses the term perspective transformation to describe such change.</p>
<p>The sojourn has been likened to a therapeutic time of self-discovery. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1475240912441445">Madison (2006)</xref> writes of the opportunity for self-actualization, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240912441445">Hayes (2007)</xref> uses the term ‘becoming oneself’ to refer to the living of an authentic life that is distant from the familial and professional pressures associated with the home culture. Prolonged absence from the home world carries the potential to force a revision in how sojourners view their domestic and professional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1475240912441445">Vasiliki, 2000</xref>), as they develop an increased self-awareness, pliability, resilience and independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1475240912441445">Martin and Harrell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912441445">Brown 2009a</xref>). Studies of long-stay tourists by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240912441445">Hottola (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1475240912441445">O’Reilly (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1475240912441445">Tucker (2005)</xref> similarly show that tourism offers an opportunity not only for pleasure but also for self-exploration, as freedom from domestic constraints allows tourists to develop a stronger sense of self.</p>
<p>One of the oft-cited benefits of the sojourn includes the development of intercultural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240912441445">Gudykunst, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1475240912441445">Koester and Lustig, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1475240912441445">van Hoof and Verbeeten, 2005</xref>), defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1475240912441445">Hammer et al. (2003)</xref> as the ability to think and act in interculturally appropriate ways. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240912441445">Gudykunst (1998)</xref> states that the interculturally competent person is someone whose cognitive, behavioural and affective characteristics are open to growth beyond the psychological parameters of any one culture, a ‘model for human development’ unbound by original cultural norms and values. The attributes associated with intercultural competence are, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1475240912441445">Koester and Lustig (2003)</xref>, respect, empathy, cultural knowledge, tolerance for ambiguity and the capacity to manage interaction. The positive outcome for globalized society of the creation in large numbers of interculturally competent persons is that sojourners are transformed into a human bridge between cultures upon their return home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240912441445">Bochner, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240912441445">Cushner and Karim, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Claims for changes in cultural outlook are made in a small but growing literature on the consequences of long-stay travel, owing to the characteristics of openness, flexibility and tolerance associated with the long-stay tourist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1475240912441445">Muzaini, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1475240912441445">Noy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1475240912441445">Tucker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1475240912441445">O’Reilly, 2006</xref>). Indeed, a correlation has been observed between tourism, international education and world peace, believed to be due to their associated extended cross-cultural contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240912441445">d’Amore, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240912441445">Askjellerud, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1475240912441445">Noy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1475240912441445">van Hoof and Verbeeten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1475240912441445">Muzaini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1475240912441445">O’Reilly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1475240912441445">Steyn and Grant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912441445">Brown, 2009a</xref>;). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240912441445">1986, Bochner</xref> argued that international education and tourism were the most powerful positive influences on world relations: given the increase in both, such a claim arguably still holds true. However, it should be noted that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1475240912441445">Litvin (1998)</xref> argues for a less idealistic treatment of the link between tourism and peace by researchers, arguing that tourism is a beneficiary rather than a generator of peace, and the same could be said of international education.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above-cited positive outcomes of extended cultural contact, there is recognition that the changes effected in personal and cultural outlook pose problems in return to the home culture. It is often stated that sojourners have to undergo a stage of reverse culture shock when re-adapting to life at home (Martin and Harrell, 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1475240912441445">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1475240912441445">Kiley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1475240912441445">Ward et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240912441445">Cushner and Karim 2004</xref>); a distinguishing feature of such ‘re-entry shock’ is that it is unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1475240912441445">Martin and Harrell, 2004</xref>). A lack of conformity to group norms could isolate the ‘returnee’ from mainstream society: unless sojourners become successful in moving fluidly between different life worlds, they might be compelled to undergo the painful and conflicting process of unlearning the new norms and values absorbed during their sojourn. The outcome of the sojourn is only life-enhancing if positive change can be maintained at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912441445">Brown, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, an undoubted benefit of personal and cultural change is that the career prospects of returnees are improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1475240912441445">Ledwith and Seymour, 2001</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1475240912441445">Van Hoof and Verbeeten (2005)</xref> point out, international experience helps young students to become more mature, well-rounded and culturally sensitive adults. This is acknowledged in a report by the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912441445">EC-DGEC, 2002</xref>) on exchange programmes that, owing to the positive outcomes of increased language and culture skills, calls for more and more higher education institutions to sign up to exchange agreements.</p>

<sec id="section4-1475240912441445">
<title>Impact of global politics on the international sojourn</title>
<p>It is widely acknowledged that most sojourners face difficulties in adjusting to a new cultural environment (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240912441445">Kim 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1475240912441445">Ward et al., 2001</xref>): among these difficulties may be identity confusion and depression caused by discrimination on the grounds of race and faith. Indeed, it is recognized that host reactions towards visitors shape the lived experience of the sojourner, influencing both well-being and interaction patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240912441445">Berry, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1475240912441445">Stephan and Stephan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912441445">Brown, 2009b</xref>). Research shows that racial appearance influences the treatment of sojourners by the host community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1475240912441445">Honeyford, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240912441445">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912441445">Brown, 2009b</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that physical attacks on visitors to Europe are on the increase; there has been a rise in particular in acts stemming from Islamophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240912441445">Bunting, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240912441445">European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, 2010</xref>). The same point was noted in research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912441445">Brown (2009c)</xref>, which found a high incidence of verbal and physical abuse against Muslim international students in the UK. Muslim sojourners were embroiled in a state of tension that they had not experienced before. Geopolitical tension affected the everyday life of Muslim students, who pointed to a clear link between their safety and events in the macro environment, such as the September 11 terrorist attack on the USA (‘9/11’), the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the growth in Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. Clearly, researchers must not overlook the dynamic relationship between the micro and the macro context; they must contextualize findings in their contemporary socio-political setting.</p>
<p>The hostility shown towards Muslims is attributed partly to racism and bigotry, and partly to global tensions between Islam and the west, encompassing the ‘war on terror’ and western foreign policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1475240912441445">Omar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912441445">Brown, 2009c</xref>). Whether Muslim sojourners are vulnerable to physical and verbal assault may be a function of the outer manifestation and visibility of their faith but, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1475240912441445">Omar (2006)</xref>, discomfort is likely to be universally experienced by Muslims living in a society in which there prevails a generalized anxiety over and mistrust of Islam. Baines et al. (2006) attribute the source of tension between Muslim and non-Muslim groups to two factors: to the fear and suspicion in the non-Muslim community of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism, which has grown since the events of 9/11 (commonly described as Islamophobia); and to resentment in the Muslim community over the portrait and treatment of Muslims and a seemingly blanket association between Islam and terrorism, as well as apprehension over retribution by the non-Muslim community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1475240912441445">Zamani-Farahani and Henderson (2010)</xref> support this observation, stating that political tensions between the west and some Muslim countries have created and reinforced mutual suspicion, with negative implications for the Muslim tourist to the west.</p>
<p>In their qualitative study of British Muslim attitudes towards militant Islamic propaganda, Baines et al. (2006) found that most Muslims are unsympathetic towards militant Islamism, though they resent the destruction by the western media of the image of their faith by equating Islam with terrorism: this point is also made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1475240912441445">Omar (2006)</xref>, who describes an uneasy relationship for Muslims living in a western country between self-image and faith. The same point is also supported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912441445">Brown’s (2009c)</xref> study of international Muslim postgraduate students in the UK. In her paper on the link between faith and well-being, international Muslim students reported both anxiety over disclosure of religious affiliation for fear of negative judgement and verbal and/or physical assault, and an unforeseen defensiveness about their religious/cultural identity. Indeed, in times of tension, Muslim students at UK universities are regularly warned to be careful about their personal safety by the Federation of Student Islamic Societies, which represents 90,000 Muslim students in the UK. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912441445">Althen (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1475240912441445">Ward (2001)</xref> observe, the link between larger political and economic forces and the reception offered to international visitors cannot be ignored in studies of contact between cultures. Meanwhile, Baines et al. (2006) describe the relations between Islam and the west as a highly sensitive contemporary topic; indeed they have labelled it <italic>the</italic> issue of our times.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A qualitative approach was selected as the basis for data collection in this study in order to enable students to express their opinions and feelings freely and without restriction. In August 2009, unstructured interviews were held with all 11 undergraduate students (nine female; two male) who had been selected as exchange students by the international office of their home university in Izmir, Turkey. The Centre for European Union Education and Youth Programmes, a division within the Ministry of EU Affairs, sets the criteria each year for those who can participate in an Erasmus exchange. In the year the interviews were conducted, the first criterion was a minimum 2.4 (out of 4) cumulative grade at the time of application. Those who meet this criterion then take a foreign-language test. The two students going to France took a French test, while the rest took an English test. Students are then listed starting with the highest grades achieved in the test. Each department has a certain quota, restricting the number of students to be sent abroad. In the year the interviews were conducted, the quota for the Department of Tourism Management was 10, so the 10 highest graded achievers in the foreign-language test were selected to benefit from Erasmus funding. The remaining student (who went to Hungary) agreed to fund his own travel. Students were about to embark on a 4-month programme of study in one of a number of countries included in the existing bilateral agreements between the sending and receiving universities at the time of data collection. The breakdown of countries visited is as follows: Hungary (4), France (2), Holland (2) and Finland (3). All these countries send students to the Turkish university in question as part of the bilateral agreement. It is important to note that students participated in individual exchanges (they did not travel as a group) and that each student travelled to one country only, which they selected themselves. The voluntary participation of students in the research was encouraged by one of the authors, who currently acts as an international relations coordinator of the Department of Tourism Management of the sending university in Izmir, but who had no influence on student selection for exchange programmes.</p>
<p>Students were invited to interview sessions by email; they were offered alternative dates and times so that a mutually convenient time could be agreed. They were provided with information on the research and its aim, and were assured about the confidentiality with which the information they were to provide would be treated. Students were told that the aim of the research was to find out how they were feeling about their imminent exchange trip. Students’ interest and willingness to participate in the research were high, probably because they felt that they could talk about the exceptional nature of their experience with someone who showed an interest in it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1475240912441445">van Hoof and Verbeeten, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Interviews were held prior to the orientation programme planned for all exchange students in order to access their unaffected perceptions and feelings. An unstructured interview approach was used; the first question used in all interviews was ‘How are you feeling about your trip?’ Subsequently, each interview proceeded according to the response of the interviewee. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1475240912441445">Mason (2002)</xref> notes, the hallmarks of the qualitative interview are its flexibility and spontaneity. Interviews took place in the researcher’s office a month before the students travelled abroad. Interviews lasted from 45 minutes to 1 hour, and were conducted in Turkish as interviewees and interviewer were native Turkish speakers. The tape-recorded interviews were then transcribed into text documents and translated into English by the bilingual researcher, then checked by the English native-speaker co-author. In order to confirm an accurate and congruent translation of the Turkish findings, the English text was repeatedly analysed and checked by the Turkish–English bilingual Turkish author.</p>
<p>Thematic analysis was used to generate research categories. As Holloway and Wheeler (2010) advise, the first step of thematic analysis involves immersion in the data; thus transcripts were repeatedly read, in order to get a sense of the whole. Subsequently, a process of coding was conducted whereby the transcripts were separated into manageable chunks and labelled as discretely as possible. Codes were then placed into broader categories, which represent the main themes of the research, as reflected in the headings of the results section below. As is appropriate in an inductive study (Holloway and Wheeler, 2010), the research categories emerge from the data and reflect participants’ particular biases.</p>
<p>Qualitative researchers acknowledge that a small sample makes generalization impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1475240912441445">Mason, 2002</xref>). However, <italic>transferability</italic> is an alternative label for generalizability. Transferability refers to the extent to which findings and conclusions can be transferred to similar settings and situations with similar participants. This requires researchers to show good judgment on how their context is transferable (Daymon and Holloway, 2010). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1475240912441445">Hammersley (1992</xref>: 16) argues, it is possible to produce research that identifies generic features: ‘to find the general in the particular; a world in a grain of sand’. This exploratory study has produced findings that may resonate with Muslim students from countries other than Turkey and with other categories of tourists about to travel from a Muslim to a western country. According to Todres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1475240912441445">2003</xref>), resonance is a key criterion for judging the quality of qualitative research.</p>

<title>New horizons</title>
<p>Outweighing any feelings of trepidation about studying abroad was a universal excitement about the unknown life journey in front of them, as expressed by the following student: ‘I am excited. I do not know exactly what I should expect from the whole thing just yet, but I am excited!’ This finding lends weight to the notion embraced in the old, but widely cited and regularly reformulated, U-Curve models of adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1475240912441445">Lysgaard, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1475240912441445">Oberg, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1475240912441445">Mohamed, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1475240912441445">Liu, 2001</xref>) that euphoria is commonly initially experienced by sojourners. Though the present study captures only students’ feelings before departure, these feelings echo the sentiments expressed by international students in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240912441445">Brown and Holloway (2008)</xref>, which documents a high level of excitement about their anticipated new venture. It is equally important to mention that students in this study were not yet overwhelmed by the possible negative symptoms associated with culture shock. In fact, students seemed prematurely aware of the growth potential of stress; they were optimistic about the power of the forthcoming exchange visit to effect in them positive changes, including improved coping skills, increased confidence, greater independence and altered life perspectives:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I might have problems over there, and I will need to cope with such problems. I think I want to prove to myself that I can do all this, and say ‘I have done it’ in the end.</p>
<p>I will improve my self-confidence. I will probably be more open to new cultures. I may change some of my habits and attitudes in the end.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students were aware of the opportunity for self-exploration offered by the exchange. This reflects philosophical discussions of the life-changing nature of the international sojourn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1475240912441445">Todres, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1475240912441445">Hayes, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Excitement about travel to a new destination was unanimous; for most students this was to be the first time they had been abroad, and the first time they had travelled by air:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have been excited since the day I was told that I am going to Hungary. I can get excited even by thinking about the application for a visa! This will be my first trip abroad.</p>
<p>I do think it will be an experience of a lifetime. Just being abroad sounds fantastic.</p>
<p>Just getting on board to fly is exciting enough on its own. I have never flown before.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, excitement over the prospect of travel to the destination and of using it as a starting point for travel to nearby destinations, including to neighbouring countries, was universal. This finding echoes the importance attributed by exchange students to the opportunity to travel while abroad in research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240912441445">Llewellyn-Smith and McCabe (2008)</xref> and clearly indicates the importance of this market segment for destination managers. The following comments show students’ awareness of themselves as leisure tourists during their time away from Turkey:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I would like to see as many places as I can, to travel to lots of beautiful cities and countries.</p>
<p>I have also considered the location of Hungary in Europe. It is close to all these places I would like to discover. It will be easy and cheap to travel.</p>
<p>I would like to travel to other European countries during my stay there. To be honest, I am more excited about travelling to different countries than being in Hungary all the time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though students were aware that the purpose of their visit was educational, they were determined to exploit the opportunity to travel, underlining the value of the international student market to tourism destinations. This leads us to reconsider the classification put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1475240912441445">Ritchie et al. (2003)</xref>, who argue that international students should be classified as ‘education first tourists’ whose primary motivator is education rather than the destination and the opportunity for travel. This is disputed in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240912441445">Llewellyn-Smith and McCabe (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1475240912441445">Van Hoof and Verbeeten (2005)</xref>, which, like our research, found the accessibility of the university town to tourist attractions and other tourist destinations to be comparatively more important in institution selection than the academic offer. Our findings suggest that travel opportunities are central to students’ choice of destination and that their purpose of trip is therefore twofold. This lends weight to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240912441445">Llewellyn-Smith and McCabe’s (2008)</xref> complaint that the travel undertaken by international students during their academic sojourn is a neglected research area, which is also under-exploited by destination marketing organizations. Despite the size and growth of the international student population, this market has been neglected because of the assumption of its low market value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1475240912441445">Ritchie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1475240912441445">Llewellyn-Smith and McCabe, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Learning about new cultures</title>
<p>The prospect for cultural learning offered by the international sojourn was acknowledged by all to be an exciting aspect of the student exchange scheme: enthusiasm for meeting people from different cultures was unanimous. The following comments reflect an early desire for cultural learning:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think being in a different cultural environment and meeting new people are the aspects I am most happy about. I would like to meet new people, and to learn about their culture and traditions.</p>
<p>Meeting students from different cultural backgrounds will be interesting. I hope to meet people that I cannot find in Turkey. I am so curious!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to cross-cultural communication theory, openness is a key variable in successful intergroup encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1475240912441445">Kim, 2001</xref>), and our interviews show a preparedness for and acceptance of cultural differences, as expressed simply by the following student:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The world does not constitute only Turkey and Turkish people. I am well aware of this fact, and I am curious to find out about what is going on in the rest of the world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students indicated a broad category width, a term developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912441445">Detweiler (1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475240912441445">1980</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240912441445">Gudykunst (1998)</xref> to describe openness to and tolerance of diversity. This attitude of mind is often present in a sojourner, who is usually inclined to adjust to some extent to local cultural norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1475240912441445">Jandt, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Students were also aware that distance from the origin culture would bring insight into their own cultural programming. Indeed, self-knowledge is cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240912441445">Hofstede (2001)</xref> as one of the prerequisites of cultural relativism, which he defines as the recognition that no single culture has the absolute criteria for judging another. One student observed that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You would be eager to find what causes you to become different. I look forward to analyse myself in a different culture, and understanding my own culture better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students were committed to communicating this cultural distinctiveness to students of other nationalities; enthusiasm for promoting the origin culture, in this case, Turkey, was a common theme:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think they can find me more interesting than, let’s say, a German or Polish student. Because I am different. I am excited about telling them whatever I know about my country and myself.</p>
<p>I will also find an opportunity to talk about my country and how beautiful it is.</p>
<p>Because we are so different from them, they would find talking to us more interesting. There are so many things that we can learn from each other.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tendency to see themselves as national ambassadors was pronounced. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1475240912441445">Ward (2001)</xref> points out, patriotism often increases during absence from the home country.</p>
<p>Finally, students were keen to learn about the host community. Contact with international friends was important, but host contact was a target before arrival, as pointed out by the following students:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am not going to Hungary to meet Italians, Greeks or French. I would like to be with the Hungarians. We have a chance of learning the Hungarian culture in its utmost details. We will be living there. In their town, at their university, with Hungarian students. We will see how they live.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is worth noting that previous research has documented a desire to achieve host contact alongside a simultaneous failure to do so, owing to an apparent unwillingness among the host population to offer the hand of friendship: this has led to disenchantment over the reception offered by the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1475240912441445">Spencer-Rodgers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1475240912441445">Ward et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912441445">Brown, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, all students equated increased cultural knowledge with increased employability; there was universal awareness that globalization entailed international cooperation and an expectation that internationalized companies would prize the cultural skills that the international study context would instil. Indeed, this association is widely acknowledged in the sojourner adjustment literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240912441445">Cushner and Karim, 2004</xref>), and also appears in the tourist literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1475240912441445">Hottola, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1475240912441445">O’Reilly, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1475240912441445">Milstein (2005)</xref>, for example, found a positive correlation between cross-cultural contact and the development of improved communicative self-efficacy that would be a valuable asset to a graduate’s curriculum vitae. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240912441445">Casado (2009)</xref> meanwhile observes that tourism and hospitality education must involve student preparation for the international nature of the industry, and as successive European Commission reports conclude, nowhere are students better prepared than through direct experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912441445">EC-DGEC, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240912441445">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240912441445">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>By the students in the present study it was also perceived that the trip provided a possibly useful networking opportunity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>New friends, new connections, new culture … Who knows, a new product or a new market I might discover during my stay in Hungary, may help me establish my own business.</p>
<p>You never know, I might as well do business with Hungary when I graduate. From the tourism perspective, it is still an untouched market for Turkey.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The value of international contacts for future tourism professionals has also been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912441445">Brown (2009a)</xref>, who simultaneously observes the lack of evidence of the durability of such ties. However, echoing the claim made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240912441445">Cushner and Mahon (2002)</xref> that the consequences of the international sojourn for professional life should outlast the actual stay, this study clearly indicates students’ sense that the sojourn would be both professionally and personally enriching, carrying influence beyond the immediate future.</p>

<title>Preparing for battle: anticipating attacks on developing world status</title>
<p>Thus far, only the anticipated positive outcomes of cultural contact have been observed, reflecting and supporting the existing literature on the transformative power of the international sojourn. However, also of note in analysis of interviews was a common fear of negative judgement of Turkey’s status as a developing economy. This article thus makes an important contribution to the literature on the international sojourn in making a link between economic standing, collective self-esteem and experience of the sojourn. Students were concerned that they would be treated as inferior by those from more developed economies. The influence of economic status on intergroup relations has received limited empirical attention, though its importance in theoretical work has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912441445">Althen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1475240912441445">Stephan and Stephan, 2001</xref>). Social psychology theory is useful in understanding students’ fears: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1475240912441445">Quarantelli and Cooper (1972)</xref>, for instance, argue that it is the perceived rather than the actual response from others that more often determines self-concept. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240912441445">Cooley (1972)</xref> describes this perceived response as the self-idea, the imagined effect on another’s mind that can stimulate feelings of pride or mortification. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240912441445">Giddens (1991)</xref> argues that self-esteem is continually vulnerable to the reaction of others, and this is reflected in the following typical comments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>They may have some biases against Turkish students. They may not know enough about our country, our education system or our culture. They may think that we do not have an equivalent education system, just because we are a developing country.</p>
<p>Those coming from developed countries would be biased against Turks. During visa applications, they asked us to take a tuberculosis test. That was insulting!</p>
<p>I am slightly worried that I have to convince people that we are nice people. Those who attended similar programmes in the past say that it takes several weeks to overcome biases against Turkey and Turkish people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students exhibited a strong cultural identification, considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1475240912441445">Sussman (2002)</xref> to be important in the maintenance of both identity and self-worth. Moreover, students trusted that face-to-face contact would overcome negative stereotypes. However, previous research suggests that students’ fears are grounded: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240912441445">Brown’s (2008)</xref> study of international student adjustment revealed a negative association between economic status, prejudice and collective self-esteem, among for example students from China, Thailand and Iran. Indeed, in the present study, students whose exchange university was in Hungary spoke of being reassured by the fact that their destination was in eastern Europe, considered on a par with Turkey. Interestingly, students themselves made a correlation between a high GDP, superiority and derogation of those from developing countries; conversely a link was made between modesty and low economic status. Comfort would be obtained from contact with groups of similar economic standing:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I suspect that Hungarians would be humble and friendly people. They are brought up in a communist system. So, they could not be spoiled people looking down at others.</p>
<p>I do not think Hungarians would be spoiled people like French or British, who often ignore or look down on other nationalities. Some Western Europeans think that they are superior. Whereas, if you look at the country profiles – and I did my research and even looked at the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] figures to see where Hungary stands in terms of population, unemployment and gross domestic product – they are still at an early phase of development. So, I expect them to be more humble.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to in-group/out-group theory, a perceived or actual attack on the collective self-esteem can lead to derogation of the attacking out-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240912441445">Crocker and Luhtanen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240912441445">Branscombe and Wann, 1994</xref>) and to defensive strategies to maintain self-worth. Indeed in this instance, with the perceived ‘superior westerners’ as the out-group, students manifested pre-departure a determination to promote Turkey’s superiority to other developing countries:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I will try my best to express who we are, and what qualities we are equipped with throughout our education. I do not want them to think that we lack educational qualifications required to take courses in France, as I do not think that we do.</p>
<p>I will do my best to change this with the students I meet; I think our university should have a policy when selecting students. They should select students who can represent Turkish people accurately in foreign countries.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A strong cultural identification bolsters resistance against attack, but it might be pertinent to ask whether students’ own prejudices and fears might diminish through encounters with westerners who do <italic>not</italic> display signs of condescension towards Turkish nationals. The decategorization process, defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240912441445">Gudykunst (1998)</xref> as the challenge to negative stereotypes brought by intergroup contact, might apply to themselves as well as to non-Turkish groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1475240912441445">
<title>Fear of stigmatization</title>
<p>A further significant contribution to the literature on the international student experience is made by this study in the relationship it establishes between faith and environmental receptivity. Very little research has focused on the experiences of Muslim international students whose well-being and security in the new country can be threatened by a popular and often media-inspired equation between Islam and terrorism (Baines et al., 2006). This study helps to shed light on the malaise that is uniquely experienced by Muslim students studying in a western culture by revealing the unanimous concern of the Turkish students in this study that they might be treated unfavourably because of their faith: Turkey is a Muslim country, though the country is a secular state of long standing (with constitutional reforms starting in 1923 and being completed in 1937). The source of anxiety was centred on students’ awareness of the global tension between Islam and the west, as encapsulated in the question posed of the interviewer by one of the interviewees: ‘What happens if they call me a terrorist?’ Baumann (2000: ix) argues that identity only assumes importance when it is challenged: ‘no thoughts are given to identity when “belonging” comes naturally, when it does not need to be fought for, earned, claimed and defended.’ Perhaps religious identity is preoccupying for Muslim students in an era of global tension between Islam and the west?</p>
<p>As shown in the following excerpts, students were anxious that negative judgements would be made about their faith due to a link in the popular western media between Islam and terrorism; such fear was exacerbated by word of mouth about acts of Islamophobia in western countries, particularly from Internet chat rooms:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I log into various chat and blog sites on the Internet. There, if you are involved in any discussion groups with other nationalities, the topic of Islam-Christianity arising is just a matter of time. Some are really biased and believe what they are told about Islam. Meeting with such people in Hungary may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Despite all the advantages of France, I know that their people can be quite racist. They are not really happy with Turks living in their country. That is probably because they think of Turks as a bit conservative, religious and isolated, who only mix in their own groups. I am slightly worried that they will approach me with bias, or they will not approach at all.</p>
<p>I am concerned about religious issues. I suspect that the possibility of foreigners being biased against Islam is much higher than biases against Turks.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Vindication of students’ fears is found in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912441445">Brown (2009c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912441445">Appleton (2005)</xref>, which point to a high incidence and fear of bigotry against Muslim students, if faith is outwardly detectable. This is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1475240912441445">the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding (2007)</xref>, which cites Islamophobia as the main source of bigotry in Europe. Of interest is the allusion by this source to the importance of the Internet as a source of (negative) pre-travel information, also noted in research into travel decisions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240912441445">Brown and Holloway (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1475240912441445">Xu et al. (2009)</xref>, who cite the Internet as the main information source among student travellers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a small number of students in the present study were anxious about cultural differences in the tolerance of alternative lifestyles, as expressed in the following observations:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can get irritated by the forward and eccentric lifestyles of Europeans sometimes. I see that as forcing the limits in the name of being free, or having freedom. Well, they use drugs. Gay relationships are accepted. I am not really sure whether you can put all these behind a ‘tolerant’ mask.</p>
<p>I might observe attitudes not acceptable by Turkish customs and habits. I mean, in terms of morals. I would not be happy to see people making love in public spaces, or even worse, to be approached by someone with such ideas in his mind. We are not that open about such confrontations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was awareness that differing religious and moral values between the origin and the host culture might lead to some discomfort. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240912441445">Furnham and Alibhai (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912441445">Brown (2009c)</xref> claim that the sojourner is usually attuned to similarities as a source of validation of their own cultural identity. This reassuring mirroring of students’ values and behaviour would not be offered in the new culture. It must be pointed out however that the majority of students were insistent on their cultural similarity with European countries, and it can be inferred that students who expressed the above sentiments were possibly more devout than the rest of the participants. Nevertheless, this study sheds light on the possible concerns of tourists to the west from stricter Muslim countries.</p>
<p>Indeed the response to possible discrimination on the grounds of faith was a unanimous declaration by the students of Turkey’s secularity and moderateness. Students were resolute that communication of their distinctiveness from other Muslim countries would eradicate negative judgement. Again, promotion of the special characteristics of the home country was common: insistence on Turkey’s moderateness is shown in the excerpts below:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Yes, I am Muslim. But I am not extremely religious. I do drink alcohol, have fun with friends, and if there is a tiny little bit of pork on my plate, I would not make a big fuss about it. I would not think, ‘ok, it is time to get prepared for hell’. I do not think Turkish people my age are really religious.</p>
<p>We all know how marketing is important in portraying countries correctly. I will try to create a positive image of Turkey and Turkish people, who are well-educated, modern and not much different than Europeans. They may think that we are an Islamic nation such as Iran. It is our responsibility to tell as many people as we can, that we are not like that, and we have a secular system in our country. If I can make even one person understand this reality, I would be a happy person.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students did not then criticize the west’s confusion of Islam with fundamentalism and terrorism, something that, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1475240912441445">Omar (2006)</xref>, forces Muslims into an uneasy relationship with their faith. Instead they insisted on underlining Turkey’s secular status, in a bid to secure a more positive judgement.</p>
<p>Finally, running through all interviews was a high degree of optimism; that a sense of common humanity would ensure that faith would not divide students from other national and religious groups is encapsulated in the comment ‘We are all human beings with two eyes, and two ears. How different could we be?’</p>
<p>Important personality attributes in the creation of peaceful relations were cited and included respect, tolerance and understanding, all fundamental ingredients in the development of a culturally relativist mindset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1475240912441445">Hofstede, 2001</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am not pessimistic about being a Muslim student. I am confident that I can deal with such negative thoughts. Once they get to know me, they will understand that we are not any different.</p>
<p>It would be so stupid to argue over religions. We all need to respect each other’s values and beliefs. If we, both parties, respect each other, I do not see why religion should be a problem. Everybody should approach each other with tolerance. Religion is something personal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was strong confidence in the reception to be offered by the student population and by the host society: students would arrive with high expectations of a positive host welcome. How such optimism would fare on direct experience of either indifference or bigotry, as documented in other studies of host-visitor contact, remained to be tested.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study reveals that the perceived benefits of international travel for education were manifold. They included a test of personal resourcefulness, an opportunity to travel and to learn about new cultures and to enhance career prospects. Such positive outcomes are echoed in the literature on the international sojourn, and lead us to conclude that more students should be encouraged to take up opportunities such as those offered by the Erasmus scheme. Indeed this is the remit of the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912441445">EC-DGEC, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240912441445">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240912441445">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, since participants stated that the purpose of their visit was to obtain an education and to travel during their stay, we recommend that the receiving institution should cooperate with the stakeholders of their local and regional tourism industry in order to improve marketing targeted at students in the origin country and in the destination. Destination management organizations should assess the characteristics and travelling habits of this potential and lucrative market segment. The ever growing exchange student market enables destinations not only to diversify their tourism income sources with alternative tourist products appealing to different segments. The use made of the Internet by prospective students is also highlighted, pointing to the need by institutions and destination management organizations to maximize their online visibility.</p>
<p>This article also highlights the anxiety experienced by Turkish Muslim students with respect to possible discrimination over Turkey’s status as a less developed economy and as a Muslim country. By so doing it illuminates the link between the micro and the macro, and makes an important contribution to our understanding of the factors that influence the experience of the international sojourn. A prevalent fear that national and religious identity would lead to prejudice and maltreatment by members of the host community, and by other exchange students, suggests a need for the receiving institution to ensure that appropriate pastoral support systems are in place in the event of student distress. The intervention strategies to be used by those offering pastoral or psychological support to international students (including personal tutors, programme administrators, lecturers, chaplaincy) should be available at the start of the sojourn when stress is usually at its height, as feared by this study’s participants. However, access to support should be ongoing in case of stress suffered, as students indicate, through confrontations with prejudice or suspicion based on religious affiliation. Support staff in the receiving destination should inform themselves about the political and religious background of students’ origin country and any issues of contemporary concern should be addressed. The student population make-up is changing and institutions need to be prepared for this. The local community should be made aware of the economic contribution made by international students to the receiving area, and increased tolerance of difference should be encouraged. Though whether this is a sustainable and feasible suggestion is debatable: sojourners are caught in larger political and societal issues over which neither they nor the host institution may have any control.</p>
