<p>Objective: The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the cosmetic results of wedge resection of the nail matrix (Winograd technique) in the treatment of ingrown toenail. Materials and methods: This study retrospectively reviewed medical charts of 68 patients with 75 ingrown toenails who underwent surgical correction with the Winograd technique between January, 2008, and December, 2009, at the Orthopaedics and Traumatology Department, Antalya Education and Research Hospital. For the final follow-up, patients were contacted by telephone and completed a telephone questionnaire. Recurrence, cosmetic results, and satisfaction of the patients were the major outcome measures. Results: There was recurrence in 9 patients (13.2%). The mean recurrence time was 6.7 months (range = 2-12 months). All recurrences involved the lateral border of the toenail. Cosmetic ratings were statistically lower in female patients (P = .005). The reasons for poor and acceptable cosmetic results were proximal-incision scar and narrowing of the nail plate. Conclusion: Wedge resection of nail matrix has a considerably high recurrence rate. Furthermore, narrowing of the nail plate is a disadvantage of this procedure. All patients should be informed about the possibility of recurrence and disfigurement in their toenails (narrow nail plate). Particularly, female patients who care about the cosmesis may be dissatisfied with this surgical technique.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ingrown toenail, also known as onychocryptosis and unguis incarnatus, is a common disorder that causes pain and discomfort in daily activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012444729">1</xref></sup> Currently, a wide variety of treatment options exist ranging from conservative treatment in the form of basic foot care and footwear advice to complete surgical ablation of the nail bed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012444729">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012444729"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012444729">3</xref></sup> Conservative treatment can be used at the initial stage of the disease; however, presentation with a later stage of the disease or refractory cases may need surgical treatment.</p>
<p>Several different surgical techniques have been described up to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012444729">4</xref></sup> Although, partial nail avulsion coupled with chemical destruction of the nail matrix (matricectomy) with phenol remains the most preferred surgical technique, wedge resection of nail matrix (Winograd technique) is still popular in many clinics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012444729">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012444729">6</xref></sup> Several studies have been published regarding the results of the Winograd technique or its modifications since its description in 1929.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012444729">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012444729"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012444729"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012444729"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012444729"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012444729"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012444729"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012444729">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Almost all these studies evaluated the effectiveness of the surgical technique with the rate of recurrence. On the other hand, cosmetic result of this procedure is underestimated from the surgeons’ point of view. In a recent review that evaluated the effectiveness of methods of the surgical treatment of ingrown toenails, the authors noted that recurrence was the primary outcome measure; however, no conclusions could be drawn on the differences in healing times, degree of pain, and frequency of infection between the different procedures. Furthermore, in the studies where patient satisfaction was recorded, methods of assessment were not described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012444729">5</xref></sup> Toenails not only protect the fingers and surrounding soft tissues but also serve a cosmetic role. Therefore, the cosmetic results are also as important as the other outcome measures.</p>
<p>The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the cosmetic results of wedge resection of the nail matrix (Winograd technique) in the treatment of ingrown toenail.</p>

<sec id="section2-1938640012444729" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed medical charts of consecutive patients who underwent surgical correction of ingrown toenail between January, 2008, and December, 2009, at our clinic. All patients in whom the Winograd technique was performed were included in this study. Patients with follow-up duration of &lt;12 months were excluded from the study. Demographic information and anatomic localization of the disease (medial, lateral, or both borders) were recorded. Heifetz staging system was used to classify the severity of the ingrown toenail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012444729">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>For the final follow-up, patients were contacted by telephone and completed a telephone questionnaire. Recurrence, cosmetic results, and satisfaction of the patients were the major outcome measures. Cosmetic results of the patients were evaluated according to patients’ subjective ratings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938640012444729">Table 1</xref>). Satisfaction of the patient was scored as “yes” or “no.”</p>

<title>Wedge Resection of Nail Matrix (Winograd Procedure)</title>
<p>We performed all operations on the day of admission. A single dose of a first generation cephalosporin was administered to all patients 30 minutes prior to the start of the procedure for infection prophylaxis. An anesthetic block was carried out at the base of the toe with a 2% solution of Prilocain at the level of the lateral and medial neurovascular bundles and dorsal accessory branches. The finger of a surgical glove was used as a tourniquet. The Winograd procedure involves a “D” shaped excision of the nail root and overlying soft tissues. A 2- to 3-mm segment of nail on the nail edge was removed through a longitudinal incision together with a wedge of nail plate and the lateral nail fold, including the granulation tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012444729">Figure 1A</xref>). The incision was lengthened proximally and the proximal matrix was removed sharply. A semielliptic wedge down to the bone was created (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012444729">Figure 1B</xref>). The margins were then closed with sutures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012444729">Figure 1C</xref>). Compression bandage was applied and dressings were changed 3 to 4 times a week, as necessary.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the 24-month period under investigation, 116 patients were surgically treated at our clinic. Of these 116 patients, 92 were treated with the Winograd technique. Sixty-eight patients with 75 ingrown toenails responded to our telephone survey and were included in the analysis. There were 26 female (38.2%) and 42 male (61.8%) patients. The mean age was 24.2 ± 9.7 standard deviation. Lateral border of the toenail was involved in 64 toes, medial border in 5 patients, and bilateral border in 7 patients. Fifty-four ingrown toenails were classified as Heifetz type III and 21 were classified as Heifetz type II. The mean (± standard deviation) follow-up time was 23.8 ± 6.01 months. There was recurrence in 9 patients (13.2%). The mean recurrence time was 6.7 months (range = 2-12 months). All recurrences involved the lateral border of the toenail. All these patients were reoperated with the Winograd technique at the time of recurrence. No further recurrence was present at the final follow-up. Twenty-four patients with 26 ingrown toenails were lost for follow-up. When we assume all these cases as recurrent cases, the recurrence rate would be 34.6% (worst case scenario).</p>
<p>In all, 66 (97%) patients were satisfied with the treatment. Although, there was no recurrence, 2 patients were dissatisfied from the treatment because of intermittent pain. Sixty-two patients, with 69 ingrown toenails, rated cosmetic results as “excellent,” 4 patients as “acceptable,” and 2 patients as “poor.” Cosmetic results were excellent in all the male patients. Cosmetic ratings were statistically lower in female patients (<italic>P</italic> = .005). The reasons for poor and acceptable cosmetic results were proximal-incision scar and narrowing of the nail plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012444729">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study investigated the patient-oriented cosmetic results of wedge resection of the nail matrix (Winograd technique) in the treatment of ingrown toenail. Although 97% of patients were satisfied with the treatment and were happy to recover from this decapitating condition, 8.8% of patients complained about the cosmetic appearance of their toenails. All these patients were female and stated that they were unwilling to wear open-toe shoes because of the asymmetric shape of their nails or prominent proximal incision scar.</p>
<p>The Winograd technique narrows the nail plate. If this technique is used for both border ingrown toenail or recurrent cases repeatedly, the narrowing effect is more prominent. Therefore, surgeons should warn their patients about this consequence especially in female patients who wear open-tip shoes. Alternatively, other techniques that do not alter the nail width and spare the nail plate can be a solution for these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012444729">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the relevant literature, there are few studies that evaluated the cosmetic results of the Winograd technique. Gerritsma-Bleeker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012444729">4</xref></sup> evaluated the cosmetic outcome using a visual analogue scale (0-10, not present or very satisfactory to heavy presence or very unsatisfactory). Studies by Cöloğlu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012444729">6</xref></sup> and by Vaccari et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012444729">8</xref></sup> evaluated the cosmetic results of wedge resection; however, they did not explain how they quantified the cosmetic outcome and did not give details about the cosmetic results. Aydin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012444729">9</xref></sup> evaluated the patient satisfaction after wedge resection in a retrospective study. Similarly, they did not define any detail about how they measured patient satisfaction. Several other studies even did not mention about the cosmetic results or patient satisfaction in their study and discussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012444729">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012444729">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012444729">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012444729">11</xref></sup> In our opinion, we need a specific outcome score for ingrown toenail, and cosmetic results should be one of the components of this score. This will allow us to speak a common language all around the world and provide a more reliable platform to compare results of even different techniques.</p>
<p>The recurrence rates with the Winograd technique show great variation among different studies. Gerritsma-Bleeker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012444729">4</xref></sup> reported 21% recurrence rate after partial matrix excision. Cöloğlu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012444729">6</xref></sup> described a new technique called “lateral fold advancement flap” and compared their new technique with partial matrix excision in their prospective study. They found 8.1% recurrence in partial matrix excision group. Aydin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012444729">9</xref></sup> reported 6.5% recurrence in their series. However, their mean follow-up duration was short, 4.2 months (range = 4-7 months). In our series, the mean recurrence time was 6.7 months (range = 2-12 months); therefore, patients should be followed-up for at least 12 months to encounter recurrent cases. van der Ham et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012444729">10</xref></sup> reported 16% recurrence rate with wedge excision of the nail matrix. In our study, we found 13.2% recurrence rate in patients who were followed up. However, 24 patients for lost for follow-up and recurrence rate was as high as 34.6% (worst case scenario). On the other hand, there are other studies, which combined wedge resection with phenolization, in the literature which reported lower recurrence rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012444729">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012444729"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012444729"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012444729">14</xref></sup> Combination of phenol with surgical matrix excision seems to be more effective at preventing symptomatic recurrence of ingrown toenails.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012444729">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, wedge resection of the nail matrix has a considerably high recurrence rate. Furthermore, narrowing of the nail plate is a disadvantage of this procedure. All patients should be informed about the possibility of recurrence and disfigurement in their toenails (narrow nail plate). Particularly, female patients who care about the cosmesis may be dissatisfied with this surgical technique.</p>
