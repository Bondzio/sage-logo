<abstract>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by progressive and not fully reversible airflow obstruction. It is a common condition in the UK; it is associated with smoking and becomes more prevalent with age. Symptoms of COPD, such as breathlessness and sputum production, are made worse by acute exacerbations. Such exacerbations may be associated with underlying infection, air pollution or poor medication compliance. Early identification of an exacerbation and appropriate treatment in the community may help avoid unnecessary hospital admission or at least reduce the length of inpatient stay. As well as treating exacerbations appropriately, it is essential that emphasis be placed on prevention, which should include good healthcare advice around smoking cessation, and appropriate disease management for patients diagnosed with COPD.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1755738012467334"><title>Defining an exacerbation of COPD</title>
<p>An exacerbation of COPD typically presents as acute onset breathlessness. It has been defined by the Global Initiative of Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as: “an acute event characterised by a worsening of the patient’s respiratory symptoms that is beyond day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1755738012467334">GOLD, 2011</xref>). This might be triggered by a viral or bacterial infection, or exposure to air pollution. In one third of cases no cause is found. Factors such as continued smoking, poor compliance with medication and limited access to pulmonary rehabilitation are associated with an increase in the number and severity of exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1755738012467334">GOLD, 2011</xref>). It is important to remember that other conditions, such as congestive heart failure, sepsis, pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism can also mimic an exacerbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1755738012467334">NICE, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1755738012467334"><title>Diagnosing an exacerbation of COPD</title>
<p>There is no valid diagnostic test or biochemical marker to confirm an exacerbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1755738012467334">Cazzola et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the clinical picture is the most reliable way to ascertain the likelihood of an exacerbation and its severity. Investigations should be used as an adjunct only.</p>
<p>An exacerbation may be suspected in patients with COPD who report symptoms such as worsening breathlessness, chest tightness, cough or increased sputum production, with or without change in colour, that is beyond his or her usual daily variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1755738012467334">GOLD, 2011</xref>). When taking the history it is important to ask about changes in baseline symptoms, such as breathlessness, and the impact of this on daily life. This might indicate how well the patient is likely to manage at home. It should also be established if the patient has had previous hospital admissions, needed non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or even admission to intensive care, as this will lower the threshold for initiating treatment or indeed referring to hospital.</p>
<p>Physical examination is an essential part of the assessment and often enables decisions to be made about the severity of the situation and subsequent management. Examination should include a full respiratory and cardiovascular examination. It may reveal signs such as pursed lip-breathing and diffuse wheeze on chest auscultation. Other worrying signs include fever (with or without evidence of consolidation), severe breathlessness at rest, peripheral and central cyanosis and peripheral oedema. If you suspect pneumonia the patient should be scored using the CURB 65 criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1755738012467334">Table 1</xref>), alongside considering the criteria for admission of patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1755738012467334">Fig. 1</xref>). Mental state should be assessed to identify new confusion, which may be a sign of respiratory compromise.

</p>
<p>Although most exacerbations are mild, some will be more severe and require secondary care intervention. It is important to be able to make this assessment, determining whether immediate hospital admission is needed, or whether control might be achieved within the community. NICE has identified a list of factors that should be used to assess whether patients require admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1755738012467334">Fig. 1</xref>). Some of the indicators (e.g. arterial blood gas measurement and chest radiographs) are not available within the GP practice—they are intended for use in a hospital emergency department. These factors are designed to pick up patients who cannot be managed in the community because they are at risk of hypercapnic type-2 respiratory failure, requiring controlled oxygen therapy and possibly NIV. These patients need urgent admission to hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1755738012467334"><title>Management in the community</title>
<p>The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) have subcategorised exacerbations of COPD into mild, moderate and severe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1755738012467334">Table 2</xref>), reflecting the level of medical intervention required. The majority of community-led care for patients with COPD will involve mild exacerbations. The introduction of Hospital-at-Home (HaH) may allow some patients with moderate disease to also be managed in the community.

<sec id="sec5-1755738012467334"><title>Bronchodilator therapy</title>
<p>Bronchodilators can be administered either via hand-held inhaler devices or nebulisers, depending on the facilities available to the patient and their ability to self-administer medication. Successful use of bronchodilators will help to ease airflow obstruction and clear mucus and infective debris.</p>
<p>Primary management of an acute exacerbation is to increase the dose of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, in particular a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA). This can be used in conjunction with a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA); this is the preferred bronchodilator therapy for an acute exacerbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1755738012467334">GOLD, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>During an acute exacerbation patients who are more unwell may benefit from temporary home nebulisers, as severe breathlessness may cause inadequate drug deposition in the lungs using inhalers. Salbutamol (SABA) and ipratropium (SAMA) nebulisers can be given until the patient is able to use inhalers again. If the patient is already on a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) he or she should discontinue this. However, if using a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) as part of a combined inhaler, it is preferable to continue this throughout the exacerbation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1755738012467334">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Long-term home nebulisers should be considered for those who have frequent exacerbations or disabling and distressing breathlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1755738012467334">NICE, 2010</xref>), although the indications for these should be assessed when the patient is stable. In an acute setting it is important to ensure the nebuliser can be used appropriately by the patient, or by his or her carer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1755738012467334"><title>Steroid therapy</title>
<p>Oral steroids may be used in patients with significant worsening of symptoms that interfere with their daily lives. They are the most important intervention in the management of an acute exacerbation. Evidence suggests that the use of steroids decreases the rate of treatment failure, shortens hospital stay, improves hypoxaemia and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and delays the time to recurrent exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1755738012467334">Evensen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Providing there are no contraindications to steroid use, most exacerbations can be managed with a dose of 30 mg oral prednisolone, usually for a maximum of 7 to 14 days. Patients already on low-dose oral steroids may require a higher starting dose of oral steroid during an acute exacerbation. There is no evidence for using oral steroids for longer than 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1755738012467334">BNF, 2012</xref>). If the dose of steroid used is less than 40 mg, and it is taken for less than 3 weeks, the steroid can be stopped abruptly. However, if there is a possibility of relapse, or the patient has recently taken additional courses of steroids, a more tailored reduction in steroid dosing may be required. In patients who suffer with frequent relapses and who require regular steroids, consideration should be given to the need for osteoporosis prophylactic therapy and they should carry a steroid treatment card (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1755738012467334">Fig. 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-1755738012467334" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Steroid treatment card.</p>

</fig></p>
<p>Patients who have two or more exacerbations per year requiring steroids and antibiotics, and those with FEV1 of less than 50%, should already be on an inhaled corticosteroid, as well as a SABA and LAMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1755738012467334">NICE, 2010</xref>). While there is no role for inhaled corticosteroids in an acute exacerbation of COPD, both Seretide (containing fluticasone and salmeterol) and Symbicort (containing budesonide and formoterol) have randomised control trial evidence to support their use in prevention of exacerbations, and tend to be continued during an exacerbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1755738012467334">Calverly et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738012467334">Calverly et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1755738012467334"><title>Antibiotics</title>
<p>Antibiotics are required if patients have increasing production and purulence of sputum, sputum colour change, or evidence of consolidation on clinical examination. An awareness of the local antibiotic resistance and local trust policies on antibiotic prescribing should help promote better antibiotic use; antibiotic prescribing should be guided by sputum culture where possible. If the patient has received recent courses of antibiotics there is a risk of infection with resistant organisms, such as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (this may be indicated by thick, green sputum) and methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). Those who have grown <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> may have other underlying lung conditions such as bronchiectasis, and should be referred for further imaging and respiratory follow-up. Patients with MRSA grown from sputum cultures are likely to need admission to hospital for intravenous antibiotics.</p>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> are the most common bacterial organisms grown from the sputum of patients with COPD. Although the usual empirical treatment suggested by NICE is an aminopenicillin (e.g. amoxicillin), macrolide (e.g. clarithromycin or erythromycin) or tetracycline (e.g. doxycycline), most strains of <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic> and 15% of <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> produce beta-lactamase, making them resistant to amoxicillin. Co-amoxiclav can be used if there is suspicion of these organisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1755738012467334"><title>Non-pharmacological therapy</title>
<p>Oxygen therapy and NIV are treatments reserved for patients with moderate to severe exacerbations of COPD, and are usually administered in a hospital setting. However, some patients already on long-term oxygen therapy may be managed at home using HaH services. The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of these patients, measured by pulse oximetry, needs to be kept within the individualised target range as set out by local trust protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1755738012467334">NICE, 2010</xref>)—failure to do so warrants hospital admission and an escalation of ventilatory support.</p>
<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation is suitable for all patients with COPD, except for those with very mild COPD who are not troubled by breathlessness. In general, it has no role in the treatment of an acute exacerbation of COPD. However, chest physiotherapy using positive pressure expiratory masks can be helpful for clearing thick sputum in selective patients and has a role as adjunctive therapy in the management of exacerbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1755738012467334">Rodriguez-Roisin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1755738012467334">NICE, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1755738012467334"><title>Intermediate care and Hospital-at-Home</title>
<p>COPD is responsible for more than 90,000 hospital admissions per year, with an average stay of 11 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1755738012467334">Lung and Asthma Information Agency, 2003</xref>). It is the second most common cause for emergency hospital admission (one in eight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1755738012467334">British Lung Foundation, 2007</xref>). It is also one of the most expensive inpatient conditions treated within the NHS, with the cost of a COPD-related admission estimated at £1960, although this figure may be doubled for an admission that includes NIV or intubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1755738012467334">NICE Costing Report, 2011</xref>). Consequently, there is a strong political drive to encourage doctors to anticipate exacerbations and reduce the number of hospital admissions.</p>
<p>HaH is a service concept in which intermediate care is provided for patients who would otherwise require hospital admission. Healthcare professionals run the service, devising a treatment package to be used within the home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1755738012467334">Stevenson, 2007</xref>). At least a quarter of patients with an exacerbation of COPD may be suitable for HaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1755738012467334">Ram et al., 2004</xref>). A systematic review comparing inpatient care with HaH schemes showed that, for selected patients, providing hospital care at home and avoiding admission showed similar outcomes to inpatient care, at a similar or lower cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1755738012467334">Shepperd et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines have suggested a 4-step process to assess the eligibility of patients for HaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1755738012467334">Stevenson, 2007</xref>). The first two steps are to confirm the diagnosis of COPD and whether the patient has an exacerbation. Once this is established, patients should be assessed to see whether they could be safely managed at home. This assessment can be made using similar criteria to the factors mentioned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1755738012467334">Fig. 1</xref>. Patients who are less safe to manage at home, are those at greater risk of rapid decline, including patients who are older, have frequent exacerbations, chronic mucous hypersecretion or a previous history of relapse. For those who are deemed safe the final step is to arrange a treatment package to manage them within the community.</p>
<p>HaH can provide appropriate treatment for exacerbations, including antibiotics, steroids, nebulised bronchodilators and home oxygen. These are usually delivered by specialist respiratory nurses or physiotherapists, although liaison with district nursing teams, community matrons and practice nurses enables continuity of care following discharge of the stable patient from HaH services.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of HaH is that assessments are usually needed by specialist respiratory physicians and respiratory care nurses, either in the emergency department, or by direct GP-led referral to the respiratory department. In addition, it is not available in all hospital trusts and, even where it is available, patients deemed non-compliant with medication or those without family support are unlikely to benefit unless they also have an emergency care package.</p>
<p>GPs may find it helpful to use other services to avoid a hospital referral and admission. Rapid response teams are in place across the country to help avoid unnecessary hospital admissions and provide additional care at a time of crisis. The service is most likely to be required for patients with an exacerbation of COPD who are unable to manage their personal care or take their medications easily, or for those whose illness has made them unable to look after dependent members of their family. These services will vary according to locality; it is essential to know what is available in your area when planning patient care. For example, in the Berkshire Healthcare and NHS foundation trust the rapid response service can be initiated by a referral from health care professionals in the community or in the emergency department, and provides up to 14 days of emergency care. While the rapid response service is in place the situation is constantly reassessed to ensure the patient is receiving enough support, or to remove care that is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1755738012467334">Berkshire Healthcare NHS trust, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Other intermediate care schemes include assisted-discharge schemes, where an exacerbation is initially managed within the hospital setting, but early discharge is arranged with community support. In hospitals with a smaller respiratory department or where patients with exacerbations have been admitted out-of-hours when HaH is not available, early-discharge is the favoured intermediate care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1755738012467334">Stevenson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Intermediate care services are also often essential for patients with end-stage COPD, who need end-of-life care outside of a hospital or hospice. In this setting the rapid response service or the local palliative care team can enable access to emergency medications (e.g. those needed for a syringe driver), organise emergency oxygen if required and implement appropriate fast-track care if the patient is approaching end-of-life. The Gold Standards Framework (GSF) in primary care was set up to improve the management of patients who are reaching the end-of-life, allowing their needs and preferences to be met. The GSF Advance Care Plan (ACP) is split into an Advance Statement and Advance Decision. The former is a non-legally binding statement of wishes, advising clinicians of the patient and family’s wishes for the future. The latter is made when the patient has mental capacity and it is legally binding. It formalises what patients do <italic>not</italic> wish to happen to them, e.g. the use of NIV or further antibiotic prescribing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1755738012467334">GSF, 2012</xref>). The ACP helps to guide GPs in the management of patients with end-stage COPD, particularly in determining the most appropriate care if the patient suffers an acute exacerbation.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1755738012467334"><title>Preventing future exacerbations</title>
<p>Measures can be taken to slow the rate of decline and frequency of exacerbations, and it is important for GPs to discuss this with patients. COPD is a progressive condition, with relapses tending to become more frequent and more severe. As the need for medical intervention escalates, so does the time that a patient spends in hospital receiving more aggressive therapy, which might include NIV or even an admission to intensive care. It is vital for GPs to discuss the importance of preventative medicine with patients, as many may not appreciate the severity and progressiveness of their condition, nor be aware of what can be done to improve the prognosis. Some of these methods by which exacerbations can be delayed or prevented are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1755738012467334">Box 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec11-1755738012467334"><title>Pharmacological prophylaxis</title>
<p>It is recommended that patients who have persistent exacerbations should use a LABA and inhaled corticosteroid as a combination inhaler, in addition to a LAMA such as tiotropium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1755738012467334">NICE, 2010</xref>). For those refusing or intolerant of steroids, a LAMA and a LABA should be given instead of the combination inhaler. The use of tiotropium was shown in the UPLIFT (Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium) trial to reduce the rate of decline of lung function, as measured over a 4-year period of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1755738012467334">Tashkin et al., 2008</xref>). The outcomes of the trial suggest that tiotropium should be given to patients who suffer frequent exacerbations, to reduce the number and severity of these acute episodes.</p>
<p>The <italic>Towards a Revolution in COPD Health</italic> (TORCH) trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial comparing mortality in three different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1755738012467334">Calverly et al., 2007</xref>). This 3-year study showed that patients in the combination inhaler group (salmeterol plus fluticasone) had a significantly reduced number of exacerbations, as well as improved lung function and general health, in comparison to those in the individual inhaler group and placebo group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1755738012467334"><title>Patient education and self-management</title>
<p>As part of the draft Health and Social Care Bill 2013, Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are being created to allow GPs to have greater influence on how the NHS budget is spent, in the hope that this will create more suitable healthcare provision for each local area based on its specific needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1755738012467334">Imison et al., 2011</xref>). The Kings Fund has highlighted ten priorities for CCGs, the first being more active support for patient self-management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1755738012467334">Imison et al., 2011</xref>). There are a number of programmes that aim to achieve this. They can either be used in isolation or as part of a package of care, and include: patient and carer education; medicines management advice and support; and advising about diet and exercise.</p>
<p>Patient education can help to reduce breathlessness, improve quality of life, and reduce the number of unplanned hospital admissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1755738012467334">Effling et al., 2007</xref>). Through education, patients can recognise the warning signs and symptoms of an exacerbation, allowing them to initiate self-management strategies such as self-medicating with provided rescue packs (e.g. bronchodilators, oral steroids and antibiotics), thereby preventing any delay of treatment and potential deterioration. However, this approach might need to be initiated with caution, as a recent randomised-control trial in the United States showed a 3-fold increase in mortality among COPD patients who received an education programme and management plan for identifying and treating exacerbations, compared to those receiving standard primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1755738012467334">Fan et al., 2012</xref>). This is only one study, and previous research has found differing results, but it suggests that patient education may need to be provided on a case-by-case basis, with clinicians assessing the suitability of each patient for a self-management programme.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1755738012467334" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>COPD is a complex condition and provides many challenges to the health care provider. It is possible to successfully manage exacerbations in the community through early diagnosis, the use of optimal medication when needed and involvement of the multi-disciplinary team. Giving patients the autonomy to manage their own disease via education is important. Easy access to primary care for medications such as steroids and antibiotics may help reduce the number and severity of exacerbations, and hence subsequent hospital admissions.
