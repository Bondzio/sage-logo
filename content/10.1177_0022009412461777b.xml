<p>Since the appearance of Paul Fussell’s classic <italic>The Great War and Modern Memory</italic>, a prolific amount of research has been produced on the subject of the cultural memory of the First World War. While scholars have focused heavily on British, French and German case studies, the war’s social and intellectual impact in Russia and – from 1922 – the Soviet Union, has been largely ignored, save for a small handful of articles and book passages. Historians have explained, and to some extent justified, this neglect by emphasizing the war’s marginal place in Soviet commemorative discourse. The Bolsheviks rejected the war as illegitimate and, contrary to interwar developments in other European great powers, minimized the war’s public remembrance in favor of foundational socialist struggles like the Revolution and Civil War. Given the scale of the conflict on the Eastern Front, however, this narrative of Russian idiosyncrasy has never been wholly satisfying. Through her excavation of the cultural response to the war that persisted ‘at the margins’ (6) of Soviet public discourse, Karen Petrone has done a remarkable service to the field. <italic>The Great War in Russian Memory</italic> not only sheds light on a long overlooked theme but also skillfully weaves the Russian story into the larger European process of coming to terms with ‘the war to end all wars’.</p>
<p>The first part of the book overturns the notion that the war was somehow ‘forgotten’ in the interwar USSR. Highlighting all manner of public representation, from pamphlets to architectural projects, from personal accounts by little-known participants to works by major figures such as Sholokhov and Erenburg, Petrone reveals the Great War to have been a vibrant theme in post-revolutionary discourse. She borrows from studies of European memory to delineate common interwar motifs, including religion, gender, violence and nationality. Significantly, this approach proves highly appropriate for the Soviet case. Even though the Bolsheviks sought to radically upend religious belief, traditional gender roles, and Old Regime militarism and nationalism, elements of each of these categories persisted in spite, and often because, of Bolshevik policies. Thus, an anti-religious tract designed to mock the purported appearance of the Holy Mother to tsarist troops during battle could inadvertently perpetuate the beliefs the regime had hoped to challenge. By stressing continuity, Petrone generally sides with scholars such as Jay Winter and Antoine Prost who have argued that the Great War did not cause a complete rupture with the past, but that traditional frames of reference endured throughout the 1920s and 1930s. As the author puts it, ‘The Soviet state was much more successful in creating a hybrid of new and old than it was in eradicating the old’ (74).</p>
<p>Petrone’s treatment is always nuanced, exposing the ambiguities, tensions, contestations and contradictions that existed in Soviet discourse about the war, as well as highlighting those ruptures that did occur across the revolutionary divide. This allows her to underscore the interconnectedness between, for example, gender, violence and ethnicity, and to bring out not only pan-European cultural trends, but also important Soviet departures. One of the author’s significant revelations is the degree to which Soviet cultural producers of the interwar period consistently refused to glorify or aestheticize violence, in sharp contrast to Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and prerevolutionary Russia.</p>
<p>The second section of the book maps discursive change over time, focusing on Soviet censors and decision-makers, and the reasons behind the fluctuations in the war’s representation. Petrone demonstrates that much public discussion of the war began to disappear around 1930, not as the result of a sudden dictate from above, but rather because of a complex host of institutional, ideological and political rivalries and convulsions. The war’s memory was never erased, however, and the author shows convincingly how connected anti-German sentiment of the 1930s was to First World War memory. When it became apparent that individual and historical memory of German martial superiority during the Great War was contributing to popular anxiety over Nazi militarization, Soviet officials selectively recast the theme of the war, along with earlier Slavic-Germanic conflicts, to provide examples of German military vulnerability. The closer war loomed, the more depictions of the Great War served to echo traditional forms of religious, gender, militarist and nationalistic rhetoric. Rather than a ‘full-circle’ return to tsarist patriotic discourse, however, the dominant line remained contested within the cultural establishment, even after the outbreak of the Second World War further undercut the radical revolutionary precepts of the 1920s.</p>
<p>Given the pathbreaking nature of the study, it inevitably raises questions that cannot be fully addressed. Petrone sometimes deliberately conflates the cultural memory of the Great War with that of the Civil War, for instance during multiple discussions of the works of Isaac Babel. This is an understandable approach (161); however, it might have been equally useful to emphasize where the memories of these violent conflicts differed, beyond the author’s few passing observations. Likewise, Petrone could have devoted a brief section to Soviet memory of the Second World War in light of her research. George Mosse, among others, has pointed out the peculiar resemblance between European First World War memorials and those dedicated in the Soviet Union during the 1960s to the defeat of the Nazis. Was the memory of the Great War somehow reflected in the Soviet cult of the Second World War? These questions are merely an indication of how engaging and welcome Petrone’s book is. This is cultural history at its best.</p>
