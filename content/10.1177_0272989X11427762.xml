<p><bold>Background.</bold> Many behaviors affect not only the self but also others. The utility of a vaccination to each individual depends on population immunity, the cumulative result of individual vaccination decisions. However, little is known about how the benefit to others influences vaccination decisions. <bold>Methods.</bold> In a series of 3 experiments (<italic>N</italic> = 292, 316, and 299) using hypothetical scenarios and college student respondents, we tested whether the vaccination decisions of individuals were sensitive to the level of immunity in the population when it had implications for either altruistic or free-riding vaccination behavior. <bold>Results.</bold> Our findings indicate that decisions of individuals were sensitive to opportunities both to free ride by refusing vaccination and to vaccinate altruistically. Although individuals were most willing to get vaccinated when they were at risk themselves, they were also sensitive to the amount of good they could do for others. This altruistic sensitivity was strongest when individuals were not vulnerable to the disease themselves. <bold>Conclusions.</bold> The most effective vaccination strategies, from a public health perspective, often entail vaccinating the disease transmitters rather than those who are most vulnerable. Consequently, those who bear the burden of vaccination and those who benefit are not the same individuals. Thus, effective vaccination campaigns require that disease transmitters vaccinate even when it is not in their self-interest to do so. Our results suggest that it may be possible to encourage vaccination by appealing to altruistic motives.</p>

<body>
<p>Human behaviors often have widespread repercussions throughout a population. Each individual’s decision affects the outcomes experienced by other people, creating a social dynamic where decision makers are influenced by the decisions they think other people will make. As a case in point, vaccination is not a solely personal behavior: It both influences other people, via changes in the dynamics of disease transmission, and is influenced by other people because an individual’s risk depends on disease prevalence within the population. When individuals get vaccinated, it confers protection on nonvaccinated individuals. This provides the opportunity for nonvaccinated individuals to free ride or benefit from the vaccination of others. If enough of a population is vaccinated against an infectious disease, transmission can be curtailed or eradicated, as was achieved for smallpox. Conversely, individuals can choose to get vaccinated not only to accrue benefits for themselves but also to preserve the health of others. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that caregivers of small children vaccinate against influenza to confer indirect protection on this vulnerable age class.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11427762">1</xref></sup> In addition, although elderly people suffer the greatest morbidity and mortality from influenza infection, young people are primarily responsible for spreading the disease. Consequently, epidemiological models suggest that the optimal approach to protect the elderly from influenza is by vaccinating the young people who are most responsible for spreading the infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11427762">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X11427762">3</xref></sup> Thus, vaccination decisions can be considered from the vantage point of game theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11427762">4</xref></sup> where the behavior and outcomes of each individual are influenced by the behavior of others. Because vaccination of one person confers benefits on others in the community, some individuals may seek to get vaccinated in part to contribute to this community benefit. In the current studies, we evaluate the role of altruism in vaccination decisions, where altruism is defined as accepting a net cost to one’s self in order to benefit others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11427762">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Do individuals take vaccination decisions and immunity status of others into account when making their own vaccination decisions? Specifically, are they willing to get vaccinated when a vaccination would not benefit them directly but would benefit others indirectly? In a focus group study, some parents volunteered social responsibility as a reason to get their children vaccinated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11427762">6</xref></sup> A review of studies of parental vaccination decisions, however, revealed that vaccine decliners were disinclined to vaccinate for the benefit of the community, and even vaccine acceptors viewed community protection as a bonus rather than a primary aim.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X11427762">7</xref></sup> In a hypothetical scenario study, Hershey and colleagues found that bandwagoning, altruism, and the motivation to free ride on herd immunity all play a part in vaccination intentions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11427762">8</xref></sup> In their study, participants considered vaccination scenarios that differed in the proportion of the people who had already been vaccinated, whether vaccination would protect others in addition to the self, and whether the scenario was framed as an opportunity to free ride or to behave altruistically. Their analysis indicated that others’ vaccination behavior exerted most of its influence through bandwagoning, or the desire to behave the way others are behaving without regard to the consequences. After statistically controlling for bandwagoning, however, free-riding and altruism effects were also demonstrated.</p>
<p>Of the various ways that the immune status of others can affect our vaccination decisions, free riding has received the most attention. Parents who do not want to vaccinate their child cite the vaccination of others as a reason their child need not be vaccinated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X11427762">9</xref></sup> Parents who are wary of the pertussis vaccine showed an appreciation of herd immunity, with their willingness to have their children vaccinated decreasing with the extent to which other children are vaccinated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11427762">10</xref></sup> Another study also found evidence of free riding in a computerized laboratory task version of vaccination decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X11427762">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current article, we focus on altruistic motives for vaccination. A series of experiments using hypothetical scenarios tested whether vaccination decisions of individuals are influenced by altruism. That is, we evaluated the circumstances under which vaccination decisions are influenced by a potential benefit for others. We devised scenarios such that altruism and free-riding motives predicted different response patterns. Specifically, we included scenarios where the only benefit of vaccination was the protection of others (with no benefit to the self). In these scenarios, we manipulated the percentage of the population already immune, and hence the percentage of the population that can benefit if the decision maker gets vaccinated, but kept the risk to the self constant. We term these scenarios “altruism scenarios” because they have the potential to reveal altruism motives for vaccination. A pattern where one is more likely to vaccinate when larger numbers of people stand to benefit from one’s vaccination constitutes evidence for altruistic motivation. We also included scenarios where the percentage of those immune had implications for self-interested motivations (the number of people who could infect the individual) as well as altruistic motivations (the number of people who could benefit if the individual gets vaccinated). We term these scenarios “herd immunity scenarios” because they entail both the self-interested and the altruistic motivations that arise from herd immunity. Our studies not only explore whether vaccination decisions are influenced by altruism but also examine the conditions under which altruism operates.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>The first study concerned vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV), an infection that causes cervical cancer in women and genital warts in men and women. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11427762">Table 1</xref>, we presented subjects with 2 series of hypothetical scenarios and measured their willingness to get the HPV vaccine. The first series was designed to measure altruism and varied the proportion of the population that the participant’s vaccination could benefit while holding risk to the participant constant. Therefore, differences in intent to get vaccinated across levels of immunity should be due to altruism because self-interest does not differ. The second series of scenarios was designed to measure willingness to free ride on herd immunity. In these scenarios, both self-interest and benefit to others varied as a function of population immunity; as the percentage of those immune increases, both risk to the self as well as the benefit to others are reduced.</p>

<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>The vaccination scenarios were presented within the context of a larger Web-based questionnaire about HPV (Appendix). The questionnaire included some introductory information about HPV and HPV vaccination, so all participants were aware of HPV, the possible consequences of HPV infection, as well as the availability of a vaccine before reading the scenarios. Although at the time of the study (spring 2007) no HPV vaccine had yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in men, we told participants that men who were vaccinated could protect their sexual partners from HPV. (They were informed during debriefing that no HPV vaccination had yet been approved for men.)</p>
<p>All participants responded to the same 2 series of scenarios in the same order (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11427762">Table 1</xref>). The first series of 4 scenarios, called hereafter “altruism scenarios”, tested whether participants would be sensitive to opportunities for altruism. These scenarios described a situation where some proportion of the population (excluding the participant) had been vaccinated with an old version of the HPV vaccine, which conferred protection against warts and cervical cancer but did not prevent transmission to others. Therefore, the participant’s own risk of contracting HPV is not affected by the percentage of those immune. However, the percentage of those immune changes the participant’s potential to benefit others by getting vaccinated because the participant’s vaccination will decrease the risk for individuals who have not been vaccinated. The percentage already vaccinated was 10%, 60%, 90%, and 100% across scenarios that were otherwise identical. This construction dissociates self-interest (held constant because risk to the self is the same across scenarios) from altruism in vaccination (varied across scenarios because benefit to others depends on the percentage already vaccinated).</p>
<p>A second series of 4 scenarios, hereafter called “herd immunity scenarios”, was designed to examine individuals’ willingness to free ride on the protection offered by the immunity of others. These scenarios described a situation where a proportion of the population (excluding the participant) was naturally immune to HPV and explained that this immunity would protect the individual from both cervical cancer and genital warts as well as prevent the immune individuals from transmitting HPV (Appendix). (Describing these individuals as naturally immune rather than previously vaccinated was intended to avoid bandwagoning effects that would covary with percentage of the population already immune.) In this set of scenarios, the participant’s own risk of contracting HPV depends on whether others are immune to HPV (only those who are not immune can transmit HPV), and the participant’s vaccination behavior will benefit only those individuals who are not immune (HPV can only be transmitted to unvaccinated individuals; thus, only unvaccinated individuals can benefit from the vaccination of others). Consequently, self-interested and altruistic motives are perfectly linked in these herd immunity scenarios. The proportion of the population naturally immune to HPV was the same as in the first 4 scenarios (10%, 60%, 90%, and 100%).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11427762">Table 1</xref>, the altruism and herd immunity scenarios were the same in terms of the proportion of those immune and the corresponding proportion who could benefit from the participant’s vaccination; they differed on whether the already-immune population could infect the participant. Each of the 8 scenarios was accompanied by a pie chart showing the proportion of the population susceptible to the disease and the proportion of the population that can transmit the disease to others. For each scenario, comprehension questions asked participants to identify what proportion of the population could possibly transmit HPV to them and what proportion could possibly benefit from their vaccination. They were told to imagine that a new vaccine had been developed that would both prevent them from developing warts and cancer while also preventing them from transmitting HPV. Participants rated how likely they would be to get vaccinated if they had to pay the $360 cost out of pocket. (The market price of the vaccine was specified to keep the scenario realistic.) Responses were made on an 11-point scale that ranged from 0% to 100% in 10% intervals.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Two male participants answered the check questions incorrectly and were excluded from further analysis, leaving a final sample of 124 women and 166 men. Because HPV infections are more dangerous in women than men (only women can get cervical cancer), we included gender in the analysis. Intentions to get vaccinated were entered into a 2 (gender) × 2 (type of scenario: altruism v. herd immunity) × 4 (percentage of those immune) ANOVA, with type of scenario and percentage of those immune as within-subjects factors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X11427762">Figure 1</xref> shows the mean ratings as a function of experimental condition. Notably, the curves for the herd immunity scenarios are negatively sloped, indicating that rated likelihood to get vaccinated decreases with the percentage of individuals who are immune. In contrast, the curves for the altruism scenarios are essentially flat. This pattern indicates that participants are motivated by free riding but not by altruism. That is, in the altruism scenarios, interest in the vaccination is unaffected by the number of people who can benefit from the vaccination, indicating no altruistic motivation. In contrast, in the herd immunity scenarios, interest in the vaccination declines when there are fewer people who can spread the virus, suggesting a free-riding motivation. We do not attribute this pattern in the herd immunity scenario to altruism (even though fewer people who can spread the virus also means fewer people who can benefit from one’s vaccination) because the altruism scenarios showed no effect on the number of people who could benefit.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X11427762">Table 2</xref> shows the ANOVA results. As expected, there was a main effect of gender, with greater interest in vaccination among women (mean = 68%) than men (M = 57%). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X11427762">Figure 1</xref>, there was also a main effect of the percentage of those immune in the population, with participants giving higher ratings of likelihood to get vaccinated when fewer were immune to the virus. Scenario type also had a main effect, with more interest in a vaccination in the altruism scenarios, where risk to the self is held constant at a high level (M = 70%), than in the herd immunity scenarios, where risk to the self varies (M = 55%). However, of primary interest, the effect of scenario type was moderated by the percentage of those immune in the population. Analysis of simple main effects indicated that individuals were sensitive to the percentage of those immune in the population when risk to the self depends on it (herd immunity scenarios) (<italic>F</italic><sub>3,864</sub> = 124.65, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), so that a lower percentage of those immune led to greater interest in vaccination. No such effect was found when self-risk was not affected by the percentage of those immune (altruism scenarios) (<italic>F</italic><sub>3,864</sub> = 0.23, <italic>P</italic> = 0.87). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X11427762">Figure 1</xref> shows the linear slopes for each curve, which were significant for the herd immunity scenario curves (<italic>t</italic><sub>1734</sub> = 18.69, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) but not for the altruism scenario curves (<italic>t</italic><sub>1734</sub> = 0.71, <italic>P</italic> = 0.48).</p>

<p>We also observed a small 3-way interaction among type of scenario, percentage of those immune in the population, and gender. Polynomial contrasts revealed that this interaction was due to an interaction among gender, scenario type, and the quadratic function of percentage of those immune (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,288</sub> = 9.57, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). That is, the herd immunity scenario curve was more concave for women than for men, whereas the altruism scenario curves were equally flat for both genders.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that individuals are sensitive to opportunities to free ride on the immunity of others, but we did not observe sensitivity to the potential benefit for others. This apparent lack of altruism in our sample may have been related to our use of HPV as the infectious agent, as HPV is sexually transmitted. Given that people generally believe that they have a great deal of control over their sexual relations, perceived control may have mitigated the altruistic motivation to get vaccinated. It could be that participants would be more altruistic if they could unwittingly transmit the virus to someone during casual contact, making transmission seem more likely. The high cost of the vaccine might also have been a deterrent.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Our second study was based on influenza vaccination decisions. Because influenza is transmitted through coughing and sneezing rather than through intimate contact, people may be more sensitive to the proportion of the population susceptible to influenza than to HPV. The influenza vaccine is also considerably less expensive than the HPV vaccine, and so individuals may be more willing to incur the cost for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>For this study, we included only altruism scenarios. In addition, to conduct a more sensitive test of altruism in vaccination decisions, we eliminated any benefit for the self, such that vaccination only protected others. In study 1, vaccination in the altruism scenarios was in the individual’s self-interest; individuals protected themselves by vaccinating while also helping to protect the vulnerable portion of the population they might otherwise infect. It is possible we failed to detect an effect of altruism in that study because a strong self-interested motive masked potential altruistic motives. Thus, the study 2 scenarios described a situation where participants were already protected from developing the disease, but unless they got vaccinated, they could still transmit the infection to others. Therefore, the self-interested motive was eliminated, and altruism in vaccination could be tested in a more parsimonious way.</p>

<p>As in study 1, the scenarios were embedded in a larger questionnaire about the flu. Participants were presented with both verbal descriptions of population immunity as well as with a pie chart for each scenario. Comprehension questions were included to ensure that all participants could correctly identify what proportion of the population was vulnerable to the disease and what proportion was capable of transmitting the disease to them. Participants had to answer these correctly before they could proceed. Each participant responded with their likelihood to get vaccinated under 2 different levels of population immunity: 5% immune (95% vulnerable) and 90% immune (10% vulnerable)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0272989X11427762">a</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11427762">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The scenario stated that participants were already immune to influenza (Appendix). Participants were informed that they and the other 5% (90%) of the population had received an old version of the vaccine that would prevent them from developing influenza, but they could act as carriers and transmit to those who had not been vaccinated. They were informed of a new vaccine that would prevent transmission, available to them for $30 (this price reflects the realistic market value of the flu vaccine). Each participant indicated their intention to get vaccinated in each scenario on an 11-point scale ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Intentions to get vaccinated were analyzed with a repeated-measures <italic>t</italic> test. Many participants intended to get vaccinated, even though they would not be susceptible to influenza. Responses of 100% were common, comprising 41% of responses in the scenario where 10% of the population could benefit and 47% of responses in the scenario where 95% of the population could benefit.</p>
<p>Of primary interest, intentions to get vaccinated were sensitive to the percentage of those immune (<italic>t</italic><sub>290</sub> = 5.71, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.10), with participants indicating greater willingness to get vaccinated (M = 81%, SD = 30%) when 95% of the population could benefit than when only 10% of the population could (M = 74%, SD = 27%). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test also revealed a difference in willingness to vaccinate between conditions (<italic>T</italic> = 2460.5, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Thus, study 2 revealed that vaccination decisions are (or can be) influenced by the opportunity to benefit others.</p>

<title>Study 3</title>
<p>Study 2 demonstrated that flu vaccination intentions were sensitive to the potential for altruism, in that vaccination intentions were greater in a situation where the individual’s vaccination could help more people. Study 1, however, showed no altruism effect. Studies 1 and 2 differed in a number of respects, including disease type and cost of vaccine, and so the purpose of study 3 was to identify the factor that determined whether vaccination decisions are influenced by altruism. We predicted that the key difference between studies 1 and 2 was the presence or absence of a self-interested motivation to get vaccinated. Individuals who are concerned with protecting themselves may be insensitive to the opportunities to protect others, while those who are secure in their own safety may be more willing to take the well-being of others into account. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that vulnerability moderates the impact of population immunity, with the vaccination intentions of those who are not vulnerable to the disease showing the greatest sensitivity to outcomes for others.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section14-0272989X11427762">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>The procedure was similar to the previous 2 studies. Participants were given a series of hypothetical scenarios regarding the influenza vaccination and were presented with information regarding the proportion of the population that was immune. As before, we included pie charts with each scenario, depicting the proportion of the population susceptible to the infection. Consistent with the preceding study, participants were required to correctly identify the proportion of the population who could transmit influenza to them as well as the proportion they could possibly infect, before rating their likelihood to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Study 3 included a total of 6 scenarios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11427762">Table 1</xref> and Appendix). The first 3 were herd immunity scenarios and were the same for all participants. The last 3 were altruism scenarios and varied between subjects on whether there could be a self-interested motive to get vaccinated. The herd immunity scenarios were included to provide a baseline for how population immunity affects vaccination decisions when both altruism and free riding drive a vaccination. These scenarios were similar to the herd immunity scenarios in study 1, except there were 3 levels of immunity (95%, 60%, and 10%, in that order).</p>
<p>The 3 altruism scenarios differed between subjects in order to investigate whether the influence of altruism on vaccination decisions depends on whether the disease poses any risk to oneself, that is, whether a self-interested incentive was relevant. For one group of participants (zero risk to self), self-interest was irrelevant, while in the other group (high risk to self), self-interest was relevant and held constant across the 3 scenarios (this is in contrast to the herd immunity scenarios, where self-interest is not only always relevant but also varies across the 3 scenarios, linked to the benefit to others). Similar to the altruism scenarios in studies 1 and 2, the altruism scenarios in study 3 described a situation where some portion of the population had received an old version of the vaccine that protected the recipient from developing influenza but did not prevent the recipient from transmitting influenza. Half of the participants were informed that they, too, had received the old vaccine (as in study 2) and so could not develop influenza but could transmit it to others (zero risk to self condition). The other half of the participants were informed that they had not received the old vaccine (as in study 1) and could therefore be infected by anyone (high risk to self condition). In the altruism scenarios, everyone is a potential carrier of influenza, regardless of the percentage of those susceptible. The percentage of those immune in both conditions was the same as in the first set of scenarios: 95%, 60%, and 10%.</p>
<p>Participants were informed that a new vaccine prevents the individual from infecting others in addition to protecting the recipient. Participants rated their likelihood to get vaccinated with this new vaccine on a 12-point scale, which ran from 0% likely to 100% likely in 10% increments, with the addition of a 5% option. In this study, we specified a higher price for the vaccine and also some possible side effects in an attempt to decrease the number of participants who responded at the top of the response scale. Thus, participants were informed that vaccination would cost $50, which was associated with some side effects, including risk of soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given; low-grade fever and aches; and on rare occasions, serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Individuals’ stated likelihood to get vaccinated were entered into a 3 (percentage of those immune: 95%, 60%, and 10%) × 2 (scenario type: herd immunity v. altruism) × 2 (subject group with zero v. high risk to self in the altruism scenarios) mixed-model ANOVA, with percentage of those immune and scenario type as within-subjects factors. Note that the between-subjects factor (zero or high risk to self) only affected the set of 3 altruism scenarios. The herd immunity scenarios were identical for the 2 subject groups.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X11427762">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X11427762">Table 3</xref>, all main effects and interactions were significant. There was a main effect of the percentage of those immune, such that the rated likelihood to get vaccinated increases with the percentage of the population who could become infected with or transmit the virus. There was also a main effect of scenario type, such that individuals rated themselves as more likely overall to get vaccinated in the herd immunity scenario than in the altruism scenarios. Additionally, there was a main effect of the between-subjects condition, such that individuals in the high risk to self group gave higher ratings of likelihood to get vaccinated than those in the zero risk to self group. These main effects were qualified by all 2-way interactions. Of primary interest, a significant 3-way interaction indicated that the effect of the percentage of those immune on the rated vaccination likelihood differed across the zero/high risk to self conditions, but only in the altruism scenarios. Specifically, in the altruism scenarios, the percentage of those immune more strongly influenced intentions to get vaccinated among participants who were immune to influenza themselves (zero risk to self condition) than those who were not immune (high risk to self condition). In the herd immunity scenarios, however, the percentage of those immune influenced intentions to get vaccinated to the same extent for both groups because the herd immunity scenarios were the same for both subject groups.</p>

<p>Mean self-reported probability to get vaccinated as a function of experimental condition in study 3. In the herd immunity scenarios, immune members of the population cannot transmit the virus, and so both risk to the self and benefit to others decrease with increasing percentage of those immune. In the altruism scenarios, risk to the self is held constant, so only benefit to others decreases with increasing percentage of those immune. The left panel shows the zero risk to self condition, where the altruism scenarios hold risk to self constant at a zero level (self is immune and so cannot get infected, but vaccination of self will benefit others). The right panel shows the high risk to self condition, where the altruism scenarios hold risk to self constant at a high level (self is not immune and so can get infected from anyone, but vaccination of self benefits both self and others). “b” represents the regression coefficients for simple main effect linear contrasts.

<p>Contrast analyses indicated that the main effect of the percentage of those immune and all interactions with this variable were linear. Analysis of simple main effects showed that the percentage of those immune had an effect for both the herd immunity and altruism scenarios in the zero risk to self condition (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,594</sub> &gt; 15.03, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X11427762">Figure 2</xref>). However, in the high risk to self condition, the percentage of those immune only had an effect for the herd immunity scenarios (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,594</sub> = 22.93, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) but not for the altruism scenarios (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,594</sub> = 1.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.36).</p>
<p>These results indicate that individuals are willing to get vaccinated even when there is no benefit to the self. Furthermore, individuals are sensitive to how much their vaccination might benefit others, with greater willingness to get vaccinated the more that others are susceptible to the infection and thus the more they could benefit from one’s vaccination action. The procedure of the study also ensured that participants knew that their own risk did not change across the 3 altruism scenarios, so that their pattern of vaccination intention is not due to a misunderstanding about their own risk but rather a concern for the health of others. Of primary interest, sensitivity to others’ disease outcomes depends on one’s own risk; when the risk of the self developing the disease was high, sensitivity to others’ health outcomes was eliminated. That is, benefit to others did motivate vaccination behavior, but this occurred only when the self was not at risk for infection.</p>
<p>We suggest that the value that individuals place on the altruistic value of vaccination depends not only on the costs and benefit of the vaccine but also on the function that an individual ascribes to the vaccine. In reality, all vaccines make an individual less susceptible to infection from a particular pathogen and reduce the likelihood that the vaccinated individual will infect others. However, whether the individual needs protection may influence whether vaccination is regarded as an act of self-interest, altruism, or a combination. When the self is vulnerable, the vaccine is perceived as serving a self-protective function. In that case, secondary functions, such as protecting others, are undervalued relative to the case where the vaccine was perceived primarily as a way to protect others.</p>

<sec id="section16-0272989X11427762">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Experiments from psychology and economics have demonstrated that decision makers sometimes make choices that imply that their utility increases with the well-being of other people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11427762">5</xref></sup> Our studies indicate that this altruistic motivation manifests in vaccination decisions. We found that individuals were sensitive to the positive impact their vaccination could have on the health of others. Although individuals are most willing to get vaccinated when they are at risk themselves, those who were not vulnerable to the disease were still interested in vaccination, and their interest was positively related to the vulnerability of others. In study 1, we found that when participants’ own risk of infection was held constant, vaccination decisions were unrelated to the percentage of others in the population who could benefit from the participant’s vaccination and contribution to herd immunity. In contrast, in study 2, we found that participants were more likely to get vaccinated when such vaccination could benefit many (as opposed to few) members of the population, even when their own risk of infection was held constant. Thus, study 2 shows evidence of altruistic vaccination, while study 1 did not. The 2 studies had a number of procedural differences, however. Of primary interest, in study 1, the altruism scenarios held risk to the self constant at a high level (everyone in the population could potentially infect the participant), whereas in study 2, the altruism scenarios held risk to the self constant at zero (the participant was immune to infection).</p>
<p>Study 3 explored the reasons for the differing results across studies 1 and 2. Specially, in study 3 when we experimentally manipulated whether the altruism scenarios held risk to the self constant at a zero level or a high level, we found that in the high risk to self condition (where risk to self was held constant at a high level), participants were very interested in vaccinating, but vaccination interest bore little relationship to the potential to benefit others. That is, vaccination decisions were not driven by altruism in this case. In contrast, in the zero risk to self condition (where risk to self was held constant at zero), participants were less interested in vaccinating overall, but vaccination intention bore a robust relationship to the potential benefit to others. That is, in this condition, vaccination decisions were driven by altruism. Thus, our results indicate that vaccination decisions can be influenced by altruistic motivation, but this is primarily the case when the self is not at risk.</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with the previous Hershey and others study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11427762">8</xref></sup> Their hypothetical scenario study also demonstrated altruism in vaccination decisions; however, in that study, altruism co-occurred with and was in part overridden by free-riding and bandwagoning motivation. Although the scenarios in their study did separate to some extent the ability of the hypothetical vaccines to protect the self versus to prevent transmission to others, unlike the present studies, their study did not contain any scenarios where the consequence of vaccinating was only the protection of others (because the self was already immune). In our study, this situation revealed the strongest altruism.</p>
<p>The scenarios in the current studies each described the current state of population immunity—that is, the percentage of the population that was susceptible to infection and that could spread the disease—and asked participants to make a vaccination choice conditional on those facts. It is possible, however, that participants made inferences about how population immunity might change over time and that these inferences influenced their decision. For example, when only some in the population are already immune and I am offered a new vaccine, I might infer that other nonimmune individuals are also being offered the same new vaccine and that some of them may accept it. I then have the opportunity to free ride on these new vaccinators. When there are many nonimmune individuals, there is a large benefit to the population from my vaccination, but there are also many individuals who, like me, have the opportunity to receive the new vaccine and hence many individuals on whom I might free ride. This free-riding motivation could counteract an altruism motivation and lead to no net effect. When the risk to the self is zero, however (as in study 2 and the zero risk to self condition in study 3), there is no motivation to free ride. This could explain why that is the condition in which we find evidence of altruistic vaccination.</p>
<p>When the people who bear the cost of vaccination are not the same people who reap the benefits of vaccination, one strategy for achieving the population optimal outcome is compulsory vaccination. Indeed, a recent editorial argues that the case of compulsory vaccination, while always controversial, is stronger when the vaccine confers herd immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X11427762">12</xref></sup> Although compulsory vaccination programs can be successful in some settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11427762">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X11427762">14</xref></sup> one questionnaire study found that many health care workers were not even aware that their workplace had a compulsory vaccination program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X11427762">15</xref></sup> One way to avoid the need for compulsory vaccination programs is to encourage altruistic vaccination, such that individuals voluntarily vaccinate in order to promote the community good.</p>
<sec id="section17-0272989X11427762">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The current studies had several limitations. They employed hypothetical scenarios, and the order of scenarios in each study was not counterbalanced. The studies employed within-subjects designs that may make participants especially sensitive to the experimental manipulations. The participants were college students expressing hypothetical intentions, and the vaccination intentions expressed in our studies were quite high—higher than actual influenza vaccination rates seen in real life. Thus, it remains for future research to reveal the extent to which the benefit to others motivates actual vaccination decisions. The current results nevertheless suggest that this may be a fruitful avenue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0272989X11427762">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Public health is a collaborative effort, with each of us making decisions that impact not only our own well-being but that of those around us as well. In some cases, including influenza vaccination, disease prevention is more effective when the disease carriers are vaccinated rather than those who would suffer most from infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11427762">2</xref></sup> Consequently, effective vaccination programs may depend on the sensitivity of vaccination decisions to the well-being of others. Benefit to others may also motivate additional health behaviors, including testing for sexually transmitted infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X11427762">16</xref></sup> safe sex practices, and smoking cessation or treatment for other addictions.</p>
<p>Our studies reveal that vaccination decisions can be sensitive to the effects that vaccination has on other people’s health outcomes. This responsiveness could be important for future vaccination campaigns. In some circumstances, a self-interested vaccination strategy is a poor one for public health. In the case of the seasonal influenza, the elderly are most at risk for serious consequences from infection, while influenza typically is merely bothersome in younger people. However, influenza vaccination is less effective in the elderly than in the young, and the young transmit influenza more. Therefore, the most effective way to protect the vulnerable is by vaccinating the disease transmitters rather than the most vulnerable. The most effective vaccination strategies from a public health perspective may therefore rely on altruistic motivations, where those who bear the burden of vaccination and those who benefit are not the same individuals. Our results suggest such strategies may be viable.</p>

<p>Suppose you found out that 10% (60%, 90%, 100%) of all college-age American adults were naturally immune to HPV. You do not have this natural immunity. You cannot catch HPV from any of the naturally immune people but can get HPV from the 90% (40%, 10%, 0%) who are susceptible.</p>
<p>Now, a new HPV vaccine is available. It protects you from getting HPV and also prevents you from spreading the virus to the 90% (40%, 10%, 0%) of people who are susceptible.</p>
<p>Imagine you could get the new HPV vaccine for a cost of $360.</p>
<p>Without the new vaccine, you can catch HPV from individuals who are not naturally immune. The new vaccine prevents you from catching HPV and spreading it to susceptible individuals.</p>

<title>Altruism Scenario from Study 2<sup>a</sup></title>
<p>Suppose you found out that 5% (90%) of the US population had already received an old vaccine against the flu and acquired immunity to the flu virus. However, the flu virus has evolved—now it could be carried by anyone, even people who have received the old flu vaccine. Those who have received the old vaccine WILL NOT develop flu or experience any adverse effect by carrying the flu virus, but they CAN transmit the flu virus to unvaccinated people, who will develop the flu.</p>
<p>A new flu vaccine has been developed to prevent people from developing the flu AND from carrying and transmitting the flu virus.</p>
<p>You HAVE received the old flu vaccine and are immune to the flu virus; that is, you will not develop the flu even if you carry the flu virus, but you can carry and transmit the virus to unvaccinated people. However, the new vaccine can prevent you from carrying and transmitting the flu virus to the 95% (10%) of the people in the US who are unvaccinated and consequently would potentially develop the flu if they were exposed to the flu virus.</p>
<p>Imagine you could get the new flu vaccine for a cost of $30. How likely would you be to get vaccinated with the new vaccine?</p>

<title>Herd Immunity Scenario from Study 3</title>
<p>Suppose you found out that 95% (60%, 10%) of the US population was naturally immune to the flu. You do not have this natural immunity. You CANNOT catch the flu from those who are naturally immune, but you CAN still catch it from the 5% (40%, 90%) of the population who are susceptible and transmit the flu to these people in the case that you do get infected.</p>
<p>A new flu vaccine has been developed to prevent people from developing the flu AND from carrying and transmitting the flu virus. In other words, the new vaccine can prevent you from getting infected with the flu from the 5% (40%, 90%) of the population AND from transmitting the flu virus to this 5% (40%, 90%) of the population, who do not have immunity against flu and consequently would potentially develop the flu if they were exposed to the flu virus.</p>
<p>The side effects of the new flu vaccine include soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given; fever (low grade); and aches. On rare occasions, flu vaccination can cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. Imagine you could get the new flu vaccine for a cost of $50. How likely would you be to get vaccinated with the new vaccine?</p>

<p>There was also a between-subjects manipulation of social distance, with half of the participants reading the standard scenario and the other half reading a scenario specifying that the population was their small community where they had a great deal of contact with their friends and neighbors. This manipulation had no effect on vaccination intentions and so is not discussed further. The results presented combined responses from both social distance conditions.</p>
