<p>‘To be continued by the reader …’ are the final words concluding the remarkable book ‘made by’ five authors – John Berger, Sven Blomberg, Chris Fox, Michael Dibb, and Richard Hollis – who adapted it from the no less remarkable BBC television series that had appeared in 1972. ‘Our principal aim’, they announced in their preface ‘has been to start a process of questioning.’ There can be few intentions so abundantly fulfilled, as the readers – and lookers – who have continued to pose questions about sight and its vicissitudes have been legion. Future historians will, in fact, likely date the launch of visual culture studies as a serious scholarly field of study to the publication of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>.</p>
<p>This particular reader’s first encounter with the book came in l983, when I was just beginning the research for a study of the 20th-century French interrogation of visuality, which was published a decade later as <italic>Downcast Eyes</italic>. It may well, in fact, have been instrumental in my choice of a topic; it clearly reinforced my hunch that it was worth pursuing. There was, to be sure, nothing particularly French about the argument of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> – it was the German Walter Benjamin who was the acknowledged muse inspiring Berger and his colleagues – but visuality was certainly interrogated. In a few bold strokes and with a welter of telling examples, they succeeded in showing that visual experience was never innocent, even in the most exclusive precincts of high art. Instead, it always had to be understood in a multi-layered context, involving modes of production, gender relations, and technological developments. Even the most seemingly idyllic genre like landscape painting could harbor injuries of class and the disinterested gaze at the nude, celebrated in terms of pure sublimation by critics like Kenneth Clark, could be shown to mask a still potent lust of the male eye directed at the female body on display. The images of modern publicity, they insisted, are not so much a repudiation of the great tradition of oil painting begun in the Renaissance as its decadent continuation; both are deeply rooted in the commodity culture of capitalism.</p>
<p>Relentless in its hostility to that culture and its concomitant impoverishment of visual experience, <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> may now seem an unnuanced diatribe without, say, Foucault’s ambiguities about normalization and resistance or the complexities of Lacan’s unreconciled dialectic of the look and the gaze. Here women are only the objects of the male gaze with few resources to look back, and publicity works only to delude those who are seduced by its false dreams. It is a rare artist like Blake, whose preference for limpid water colors over oil deprived his work of the dense materiality that fitted so well with the commodification of portable easel paintings, who could escape complicity with the dominant order.</p>
<p>It is, however, vital to acknowledge the undeniable impact of a work that advanced a strong and unapologetic argument confuting the prevailing wisdom of its day, and yet somehow was able to find a mass television audience and then became a canonical text for a generation. Sometimes it is most effective to avoid qualifications, equivocations and understatements, throwing down instead as many gauntlets as you have in your wardrobe. Certainly, in the case of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, the readers invited to pick them up did so with gusto, and the study of visual culture has never been the same.</p>
<p>As a footnote to this tribute, let me mention a telling episode that demonstrates the book’s continued relevance. In the course of preparing a reader of texts that explore the intersection of imperialism and visuality, which I’m co-editing with Sumathi Ramaswamy for Duke University Press, we noticed how infrequently discussions of visuality in the West acknowledged the role of empire, preferring to highlight issues of class, gender, technology and race instead. With the occasional exception such as Bernard Smith’s classic l985 study <italic>European Vision and the South Pacific</italic>, only modest attention has been paid to the vital role of the imperial gaze in constituting the subject position reinforced by a great deal of Western art.</p>
<p>After arriving at this generalization, I wondered if <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> had conformed to the pattern of neglect. Having no memory of its challenging it, I went back to the text, and much to my delight found that in fact it did contain a suggestive analysis of Hans Holbein’s <italic>Ambassadors</italic> of 1533 in precisely these terms. At the very dawn of European expansion, both the imperious, self-confident gaze of the two men in the painting and the shelves of objects behind them, so Berger and his colleagues claimed, radiated the nascent awareness of a Europe that was poised to conquer the world. Alongside a globe, which referenced the recent circumnavigation of Magellan, the shelves contained mathematical and religious books, as well as a lute. ‘To colonize a land it was necessary’, Berger and his colleagues wrote, ‘to convert its people to Christianity and accounting, and thus to prove to them that European civilization was the most advanced in the world. Its art included.’ This claim was then hammered home by two images of later paintings, Emmanuel de Witte’s 17th-century ‘Admiral de Ruyter in the Castle of Elmina’, which depicts an African holding an oil painting of the castle involved in the slave trade to his master, and an anonymous allegorical painting of the l8th century, ‘India offering her Pearls to Britannia’, commissioned by the East India Company. What these paintings make painfully explicit is already foreshadowed in Holbein’s classic canvas.</p>

<p>How directly or not the two ambassadors were involved in the first colonizing ventures is not particularly important. For what we are concerned with here is a stance towards the world; and this was general to a whole class. The two ambassadors belonged to a class who were convinced that the world was there to furnish their residence in it. (p. 96)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And what was worse, the interaction between colonizer and colonized, in which each reinforced the ideology of master and slave, was self-perpetuating. Here there are no subalterns who have figured out how to look back defiantly, no Calibans who have learned to curse.</p>
<p>Despite the reductive one-directionality of their analysis of the colonial gaze, the authors of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> were right to make us ask questions about the role played in the development of Western visual culture by the discovery and colonization of non-European lands and peoples. Although there is always a danger of tendentious misreading – witness the polemics generated by Edward Said’s critique of Jane Austen’s alleged condoning of slavery in the West Indies – it is still worth remembering, to fiddle slightly with the oft-cited maxim of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">Walter Benjamin (1974[1969]</xref>: 256) that ‘there is no document of [visual] culture that is not at the same time a document of barbarism.’</p>
