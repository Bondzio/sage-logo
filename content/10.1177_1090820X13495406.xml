<title>Background:</title>
<p>To avoid complications and improve patient satisfaction with lower lid blepharoplasty, a precise assessment of any preoperative eyelid asymmetry is essential.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X13495406">

<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Digital images of 204 patients were analyzed using Photoshop CS3 Extended software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California). The left eye was superimposed over the right eye using layers in the software program, and the lower eyelid margin and axis were outlined to obtain a diagram with the superimposed outlines of both eyes.

<sec id="section4-1090820X13495406">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of the 204 patients studied, 184 (90.2%) had some degree of asymmetry. Most (118; 64.13%) presented with the right lower eyelid at a more inferior position than the left (R–), while 66 (35.87%) presented with the right lower eyelid at a higher position than the left (R+), a difference that was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>This software is a powerful and precise tool to evaluate and measure eyelid asymmetries. The use of this method showed a large degree of eyelid asymmetry preoperatively (more than 90%), which proves the importance of detecting and adequately analyzing this condition prior to surgery. The authors’ simple method may be an important adjunct to obtaining optimal results in patients who seek eyelid surgery.</p>

<body>
<p>Lower lid blepharoplasty is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgical procedures worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13495406">1</xref></sup> To improve results and reduce complications, emphasis has recently been placed on incorporating lower lid support techniques as an adjunct to lower lid blepharoplasty. The benefit of newer techniques such as lateral canthal anchoring, prophylactic canthopexy, canthoplasty, lateral retinacular suspension, and transpalpebral cheek elevation has been well acknowledged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13495406">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13495406">3</xref></sup> However, despite their advantages, these procedures are sometimes associated with lower lid and lateral canthal asymmetry postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13495406">4</xref></sup> To avoid this problem, a precise assessment of any preoperative eyelid asymmetry should be performed and discussed with the patient before the operation.</p>
<p>The study presented here has 3 goals: (1) to develop a method that detects and assesses preoperative eyelid asymmetry and that is simple and easy to replicate through readily available software, (2) to detect patterns of eyelid asymmetry in patients who seek facial plastic surgery and to present a classification of lower eyelid asymmetries, and (3) to identify specific eyelid measurements that may indicate the presence of eyelid asymmetry preoperatively.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X13495406" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Digital images of 204 consecutive patients (39 male and 165 female) who sought facial plastic surgery between November 2007 and October 2009 were analyzed using Photoshop CS3 Extended software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, California). The study was approved by the Complutense University of Madrid institutional review board, and informed consent was acquired from all patients. We excluded subjects who had any condition that could affect the measurements, including a history of periocular or ocular surgery, trauma, congenital abnormalities, orbital or eyelid tumors, or thyroid ophthalmopathy. Patients were photographed in resting frontal view with the eyes in primary gaze. All photographs were standardized by aligning the camera with the axial plane of the eyes and by using the same fixed focal length lens (60 mm on a 1.6× cropped sensor, which is equivalent to a 96-mm lens on a full-frame sensor or 35-mm film), aperture (7.1), and distance to the patient (1 m) to allow accurate comparison between images.</p>
<p>Each patient’s left eye was superimposed over the right eye through the use of layers in the software program. A video of this process is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com">www.aestheticsurgeryjournal.com</ext-link> You may also use any smartphone to scan the code on the first page of this article to be taken directly to the video on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.YouTube.com">www.YouTube.com</ext-link>. The 4-step method for performing this maneuver was as follows (note that any term in bold font indicates a specific tool in the software program): (1) Both eyes were set to a perfectly horizontal position to avoid any minor tilt of the patient’s head while being photographed. A <bold>ruler</bold> tool was used to draw a line connecting the flash reflection from each of the patient’s pupils. Then the command <bold>image &gt; rotate canvas &gt; arbitrary</bold>, which automatically set the line together with the image at a 0° angle, was used. (2) A rectangle was drawn over the left eye using the <bold>marquee</bold> tool, and a new layer was created from that rectangle using the command <bold>layer &gt; new &gt; layer via copy</bold>. (3) A specular image of the left eye was created through the command <bold>edit &gt; transform &gt; horizontal flip</bold>. (4) The left iris was placed exactly over the right iris using the <bold>move</bold> tool and the flash reflection on the pupil as a guide, and the opacity of the new layer was reduced to 40%. (The flash was fired directly vertical to the lens, producing a symmetric reflection on both eyes.) The opacity was set back to 100%, and the <bold>view layer</bold> icon on the <bold>layers window</bold> allowed the view of the new layer to be toggled on or off.</p>

<label>Incidence of Lower Eyelid Asymmetry: An Anthropometric Analysis of 204 Patients</label>
<caption><p>In this video accompanying their article, the authors demonstrate their method of assessing preoperative eyelid asymmetry by superimposing images of patients’ left and right eyes in a common software program.</p></caption>
</media></p>
<p>The lower eyelid margin and the lower eyelid axis were outlined and selected for each eyelid to obtain a diagram with the superimposed outlines of both eyes. The color red was used to define the left eye and the color blue to define the right eye. The 4-step method for performing this maneuver was as follows: (1) The <bold>pen</bold> tool was employed to draw an outline of the lower lid margin along with the intercanthal axis for each eye. The lower lid margin “break-point” near the punctum was defined as the reference point for the medial canthus. (2) A new layer was created from this path using <bold>layer &gt; new &gt; layer</bold>, and (3) the path was transformed into a selection through the <bold>load path as a selection</bold> icon in the path window. (4) The selection was outlined in color through the command <bold>edit &gt; stroke</bold> using a 2-pixel, centered width, selecting blue for the right eye and red for the left eye. On the <bold>layers window</bold>, only the outlined layers in red and blue were visible through the visibility icon. The resulting image is the proposed diagram for visually evaluating eyelid asymmetries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X13495406">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Two independent observers divided patients into 3 groups following strict criteria based on the position of the left eye with respect to the right one: R+ patients were defined as those with the right lower lid margin in a higher position than the left, R– patients were defined as those with the opposite configuration, and symmetric patients were defined as those with more than 90% of the lower lid margins superimposing each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1090820X13495406">Figures 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1090820X13495406">4</xref>). Statistical analysis with a χ<sup>2</sup> test was employed to compare the proportion of eyelid asymmetry observed in the group studied with that expected in the general population. (The expected asymmetry in the general population, attending to odds, should tend to level out such that half the population has the right lower eyelid above the left and half has the left lower eyelid above the right.)</p>

<p>After we used the subject’s horizontal corneal white-to-white distance for calibration, we defined and obtained several measurements for each patient using the tools available in the software program described. Corneal white-to-white distance was shown to be remarkably constant and independent of age or sex, measuring approximately 12 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13495406">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13495406">6</xref></sup> This distance was an excellent marker to use in place of a ruler to perform measurements in the pictures. The following 3 steps were undertaken in the software program to obtain measurements: (1) The measurement window was opened by pressing the tab <bold>analysis &gt; set measurement scale &gt; custom</bold>. (2) The horizontal corneal white-to-white distance was measured in pixels using the <bold>ruler</bold> tool that appeared in the window. (3) This distance was translated into millimeters by introducing 12 in the <bold>logical length</bold> box and mm in the <bold>logical units</bold> box.</p>
<p>Differences between the right and left eyelids were recorded using the command <bold>analysis &gt; record measurements</bold>. Several measurements were defined and obtained, including the intercanthal length, the length of the lower eyelid margin, the surface area of the lower palpebral fissure, and the perimeter of the lower palpebral fissure. These data were compared between patients using a <italic>t</italic> test for statistical analysis to identify the measurements that best detected lower eyelid asymmetries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X13495406">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X13495406">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Digital imaging has been shown to be much more reliable than direct manual measurement in acquiring valid anthropometric measurements. Despite the 2-dimensional nature of the measurements (a limitation that is now being overcome through the use of 3-dimensional imaging devices), digital image analysis has multiple advantages over direct measuring methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X13495406">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X13495406">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although several software programs have been developed specifically to obtain anthropometric measurements, most are expensive and complex, limiting their use to particular research projects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X13495406">9</xref></sup> In this study, we employed an easy-to-use, inexpensive, and readily available digital imaging software, Photoshop CS3 Extended, to develop a reproducible diagram that facilitates the objective documentation and analysis of lower lid asymmetries that might need correction during a lower blepharoplasty or lateral canthopexy procedure. The diagram is rapidly obtained and precisely outlines the lower palpebral border through the use of the <bold>pen tool</bold> in the software program, which we believe is superior to other selection tools previously used to obtain measurements in the ocular region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13495406">10</xref></sup> In obtaining measurements from digital images, earlier investigators used a ruler taped to the patients’ heads as a reference and calibration tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13495406">10</xref></sup> This method is cumbersome and may be difficult to implement routinely during office consultations.</p>
<p>Our study employed a novel method to measure distances in facial digital images, the basis of which is the use of the “white-to-white” distance, or corneal diameter, as calibration. This distance has been shown consistently to be about 12 mm in humans, with little or no variation based on ethnicity, sex, weight, height, or age after the eyeball is nearly fully developed at 2 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13495406">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13495406">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X13495406">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X13495406">12</xref></sup> Counting the number of pixels at the level of the iris meridian in the digital image and assigning this number a set measurement of 12 mm allowed us to objectively compare all measurements from the diagrams obtained from patients’ photographs. This calibration system may also provide precise anthropometric measurements not only of the eyelids but of any eye-related distance in a digital picture, provided the eyes are included in the photograph. Thus, the system avoids the need to include a ruler or other measurement device in the image when the picture is taken.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X13495406">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Symmetry, along with averageness, sexual dimorphism, and proportion, is considered one of the key elements in facial attractiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X13495406">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13495406"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X13495406">15</xref></sup> Therefore, any asymmetry appearing postoperatively after eyelid surgery may have negative consequences in the surgical results and could be an important concern for our patients. Previous studies have evaluated facial asymmetry. In a study with digital pictures and an analysis of a Euclid matrix, Ercan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X13495406">16</xref></sup> found significant differences in facial asymmetries in both hemifaces, with a higher proportion of asymmetries in the female population and with the left hemiface having the greatest amount of asymmetries, although this finding has not been confirmed by further studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X13495406">17</xref></sup> Farkas and Cheung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13495406">18</xref></sup> performed an anthropometric study in children that determined that the right hemiface was larger and that the upper third of the face contained the most asymmetries. Rohrich et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X13495406">19</xref></sup> described a method by which to analyze facial asymmetries before and after facelift surgery based on the observation of 3 bilateral parameters—width, length, and fullness—and created a score system with these features. Hamra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090820X13495406">20</xref></sup> described a method by which to evaluate pre- and postoperative results in facelift surgery by creating a composite image of 2 same-side hemifaces before and after surgery, with the postoperative image flipped horizontally to create a full face. Rohrich et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090820X13495406">21</xref></sup> were the first authors to stress the importance of performing an objective preoperative analysis of asymmetries after finding a high incidence of asymmetry in patients’ breasts before they underwent augmentation surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090820X13495406">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our method of evaluating eyelid asymmetries is fast, simple, and objective. It is based on the use of the proposed diagram of the superimposed images of both eyelids as layers, with the left eyelid flipped horizontally to overlay the right precisely. This method allowed us to detect and measure lower eyelid asymmetries and to show not only that such asymmetries are the norm, rather than the exception, but that there is an apparent pattern in their frequency and type, which prompted our (R+), (R–) classification system. The precision and reproducibility of our method allowed us to identify lower eyelid asymmetries that would have easily passed undetected by visual observation. Among the patients whose lower eyelids were asymmetric (90%), the right lower eyelid was in a position inferior to the left in a significant proportion (64.13%). Of course, our method and the diagram produced by the software could also be employed to study pre- and postoperative results and to study and classify asymmetries in other areas of the face and body, such as the upper eyelids, nose, and breasts.</p>
<p>The measurements gathered from the diagrams and their later comparison showed statistically significant differences in the length of the lower eyelid margin, the intercanthal distance, the lower palpebral fissure surface area, and the perimeter between the left and right lower eyelids. When a patient was classified as R–, all of these measures were significantly higher for the right eye, and when a patient was R+, they were significantly higher for the left eye. This finding demonstrates that performing measurements of the diagram developed in this study is an objective way to determine which lower lid margin is in an inferior position. The diagram alone, without measurements, is also useful in determining visually which canthus and lid margin is in a higher position relative to the contralateral eye and could be convenient in the preoperative planning of lower blepharoplasty procedures in which a lateral canthal support technique may be necessary.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and classify lower eyelid asymmetries. There are 2 primary advantages to objectively detecting and evaluating asymmetries preoperatively: (1) the patient is aware of his or her existing asymmetry before undergoing a surgical procedure, making it more likely that the patient will accept the postoperative results, and (2) the surgeon can modify the procedure on each side according to the preoperative assessment to improve postoperative results.</p>
<p>Although multiple hypotheses have attempted to explain facial asymmetry,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X13495406">18</xref></sup> the most widely accepted cause is the differential activity of the 2 hemifaces in relation to their contralateral brain hemispheres, which determines a disparity in muscle development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090820X13495406">23</xref></sup> Facial movement and expression are also asymmetric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090820X13495406">24</xref></sup> Further research into the cause of facial asymmetry in general and eyelid asymmetries in particular is warranted to evaluate the factors that may be related to the high incidence—almost two-thirds of the asymmetric patients in our population—of patients whose right lower eyelids are in an inferior position to the left (defined as R– in our classification).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A powerful and precise tool to evaluate and measure eyelid asymmetries is presented. The use of this method in 204 consecutive plastic surgery patients showed a large degree (more than 90%) of eyelid asymmetry preoperatively, with a high proportion of patients (almost two-thirds) with the right lower eyelid in an inferior position with respect to the left. The findings observed in this study indicate the importance of detecting and adequately analyzing eyelid asymmetry prior to surgery. Discussion of eyelid asymmetries with the patient preoperatively may reduce the incidence of postoperative complaints.</p>
