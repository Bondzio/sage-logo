<p>Rich studies can be read in many ways. Craig Jeffrey’s <italic>Timepass</italic> can be read as an investigation of youth culture in a particular setting in India, i.e. the culture that develops among educated youth as they prepare for life as adults and an income that sets them free from their fathers, and perhaps to find a purpose in life. It can also be read as an exploration of the politics of waiting – waiting for a job in this case. As such the study presents us with a rich ethnographic description of what people do when they have nothing to do and what consequences this has for their sociocultural orientation. And of course it is about class – that striving lower middle class, awkward in its own way, emerging from among a peasantry to form that populous stratum India’s economic upturn hinges on.</p>
<p>To me, as a historian of modern India’s political life, the most interesting is still Jeffrey’s exploration of that dynamic field of politics. The educated, unemployed or underemployed youth, somewhere between their rural roots and an urban life, are ‘passing the time’ engaging in age-old trade of politics. In many ways Jeffrey shows us that they learn and represent a continuation of all that we have come to know about Indian politics – with its corruption, violence and ‘fixing’ (the Hindi word <italic>jugar</italic> Jeffrey shows to be very elastic). At the same time they also find themselves learning new tools, the tools and concepts and forms of modern politics. The crux of Jeffrey’s argument, though, is that his young leaders do not turn to formal politics as such. Their ‘political imagination is oriented towards, and fashioned through, the informal political spheres in which they operate’, he writes (p. 181). They are Jats, his leaders, hailing from a numerous middle-ranking caste of North Indian peasantry. The political spheres towards which they orient themselves are different from those of leaders belonging to the Dalit community, formerly known as ‘untouchables’. They are the ones engaging in formal politics more strictly speaking. Jeffrey’s young aspiring Jat leaders engage with the state in more informal ways, albeit no less successfully.</p>
<p>One of the great debates in ‘India studies’ over the last 20 years has been over the nature of the relationship between the political style of the elite on the one hand and the politics of the poor on the other. The debate was opened by Ranajit Guha in his <italic>Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-204382061200200110">1983</xref>), although others had touched upon it previously. It was continued in the many excellent studies in edited volumes and monographs by the Subaltern Studies group and others, and has ended up, for the time being at any rate, most poignantly in Partha Chatterjee’s <italic>Politics of the Governed</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-204382061200200110">2004</xref>). Here Chatterjee postulates that there is a form of politics that belongs to the Indian urban middle class and that has all the trappings of a modern state with its associated civil society. The poor, however, conduct their politics along different lines, what he calls political society. In political society, the relationship of the poor to the state is regulated through temporary, contextual, and often illegal and sometimes violent arrangements.</p>
<p>Through his material and analysis Jeffrey shows that this dichotomy of elite politics versus subaltern politics is unsustainable. His group of young educated men aspiring out of their rustic background taps into the urban state and creates for themselves networks into its apparatus. These networks help the individual, but they hinge on caste loyalty and thus sustain the caste’s domination. It is a dynamic and flexible arrangement. Jeffrey uses the term ‘an emerging culture of political entrepreneurialism’ (p. 161), and the middle class in question identifies itself with the local state. Jeffrey writes that their power ‘is firmly rooted in control over local networks and cultural capital’. All the while the local state and society, and these young men themselves, are being transformed (p. 188).</p>
<p>That the dichotomy is unsustainable is part of the whole debate. What is new in Jeffrey’s study is the richness of his ethnography and the delicate analysis that documents the close, even tight, relationship between one particular social group on the one hand and important institutions of the local state and hence of local power on the other. Jeffrey’s observation that the local middle class has appropriated the local state has several interesting consequences. One is that it refutes the idea that the middle class is divested from the nation – a rather lazy idea to start with, but strangely powerful. Another is a better understanding of the workings of the local state, including, as Jeffrey points out, the corruption and ‘fixing’ that are rampant in this part of India. One question that comes to mind is for Jeffrey to reflect more over the consequences his observations have for our understanding of the Indian state. Could we say that it has become ‘embedded’, in the way that Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-204382061200200110">Evans (1995</xref>) suggested, and thus also bound to a particular social formation?</p>
<p>A book that came out at approximately the same time as <italic>Timepass</italic>, Lucia Michelutti’s <italic>Vernacularisation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-204382061200200110">2008</xref>), makes observations that are not dissimilar to those of Jeffrey. She argues that democracy is practised locally in a manner influenced by the political practices of the locally dominant caste – in her case the Yadav caste. One might ask Jeffrey what he makes of her concept. A particular point with Michelutti is that the style of politics is influenced by the Yadavs’ sense of masculinity. Jeffrey makes repeated references to what may be considered similar elements in a local style of politics – mischief, irreverence, a certain emphasis on manliness, bravado. What are the effects of this style? Does it help them sustain their power and sense of value? And what does it do to others, who are not members of the Jat caste?</p>
<p>One point that irks me a little in <italic>Timepass</italic> is the emphasis Jeffrey puts on the category Jat – the caste. In a sense he has made the Jats his object of study. He tends to describe the Jats a little undifferentiated (‘Jats were therefore stretching “the local” practically and imaginatively through rural-urban strategies’, p. 177). My point is that there are poor Jats, office-going Jats, meek Jats, and Jats who are not really good at the game of politics. Did the caste as a whole have a strategy? It sounds a tad essentializing and problematic, but it may be my own limited experience from North India and I would like to invite Jeffrey to elaborate on this a little.</p>
<p>Lastly, the historian in me believes Jeffrey’s narrative might have benefited from a historical depth. One point he makes it that the Jats did not imagine the West as their ideal. Their middle-classness belonged in India and they distinguished themselves from the westernized and globalized upper middle class that occupies so much of the visual expressions of modernity in contemporary India. This is a very interesting observation and I have not seen it made elsewhere. Nonetheless, issues of identity and what it meant to be Indian have been debated in rural north India since the turn of the last century and in urban India a hundred years more. It might also have been interesting to relate some of the issues raised in his ethnography to older debates about on social reform, tied to concepts such as sanskritization, for instance. One might also point to Paul Brass’s recent and very interesting study of debates on corruption, as these played out in the 1960s in the life and career of Chaudhary Charan Singh – the politician after whom the university of Jeffrey’s ethnography was named.</p>
<p>These suggestions apart, <italic>Timepass</italic> is a rich and valuable ethnographic contribution to the understanding of the local Indian state. It is a unique insight into the dynamics of urban politics.</p>
