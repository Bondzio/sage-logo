<abstract>
<p>This study examines the strategies employed in justifying counter-arguments against answers provided in Q&amp;A (question and answer) discussion. The study also explores how information sources are used in support of such arguments. The findings draw on the analysis of 100 discourse episodes focusing on global warming – a controversial topic eliciting competing answers from the participants. The empirical data were downloaded from Yahoo! Answers. Four strategies were identified. Of them, questioning the validity of answers and questioning the background assumptions of answers were used most frequently. While justifying counter-arguments, the participants also drew on emotional appeals and questioned the contributor’s motives. To support the counter-arguments, the participants mainly drew on internet-based sources of information. The controversial nature of the discussion topic was reflected in the debate about the most authoritative information sources: persuasive material advocating a particular viewpoint to global warming vs objective research reports.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>One of the reasons for the growing popularity of social reference services is that they can complement information obtained from internet searches in cases in which people need additional facts or more detailed advice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551513478892">1</xref>]. Question and answer (Q&amp;A) sites are probably the most popular forms of social reference services. Major social Q&amp;A sites include Yahoo! Answers, WikiAnswers and Answerbag. In 2008, the largest among these sites, Yahoo! Answers, included over 23 million resolved questions. About 100 million people all over the world used this site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513478892">2</xref>, p. 66]. Given the increasing popularity of social media as a whole, it is obvious that the number of Q&amp;A users has continued to grow since that time.</p>
<p>The interaction in social Q&amp;A forums is based on the practice in which ‘askers’ post their questions to a public Q&amp;A site and then receive comments from ‘answerers’, that is, anyone who is willing to share his or her knowledge about the issue at hand. The architecture of social Q&amp;A services also allows commenting on questions and answers and rating of the quality of answers. Different from online discussion groups, however, debating on Q&amp;A sites is rendered more difficult because the discourse is constrained by a strict question and answer format. Q&amp;A threads must start with a question, and the participants mainly interact by answering the question, not by addressing one another. Furthermore, one cannot answer more than once, nor can one answer oneself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551513478892">3</xref>, p. 667].</p>
<p>On social Q&amp;A sites, the provision of answers is not necessarily a process in which the participants aim at reaching consensus about the issue at hand. Offering conflicting answers is common, particularly when the topic of discussion is controversial. Unfortunately, so far, this issue has been neglected in Q&amp;A studies. The present investigation fills gaps in this field by analysing how the participants justify their disagreements while commenting on the claims included in the answers. More specifically, the study identifies strategies by which the answerers justify their counter-arguments while claiming that the answers posted to a discussion thread are inadequate. Further support for the importance of this research topic can be found in Shachaf’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513478892">2</xref>] recent study identifying the major components that are needed in the development of a unifying theory of social reference. She emphasized the need to explore the issues of ‘conflict management’ because such studies would shed additional light on how questions and answers are negotiated in Q&amp;A discussions.</p>
<p>The present investigation approaches the above issues from the perspective of Toulmin’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513478892">4</xref>] classic model of argument patterns originally developed in the 1950s. The same model was used in an earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551513478892">5</xref>] scrutinizing the argument patterns used on Yahoo! Answers about global warming. Four argument patterns were identified: (1) failed opening; (2) non-oppositional argument pattern; (3) oppositional argument pattern; and (4) mixed argument pattern. In the case of failed opening, a participant presents an initial claim (as a part of a question or an answer). However, because the other participants do not comment on the initial claim, the opening of the discussion fails and the argumentation process is discontinued. Non-oppositional argument pattern is employed when one or more participants react to the initial claim by supporting it. In the case of oppositional argument pattern, the participants present counter-claims or rebuttals against the initial claim. Finally, the mixed argument pattern is constituted by counter-claims, rebuttals as well as indications of support (Toulmin’s model will be discussed in greater detail in Section 4).</p>
<p>The present study elaborates the picture of argumentation on Q&amp;A sites by concentrating on the oppositional and mixed argument patterns. They are particularly relevant because the provision of competing answers is based on such argument patterns. Similar to the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551513478892">5</xref>], the empirical data were gathered from the Yahoo! Answers discussion category Global Warming – a controversial topic providing a fertile ground for competing interpretations. Yahoo! Answers was selected as a research setting because of its dominant status among Q&amp;A sites. It is believed that, owing to this position, Yahoo! Answers attracts a wide variety of questions and alternative answers whose credibility is debated.</p>
<p>The paper proceeds as follows. A literature review provides background for the empirical investigation by briefly characterizing the debate about global warming and discussing the findings of relevant studies on Q&amp;A and online discussion forums. Then, the research framework is specified, followed by the report of the empirical findings. The last sections discuss the significance of the research findings and present ideas for future research.</p>

<title>2. Literature review</title>
<sec id="section3-0165551513478892">
<title>2.1. Debate about global warming</title>
<p>Questions concerning global warming have been debated heavily since the 1990s [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551513478892">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165551513478892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551513478892">8</xref>]. In general, the discussion has revolved around the causes and consequences of the rising average temperature of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans and its projected continuation. It is asserted, for example, that global warming is mainly caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. In the debate, opinions are divided with regard to the significance of global warming, ranging from the denial of its existence to warnings of future crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513478892">9</xref>, p. 92].</p>
<p>From the beginning, the arguments around global warming are characterized by conflicts of expertise and rationality, as well as conflicts concerning appropriate future action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513478892">9</xref>, pp. 94 and 97]. Interestingly, these conflicts reflect the plurality of knowledge in contemporary society. There is conflicting evidence about global warming provided by researchers working in diverse fields, and also everyday experience of all sorts, professional and domestic. This raises the question of which voice or knowledge counts most, what evidence should we count, and who should we believe. Q&amp;A sites provide an intriguing forum for the debate on issues such as these.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0165551513478892">
<title>2.2. Answering and arguing on social Q&amp;A sites</title>
<p>Recently, Gazan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551513478892">10</xref>], Oh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551513478892">11</xref>] and Shah et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551513478892">12</xref>] have comprehensively reviewed the main findings of the Q&amp;A studies. These reviews indicate that social reference is a relatively novel phenomenon and that so far the number of studies theorizing the features of Q&amp;A practices has remained low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513478892">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551513478892">13</xref>]. The majority of the findings of Q&amp;A studies originate from empirical investigations characterizing the content of questions and answers, as well as the ways in which Q&amp;A sites are used.</p>
<p>Drawing on the analysis of about 102,000 answers collected from Yahoo! Answers by means of a crawler, Oh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165551513478892">14</xref>] identified over 5300 mentions of information sources used by internet users answering questions. For this purpose, human sources were cited most frequently, that is, 56.4% of all sources mentioned by the participants. These sources were defined as answerers presenting their own knowledge or the knowledge of third parties as sources of answers. Further, 39.8% of the sources mentioned by the participants were classified into the category of online sources, that is, those with information on URLs. The remainder (3.8%) of sources mentioned belonged to the category of offline sources, for example, printed books.</p>
<p>Harper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551513478892">15</xref>] demonstrated that answers with citations and supporting evidence such as links to other sites tend to receive higher ratings than those without. Fichman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551513478892">16</xref>] compared answer quality on three Q&amp;A sites. Wikipedia Reference Desk provided much more accurate, complete and verifiable information, while the most popular Q&amp;A site, Yahoo! Answers, provided the least accurate answers, which were also the lowest quality in terms of answer verifiability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551513478892">16</xref>, p. 477]. On the other hand, Yahoo! Answers provided answers that were as complete as those available on other Q&amp;A sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551513478892">16</xref>, p. 482]. Kim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551513478892">1</xref>] explored the criteria by which the users of Yahoo! Answers evaluate answer credibility. It appeared, for example, that a factual assertion made in the answer positively impacted credibility judgment, while a lack of fact-based information resulted in a negative credibility judgment.</p>
<p>More recently, Savolainen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551513478892">5</xref>] examined the ways in which argument patterns are structured on the Yahoo! Answers sub-category of global warming. Failed opening appeared to be the most frequent argument pattern (63% of all instances of unique argument patterns), followed by oppositional (15%), non-oppositional (13%) and mixed (9%) argument patterns. While providing grounds for their arguments, the participants drew on their personal beliefs. In addition, facts were used as grounds quite frequently, while the role of the opinions of other people and emotive appeals remained marginal. The findings suggest that most Q&amp;A discussions are broad but not particularly deep. The study also showed that the arguments presented in discussion can be taken more seriously if they are bolstered with fact-based grounds.</p>

<sec id="section5-0165551513478892">
<title>2.3. Use of information sources in online discussion groups</title>
<p>An interesting point of comparison to argumentation taking place on Q&amp;A sites can be found in Wikgren’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513478892">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551513478892">18</xref>] studies examining the use of information sources in Usenet newsgroups. Her findings are particularly relevant for the present study since she focused on debates about a controversial health topic: the beneficial or hazardous use of dietary chromium supplementation in diabetes self-management. Owing to its sensitive nature, the above topic has parallels with the issues of global warming. Wikgren [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513478892">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551513478892">18</xref>] found that, to support their views, the participants cited documents available on the Web [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551513478892">18</xref>, p. 230]. Of the Web citations, roughly one-third referred to Medline abstracts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Medline abstracts were used as ‘hard currency’ in the arguments for or against the use of chromium supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513478892">17</xref>]. The participants often employed a persuasive citation strategy. The citations were seen as a part of the rhetoric of legitimating knowledge claims, with the purpose of ‘providing authoritative grounds to persuade readers of the validity and significance of the arguments’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513478892">19</xref>, p. 117]. Since Medline abstracts are associated with authoritative sources of medical knowledge, citing them may be an effective strategy. Medical science can be employed as a ‘general ideological support, where science has a voice of authority and appeals to scientific proof tend to win arguments and give power to those who can articulate them’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165551513478892">20</xref>, p. 116].</p>

<sec id="section6-0165551513478892">
<title>3. Conceptual framework</title>
<p>A literature review indicated that the evaluation of the credibility of answers and the authoritativeness of information sources supporting them occupy a central role in online discussions. The present study elaborates these issues by concentrating on the ways in which Q&amp;A participants challenge the competing answers by formulating counter-arguments against them. Argumentation theories provide relevant approaches to the conceptualization of discursive processes such as these.</p>
<p>The issues of argumentation can be approached from alternative theoretical perspectives with varying emphasis on logical, rhetorical and practical factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551513478892">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551513478892"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165551513478892">23</xref>]. In general, <italic>argumentation</italic> can be defined as a process involving at least two individuals engaged in dialogue, each contending differing positions and trying to persuade each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165551513478892">24</xref>, pp. 2–3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165551513478892">23</xref>]. Argumentation is not necessarily restricted to dealing with overt disagreements only. It also enables the introduction and reinforcement of new ideas, as well as attempts to achieve understanding and agreement. <italic>Argument</italic> can be characterized as a product of the argumentation process. According to Johnson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165551513478892">25</xref>, p. 168], argument is ‘a type of discourse or text – the distillate of the practice of argumentation – in which the arguer seeks to persuade the Other(s) of the truth of a thesis by producing the reasons that support it’.</p>
<p>The present study makes use of the argument pattern developed by Stephen Toulmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513478892">4</xref>]. This model was chosen because it clearly defines the main elements of argument as operationalizable categories; in addition, the model focuses on practical argumentation in mundane contexts. Clark et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165551513478892">26</xref>, p. 350] demonstrate that Toulmin’s model is well suited for the study of argumentation taking place in online environments that use asynchronous threaded communication, and involve well-defined or complex problems. These features are also characteristic of discussions occurring on Q&amp;A sites. Toulmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513478892">4</xref>, pp. 87–100] specifies six elements of argument as follows; the illustrative examples related to the issues of global warming are developed by the present author [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551513478892">5</xref>].</p>
<list id="list1-0165551513478892" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Claim</italic>: the conclusion whose merits an arguer seeks to establish; an assertion or proposition an arguer wants another to accept (for example, ‘In the United States, global warming increases the occurrence of heavy rainfall’).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Data</italic>: the facts an arguer appeals to as a foundation for the claim. For instance, data may consist of facts provided by official statistics (for example, ‘In the United States, total annual precipitation has increased at an average rate of 6.1 percent since 1900’).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Warrant</italic>: the statement authorizing the movement from the data to the claim. A warrant legitimizes the claim by showing the data to be relevant. The warrant may be explicit or unspoken (implicit), and it answers the question ‘Why does that data mean your claim is true?’ (for example, ‘The data available from US rainfall statistics cover a period of 200 years’).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Backing</italic>: gives additional support to the warrant. Backing must be introduced when the warrant itself is not convincing enough to the readers or the listeners (for example, ‘US rainfall statistics are collected consistently over time by government agencies’).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Qualifier</italic>: indicates the strength of the leap from the data to the warrant and may limit how universally the claim applies (for example, ‘It is evident that US rainfall statistics are reliable’).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Rebuttal</italic>: statements recognizing the restrictions to which the claim may legitimately be applied. Thus, rebuttal admits to those circumstances or situations where the claim would not hold. Usually, rebuttals include attacks on the data used to bolster a claim or attacks directly on a claim (for example, ‘The increasing occurrence of heavy rainfall in the United States is mainly caused by other factors such as <italic>El Nino</italic> oscillation’).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The primary structure of argument involves the movement from the data (evidence) to the claim (endpoint or conclusion) based on the reasoning provided by the warrant. Additional concepts may clarify the move from data to conclusion: a backing may reinforce the warrant, and a rebuttal shows objections to the claim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165551513478892">27</xref>, p. 497].</p>
<p>Even though Toulmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513478892">4</xref>] explicitly defined the components of his model, its empirical application is often difficult because there are no clear rules of how to differentiate between data and warrant, or warrant and backing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513478892">28</xref>, p. 261]. To avoid this problem, Erduran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165551513478892">29</xref>] collapsed the elements of data, warrant and backing into a composite category of <italic>grounds</italic>. The present study follows this methodological idea. Clark and Sampson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513478892">28</xref>] elaborated the model further by introducing a new element, that is, <italic>counter-claim</italic>. This is because the participants in the dialogue may not merely rebut an initial claim by directly attacking it or questioning its grounds. The participants may also present counter-claims indicating disagreement with an initial claim, for example, ‘global warming increases the occurrence of heavy rainfall’. In this case, a counter-claim may assert that ‘the occurrence of heavy rainfall does not correlate with the rising average temperature of Earth’s atmosphere’.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the focus of the empirical study, ‘qualifiers’ identified by Toulmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513478892">4</xref>] were excluded from the present investigation. Thus, finally, the following elements of argument are included: (1) claim; (2) counter-claim; (3) rebuttal; and (4) grounds. Clark and Sampson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513478892">28</xref>] employed similar categories in a study of the structural nature of the argumentation among students in an online learning environment. In their study, the combinations of messages containing elements of argument were labelled as oppositional and non-oppositional <italic>discourse episodes</italic>. The present study employs this methodological idea in order to identify discourse episodes relevant for empirical analysis. More specifically, the study concentrates on discourse episodes constitutive of oppositional and mixed argument patterns. The oppositional pattern entails three elements of argument – initial claim, counter-claim(s) and rebuttal(s) – while the mixed pattern includes these three elements plus indication of support (of the initial claim). The present study focuses on both argument patterns, but the element of indications of support constitutive of the mixed pattern is excluded from the analysis because this element is not relevant for the study of counter-arguments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551513478892">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the conceptual framework used in the study.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the argumentation process taking place on Q&amp;A sites, an initial claim can be presented as an integral part of the answer (message 1). In this context, other answerers can challenge the initial claim by formulating counter-claim(s) or rebuttal(s) against it (messages 2 and 3). Counter-arguments such as these may be bolstered by grounds of some kind. Such grounds may draw on facts obtained from documents, for example. While formulating and presenting counter-arguments, the answerers employ diverse strategies to justify the counter-claims and rebuttals against the initial claims. As discussed in greater detail below, the answerers may, for example, challenge the background assumptions of the answers. Further, as a part of such strategies, the answerers may seek further support for the justification of counter-arguments by using (e.g. citing) information sources such as Wikipedia articles. Information sources used for this purpose may differ with regard to their authoritativeness, ranging from peer-reviewed papers published by climatologists to persuasive material such as YouTube videos advocating an ideological viewpoint on the issues of global warming.</p>

<title>4. Research questions</title>
<p>Drawing on the conceptual approach illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551513478892">Figure 1</xref>, the present study addresses the following research questions:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>RQ1:</bold> What kind of strategies do the answerers employ to justify their counter-arguments in Q&amp;A discussions?</p>
<p><bold>RQ2:</bold> In which ways do the answerers use information sources in order to support their counter-arguments?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To sharpen the focus of the study, a few limitations were necessary. First, attention is solely paid to the initial claims presented in the context of answers (not questions presented by the askers). Second, the ways in which the presentation order of the elements of argument is associated with the employment of diverse justification strategies will not be examined. Third, no attempt will be made to specify how the indications of support constitutive of the mixed argument pattern affect the justification of counter-arguments; the focus will be placed on the role of ‘oppositional’ elements (counter-claim and rebuttal) only.</p>

<title>5. Empirical data and analysis</title>
<p>The empirical data were collected from Yahoo! Answers threads focusing on the issues of global warming (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">http://answers.yahoo.com/</ext-link>). To this end, 100 consecutive threads containing oppositional or mixed discourse episodes were downloaded. Because the main emphasis is placed on qualitative analysis and no statistical generalizations are aimed at, the above sample appeared to be sufficient for the needs of the current investigation.</p>
<p>The Yahoo! Answers threads examined in the present study are available in the sub-category of Environment/Global Warming/Resolved Questions. This category was preferred because the threads placed there are in their final form; discussions will not be continued by adding new messages, different from the Open Questions and In Voting sections. The messages analysed in the present study had been posted to Yahoo! Answers within the period of 14 March to 14 April 2012. However, threads containing fewer than five messages were excluded from the study. This is because the preliminary reading of the research material indicated that very short threads do not provide sufficient opportunities for starting argumentative discussion.</p>
<p>In order to identify 100 consecutive discourse episodes meeting the above criteria, altogether 66 threads were downloaded. All in all, they contained 60 oppositional and 40 mixed discourse episodes. In addition, these threads entailed 239 discourse episodes of other types, that is, failed opening and non-oppositional discourse episodes. Thus, of all discourse episodes, altogether 29.5% were classified into the categories of oppositional and mixed episodes. Since the present study focuses on the oppositional and mixed episodes, discourse episodes of other types will not be discussed in greater detail.</p>
<p>The downloaded threads were first read several times in order to obtain an overall picture. The relevant portions of the messages, that is, a sentence or fewer related sentences, were then coded by making use of the categories specified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551513478892">Figure 1</xref>. First, the initial claim, for example, ‘global warming increases the risk of flooding’, was identified in the message posted by an answerer. Then, the messages commenting on the initial claim within the same thread were scrutinized to identify other elements of argument related to the initial claim. An individual thread entailed one or more sub-threads indicating the instances of unique argument patterns. A code was assigned to each element (for example, rebuttal) when it occurred for the first time within a message; other instances of the same element, for example, restatement of a rebuttal within the same message, were simply ignored. In this way, a sub-thread consisting of messages containing elements of argument was identified. In the case of oppositional argument pattern, the elements often appeared in the following order: initial claim → counter-claim → rebuttal. In the case of mixed argument pattern, the order was typically: initial claim → counter-claim → rebuttal → support.</p>
<p>If the initial claim presented in the answer was bolstered with grounds of some kind, the type of the grounds and the type of information source used to support the grounds were coded too. In the coding of grounds, the type of evidence was specified by using four categories. They were identified inductively from the research data as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0165551513478892" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Fact</italic> denotes something that has really occurred or is actually the case and is potentially verifiable (testable), although not necessarily true. In the coding, a ground was defined as a fact if the answerer provided explicit evidence for the existence of the state of affairs by referring to an information source, for example, a research report.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Personal beliefs</italic> are subjective assumptions about the nature, value and meaning of the state of affairs articulated by the answerers.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Opinion</italic> of other people refers to subjective views presented by other individuals.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Emotive appeals</italic> denote the affectively coloured assessments of the characteristics of the fellow answerers. For example, emotive appeals can be used to undermine the initial claim by labelling its presenter as a ‘denialist’ of global warming.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Grounds of these kinds can be further supported by drawing on information sources of various types. In the coding of information sources, the following categories were used:</p>
<list id="list3-0165551513478892" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><italic>human sources</italic> (e.g. an individual scientist);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>networked sources</italic> (e.g. a website);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>broadcast media</italic> (e.g. a television programme);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>printed media</italic> (e.g. a newspaper article);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>organizational sources</italic> (e.g. a research institute).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In order to specify the role of the internet-based sources, all information sources with URLs were classified into the category of networked sources despite the fact that the information content of such sources ultimately originates from a human source (e.g. an individual scientist) or an organization (e.g. a research institute).</p>
<p>To elaborate the picture of the use of information sources as a factor of justifying counter-arguments, the sources of information were also characterized according to their authoritativeness. This characterization draws partly on the ideas of Wikgren [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551513478892">18</xref>, p. 233]. Since conflicting rationalities struggle for the meaningful interpretation of the phenomena of global warming, no single information source may provide a self-evident truth that is accepted by all. On the one hand, the authoritativeness of information sources can be defined from the perspective of scientific rationality, since the phenomena of global warming are explored by climatologists, for example. On the other hand, the authoritativeness of information sources can be approached from the viewpoint of ideological rationalities because global warming is also a political and economic issue.</p>
<p>Given the problem of multiple rationalities, no attempts were made to place the information sources on a continuum of high vs low authoritativeness. A neutral approach was taken by characterizing the nature of evidence provided by information sources of various types. To this end, the content of all information sources used to support counter-claims and rebuttals was scrutinized by accessing the networked sources. The authority of information sources of other types was inferred on the basis of qualitative analysis of the message. Five major categories indicating the nature of the authoritativeness of information sources were inductively identified as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-0165551513478892" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Scientific sources</italic> provide evidence by reporting the findings of basic and applied research funded by universities and research agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Popular scientific</italic> sources entail material that interprets the findings of scientific research for a general audience in diverse formats such as printed books, television documentaries and web pages. Examples of sources of this type include Wikipedia articles and the articles of <italic>National Geographic</italic>.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>News</italic> communicates selected information on current events which is presented by print, broadcast or the Internet to a mass audience.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Persuasive material</italic> advocates a particular viewpoint in order to influence public opinion. Examples of sources of this type include the website organized by Global Warming Hoax (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php">http://www.globalwarminghoax.com/news.php</ext-link>).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Other sources</italic> include a variety of miscellaneous sources such as a message posted to a Q&amp;A site or an opinion presented by a friend.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The coding was finalized by inductively identifying the strategies employed in the justification of counter-arguments. These strategies were defined as a set of goal-directed discursive activities that identify, select and employ grounds of various kinds, as well as information sources of diverse types supporting such grounds, with the intent of presenting the counter-claims and rebuttals as credible. The following strategies were identified:</p>
<list id="list5-0165551513478892" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Questioning the background assumptions of answers</italic>. This strategy challenges the starting points of the answer encapsulated in the initial claim. This may be done, for example, by maintaining that an earlier answer specifying the relationships between the Antarctic ice extent and global warming is not meaningful because there is no such thing as global warming; it is merely a scam fabricated by politicians.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Questioning the validity of answers</italic>. This strategy asserts that the content of an individual answer is not valid, because the initial claim is based on incomplete data or incorrect interpretation of facts or evidence of other types.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Drawing on emotional appeals</italic>. This strategy aims at undermining the credibility of the presenter of the initial claim by drawing on ad hominem attacks, for example.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Questioning the contributor’s motives</italic>. This strategy asserts that the presenter of an initial claim has morally dubious goals, for example, spamming messages propagating a political view.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In order to strengthen the validity of the coding, the initial coding was checked iteratively by the present author. Because the study is exploratory and does not aim at statistically representative generalizations of Q&amp;A sites, the requirement of the consensus on coding decisions based on inter-rater reliability can be compromised without endangering the reliability of the exploratory study. According to Miles and Huberman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165551513478892">30</xref>, p. 65], check-coding the same data is useful for the lone researcher, provided that code-recode consistencies are at least 90%. Following this idea, check-coding was repeated and the initial coding was carefully refined. The refining of the coding was continued until there were no anomalies.</p>
<p>To answer the research questions, the data were scrutinized by means of descriptive statistics. The percentage distributions were calculated for the strategies used for justifying counter-arguments and the use of information sources of various kinds. Next, qualitative content analysis was conducted. The constant comparative method was used to capture the variety of articulations of the strategies for justifying counter-arguments and the ways in which information sources were used to support such strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165551513478892">31</xref>, pp. 339–344]. As the qualitative data appeared to be saturated enough, it was possible to draw a sufficiently coherent and credible picture of the nature of justifying counter-arguments in the Q&amp;A forum.</p>
<p>Since the contributors to Yahoo! Answers are expected to be well aware of the fact that their messages will become publicly available on a social Q&amp;A site, no attempts were made to contact the askers and answerers to obtain permission for the use of their messages in the present study. Asking permission would have been difficult in practice because the majority of the contributors appeared to be occasional users; they may not be motivated in answering requests such as these. However, when using the illustrative extracts taken from messages, the anonymity of the contributors is carefully protected. Their nicknames are replaced by neutral identifiers such as Asker, Discourse episode 80 or Answerer 2, Discourse episode 24. Given the high number of Q&amp;A threads discussing global warming, it is unlikely that the extracts taken from discourse episodes constitutive of threads could be associated with individual contributors.</p>

<title>6. Findings</title>
<sec id="section10-0165551513478892">
<title>6.1. Quantitative overview</title>
<p>The 66 threads examined in the present study contained 723 messages. Of them, 66 messages entailed the questions presented by the askers, while 657 messages provided answers to these questions. The lowest number of messages per thread was five and the highest 26. In total, 57 askers and 118 answerers contributed to the threads containing 60 oppositional and 40 mixed discourse episodes. In these episodes, the answerers presented 388 initial claims; of them 28.1% were bolstered with grounds of some types. While commenting on the initial claims, the fellow answerers formulated altogether 83 counter-claims. Of them, 37.3% were bolstered with grounds. Moreover, the answerers presented 129 rebuttals. Of them, 48.8% were supported by grounds. This suggests that the contributors were most active in providing grounds for rebuttals.</p>
<p>The answerers drew on grounds of diverse kinds while bolstering their counter-arguments. Of the grounds, facts were most popular, entailing 50% of all mentions of grounds. Quite frequently, the answerers also drew on emotional appeals; their share of all grounds mentioned was 26.2%. Personal beliefs were also used fairly often (19.8% of all mentions of grounds), while the role of opinions of other people remained marginal (4% of all mentions).</p>
<p>To strengthen the grounds, answerers made altogether 100 explicit mentions to information sources of diverse kinds. The majority (90%) of the sources were internet-based, for example, websites. The share of information sources of other types remained marginal: printed sources, for example books (3%), human sources (2%) and sources of other types (for example, university degrees such as an MA in Environmental Science) comprised 5% of all mentions to information sources. The popularity of the networked sources is understandable in the electronic environment. An argument can be supported more effectively if its presenter provides a hyperlink to a document containing factual evidence [e.g. 14]. The asker (and other participants) can then immediately check the information source that is readily accessible online.</p>
<p>In regard to the authoritativeness of the information sources, 38% of them belonged to the category of persuasive material, while 34% of the sources were classified as scientific. The share of popular scientific sources was 7%. Further, 5% of the sources belonged to the category of news and 16% to the category of other sources. The above findings suggest that the main struggle for the authoritativeness of sources supporting counter-arguments occurs between scientific sources and persuasive material advocating a particular viewpoint.</p>
<p>The participants employed four major strategies to justify their counter-arguments. In total, there were 152 instances of the usage of such strategies. The above number exceeds the number of discourse episodes (100) because an individual episode may entail the use of more than one strategy. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165551513478892">Table 1</xref> specifies the distribution of the strategies employed by the participants.</p>

<p>Questioning the validity of answers appeared to be the most frequently used strategy. Often, the participants also challenged the background assumptions of the answers. Sometimes, the participants drew on emotional appeals while trying to justify their counter-claims or rebuttals. On the other hand, the participants seldom questioned the motives of other contributors.</p>
<p>Of information sources (<italic>n</italic> = 100) referred to by the answerers, 52% were used to support the strategy of questioning the background assumptions. Almost equally often, that is, 46%, mentions were made in the context of questioning the validity of answers. The participants seldom referred to information sources when drawing on emotional appeals (2% of the mentions). Finally, in the context of questioning the contributor’s motives, no references were made to information sources in order to support counter-claims or rebuttals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0165551513478892">
<title>6.2. Qualitative features of the strategies for justifying counter-arguments</title>
<p>The above strategies may be characterized in more detail by drawing on qualitative analysis. To illustrate the strategies, extracts from the sub-threads will be presented. Owing to space restrictions, the extracts include only two messages: answer 1 entailing an initial claim and answer 2 including a counter-claim or rebuttal. The focus is placed on cases in which the participants used information sources to support the counter-arguments. The findings of the qualitative analysis are discussed by starting from the strategy of questioning the background assumptions of answers because this strategy operates at the highest level of generality.</p>
<sec id="section12-0165551513478892">
<title>6.2.1. Questioning the background assumptions of answers</title>
<p>Typically, the meaningfulness of the initial claim constitutive of the answer was questioned by showing that such a claim draws on faulty assumptions about the object of discussion. In addition, this strategy maintains that the object of discussion is approached from biased perspectives such as ‘denialism’ or ‘warmism’. Therefore, the initial claim (and consequently the answer) is shown to be untenable and its credibility is judged as low. Almost without exception, networked sources were employed to support the counter-arguments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165551513478892">Table 2</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Drawing on personal beliefs as grounds, Answerer 2 challenged the starting points of answer 1 by formulating a rebuttal against the initial claim. The rebuttal simply labelled global warming as a swindle. To support the rebuttal, Answerer 2 provided hyperlinks to two video documentaries. They contain persuasive material suggesting that the basic assumptions of ‘warmism’ are faulty since they exaggerate the risks of climate change. Typical to Q&amp;A discussions, however, Answerer 2 neither characterized the content of the videos in greater detail nor explained why they are particularly relevant; he just provided the titles of the sources and their URLs. Since no ready answers are offered, the Asker is expected to take additional pains to scrutinize the relevance of the suggested information sources.</p>
<p>The above strategy also manifested itself in the struggle for defining the most authoritative information sources supporting the meaningfulness of the initial claims. Again, the main struggle occurred between the ‘warmist’ and ‘denialist’ positions: what kind of sources of information are able to provide most credible evidence for or against the existence of global warming? (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0165551513478892">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The rebuttal draws on persuasive citing behaviour by contrasting the authority of YouTube videos and the reports issued by major US research institutions, that is, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The authority of YouTube videos is undermined by asserting that their content is not based on peer-reviewed (objective) research findings. Similar to the example discussed before, Answerer 2 neither described the content of the research reports in greater detail nor explained why they are particularly relevant as scientific evidence. This suggests that Q&amp;A debates about controversial issues are not particularly deep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551513478892">5</xref>]. Instead of conclusive answers, the participants often provide references to a list of information sources that are presented as authoritative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513478892">17</xref>].</p>

<title>6.2.2. Questioning the validity of answers</title>
<p>Questioning the validity of the content of answers was the most frequently used strategy for justifying counter-arguments. About 47% of all instances of the strategies were classified into this category. Typically, this strategy was employed to demonstrate that the facts or other evidence presented in support of the initial claims are interpreted incorrectly. To support the counter-arguments, the answerers primarily drew on the networked sources (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0165551513478892">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The rebuttal is based on the assertion that the information sources mentioned by Answerer 1 are not sufficiently relevant because they do not meet the criteria of peer-reviewed studies. The first-mentioned source is a Wikipedia article, while the second information source is an information sheet issued by the Climate Research Unit, School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, UK. Both sources can be classified as popular scientific. According to the Climate Research Unit, the information sheet aims at providing ‘introductory material on a variety of climate-related subjects intended for the interested layperson’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info">http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info</ext-link>). Apparently, the specifying questions presented by Answerer 2 are relevant, but the rebuttal loses much of its power because Answerer 2 does not provide the references to peer-reviewed studies he is calling for as relevant evidence.</p>
<p>However, many of the counter-arguments were supported by explicit references to information sources. Often, they were used to demonstrate that the facts presented in the initial claims are interpreted incorrectly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0165551513478892">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<p>The criticism is based on the assumption that information sources used as evidence to bolster the initial claim are not pertinent to the issue at hand. Also, the counter-argumentation draws on the assumption that, even though such sources may be relevant, they have been interpreted in a misleading way. Thus, their evidential power is lowered and the credibility of the presenter of the initial claim is undermined.</p>

<sec id="section14-0165551513478892">
<title>6.2.3. Drawing on emotional appeals</title>
<p>Since global warming is a controversial topic, the counter-arguments were quite often grounded on emotional appeals. The majority of them were negatively coloured, and often ad hominem attacks were made against the presenters of initial claims. Drawing on emotional appeals differed from other strategies in that the answerers very seldom referred to information sources to provide further justification for counter-claims or rebuttals. Almost without exception, they drew on their personal beliefs. Often, as exemplified below, the use of emotional appeals had a long history and they were used to attack frequent participants who are well-known proponents of ‘warmism’ or ‘denialism’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0165551513478892">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>The harshness of the expressions is partly because the initial claim was quite provocative. The answerers tended to react in a similar tone. From the perspective of the asker, the strategy of drawing on emotional appeals may be problematic because the answerers’ attention is distracted from the main issue at hand; the counter-arguments do not contribute to the development of answers with relevant content.</p>

<title>6.2.4. Questioning the contributor’s motives</title>
<p>Finally, the counter-arguments were based on the questioning of the motives of fellow answerers. The criticism was mainly directed to objectionable motives such as spamming. In this context, no references were made to information sources; the justification of counter-claims and rebuttals was solely based on the answerers’ beliefs and opinions. The following example illustrates the case in which the presenter of the initial claim was criticized for spamming. Answerer 2 draws attention to this aspect by referring to ‘routine’ by which Answerer 1 repeatedly distributes the same message (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0165551513478892">Table 7</xref>). The motives of the participants were also put in doubtful light in cases in which it became evident that they were trying to propagate political ideas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0165551513478892">Table 8</xref>).</p>

<p>The debate boils down to the issue whether it is morally acceptable to provide answers by ignoring scientific evidence and offering persuasive material only. Since debates such as these are ideologically laden, they tend to end as unresolved as they began. There is irony involved in this because a considerable part of the threads of Yahoo! Answer are finally transferred to the section of ‘Resolved Questions’.</p>

<title>7. Discussion</title>
<p>One of the strengths of social Q&amp;A sites is that they enable the provision of multiple answers that can complement each other. Often, however, the askers have to deal with competing answers with conflicting evidence. The present study showed that the participants employed diverse strategies to justify counter-arguments against inadequate answers provided by fellow answerers. Most frequently, the participants questioned the validity of the content of answers. Often, they also challenged the background assumptions of answers. These two strategies comprised about 86% of all instances of strategies employed by the participants. Emotionally laden strategies, that is, drawing on emotional appeals, and questioning the contributor’s motives, were less popular (14% of all instances of the strategies). Given the controversial nature of global warming as a topic of discussion, the above percentage is not particularly high. This is partly because negative emotional elements can also be embedded in messages questioning the background assumptions behind the answers or doubting the validity of individual answers.</p>
<p>The study showed that the use of information sources is most active in the context of most popular strategies. This is mainly because justifying counter-arguments against background assumptions and the validity of answers would not be effective if such arguments were based on personal beliefs only. On the other hand, the active use of information sources may be explained by the fact that there is much documented information about global warming readily available, particularly on the internet. It is no wonder that the above strategies were mainly supported by drawing on the networked sources, while the role of information sources of other types, for example broadcast media, remained marginal. This finding confirms the results of Wikgren’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513478892">17</xref>] study showing that online participants favour sources that are readily accessible on the internet. Interestingly, the above findings contradict the results obtained by Oh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165551513478892">14</xref>]. They found that the answerers contributing to Yahoo! Answers preferred human sources over online sources. This difference is mainly due to the fact that the present study classified the participants’ personal beliefs into the category of grounds; thus beliefs were not counted among the sources of information.</p>
<p>In regard with the most popular strategies for justifying counter-arguments, the findings of the present investigation support Wikgren’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513478892">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551513478892">18</xref>] conclusions about the significant role of persuasive citation behaviour. To this end, the answerers favoured authoritative sources such as reports published by top-level research organizations; sources of these kinds were used as ‘hard currency’ in the argumentation. On the other hand, an even higher portion of information sources consisted of persuasive material advocating a particular viewpoint to global warming. The source priorities reflect the struggle between scientific and ideological rationalities: which voice or knowledge counts most, what evidence should we count, and who to believe? Characteristic of Q&amp;A discussions about controversial topics, there seem to be no conclusive answers to these questions.</p>

<sec id="section17-0165551513478892" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>8. Conclusion</title>
<p>As social reference services are gaining increasing popularity among information seekers, the evaluation of the credibility of answers available on forums such as social Q&amp;A sites becomes a critical task. It can be rendered easier for the users if they are informed about the ways in which the contributors argue in online discussions and seek further support for their views by citing information sources. The ideas of how the online contributors strategically use information sources in order to persuade the others of the truth of an issue may be used in information literacy instruction focused on students, for example. Groups such as these are important because social Q&amp;A sites are used as information sources while doing homework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165551513478892">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Since the present study focused on a controversial topic debated on a Q&amp;A site, the findings cannot be generalized to social reference services as a whole. There is a need to elaborate the findings by making comparative studies focusing on discussion topics of various kinds occurring on diverse Q&amp;A sites. In addition, to expand the research setting, studies comparing the provision of answers in online discussion groups and Q&amp;A sites would be useful because comparative research settings provide opportunities to generalize the empirical findings. Importantly, comparative findings could also serve the ends of refining the conceptualizations of social reference services.</p>
