<p>“You’ve got to remember that this is the tradition, this is the knowledge and Law. It’s something that has been held onto which came from the days before there were hospitals and other forms of doctors. We were responsible for looking after all the people. We have held onto that knowledge…”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rupert Langkatjukur Peter died in 2012 and is recognized with this quote in the dedication to <italic>Traditional healers of Central Australia: Ngangkaṟi</italic>, for which we have the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (NPY) Women’s Council Aboriginal Corporation and Magabala Books in Broome to thank. Along with Andy Tjilari, Rupert Peter was recognized at the 2009 College Congress in Adelaide with the Mark Sheldon Award for his contribution to Indigenous mental health. In accepting their awards, also recognized was the work of their ancestors and their colleagues whose stories fill this impressive volume.</p>
<p>This is not the first account of the work of Aboriginal traditional healers. The original edition of A.P. Elkin’s <italic>Aboriginal men of high degree</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491993">1</xref></sup> appeared in 1945 and psychiatrist John Cawte wrote extensively and respectfully.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491993">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491993">3</xref></sup> Neither is it the first publication from these remarkable men and women. Following a meeting of <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic> in Alice Springs in 2000, the NPY Women’s Council translated and transcribed their stories in <italic>Ngangkaṟi work - An–angu way</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491993">4</xref></sup> to encourage understanding and collaboration across cultures. As Yanyi Bandicha, Chairperson of the NPY Women’s Council explains in relation to this second book, Rupert Peter’s contribution was critical as he “saw these books as a way of increasing understanding of <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic> to improve health outcomes for <italic>An–angu</italic>, whilst maintaining <italic>An–angu</italic> authority on which issues were talked about, how and by whom” (p. 265).</p>
<p>Helen Milroy (also a recipient of the Mark Sheldon Award) notes in the introduction that: “As our understanding of traditional methods increases, it is easy to see some of the overlaps with more recent developments in mental health care” (p. 12). This book is a major contribution to that understanding, not only as it gives voice to <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic>, but also because it provides a context to their discussions of continuity and change. Interspersed throughout are photographs dating from the 1940s to the present. On my desk as I write is a volume of Baldwin Spencer’s photographs from central Australia at the beginning of the last century.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491993">5</xref></sup> Taken together, these two works suggest how little changed in the first half of that century by comparison with the scale of change since.</p>
<p>The contemporary images accompanying the <italic>ngangkaṟis’</italic> stories show proud and confident women and men, and artworks of dazzling beauty. But it is the voice that is inspiring. <italic>Wangkanyi</italic>, we are told, means to talk, and there is a conversational quality as each <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic> discusses the physical, spiritual and relational aspects of their work which, while rooted in tradition, now confronts new challenges, as Toby Minyintiri Baker notes:<disp-quote>
<p>Our ability to heal people comes from our grandparents and they got it from their grandparents. That tradition has been passed down over a really long period of time. The powers that we have, the things that are given to us to do our healing, are the same – they are the same powers given to us through those lines. The reasons we use them changes all the time though – the reasons people are suffering grief, the things that have actually happened, and all the new circumstances change. However, our ability to look after people and our powers have remained the same. (p. 181)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is much discussion of cooperation, not only between <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic> but also with conventional practitioners. Several contributors recall their forebears working with Dr Charles Duguid in the 1930s and 1940s, Wakupi Clem Toby noting that: “He had an open door policy and <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic> were welcome to come in and work alongside him. Often he would wait until the <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic> did their work before he looked at patients” (p. 240). Sadly, while Duguid wrote at length about his clinical work and injustice, he was silent about traditional healing practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491993">6</xref></sup> As was also Géza Róheim who visited the area in 1927 and kept on his desk until his death in 1954 the <italic>tjurunga</italic> given by an informant during that trip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213491993">7</xref></sup> His interests were Aboriginal symbols and myths, and their meanings for psychoanalytic theory; the practice of healing was not his concern. In 1921 Roheim was awarded the Freud Prize and there is a delicious irony that in 2011 Andy Tjilari and other <italic>ngangkaṟi</italic> visited Sydney to have bestowed on them by the city of Vienna the World Council for Psychotherapy Sigmund Freud Award for ‘contributions to psychotherapy’.</p>
<p>And I believe that Andy Tjilari neatly sums up why this book should be prescribed reading for clinicians working in remote Aboriginal Australia, and a guide to anyone invested in cross-cultural cooperation:<disp-quote>
<p>So you have learnt about some of our understandings, observations about how and why people get sick. Western doctors often have difficulty understanding these things and the way we work. And so we hope the way we’re talking now helps both people understand something of our work, see how we do things. We hope the doctors will be able to understand something of <italic>An–angu</italic> Law, of traditional healing, the things that we can do, and see the ways that we can work productively side by side, in harmony with each other. Hopefully we will work out good ways to support each other, the doctors doing their work, we doing our work. (p. 244)</p>
