<abstract>
<p>In this paper, trench-gate high electron mobility transistors, which have three channel directions with micro-cantilevers, have been design and fabricated. The action of the trench-gate direction on the sensitivity of the microstructure has been considered based on high electron mobility transistors as sensitive units which are located at the root of the micro-cantilever. The microstructure has been fabricated by using the process of dry and wet etching a GaAs substrate. Through selecting suitable material and appropriate mask layout, the high electron mobility transistors have been protected as sensitive units.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the development of micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology, the miniature, integrating and high sensitivity of micro-device structures needs to be improved quickly. High electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) with the advantages of high frequency, high speed, and high power have been widely used in related fields.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740349912442859">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740349912442859"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740349912442859">3</xref></sup> The performance of HEMTs mainly depends on the property of two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the material structure, which means that the transport properties of 2DEG in the channel would be affected by an electric field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740349912442859">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740349912442859"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740349912442859"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740349912442859">7</xref></sup> The research of micro-structure devices based on the HEMT as a sensitive unit has attracted much attention. The application of this structure as the sensors for gas, liquid and temperature has made great progress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740349912442859">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740349912442859">9</xref></sup> In this paper, the different channel directions of a sensitive unit integrated with a micro-cantilever have been designed on the basis of preliminary work. The optimal choice of device will be achieved through contrasting the sensitivity of different channel directions in the device. The micro-structure device based on GaAs HEMT has been fabricated by combining the MEMS process with semiconductor technology as the main process.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>The micro-cantilever would be bent if the mass suffered applied stress along the <italic>Z</italic> direction. In addition, the strain would be induced to the channel of the HEMT device to modulate the density of the 2DEG. The stress in different channel directions with the cantilever has different values owing to the angles between the direction of pressure in the channel and the electric field direction. The piezoresistive coefficients and sensitivities of the microstructure are various because the piezoresistive effect in semiconductor materials is different. The microstructure of the three channel directions of the sensitive unit integrated with the micro-cantilever has been designed through considering the above factors, which affect the sensitivity of the microstructure. The angles of channel directions with the cantilever are 0°, 45° and 90°, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740349912442859">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The whole process for fabricating the micro-sensing structure has been formulated through researching the process of HEMT and considering the mode of HEMT connecting to the ground. The layout of the microstructure has been designed by following the rules of the software of L-edit based on the preliminary work. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740349912442859">Figure 2</xref> shows the layout of the whole structure.

<title>Fabrication</title>
<p>The processing of the HEMT embedded micro-accelerometer consists mainly of two parts: first, the preparation of sensitive cells and second, the release and etching of the microstructure. The sensitive unit GaAs HEMTs embedded in the microstructures are surface devices. To achieve the main advantage of microprocessing technology in the process, we need to address the key technologies, including shallow mesa etching, ohmic contact, double-groove etching, Schottky contacts, and so on. The main processing of the microstructure is by using MEMS body processing. We use the front etching and back etching integrated technology to achieve the release of the cantilever and the mass. The main process steps include the following.</p>
<list id="list1-1740349912442859" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Thin films HEMTs extension. In order to avoid the introduction of impurity ions, the growth of the thin films is conducted in an ultra-vacuum environment. Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), the eruption source of the required elements is opened; by adjusting the speed and time of eruption source, precise control of the thickness and doping concentration of each layer of semiconductor material is possible. Film materials testing. Before the production of HEMT devices, first, we need to clean the impurities in the surface of the material layer using organic solvents, acids, alkalis and other chemical reagents; then the surface must be soaked and cleaned with deionized water. After that, we should test the materials for surface roughness, measure the resistivity, mobility, Hall coefficient and other basic electrical parameters to obtain an initial understanding of the electrical properties of the channel layer.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Etched mesa. According to the structure map, first coat with a layer of photoresist on the substrate after light irradiation in the corrosion of the structure of the film selection. Implement the corrosion selection of the thin films. This mask is a negative version, so we can obtain the same graphics with an etching mask structure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Deposition of metal: the formation of the source and drain ohmic contact. By lithography, form an ohmic contact graphic, then evaporate a layer of metal Au–Ge–Ni on the cap layer. Usually cover with a layer of Au. The thicknesses of evaporation are 500 Å and 3000 Å, alloying temperature is about 480°C, time is about 30 s.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Production of double-groove. In order to achieve ohmic contact, the required resistance of semiconductor material is small, so it is often grown in high concentrations on the cap layer to achieve ohmic contact. Simultaneously the gate Schottky contact is formed in the barrier layer. Considering the ohmic contact and Schottky contact, gate slot nested to N + slot, this is the so-called dual-groove.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Deposition of metal to form Schottky contacts. The metal of Schottky contact should have high conductivity, high thermal stability and good adhesion characteristics. Considering these principles, a suitable combination of Ti–Pd–Au is used for the Schottky contacts, with evaporation deposition of metal film thickness of 8500 Å; this constitutes the Schottky contacts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Thick electrodes. Passivation layer using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) deposition; the front of the metal gate should be well protected to prevent contamination of the device. On this basis, we use a certain thickness of sputtering station sputtering of metal Au, thickening the three electrodes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Front etching. According to the lithography process forming positive etch graphics, we take the control hole technology to front etching on the GaAs substrate; etching depth is the thickness of cantilever −20 µm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Back etching. Two back etchings are needed. The first part is mass etching, with an etching depth of 75 µm, to form a height difference of the mass and the frame. In micro-gravity, the mass can be moved up and down. Then the control hole technology continues to be used for back etching, until the front etching hole has been punctured. After back etching twice, the cantilever is 20 µm. Finally, four beams are formed – the mass micro-accelerometer structure.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After the eight-step process above, we fabricated the embedded microstructure based HEMT successfully. The first step is the embedded microstructure HEMT pre-preparation process, steps 2 to 6 are for processing the sensitive unit HEMT, and the final step is used for processing the microstructure. A schematic diagram of the process steps is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740349912442859">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
