<abstract>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, chronic disease, in which malnutrition can have an undesirable effect. Therefore, the patient’s nutritional status is critical for optimizing outcomes in COPD. The initial nutrition assessment is focused on identifying calorically compromised COPD patients in order to provide them with appropriate nutrition. Nutritional intervention consists of oral supplementation and enteral nutrition to prevent weight loss and muscle mass depletion. Evaluation of nutritional status should include past medical history (medications, lung function, and exercise tolerance) and dietary history (patient’s dietary habits, food choices, meal patterns, food allergy information, and malabsorption issues), in addition to physiological stress, visceral proteins, weight, fat-free mass, and body mass index. The current medical literature conflicts regarding the appropriate type of formulation to select for nutritional intervention, especially regarding the amount of calories from fat to provide COPD patients. This review article focuses on the enteral product formulations currently available, and how they are most appropriately utilized in patients with COPD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, chronic disease, in which the patient’s nutritional status is critical for optimizing outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460827">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460827">2</xref></sup> Malnutrition has an undesirable effect on the clinical course of COPD and is linked to poor outcomes. Chronic inflammatory processes, tissue hypoxia, muscle atrophy, anabolic hormone deficiency, and an increased resting metabolic rate all contribute physiologically to weight loss in patients with COPD. Therefore, patients with COPD should be evaluated for signs of weight loss on account of its clinical significance.</p>
<sec id="section2-0897190012460827">
<title>Clinical Course</title>
<p>Advanced COPD is typically associated with a negative clinical response due to 25% to 40% of these patients have malnutrition. Patients can exhibit weight loss and tissue depletion, progressing to cachexia and resulting in an overall poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460827">2</xref></sup> Muscle wasting may be detected in patients with COPD by monitoring fat-free mass (FFM) depletion. FFM refers to the nonfat elements of the body, mainly skeletal muscles in addition to bones and water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460827">1</xref></sup> Nutritional intervention consists of oral supplementation and enteral nutrition to prevent weight loss in addition to muscle mass depletion. Parenteral nutrition should be limited to patients failing enteral nutrition support or reserved for patients with documented malabsorption.</p>
<p>There are 3 different compromised nutritional states to highlight in patients with COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012460827">3</xref></sup> These impaired states include semistarvation (low body mass index [BMI] with normal or above normal FFM index), muscle atrophy (normal or above normal BMI with low FFM index), and cachexia (low BMI with low FFM index). Patients in a cachectic state or with muscle atrophy are at the greatest risk for mortality. Cachexia can occur in COPD patients due to decreased oral intake, chronic systemic inflammation, and increased energy expenditures associated with difficult breathing resulting from abnormal respiratory mechanics. Therefore, low FFM index is thought to be a more accurate measure of malnutrition than low BMI in patients with COPD.</p>
<p>Malnutrition coupled with advancing COPD can lead to worsening respiratory muscle function, dyspnea, and exercise capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460827">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460827">2</xref></sup> As a result, muscle mass decreases and respiratory muscles become overloaded during ventilation which can lead to exacerbations or ultimately respiratory failure. Consequently, a poor nutritional status in patients with COPD can lead to mechanical ventilation or death. Thoroughly assessing nutritional status is clinically relevant for identifying at-risk or nutritionally compromised patients with COPD in order to provide them with appropriate nutritional intervention. Evaluation of nutritional status should include past medical history (medications, lung function, and exercise tolerance) and dietary history (patient’s dietary habits, food choices, meal patterns, food allergy information, and malabsorption issues), in addition to physiological stress, visceral proteins, weight, FFM, and BMI.</p>

<sec id="section3-0897190012460827">
<title>Nutritional Support</title>
<p>Enteral nutrition products appropriate for patients with COPD feature a modified macronutrient formulation with increased fat calories and decreased carbohydrate calories to assist in limiting the amount of carbon dioxide production while still maintaining an adequate intake of protein for lean muscle mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460827">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460827">4</xref></sup> Therefore, patients with COPD benefit from either a moderate-fat or high-fat diet, which is preferred over a traditional standard-fat diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460827">4</xref></sup> Enteral products currently available for patients with COPD feature either a moderate-fat or high-fat formulation. For patients with severe COPD, a high-fat formula contributes to clinical improvements by decreasing ventilatory time and respiratory quotient (RQ) as a result of reducing carbon dioxide production. This positive response illustrates the fact that nutrition status and ventilation status are closely linked. Therefore, enteral nutrition products should be given in divided doses throughout the day in regard to symptoms and activity patterns to ensure balanced caloric intake, in addition to preventing loss of appetite and unwanted ventilatory effects.</p>
<p>Enteral nutrition formulas currently available for patients with COPD include NovaSource Pulmonary<sup>®</sup>, Nutren Pulmonary<sup>®</sup>, Pulmocare<sup>®</sup>, and Respalor<sup>®</sup>. Each product contains canola oil and medium-chain triglycerides as fat sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460827">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460827">4</xref></sup> Additionally, Respalor<sup>®</sup> contains sunflower and corn oils, Nutren Pulmonary<sup>®</sup> contains corn oil, and Pulmocare<sup>®</sup> contains safflower and corn oils. At this time, there is no preferred lipid substrate, but canola oil and medium-chain triglycerides are primarily used. Recommendations suggest enteral nutrition products contain 35% to 65% of total calories from lipids as the primary energy source. Nutren Pulmonary<sup>®</sup> and Pulmocare<sup>®</sup> each contain 55% of total calories from fat, while NovaSource Pulmonary<sup>®</sup> and Respalor<sup>®</sup> contain 40% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012460827">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Oral nutritional supplements for patients with COPD should also include vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants in addition to the recommended amount of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460827">5</xref></sup><sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012460827">6</xref></sup> Studies have reported decreased levels of antioxidants such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E in patients with COPD. The etiology of the deficiency is not understood and may be associated with poor nutrition, the disease process, smoking history, or a combination of these. Patients are encouraged to take the recommended daily allowance of these vitamins; therefore, a multivitamin may be warranted in addition to the currently available vitamin-fortified enteral products. Additional supplementation with calcium and vitamin D may be necessary in patients with a long-term history of steroid use.</p>
<p>Dietary fiber can help maintain bowel function which can be especially important for elderly patients with COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460827">5</xref></sup> Fiber may also aid in digestion and improve breathing. NovaSource Pulmonary<sup>®</sup> is the only commercially available enteral product formulated with fiber (8 g/L) that is specific for patients with lung disorders such as COPD. Current daily fiber recommendations suggest 20 to 35 g/d, and patients should maintain adequate hydration when increasing dietary fiber to avoid constipation. Too much fiber can also cause gas and bloating which can make breathing more difficult for patients. Additionally, patients should decrease salt intake to prevent fluid retention which can also make breathing more difficult.</p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids promote anti-inflammatory activities and are a protective factor against increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460827">5</xref></sup><sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460827">7</xref></sup> Therefore, COPD patients should increase dietary omega-3 fatty acids to help control inflammation. This can be achieved by incorporating more cold water fish into the diet such as salmon, sardines, tuna, herring, halibut, and mackerel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460827">7</xref></sup> Also, soybeans, walnuts, flaxseeds, and canola oil are rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Foods that are dense in omega-6 fatty acids are thought to promote inflammation, making COPD worse, by increasing the levels of interleukin 6. Therefore, patients with COPD should consider limiting or avoiding foods such as tilapia, catfish, poultry, and vegetable oils. Currently, NovaSource Pulmonary<sup>®</sup> is the only enteral nutrition supplement formulated with omega-3 fatty acids as the primary lipid source for patients with COPD.</p>
<p>To increase lean muscle mass and encourage protein synthesis, protein intake should be at least 1.5 g/kg of body weight each day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460827">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460827">2</xref></sup> Respalor<sup>®</sup> and NovaSource Pulmonary<sup>®</sup> are formulated with a slightly higher protein content to support lean body mass when compared to other similar nutrition supplements. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs or exercise programs, if appropriate, should be utilized to augment the effects of nutritional intervention by increasing lean body mass and stimulating the appetite, thus facilitating weight gain and functional improvements. Therefore, patients with COPD may find it beneficial to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day that are high in calories while maintaining adequate hydration to promote thinning mucus. This can help prevent the stomach from feeling overly full and causing shortness of breath. The goal of nutritional support is to increase body weight, FFM, respiratory muscle function, and exercise tolerance. Improving or maintaining patient nutritional status is essential for patients with COPD to ensure successful therapeutic outcomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When choosing the proper enteral formula for the patient with COPD, it is important to consider not only those factors which can help the patient reach their nutritional goals but also those factors that can hamper or exacerbate their conditions. For example, certain enteral nutrition formulas have the potential to cause increased gastric emptying time. Ferreira et al conducted a systematic overview of 272 randomized controlled trials which found that patients receiving a high-fat diet compared to patients receiving a moderate-fat diet had measurable differences in gastric emptying times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460827">8</xref></sup> Those receiving the high-fat diet had a significant increase in gastric emptying time, which may impede the mobility of the already compromised diaphragm, thereby worsening the patient’s shortness of breath. Additionally, the patient’s satiety prevented the desire to continue eating, thereby further contributing to the malnourished state. In a double-blind, crossover study, Akrabawi et al observed that gastric emptying was significantly longer (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) after a high-fat formula versus moderate-fat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460827">9</xref></sup> They found that there was no significant change in tidal volume, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, and respiratory rate. However, at 30 and 60 minutes, significant increases in the rate of carbon dioxide production and oxygen uptake were seen in the moderate-fat diet as compared to the high-fat diet. After 150 minutes, the differences between the 2 diets were no longer observed. The RQ significantly increased with both the diets; however, there were no differences between them.</p>
<p>Most studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a formula or diet for the COPD patient over a short period of time. Therefore, it is not known what the response will be over a longer period of time. In an attempt to answer this question, Farooqi et al looked at the change in body weight and physical performance of 36 patients with COPD receiving a rehabilitation program that were given dietary advice only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460827">10</xref></sup> The patients were followed for 1 year. The results showed that an increase in body weight, handgrip strength, and walking distance was seen in all patients.</p>
<p>In summary, the nutritional status of COPD patients is critical to their overall well-being. Patients should be evaluated for proper therapy selection including enteral formula or diet. This assessment should involve a complete dietary history and a complete medication history (prescription medications, over-the-counter products, and herbal therapies). Other significant information includes anthropometric measurements, history of the patient’s weight status, and a complete medical history (severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Nutritional support is a critical part of the treatment plan for the patient with COPD. Proper care to prevent malnutrition will have a significant impact on quality of life and overall patient outcomes. In general, COPD patients may benefit from high protein, moderate-to-high fat diets with supplementation including fiber, fat-soluble vitamins, and fatty acids such as omega-3. As a result, choosing an appropriate diet can have a substantial positive effect on a patient’s longevity and quality of life. Therefore, it is critical that the pharmacy practitioner have a good understanding of the disease state and the role of proper nutrition in improving the patient’s clinical outcomes.</p>
