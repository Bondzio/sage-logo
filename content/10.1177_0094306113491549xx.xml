<p>The financial and economic crisis post 2008 has received quite extensive media attention, especially after the banking crisis spread into an economic crisis and then into a full blown crisis of the Eurozone. This book was written before and does not cover this latest period of crisis. Instead, it embarks on a comparison between the archetypical, classical crisis of 1929 and the more recent, but largely forgotten crisis of 1987. Nevertheless, it provides quite a few insights relevant for research about news coverage of more recent events.</p>
<p><italic>Front Page Economics</italic> uses two newspapers as textual sources for both periods, the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> and <italic>The New York Times</italic>. There are good reasons for doing so (the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic> was a very important paper back in the 1930s) and some idiosyncratic reasons, too (Gerald Suttles is a reader of the paper and knew some of its journalistic staff). From these papers, random samples are drawn for specific time periods which are then analyzed. Methodologically, the analysis proceeds in a deductive way. Suttles first establishes a theoretical framework through which he then reads his results.</p>
<p>He develops a specific version of frame analysis for the empirical analysis which he takes from various authors. He makes the obvious start with Goffman, but finds him wanting for allowing too much fluidity in frames and their adoption. Suttles is less interested in transient frames than in frames that last for decades, maybe centuries. He thus turns to Lakoff’s figurative language approach where frames are seen as verbal templates of lived experiences (p. 10). Metaphors, metonyms, and personification are decisive in this process of extension. In addition, he refers to the work of literary critic Kenneth Burke and his notion of dramatism. Every narrative of social practice can be analyzed in terms of five generating principles: actor, action, purpose, agency, and stage. Suttles modifies these for the analysis of newspaper coverage, using the term “wordscape” to denote the setting in which the drama is played out, and by introducing the element of personification (more on this below).</p>
<p>The deductive approach has the advantage that it allows the author to organize the empirical detail in a structured and simplified way. But it also alerts us to the fact that Suttles’ narrative is a construct and thus an exercise in self-exemplification. It would be interesting to see if an inductive approach (e.g., corpus linguistics) would lead to similar results.</p>
<p>There are several interesting findings. It appears that back in 1929, no one spoke of “the economy.” “Business,” “commerce,” or “industry” were the words used to describe economic activity. Dictionaries defined economy as a synonym for thrift. Keynes may have used the term “economic system” but his General Theory passed largely unnoticed in the press. It was only when the U.S. Senate requested the Secretary of Commerce to estimate the total national income from 1929 through 1931 that Nathan and Kuznets came up with the definition that proved influential: “The economy was that which produces the net national product” (p. 30). It is also interesting that, over time, the main actors who made judgements on economic matters changed. In 1929 it was typically the owner-businessman who “owned” the topic (Alfred Sloan, Henry Ford). By the early 1940s it was state administrators, bank economists, stockbrokers, and university economists.</p>
<p>Suttles identifies two “master narratives” in 1987 which he then traces through the period between 1930 and 1986. The first is the economic machine narrative, the second is the medical emergency narrative. According to the first, the economy is a self-regulating machine that requires little intervention, just a bit of tinkering. When the economy is in trouble, journalists turn to the medical emergency narrative, indicating that the economy may require deep intervention (p. 54). The economy is a patient in intensive care. Such master narratives allow the reader to disengage temporarily and catch up at a later time without too much disorientation. The plot is congruous with the event structure. “Any mysteries left unsolved today might be reintroduced tomorrow to sustain suspense and reader interest” (p. 60).</p>
<p>The journalistic task becomes easier as there is a common script which the news story follows. This helps solving the dilemma of explaining too much detail every day or losing the interest of the audience. However, the reader is left in a state where they learn very little about reality: the press reports on things which we already knew somehow: “As it turns out, we don’t have to learn anything new to understand the American economy. The statement is not facetious, for what I want to claim is that the way public knowledge is shared and our news reading culture made common is largely through such narratives. Something we do not know I made into something we do know…” (p. 49). We know from nursery school the “little train that could” and from films like <italic>Herbie</italic> that machines “can be characters faced with difficulties but win the struggle to overcome them” (p. 49).</p>
<p>Suttles is fond of Northrop Frye’s <italic>bonmot</italic> that “in every age the ruling social or intellectual class tends to project its ideals in some form of a romance, where the virtuous heroes and beautiful heroines represent the ideals and the villains the threats to their ascendancy” (p. 86). The obvious question arises of how new narratives come into being and gain acceptance, but Suttles does not address it, despite his assertion that figurative language is not only a passive reflection, but capable of turning one social reality into another.</p>
<p>Another master narrative is the development of the stock market which Suttle captures under the concept of “high adventure”: “as in Star Trek, a few generic adventures can be multiplied endlessly simply be renaming people and things… Despite a random walk and threat of tribal war between bulls and bears, the stock market recovers its team spirit in the last act” (p. 63). Again, the logic and structure of a pre-existing script defines what type of reporting becomes possible and what sense of reality news readers may develop. In its stark version, the main thesis of the book would be that all social reality (including economic affairs) is not only prestructured, but defined and constructed through language. Language defines how we can think about reality. Little wonder politicians, business people, academics, and journalists make use of metaphors and metonyms, especially when attempting to calm the public in times of crisis.</p>
<p>Much insight is provided in Part III, entitled “The Telling of the Great Crashes.” Chapter Six (The Annual Business Cycle and Its Promoters), Seven (The Voice of the People), and Eight (Congress and the Courts Have Their Say) provide much interesting detail. I only mention the rhythm of weekly reporting (it always peaks mid-week) and of seasonal promotions (the fourth quarter produces most economic news coverage, and Christmas is crucial for economic activity). Regarding the latter, Suttles dryly remarks that most holidays have become sales days and seasonal signposts are a time “when the numbers come out”: “Nature had been accommodated to the self-regulating machine rather than the other way round” (p. 119).</p>
<p>The structure of the book is confusing at times. Chapter One introduces the theoretical framework, followed by two empirical chapters. But Suttles returns to different aspects of theory in later chapters, in fact he seems to struggle with it until the last pages. The presentation of words in tables is often presented in a confusing way, as columns and sub-entries of typologies do not align very well. And it is not always clear how the typologies have been constructed in the first place.</p>
<p>Chapter Five introduces visual material, comprising drawings by the author (but he also tells us that they were drawn by Mike Mannery) and cartoons published in newspapers. Personally I did not think they added much to the analysis and I do not concur with the author’s suggestion that if anything sticks in the readers’ mind it would be the drawings.</p>
<p>The book would have benefitted from better proofreading, and from attention to overall consistency. For example, there are several allusions to a soaring plane on the dust jacket where there is none. There are appendices within chapters plus an appendix at the end which is called “Methodological Appendix.” However, not much in terms of methodological rigour is on display here, despite the lambasting of Jeffrey Alexander and Philip Smith’s lack of methodology in the preceding chapter. The appendix is convincing in its rationale for inclusion of the <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>, but soon drifts off into analysis of sources, and also into more anecdotal terrain. We learn that the book made use of three sources, content analysis, interviews with journalists, and “a variety of other documents.” But only the first is clearly visible throughout the book—it is not clear in which way the interviews and other sources have gone into the analysis. Nothing at all is made in terms of a systematic comparison between the <italic>Times</italic> and the <italic>Tribune</italic>.</p>
<p>Despite these shortcomings, <italic>Front Page Economics</italic> is a sophisticated book and a welcome addition to discourse analysis. It provides some very useful insights for the analysis of the more recent financial and economic crises. Its major claims and findings should be applied to different contexts also through country comparisons.</p>
