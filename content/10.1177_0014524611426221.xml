<abstract>
<p>The Book of Zephaniah expresses the expectation of divine judgment as reversals of two specific features of the Genesis 1 narrative: the creation of life and the dominion of humankind. Each is inverted in Zephaniah, which envisions life destroyed and animals ascendant. However, these two prophetic trajectories appear mutually exclusive, as the former anticipates the elimination of all life while the latter anticipates the surging dominance of animal life. This article examines this tension with reference to specific oracles, exploring possible theological significance and rhetorical function of these seemingly incongruous inversions of the Genesis 1 material. I argue that this tension conveys, perhaps surprisingly, an assertion of the mercy and gracious restraint of God, as the prophet subtly suggests a disjunction between the warranted and probable intensities of divine judgement. Moving from this theological analysis, I briefly consider how this tension also proves rhetorically effective at inviting the prophet’s hearers to seek the mercy of God through repentance.</p>

<p>In Zephaniah, various oracles of judgment form around two constellations of prophetic possibility: destruction and survival. In this article, I approach this broad interpretive model by focusing on the prophet’s depiction of two seemingly opposing reversals of the Genesis 1 narrative. Specifically, the prophet proclaims an impending judgment entailing both (a) total destruction that reverses creation by eliminating all life, and (b) resurgence of ferality that reverses humankind’s dominion over animals. These images of judgment may appear mutually exclusive, depicting both the annihilation and multiplication of life, yet I intend to demonstrate how this tension can plausibly be interpreted as a theological device that affirms God’s mercy and enhances a consequent exhortation to embrace that mercy through repentance. First, I will consider how two apparently opposing images of judgment can both be interpreted as reversals of two creational features of Genesis 1. Second, after noting the tension introduced by the inclusion of these seemingly exclusive reversals, I will examine the theological implications and rhetorical necessity of this tension.</p>
<p>In Zephaniah, the imminent judgment of God is repeatedly depicted in terms of absolute destruction. Indeed, the severest expression of this image of judgment introduces the prophetic material. Directly following the superscription, the first oracle of judgment is framed as an <italic>inclusio</italic> by the prophet’s repeated invocation of destruction ‘from the face of the earth:’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524611426221">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I will utterly sweep away everything</p>
<p>from the face of the earth</p>
<p>says the L<sc>ord</sc>.</p>
<p>I will sweep away</p>
<p>humans and animals;</p>
<p>I will sweep away</p>
<p>the birds of the air and the fish of the sea.</p>
<p>I will make the wicked stumble.</p>
<p>I will cut off humanity</p>
<p>from the face of the earth,</p>
<p>says the L<sc>ord</sc>. (1:2-3)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524611426221">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Kent Harold Richards notes, we find ‘I will sweep away’ repeated by the divine voice in order ‘to emphasize the totality of the destruction.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524611426221">3</xref></sup> The span of destruction prophesied in this introductory oracle is not limited to humanity, but this ‘remarkable inventory of destructive acts’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524611426221">4</xref></sup> will indeed also extinguish ‘animals,’ ‘birds,’ and ‘fish of the sea’ (1:3). Similarly extensive language of destruction permeates a subsequent oracle, which describes the ‘day of the L<sc>ord</sc>’s wrath’ as an event in which ‘the <italic>whole earth</italic> shall be consumed; for a <italic>full</italic>, a terrible end he will make of <italic>all the inhabitants of the earth</italic>’ (1:18). Judgment, it seems clear, will coincide with the end of all life.</p>
<p>Some oracles of utter destruction proceed also to specify discrete groups that will receive God’s wrath, such as apostate Judeans ‘who bow down on the roofs to the host of the heavens’ (1:5). Nonetheless, such instances, where the recipients of judgment are demarcated, perhaps ought not to be interpreted as progressive limitation or mollification of destruction, but rather as justification for the total destruction elsewhere prophesied. That is, when the prophet moves from describing unbounded annihilation to the destruction of a discrete group, we need not construe a limitation of judgment but rather understand the iniquity of a specific group as reason for the severity of the total desolation.</p>
<p>Accordingly, despite instances of seemingly qualified judgment, a distinct characteristic of the judgment oracles is the theme of utter destruction. Furthermore, this theme can plausibly be interpreted as a reversal of the creation narrative of Genesis 1. Indeed, Zephaniah 1:3 specifies the destruction of four creatures whose origins are depicted in Genesis 1: humankind (Gn 1:26-27), animals <italic>en masse</italic> (Gn 1:24-25), birds (Gn 1:20-21), and fish (Gn 1:20-21). Specific linguistic cues indicate persuasively that the reader (or hearer) of these oracles is encouraged to perceive a reversal of the creational content of Genesis 1. Regarding the first oracle of Zephaniah, Rex Mason observes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>what is announced is a complete reversal of the act of creation as described in Gen. ch. 1. […] To drive the point home, the word rendered in NRSV as “humans” and “humanity” is ‘<italic>ādām</italic> (as in Gen. 1:26-7), and there is the same paronomasia with the word “earth”, ‘<italic>ādāmā</italic>, as in Gen. 2:5, 6, 7, 9.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524611426221">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, that this oracle occurs at the beginning of the prophetic material of Zephaniah further heightens its connection with the first chapter of Genesis, itself describing the first events of creation. Thus, both prophetic content and linguistic resonance suggest that the motif of utter destruction present in the oracular material of Zephaniah signals a reversal of the creational narrative of Genesis 1.</p>
<p>Next, we will examine a second image of judgment, most poignantly expressed in a ‘climactic oracle’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014524611426221">6</xref></sup> against the Assyrian city of Nineveh. In the final oracle unambiguously directed against the nations, the prophet announces, ‘[The L<sc>ord</sc>] will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and he will make Nineveh a desolation, a dry waste like the desert’ (2:13). The prophet then elaborates, declaring that this ‘desolation’ will entail the return of wildlife to formerly human habitations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014524611426221">7</xref></sup> Invoking a discomforting image, the prophet declares:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Herds shall lie down in [Nineveh], every wild animal;</p>
<p>the desert owl and the screech owl shall lodge on its capitals;</p>
<p>the owl shall hoot at the window, the raven croak on the threshold;</p>
<p>for its cedar work will be laid bare […].</p>
<p>What a desolation it has become, a lair for wild animals! (2:14,15b).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014524611426221">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here the prophet depicts the ‘desolation’ as nature collapsing in upon civilization. It is worth noting, for instance, that animals are depicted on architectural facets which normally demarcate the outer, feral sphere from the inner, human sphere: ‘the owl shall hoot at the window, the raven croak on the threshold’ (2:14). This device underscores the breakdown of division between human and animalistic realms.</p>
<p>Moreover, the declaration that ‘its cedar work will be laid bare’ additionally erodes any sense that human, civilized boundaries still function. In this context, ‘cedar work’ might stand symbolically or synecdochically for the broader range of civilized luxuries found in an illustrious city. As Marvin A. Sweeney notes, ‘cedar was employed to line the inner rooms of important structures, such as palaces or temples […], and […] was sometimes overlaid with gold in such structures […].’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014524611426221">9</xref></sup> Thus, as ‘its cedar work will be laid bare,’ Nineveh and its buildings will be quite literally emptied of the marks of civilization, as the feral world streams into the resulting vacuity. The imagery is perhaps even speluncar, suggesting more a cave than a human habitation. The ultimate effect of the imagery used in this oracle is to expose the animals’ ascendancy which will reign over Nineveh. In this image, animals—not kings, soldiers, or artisans—dominate the desolate cityscape.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if viewed as the termination of humanity’s dominion over animals, this image may be interpreted as a reversal of another feature of the Genesis 1 narrative. Upon creating humankind, ‘God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth”’ (Gn 1:27). What we glimpse in the oracle of Nineveh’s desolation, then, may be seen as God’s revocation of this dominion. As O. Palmer Robertson notes, ‘Humanity originally had been given the responsibility for exercising dominion over the whole of creation. But now the creation seizes power from the greatest of human empires and transforms it into a bestial wilderness.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014524611426221">10</xref></sup> In judging Nineveh, God repeals humanity’s previously granted ascendancy, thereby nullifying a second feature of the Genesis 1 narrative.</p>
<p>Thus, we see that two images of judgment in Zephaniah may both be interpreted as reversals of the movements of Genesis 1. However, a difficulty arises in that these images seem mutually exclusive: the image of utter desolation assumes an absolute annihilation of life, whereas the image of feral dominion is predicated on a profusion of (nonhuman) life. Central to each image is creaturely life, but one image requires its elimination while the other requires its transformation. If the judgment depicted in 1:2-3 in fact obtained, resulting in total destruction, then the animalistic image of desolation in Nineveh, the ‘culmination of the oracles concerning the nations,’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014524611426221">11</xref></sup> is rendered unintelligible. Indeed, the latter oracle might harmonize with the former only if we posit that the universal destruction is not ultimately executed. Moreover, though I have focussed on an oracle depicting a proliferation of animals, the book of Zephaniah contains other clear suggestions of the survival of human life. The prophet confidently declares, for instance, ‘The seacoast shall become the possession of the remnant of the house of Judah […]. For the L<sc>ord</sc> their God will be mindful of them and restore their fortunes’ (2:7). Accordingly, assuming—as I do—that this striking tension between dominant images is an intentional feature of this brief body of prophetic material, I will now consider the possible significance of its inclusion. To that end, I will present one theological implication of this tension, then consider a rhetorical imperative which this tension facilitates.</p>
<p>This tension, I submit, enables the prophet implicitly to articulate the undeserved mercy of God. In the context of a discussion of ‘disproportionate covenant punishment,’ David Petersen insightfully suggests, ‘Perhaps one could say that Zephaniah thinks all in Israel could be, but may not be, destroyed.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014524611426221">12</xref></sup> Petersen’s interpretation of Zephaniah entails a discrepancy between the prophet’s convictions regarding what is deserved (i.e., utter destruction) and what might nonetheless be received (i.e., mollified punishment permitting survival). With this in mind, we are able to discern a plausible justification for including conflicting images of utter and partial destruction: by this means, the prophet simultaneously depicts both what is deserved and what will in fact likely be received. By presenting, in tension, both merited and probable intensities of judgment, the prophet emphasizes the restraint—and, thereby, the mercy—of God.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Further, in addition to underscoring the mercy of God, the prophet enjoins the hearer to seek that mercy through repentant piety:</p>
<p>Gather together, gather,</p>
<p>O shameless nation […].</p>
<p>Seek the L<sc>ord</sc>, all you humble of the land,</p>
<p>who do his commands;</p>
<p>seek righteousness, seek humility;</p>
<p>erhaps you may be hidden</p>
<p>on the day of the L<sc>ord</sc>’s wrath. (2:1,3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such an injunction to repentance would be wholly ineffective if accompanied only by a prophetic message of complete and inescapable destruction. That is, without at least a remote prospect of survival, there remains little motivation to repent, since that repentance will prove futile. In the above-quoted call to repentance, for instance, the prophet declares that the repentantly righteous will ‘<italic>perhaps</italic> […] be hidden on the day of the Lord’s wrath’ (2:3). By introducing the possibility of surviving imminent judgment, the prophet strengthens the rhetorical efficacy of his call to repentance.</p>
<p>The tension in the book of Zephaniah between utter destruction and partial survival is not confined to the oracles that have been the focus of this article, but these prophetic reversals of Genesis 1 nonetheless crisply reveal this paradoxical confluence of images. I make no effort to harmonize these apparently opposing images because—as I have attempted to demonstrate—this tension itself gives voice to a theological affirmation of God’s capacity for mercy. This theological articulation, moreover, also facilitates the prophet’s parallel exhortation to seek that mercy through repentance.</p>

<title>The Existence of God</title>
<p>John Hick, <italic>Between Faith and Doubt</italic> (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010. £12.99. pp. 176. ISBN 978-0-230-25167-0).</p>
<p>This is an intriguing book. Hick has constructed a series of imaginary dialogues on the nature of religion and religions and, ultimately, the question of the existence of God. In the dialogues with ‘David’ (naturalistic counter to Hick), he discusses topics such as: God’s existence; religious experience, neuroscience; suffering and wickedness and life after death. The discussions are very well written and wrestle with many of the major questions and possible solutions to these questions, in a very sophisticated and thought provoking way. A good example is his defence of the principle of free will and free decision-making against the claims of determinism. Hick also draws from his own personal experiences, including religious experiences, and from an enviable erudition in the study of religion, to articulate a personal creed. He appears to have moved from the Christian fundamentalism of his youth to a set of beliefs that are closer to a fusion of aspects of Hinduism and Buddhism – he believes in many gods who are closer to angels or Hindu gods and is sympathetic to a Buddhist reincarnation. While many readers may not share this position, they will appreciate Hick’s positive view of the propensity of religion to act for good and to provide insights into deeper realities.</p>

<p>The device of describing a ruined city inhabited only by wild animals is not limited to the oracles against the nations contained in Zephaniah, but can also be found in several other prophets’ oracles against the nations, including Isaiah 13:20-22 (against Babylon), Isaiah 34:11-15 (against Edom), and Jeremiah 50:39 (against Babylon).</p>

<p>A survey of published translations of the book of Zephaniah highlights the problematic task of identifying the particular animals described in this oracle. What the NRSV translates as ‘desert owl’ is also rendered ‘pelican’ (NASB) and ‘vulture’ (RSV). Also, presenting a more striking divergence, that which the NRSV translates as ‘screech owl’ is also rendered ‘hedgehog’ (NASB, RSV, ESV). Such distinctions may appear somewhat trivial, but can in fact appreciably affect the image. The description of scavenger birds, as in the RSV rendering ‘vulture,’ might suggest the presence of Ninevite corpses. Moreover, if the prophet intends to depict aquatic birds, as Paul Haupt argued in 1920, then the image of judgment markedly transforms. Favouring the translations ‘pelican’ and ‘bittern,’ Haupt concluded, ‘If pelicans and bitterns are found in Antioch, it shows that the former glory of the city is buried in a swamp: the columns of the palaces are submerged, so that only the capitals are visible’ (Paul Haupt, “Pelican and Bittern,” <italic>Journal of Biblical Literature</italic>, Vol. 39, No. 3/4 (1920): 160). The credibility of Haupt’s suggestion is eroded by the fact that the oracle also describes Nineveh as ‘a <italic>dry</italic> waste like the <italic>desert</italic>’ (2:13), yielding a notably unwatery scene, yet his argument nonetheless shows how weighty interpretive implications may indeed be attached to these translational issues.</p>
