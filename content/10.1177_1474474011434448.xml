<p>This volume brings together recent work on the geographies of rhythm, written in light of Henri Lefebvre’s late writings on rhythmanalysis, to think through themes of nature, place, mobilities, and bodies. Though not a book <italic>on</italic> Lefebvre, the contributors variously make use of and extend Lefebvre’s insights in a variety of contexts, from urban public space to specific mobile practices to human-animal relations to film and performance. As such, Lefebvre’s ideas, particularly his central concern for how rhythms act in a normative capacity to produce specific spatio-temporal orders but in a way that is only ever partial and so susceptible to change or subversion, act as an orientating refrain. This means that despite the aforementioned diversity of topics engaged, the volume maintains an impressive level of cohesion throughout.</p>
<p>Following Edensor’s introduction, which outlines the central themes of Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis by way of a wide-ranging review of a variety of ways in which rhythms are of distinct socio-cultural, political and economic significance, the book is sub-divided into five parts. Part 1 examines the intersections of rhythms, places, and power to show how the rhythmic characters of specific places are produced and also manipulated for a variety of (often economic) ends. Following this, Part 2 outlines how a range of ‘other’ rhythms can exist out of joint with the dominant rhythms and routines of modern society. Part 3 focuses on how mobile polyrhythms are choreographed to produce (dominant) routinized rhythms, but also how these rhythms are experienced and manipulated by specific users or are shot through with arrhythmic relations where such ordered unfolding might come undone. Part 4 illustrates how performing bodies are trained in such a way that they become synchronized and harmonized with the rhythms of other more-than human bodies and materialities, their learned movements becoming a second nature. Finally, Part 5 focuses on the persistent significance of (socio-)natural rhythms for social life and the ‘patterning’ of the everyday.</p>
<p>While the various contributions to the volume collectively present a wide-ranging and nuanced attempt to <italic>do</italic> rhythmanalysis, given Lefebvre’s elusiveness when it came to matters of the methods, the question of how the contributors actually did their analyses – and specifically how their focus on rhythm affected the selection of their methods/methodologies (or not) – could have, perhaps, been brought more to the fore. Nonetheless, the volume will make interesting and engaging reading for those interested in the geographies of everyday life, mobility, practice, embodied experience, and beyond, and no doubt provide substantial inspiration for future research on the importance of rhythms to understandings of the dynamic and ongoing production of places.</p>
