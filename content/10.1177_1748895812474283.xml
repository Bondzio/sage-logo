<abstract>
<p>In British politics, it is clear that the idea of the ‘Big Society’ encompasses many aspects of state activity and civil society, including the work of constabularies. Implications of ideas related to the Big Society implemented in police policy and practice, particularly in the area of police race relations, are considered in this article. No matter what changes that may take place, they will be mediated by the police occupational culture, which itself might be changed by Big Society ideas and concurrent, significant cuts to police budgets. The article begins with a consideration of whether we adequately understand how police organizations change. Janet Chan’s use of Bourdieu’s ideas on the relationship between ‘field’ and ‘habitus’ is criticized. In light of this discussion, the article considers aspects of police race relations. In particular, the implications of ‘seeing like a citizen’ and ‘participative policing’, Big Society ideas identified by Martin Innes, are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Britain, the notion of the ‘Big Society’ finds expression within many aspects of the present coalition government’s policies. This does not mean that it is a clearly defined concept, applied to discrete areas of policy. The Big Society is better understood as an assemblage of related ideas with the potential to inform the strategic direction of many policies, including those concerned with policing. Despite its somewhat nebulous character, the Big Society is nevertheless significant for an understanding of contemporary change within state institutions like the police. Indeed, some have argued that it articulates the present government’s understanding of the fundamental relationship between citizens and the State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895812474283">Glasman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, aspects of the Big Society of relevance to policing are analysed. The analytical standpoint adopted places the occupational culture of the police rank and file central to any understanding of policy as it is translated from its written form into action. No matter how imprecise or refined policies related to the Big Society <italic>might</italic> be, it is necessary to understand them as they are refracted through the values, beliefs and attitudes that form and sustain the rank and file occupational culture. One important consequence of this view is that written policy is understood as analytically distinct from policy implemented by officers as they undertake their work.</p>
<p>For this article, the area of policing chosen to explore how ‘Big Society’ ideas might be refracted through the occupational culture is police race relations; more precisely, how officers relate to people from minority ethnic groups in neighbourhoods and the nature of relations between police officers from minority and majority ethnic backgrounds. The analysis presented is necessarily speculative since the Big Society is more a collection of ideas than a clearly defined policy for police work scrutinized by parliament, or any other institution, and implemented in all constabularies. The evidence underpinning the argument draws on systematic criminological research rather than data from, for example, an evaluation of a specific, new policy based on Big Society ideas.</p>
<p>Ideas about the Big Society have been introduced into policies within a context of deep-cutting public sector cuts affecting all 43 constabularies in England and Wales. The government Spending Review of October 2010 imposed a 20 per cent cut in police funding by 2014–2015, with consequences for all aspects of work, including police race relations. This does not require an analysis strongly framed by political economy but it does point to a need to consider how budget cuts might have a restrictive impact on aspects of police race relations, the implementation of Big Society ideas and, crucially, the ways in which the occupational culture has structured police practice.</p>
<p>The article begins with a discussion of the importance of understanding the occupational culture within an analysis of changes to police policy and concurrent practices. It then moves to consider more closely the notion of the Big Society and its implications for policing. Race relations within constabularies and between constabularies and citizens are then considered within the context of the Big Society. The focus of this section ranges from the practical consequences of policy development and implementation to more abstract questions about how officers might understand and respond to minority ethnic views about policing. Throughout, the article explores the nature and extent of change within constabularies as ideas informing new government policy are articulated.</p>

<title>Understanding Change in Constabularies</title>
<p>Early studies of the police occupational culture described and analysed rank-and-file officers’ beliefs, attitudes and related actions when considering and implementing policy and law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895812474283">Banton, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895812474283">Cain, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895812474283">Chatterton, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895812474283">Manning, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895812474283">Skolnick, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895812474283">Westley, 1970</xref>). One consequence of this considerable body of ethnographic research was that it became possible to argue that ‘law and policy as they are written’ are conceptually distinct from ‘law and policy in action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895812474283">Barrett and Fudge, 1981</xref>: 12). An assumption that new government or local level policies have their intended impact, or that wider socio-economic change leads clearly or directly to related changes of police rank-and-file ideas and/or actions, became highly questionable.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895812474283">Janet Chan (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895812474283">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895812474283">2007</xref>) has critically engaged with this early research. Chan questioned the homogeneity of the occupational culture and, to use a rather seasoned concept, its hegemonic grip on the practice of police work. She argued that officers had been portrayed as people who behave rather than act, and raised important questions about the ability of past analyses to explain change in constabularies, not least their capacity to situate the occupational culture within shifting political and socio-economic circumstances.</p>
<p>Chan then proposed answers to the critical questions she raised, employing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895812474283">Bourdieu’s (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895812474283">1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895812474283">1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895812474283">Wacquant, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895812474283">1992</xref>) notions of ‘field’ and ‘habitus’. Cutting short a discussion of Bourdieu’s work, ‘field’ is, ‘a structured system of social positions – occupied either by individuals or institutions – the nature of which defines the situation for their occupants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895812474283">Jenkins, 1992</xref>: 85). Within the field, power, authority and access to goods or resources (capital) are of importance. ‘Habitus’ is more concerned with social practices and what we take for granted about the social world. Here, forms of interaction, style, inflection, presentations of oneself, the information on which they are based and many other aspects of social relationships are of significance. From this very brief description of two of Bourdieu’s principal concepts, the relevance of his work to understanding ways in which change in the wider social order (the field), which for this article are the recent public sector cuts and the Big Society, relate to change in the rank and file occupational culture (the habitus) becomes apparent.</p>
<p>Scrutiny of Chan’s use of Bourdieu’s ideas, however, poses questions that beg further examination, not least about our understanding of change within constabularies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 2009</xref>). It is by no means clear what Bourdieu meant when he argued that there is a relationship between changes in the ‘field’ and, consequentially, in the ‘habitus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895812474283">Jenkins, 1992</xref>). My own view is that he offered a variant of the fundamental problem of ‘structure’ and ‘agency’ based on the duality of those concepts and, arguably but by no means certainly, an emphasis on human creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895812474283">Wacquant, 1992</xref>). That changes the language we use when debating and writing about the police and other criminological subjects but gets us no further as far as an analysis of change within the occupational culture is concerned.</p>
<p>Chan did not rely solely on Bourdieu’s work. She also considered a body of organizational theory that draws attention to different types of knowledge and information found within organizations and, more fundamentally, to actors’ ‘sense making’, which qualified Bourdieu’s over-deterministic view of the relationship between ‘field’ and ‘habitus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895812474283">Chan, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895812474283">2007</xref>). This was valuable as a framework for the analysis of change within police occupational cultures but did not draw further understanding of the issue to a close. Recent studies of the police occupational culture have revealed resilience rather than change as one of its fundamental features, suggesting that the acceptance of Chan’s critique of the occupational culture is less secure than has been assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895812474283">Loftus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895812474283">McCarthy, 2012</xref>; see for a wider critique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 2009</xref>). We remain with an expectation but no guarantee of change in the occupational culture as the ideas that inform the Big Society are implemented.</p>

<title>Recent Research on Police Culture</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895812474283">Bethan Loftus’s (2009)</xref> recent participant observation study in Northshire Police demonstrates that features of the occupational culture documented during more than 25 years of ethnographic research remain within constabularies. She also describes new, important features of the occupational culture: an emphasis on social class and the related policing of young, lower class men; compliance with domestic violence policy and with aspects of race and diversity policies; and a diminished expression of overt racial prejudice and discrimination. These are important changes but, as Loftus points out, they should be placed within an analysis that emphasizes the endurance rather than the impermanency of core features of the occupational culture. The importance of an abiding occupational culture remains for analyses of change within constabularies.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that Loftus’s research (and others) is not based on an assumption that the occupational culture is static. What might be called ‘core’ beliefs, values, attitudes and related actions, revealed in a long-standing tradition of research about the police, seem to abide. Changes to the occupational culture are crafted in relation to this somewhat unyielding core. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895812474283">Daniel McCarthy (2012)</xref> has recently illustrated this point in an article about women police officers working within multi-agency teams. He argues that these officers agree to practices of police work termed ‘soft policing’. They accept, for example, the premises of a framework of ideas and practices more concerned with preventative policing dealing with young offenders and their families than with a notion of firm law-enforcement as the dominant, commonsense stance. Although their ideas and practices are not in accord with many aspects of the occupational culture, McCarthy argues that these officers are not marginalized by a prevailing occupational culture within which masculine ideas about aggressive policing dominate. This, however, does not mean that the officers created an alternative occupational culture. Instead they presented ‘soft policing’ in ways clearly informed by the core of the occupational culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895812474283">McCarthy (2012</xref>: 15) notes,<disp-quote>
<p>The police are not agents resistant to ‘soft-style’ policies per se, but rather careful in the ways they package and channel this type of response into acceptable cultural mentalities. The conveyance through pragmatic and mission orientations of police culture are key ways this can take place, arguing that it is not that ‘soft’ policing is necessarily viewed in negative ways within the police organisation, but rather that it creates a fundamental tension within its cultural acceptability as a symbolic attribute of conventional police work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the multi-agency team in which soft policing was embedded had existed for a decade or longer, officers still employed presentational tactics that resonated with the core of the occupational culture. McCarthy is careful to avoid essentialist ideas but his finding is that the soft policing he documented was confined to a small group of women officers working in a particular organizational niche. His research, not least when it is related to Loftus’s study, suggests the resilience of the core of the occupational culture as well as the importance of more peripheral ways in which officers craft alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Core features of the occupational culture are those most likely to mediate Big Society or any other novel policies. We should therefore continue to understand them as elements of a lens through which rank-and-file officers view the world and their work and, therefore, through which ideas about and actions related to the ‘Big Society’ are mediated. Further, they allow officers to make sense of that world and their work, offering a certainty in the highly discretionary, craft-like practice that is policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895812474283">Skolnick, 1966</xref>).</p>
<p>What, then, were the enduring, core features of the occupational culture that Loftus identified and are of relevance to the Big Society? First, she identified officers’ suspicion of and cynicism about the population they police and of particular places and events. The fundamental assumption is that citizens’ requests for a police service are not sufficient to merit their recognition as a priority. Rather, the police view of priorities is superior and a starting point for assessing public claims for police service.</p>
<p>Second, and related, there is implicit opposition between the police and the public. For officers, ‘We’ the police work in spite of and often against ‘Them’, the public. Policing is fundamentally not a shared enterprise. Further, rank-and-file cynicism extends to senior officers’ development of policy. Loftus documented how officers view such developments as rather slavish compliance with government and other directives and an intrusion into ‘practical police work’. Policies informed by the notion of the Big Society – increased recruitment of police volunteers and special constables, extending and giving greater priority to partnerships with public sector and voluntary agencies working in the police sphere – need to be placed within the context of rank-and-file scepticism as they are implemented in routine police work.</p>
<p>Third, crime rather than a focus upon wider concerns about order expressed by and apparent within communities remains prominent in Loftus’s findings about the occupational culture. On the basis of this rank-and-file perspective the Big Society, which places an emphasis on police responses to the views of local residents, could influence some aspects of crime reduction but the planning and implementation of responsive neighbourhood policing strategies and tactics to tackle other aspects of perceived disorder do not resonate so clearly with officers (see Bullock and Leeney, this volume).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895812474283">Loftus (2009</xref>: 191) summarized a key point of her findings like this:<disp-quote>
<p>It has not been my intention to simply duplicate the clichés of police culture. However, there unequivocally remains a range of dispositions and practices which mirror a whole history of earlier research. It is clear. In other words, long-standing, defining elements of police culture have extended into the contemporary policing landscape.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Policing, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895812474283">Skolnick (1966)</xref> put it long ago, remains a craft rather than a formal exercise of the implementation of law, rules related to policy or ‘best practice’. It is a craft based, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895812474283">Loftus (2009</xref>: 200) put it, on ‘dispositions and practices’ found in the occupational culture. Big Society ideas may change when refracted through the occupational culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1748895812474283">
<title>The Big Society</title>
<p>As argued earlier, the Big Society is an assemblage of ideas aimed at addressing a societal context identified by Prime Minister David Cameron during the 2010 election campaign and the initial months of the Coalition government. One of the central ideas is a fundamental rebalancing of the power of the State over public services and citizens’ lives. Cameron argued that previous Labour governments had set an increasing number of targets for public sector institutions to meet – to which the needs of citizens were subordinate. For example, chief constables were set numerous targets covering all areas of police work. Constabularies’ duties were directed by Whitehall through the requirement to meet targets and to measure outcomes of their work, including public satisfaction with police services in neighbourhoods. For Cameron, officers working in neighbourhoods had not been required to listen to expressions of local people’s needs and respond to them. Government direction of local policy spanned the work of many key services, leaving people feeling powerless to change their own lives or the society around them, a feeling buttressed by the crash of banks and other financial institutions in which they had previously placed trust. Cameron identified a public mood of anger, estrangement and powerlessness which he sought to address through the rhetoric of the Big Society.</p>
<p>The Labour peer and academic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895812474283">Maurice Glasman (2010)</xref>, has summarized ideas embodied by the Big Society as being ‘civic responsibility’, with a related notion of ‘the active citizen’ involved in determining the nature and delivery of local services. Social entrepreneurs are offered opportunities to deliver services to replace or, more likely, supplement state services, with some pump priming funds provided by a Big Society bank. A stress on ‘localism’ allows local councils and community organizations to make decisions about local services and significantly influence their work. Finally, an ‘organic mutualism’ binds together and, once realized, energizes citizens to foster local power and control over public services for the common good. The ‘active citizen’ is at the centre of the Big Society.</p>
<p>Such ideas are in many ways not novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895812474283">Kisby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895812474283">Smith, 2010</xref>). Although more radical than the previous Labour government’s view, the focus on localism, for example, has been a recurring feature of police policy. McLaughlin has analysed this theme, charting New Labour’s policing policies as they have moved from central direction to, in 2004, incorporating a stress on responding to citizens’ needs through the introduction of local Neighbourhood Policing Teams and the involvement of a range of local authority agencies within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895812474283">McLaughlin, 2005</xref>). In language that resonates with that of the Big Society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895812474283">McLaughlin (2005</xref>: 483) notes, ‘The Neighbourhood Policing Teams are working on the premise that active consent and legitimacy can be constructed and maintained from a multitude of positive everyday interactions between officers and citizens.’ The notion of active citizens who play a greater part in service planning and delivery, which is central to the Big Society, continues rather than disrupts policy.</p>
<p>Importantly, Big Society policies have been embedded within a context of significant public sector budget reductions. Indeed, the very notion of the Big Society may seek to mask the State’s reduction of or withdrawal from central areas of public policy (see Reiner, this volume). Whatever the rationale – implicit, explicit or diversionary – once Big Society ideas are brought into the realm of cuts to police budgets some common themes of direct relevance to police policy and practice can be found.</p>
<p>Based on his analysis of policy documents and extensive research on neighbourhood policing, Martin Innes has identified three central themes of the ‘Big Society’ of direct relevance to policing. They flow from fundamental ideas underpinning the Big Society – ‘civic responsibility’, ‘social entrepreneurship’, ‘localism’ and ‘mutualism’ – and are summarized as ‘seeing like a citizen’; ‘participative policing’; and ‘see-through services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895812474283">Innes, 2010</xref>). Each of these key themes implies changes for policing, not least change to the occupational culture and, therefore, to what Loftus called officers’ practices and sensibilities as they work in localities. Two of the themes, ‘participative policing’ and ‘see-through services’ are of particular importance for this article and in what follows they will be further analysed, employing police race relations as an area of police work within which they can be explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1748895812474283">
<title>‘Participative Policing’</title>
<p>The notion of ‘participative policing’ has a variety of meanings within the Big Society. It mainly relates to the ideal that people will work as volunteers in local services, strengthening their identities as active citizens. As far as policing is concerned, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has largely interpreted participative policing as the use of volunteers in police work, especially special constables and as police staff volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895812474283">Thornton, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895812474283">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is doubtful if large numbers of minority ethnic people have recently enlisted as special constables or as police staff volunteers. Certainly, minority ethnic people in the UK are less likely to volunteer formally than their ethnic majority peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895812474283">Department for Communities and Local Government, 2011</xref>: 33) and there are differences in levels of volunteering within and between different minority ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895812474283">Department for Communities and Local Government, 2011</xref>: 80). Interestingly, those who say their ethnicity is important to their sense of self are less likely to volunteer than those who do not think it is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895812474283">Department for Communities and Local Government, 2011</xref>: 36). In a Home Office research study examining minority ethnic volunteering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895812474283">Gaskin (2003</xref>: 7) found that formal volunteering is less relevant to minority ethnic groups who instead ‘help out’ or ‘lend a hand’. Volunteering is understood as a formal career matter.</p>
<p>These findings do not mean that recruiting minority ethnic people as volunteers is something constabularies cannot pursue. It simply informs us that the task is likely to be a difficult one. The extent to which people identify with their local community and are willing to engage in local, voluntary initiatives also differs greatly. Those living in high crime areas might not have the resources and/or will to engage with the police and related agencies in order to enhance the safety of their area. Voluntary organizations within high crime areas are likely to be hard-pressed to continue their work in the context of government cuts and therefore have a limited capacity to stimulate new work related to policing.</p>
<p>Come what may, and more importantly, one of the undoubted concerns of minority ethnic people about policing has not been access to volunteering but the low number of minority ethnic recruits into constabularies, their retention and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895812474283">Home Office, 2011</xref>). Integral to this concern has been suspicion about racial prejudice and discrimination within the police workforce, a suspicion that has been verified by the findings of industrial tribunals, research studies and analyses of officers’ experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895812474283">2010</xref>). Crucially, manifestations of racial prejudice and discrimination within the police have entered the collective memory of many black and minority ethnic people. Although, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895812474283">Loftus’s (2009)</xref> work on the occupational culture and Holdaway’s recent research about Black Police Associations found, forms of prejudice and discrimination have changed, a vivid memory of overt racism remains as if it is in the present moment.</p>
<p>For over a decade, many constabularies have organized highly creative initiatives to encourage minority ethnic people to consider a police career. That work, however, cannot continue because, at the time of writing, the vast majority of constabularies have a recruitment freeze in place. Full-time constables are not being recruited, and recruitment of Police Community Support Officers, many of whom use their employment as a taster before applying to become a full-time constable, is either non-existent or restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895812474283">Johnston, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895812474283">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895812474283">2007</xref>). Instead, many constabularies have been promoting the recruitment of special constables. It is likely that recruits to the special constabulary will have their eyes on the restoration of full recruitment to the police service and use their volunteering as an enhancement of their eventual application. Indeed, many constabularies are requiring prospective officers to volunteer as special constables or as police staff volunteers before they apply for permanent positions. But how might that situation seem to a member of an ethnic minority who is wary about applying to a constabulary because they are concerned about prejudice and/or discrimination? It could seem that the widespread recruitment freeze has placed an additional hurdle in their way. Special constables work during their free time, for no remuneration and on rather routine duties. Determined recruits might persevere but those who have been previously attracted through recruitment initiatives for minority ethnic officers and other positive actions will no longer be targeted by constabularies.</p>
<p>A further feature of the Big Society is the abandonment of constabulary ethnic minority recruitment targets set by the Home Office. This is one aspect of the relinquishing of Home Office control of policing in favour of local governance by Police and Crime Commissioners, who should be more responsive to local citizens’ views about policing. Recruitment targets were introduced by the Labour government as part of their response to the Lawrence Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895812474283">Macpherson of Cluny, 1999</xref>), and required chief officers to enhance the recruitment of ethnic minorities. Elected Police and Crime Commissioners, as proposed by the Coalition government and introduced in November 2012, will be able to set targets for all areas of their constabulary’s work, drawing on evidence gathered locally and it is conceivable that they will set targets for enhancing the recruitment of minority ethnic officers. It seems unlikely, however, that minority ethnic recruitment will be <italic>central</italic> to a Commissioner’s election platform or claims for re-election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895812474283">2</xref></sup> The priority given to these issues will depend on a potential Commissioner’s sensitivity to the views of minority ethnic people; the extent to which minority ethnic groups can influence decisions by Commissioners; and the priorities of chief officers facing deep-cutting budget cuts.</p>
<p>One largely unintended consequence of some minority ethnic recruitment initiatives has been to foster improved and to manage existing relationships with minority ethnic groups. Recruiting caravans and stalls held in public locations serve as places where concerns about routine policing might be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 1991</xref>). Recruitment programmes in schools, for example, could include more general discussions about the nature of policing and its local delivery. For chief officers with a strategic approach to race relations, such positive initiatives were also an important aspect of building wider relationships between a constabulary and its minority ethnic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895812474283">Cashmore, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895812474283">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895812474283">Holdaway and Barron, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895812474283">Stone and Tuffin, 2000</xref>). Concern for race and ethnic relations within constabularies had an impact on relationships between constabularies and their minority ethnic communities. Any reduction of initiatives aimed at enhancing recruitment from minority ethnic groups could have an unanticipated impact on the overall quality of policing of minority ethnic communities and serve to reduce their involvement in ‘participative policing’.</p>
<p>The implications of the recruitment situation might also affect serving minority ethnic officers’ views. Routine resignations could reduce their number and, in constabularies with small numbers, further diminish the presence of ethnic minority officers. Those currently serving might find themselves with less support and become concerned about the erosion of what had been a perhaps small but important flow of ethnic peers into their constabularies.</p>
<p>Loftus’s research about the resilience of core features of the occupational culture informs us that cynicism is likely to frame majority ethnic officers’ perceptions of opportunities to increase recruitment to the special constabulary. Volunteers, as far as they are of relevance to minority ethnic groups, are unlikely to be of particular interest to serving officers, save that they are breaching a gap in service that should properly be performed by full-time staff. Rather than chime with ideas about public participation in services, which is central to the Big Society, police volunteers of any type strengthen existing rather than changing rank-and-file ideas about how officers and volunteers can work together in novel ways. Maybe the presence of volunteers is understood as assistance that helps officers focus upon their priority, which is crime control. If so, a separation rather than melding of police and public participation in police work may be encouraged by the Big Society.</p>
<p>Within this recruitment context, Black Police (and similar) Associations (BPAs) might extend their work on behalf of minority ethnic officers and staff. Sustained funding will be required if these groups are to continue and extend their work, including the development of new relationships with Police and Crime Commissioners, as well as retaining relations with chief officers. Research has demonstrated that chairs and secretaries of BPAs valued duty time officially set aside for their association work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>BPAs take different stances towards their chief officers. Some are primarily concerned with support rather than advocacy. Others (most in fact) have secured seats at key policy tables and are consulted routinely about many aspects of police work. The stress on localism embedded in the Big Society may bring BPAs more centrally into consultations about the confidence of minority communities in their local constabulary, which might also include representing the views of people from their own ethnic groups. BPAs would then extend and maybe strengthen their role as a social movement within a constabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812474283">Holdaway, 2009</xref>). This could create alliances with groups representing minority ethnic communities and the lobbying of commissioners and chief officers. BPAs have not been slow to use the press when problems have arisen and, if commissioners are not receptive to their views, tension may come to characterize relationships within constabularies. The ways in which BPAs are understood by commissioners and, maybe, differently by chief officers seems important, with consequences for race relations within constabularies and between constabularies and wider communities. The emphasis on localism that is central to the Big Society might therefore provide BPAs with an enhanced role as a conduit between a commissioner and minority ethnic populations living in a constabulary area.</p>
<p>This idea, however, presents difficulties. There is an assumption that the occupational culture of the police service is sufficiently malleable for officers to accommodate and respond to public views, and to change their ways of working. It assumes that community views are rather straightforward and, indeed, that minority ethnic communities speak with a more or less unified voice conveyed by a local association in which they have confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895812474283">Hughes and Rowe, 2007</xref>). In our major cities people identify with many different minority ethnic groups and groups within them. Some minority communities are influenced significantly by religious beliefs and enter the local political arena to represent their faith community. Ethnic politics, often related to local religious affiliations, are now an important aspect of the governance of some inner city areas. This presents difficulties for officers who need to understand a wide tapestry of views found in a locality.</p>
<p>Further, the notion of police services responding to what are identified as public needs raises difficult, abiding questions about justice and fairness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895812474283">Manning, 2011</xref>). Local needs can be partial, implying negative, discriminatory policing. They can benefit a large minority with an articulate voice or based on officers’ assumptions about appropriate policing that, on closer analysis, sustain unjust inequalities. Neighbourhood policing of the type I have outlined may appear attractive because it responds to public views. Public views, however, can lead, sometimes directly and sometimes slowly and subtly, to unfairness and injustice. The concern is that, reacting to – and to some extent dependent for re-election on their response to – popular views about crime and disorder, Police and Crime Commissioners will not pay sufficient attention to how police policy and officers’ practices can sustain and reinforce structural inequalities. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895812474283">Peter Manning (2011)</xref> has reminded us recently, we need constantly to ask about the moral, political and ethical limitations that should be placed upon policing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1748895812474283">
<title>Seeing Like a Citizen</title>
<p>A further keynote of the ‘Big Society’ is that public accountability becomes central to the governance, management and delivery of public services. The thinking informing these ideas includes the notion that public services, policing being one, need to respond more directly to public views about the types of services required and how they are delivered. Managers of policy and practice have, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895812474283">Innes’s (2010</xref>: 25) words, to ‘see like a citizen’.</p>
<p>This idea is by no means new. We have noted that it is a theme woven more or less securely through years of policy development. Indeed, writing in the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> (2011) Chief Constable Sara Thornton, ACPO’s spokesperson on the Big Society, has suggested that this contemporary policy idea resonates one of Peel’s founding principles: the police are of the people. This is a rather simplistic analysis. Something far more radical is expected of contemporary policing than Peel’s view that the police are drawn from the public. One key requirement of police within the Big Society is fostering the ability to ‘see like a citizen’.</p>
<p>The notion that the police can ‘see like a citizen’ presents difficult epistemological problems for social science. The extent to which one accepts realism as a philosophical basis for social science research is central here but, without engaging in a detailed argument about realism’s inadequacy, there are long-standing arguments about how understanding others’ social worlds through methods of research that draw on the natural sciences is naive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895812474283">Hope, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895812474283">Rock, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895812474283">Winch, 1958</xref>). Questionnaires and other formal instruments of data collection are not sufficient to document contextualized processes through which relationships and the meaning of phenomena are created, sustained and changed. Methods informed by phenomenalist theory, allowing closer engagement with and in others’ worlds, are required if research findings are to be adequate at the level of meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895812474283">Blumer, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895812474283">1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748895812474283">Weber, 1949</xref>).</p>
<p>Following on from this view, police priorities and related policy for, say, neighbourhood policing based on the analysis of quantitative data from public surveys are likely to be imprecise, a starting rather than an end point for policy development. More importantly, meetings with different groups living and working in local areas need to probe more precisely the meaning of the data gathered and the contexts within which they become relevant. Some constabularies contract firms to undertake focus groups to assist their work about policing priorities, which might assist clarity of purpose. They also hold public consultative groups in neighbourhoods, and will be required to do so more frequently by legislation related to implementing the Big Society. Public consultative meetings, however, are not particularly well attended and those who do attend them tend not to be representative of the wider population (and see Bullock and Leeney, this volume). We know from one recent survey that just 42 per cent of people <italic>would</italic> (not <italic>do</italic>) attend a regular meeting with their neighbourhood policing team and it is reasonable to suppose that at least 10 per cent of that percentage might not attend on any one occasion or at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895812474283">Institute for Public Policy Research, 2010</xref>). We also know that officers’ priorities are frequently not focused upon those of the citizens they police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895812474283">Loftus, 2009</xref>). There are sound intellectual and practical, policy-related reasons to doubt the possibility of ‘seeing like a citizen’ through existing forums.</p>
<p>For ethnic minority groups, the general background to attendance at meetings is a sharper perception of the likelihood of crime victimization than that of their white peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895812474283">Home Office, 2010a</xref>). Further, ethnic minority groups have a lower (albeit relatively high) level of confidence in the police compared to their ethnic majority peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895812474283">Home Office, 2010b</xref>). These findings, however, do not provide us with a particularly precise indication of minority ethnic groups’ views about specific incidents of which they have direct knowledge and about which they might want to consult and influence a Commissioner. Indeed, some British Crime Survey findings point to important areas of concern. When asked about ‘their emotional response’ to being stopped or stopped and searched by a police officer, black and ethnic minority respondents showed greater concern (and often anger) than those from the ethnic majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895812474283">Home Office, 2005</xref>). Less confidence and satisfaction seems to be forthcoming from black and ethnic minority groups when they are asked questions about specific policing incidents in which they have been involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895812474283">Wortley and Owusu-Bempah, 2009</xref>). The suggestion, then, is that data about general subjects are not sufficient for police officers to ‘see like a citizen’ and respond appropriately.</p>
<p>Further difficulties related to ‘seeing like a citizen’ arise from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895812474283">Holdaway’s (2009)</xref> study of Black Police Associations. During that research, the chairs and secretaries of BPAs were asked to cite particular examples of institutional racism. Virtually all of them referred to a personal experience and an incident that occurred a number of years before the interview was conducted; indeed, before the notion of institutional racism entered policy discourses in England. The inference is that, when asked questions about particular experiences of policing perceived to be discriminatory, black people might well be drawing on a memory of discrimination that lives vibrantly in the present.</p>
<p>A related point is that BPA officials reported that what they called ‘overt racism’ had given way to ‘covert racism’ in constabularies, a phenomenon that is only adequately perceived and understood by black officers. White people’s tone of voice, their demeanour, the ways in which they asked subtle questions that are presented neutrally but in fact probe racial differences between those communicating and other subtle clues, identified covert racism.</p>
<p>Officers working in neighbourhoods and talking to black and other ethnic minority people about policing needs have to be sensitive to views like those expressed by BPA officials. It could be argued that black officers might play a key role deciphering black and other minority ethnic communities’ essential sentiments but there is no evidence to suggest that black officers generally or BPA members wish to be seen to be specialists in the liaison required, although many BPAs do work with local community associations. The emphasis of work with community associations is to form and sustain relationships that offer channels of communication when things go wrong; to support black youth living in high crime areas; and to advocate on behalf of communities but to do that as an adjunct to and at something of a distance from rather than close to and on behalf of their constabulary.</p>
<p>These points suggest that ‘seeing like a citizen’ presents many difficulties to the police: there are more! As part of his research on the Prevent Programme, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895812474283">Martin Innes (2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895812474283">Innes et al., 2011</xref>) analysed how different approaches to the policing of extremism in communities led to particular relationships with members of the public.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748895812474283">3</xref></sup> Recognizing that neighbourhood policing does not share all of the characteristics of the policing of political and religious extremism, there is nevertheless a strong argument that extreme situations are a litmus test for understanding the routine. One of Innes’s key findings was that a policing style open about its intentions, in this case the policing of extremism and terrorism, found real benefits when the state police allowed citizens to police their communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748895812474283">4</xref></sup> This did not give licence to vigilantes or to illegality. Rather, at times based on what Innes called ‘thin trust’ continuing, close contact with opinion formers and a wider community of people living in a locality were sufficient for officers to allow others to define policing priorities about extremism, including when and where officers should intervene. This allowed close relationships with people in localities, with sensitive dialogue and with implicit agreements about interventions based on trust. Crucially, it meant that officers were content to accept that they would <italic>not</italic> intervene in particular situations. The views and actions of those who could more appropriately ‘see like a citizen’ were placed in the ascendancy.</p>
<p>These findings are from research on specialist officers. My suggestion is that they indicate changes that could benefit neighbourhood policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895812474283">Innes, 2006</xref>). Authority given to communities by the Big Society programme, and the implications of cuts to the police budget, mean that tough and as yet largely unmade decisions about policing services that can and, more crucially, <italic>cannot</italic> be delivered at the neighbourhood level have to be made. While demand for policing services has always exceeded supply, decisions about what officers will not respond to have been more implicit than explicit (see Bullock and Leeney, this volume). The developing context of policing in the Big Society suggests that many more transparent decisions by chief officers about the services that will or will no longer be delivered in their constabulary area will have to be made public. This is a new aspect of policing, requiring a greater alignment of communities’ policing needs with the delivery of services and, crucially, an acceptance by rank and file officers that what they might regard as local policing priorities should be aligned very closely to those of people living in the areas they police, including, for the purposes of this article, localities in which people from minority ethnic groups live.</p>
<p>Difficult decisions about what are core and peripheral police services will be required during the last two of the four years of spending cuts (see Millie, Reiner, this volume). If ‘seeing like a citizen’ is to become a keynote of police policy and practice there is a need for the cynicism, the crime focus and the superiority of police over citizens’ views that continue to pervade the occupational culture to be tempered. We do not know but some officers working in neighbourhoods may already demonstrate this capacity that needs to be far more widespread if policing is to be aligned with the Big Society. ‘Seeing like a citizen’ and the Big Society present a huge challenge to chief and senior officers; crucially, they need to change the occupational culture.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Big Society ideas and reductions to the public sector budget are likely to have an impact on police race relations within constabularies and beyond. The freeze on recruitment has implications for the ethnic constitution of the police workforce; there is an emphasis on the use of police volunteers, including those from minority ethnic groups; and constabulary funding of Black Police Associations may change. A number of other changes have been discussed. Ideas related to the Big Society and fiscal constraints have led to changes to the organization of policing and to some new policies. To return to Chan, changes in the ‘field’ have led to changes of police organization and policy. That, however, is rather different from arguing that the Big Society has led to changes in ‘the habitus’. To use other, related concepts, changes to <italic>core</italic> features of the occupational culture which includes, as Loftus put it, officers’ ‘practices and sensibilities’ seem much more resistant to intended change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748895812474283">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Innes’s analysis of the Big Society identifies ‘participative policing’ and ‘seeing like a citizen’ as having important implications for police policy and practices. If they are to be implemented in practice these ideas require consideration of rank and file officers’ understandings of their work which, of course, returns us to the strictures of the occupational culture and, in Bourdieu’s language, ‘the habitus’. Here the relationship between ‘field’ and ‘habitus’ is very much less secure, suggesting that Chan’s critique begs further consideration. Certainly, some organizational and policy changes within constabularies are related to the budget cuts and to the implementation of Big Society ideas. The extent to which these ideas will lead to officers revising their understandings of public participation in policing and their ability to ‘see like a citizen’ is very much less certain. The argument of this article is that Big Society ideas that do not resonate with the core of the occupational culture will be refracted, sustaining rather than changing police practices.</p>
