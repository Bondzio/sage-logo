<abstract>
<p>In 2004, the authors completed the First World-Wide Failure Exercise dealing with benchmarking recognised failure criteria under two-dimensional, in-plane loadings. Based on the success and the lessons learnt, and using the same strategy, the authors have organised the ‘Second World-Wide Failure Exercise’. It aims at filling key gaps identified and establishing the status of 12 theoretical methods for predicting failure in fibre-reinforced composite materials subjected to three-dimensional or (triaxial) states of stress. This paper gives an account of the background to the Second World-Wide Failure Exercise, the process of completing the first part (Part A) and a summary of key conclusions.</p>

<p>Failure criteria and robust modelling capabilities for fibre-reinforced polymer composites are essential aids in the successful and efficient design of light weight structures. The authors, since 1992, began a series of coordinated studies (known as the ‘World-Wide Failure Exercise’ or ‘WWFE’) to provide a comprehensive description of the foremost failure theories for fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) laminates that were available at the time, a comparison of their predictive capabilities directly with each other, and a comparison of their predictive capabilities against experimental data. In the ‘exercise’, selected workers in the area of fibre composite failure theories, including leading academics and developers of software/numerical codes, were invited to submit papers to a strictly controlled format.</p>
<p>The First World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup> started in 1996 and came to a fruitful end in 2004 with the publication of a comprehensive reference book on failure criteria in fibre-reinforced polymer composites under two-dimensional (2D) stresses. It contained a detailed assessment of 19 theoretical approaches for predicting the deformation and failure response of polymer composite laminates when subjected to complex states of stress.</p>
<p>A strong feature in the exercise is that it involved those theoreticians and designers who originated the majority of the currently known failure theories. They described their design method in detail, indicated some of the limitations of their methods and specified steps to improve the predictive capability of their theories. The majority of the theory-originators attempted to provide a view and recommendations on how their methodology could be used in design applications. Each participating group was directed to comment only on their own theory thereby fulfilling one of the basic and important objectives of the exercise which was that the originators of the methods are best placed to provide a true and unambiguous interpretation of their own work, thereby eliminating and negating any second guessing by a third party. To this end, their recommendations have been focussed and targeted rendering them very useful indeed to those wishing to adopt one of the methodologies.</p>
<p>The participants employed a wide range of approaches, including micromechanics and finite element based methods, linear and nonlinear analyses, interactive and noninteractive theories, simple and complicated post failure progressive models, etc. The predictions from all the theories were compared with experimental results for 14 test cases, as described in Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup> Based on comparing the theoretical predictions of the 19 methods with a large number of test data, reaching 125 observations, it was possible to define the boundaries of predictability of the theories. A scoring system was used to illustrate how far the predictions deviated from the test data for all the 125 observations. Details of the scoring are found in Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The key findings that emerged from the first WWFE were:
<list id="list1-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Many of the current predictive theories have insufficient accuracy to be used as design tools and they require fundamental changes if they are ever to reach the requisite maturity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The better predictive theories exhibited acceptable accuracy in 75% of the test cases, thereby indicating that they could be used as design tools within certain limits.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In addition to the scoring schemes, recommendations were made as to bounds of applicability for each theory (ie those loading/laminate configurations conditions where the theory works well and those where it doesn’t). There was also the occasional lack of crucial experimental data that had some effects on achieving a complete validation and benchmarking of all the theories. These key experiments were identified and listed in Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup> and some work has commenced in various establishments to generate the missing data.</p>
<p>In summary, the first WWFE had focussed on the response of classical, continuous fibre, laminated, fibre-reinforced polymer composites subjected to in-plane biaxial loading situations, in the absence of stress concentrations. It proved to be a groundbreaking effort with many achievements:
<list id="list2-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It established, for the first time, an open and objective way of working in order to compare, contrast and challenge disparate theories from around the world.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It exposed the strengths and weaknesses of the current theories.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As a result of carrying out the first exercise, some 50% of the theories were improved and modified. In some cases, the modifications were made for the first time over 40 years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It provided a stimulus for researchers to build upon the accurate theoretical features whilst making improvements to deal with the shortfalls that were exposed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It highlighted gaps in experimental data and in theoretical understanding, and preliminary recommendations were made in terms of prioritisation and approach to their resolution.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It provided design engineers (the ultimate customers for such research knowledge) with recommendations on the preferred theories to use, together with evidence of the level of confidence and bounds of applicability.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Contrasting those achievements is the fact that the exercise did not address the maturity of failure criteria in the following two significant areas:
<list id="list3-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Area (1): The behaviour of materials under triaxial stresses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Area (2): Continuum damage mechanics, crack development and initiation of matrix-driven delamination.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As a result, and due to lack of robustness and uncertainty in the maturity of the current predictive models in those two areas, the authors launched two new exercises, referred to as:
<list id="list4-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The Second World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE-II), tackling Area (1) above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Third World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE-III), addressing Area (2) above.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This article is concerned with the process of conducting WWFE-II. Future publications are planned for describing WWFE-III.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998312449885"><title>The Second World-Wide Failure Exercise</title>
<p>As mentioned above, a high priority gap, identified in the first WWFE, was the need to examine the fidelity of failure theories when applied to components under 3D (i.e. triaxial) states of stress. A thorough understanding of the triaxial failure behaviour of composites is undoubtedly important in many scenarios and applications, including:
<list id="list5-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Thick and thin composite (e.g. aircraft wing skin, fuselage, lightweight fighting vehicles, rotor blades in wind turbines, helicopters and others),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Structures that are used in high pressure/high hydrostatic pressure situations (eg high performance pressure vessels, deep diving submersibles, sub-sea systems),</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bolted joints,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Indentations of shells and panels,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Impact and dynamic loadings and ballistic penetration,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Composite manufacturing, and thermal stress build-up.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>On a wider level, triaxial failure theories are important tools for providing a fundamental understanding of anisotropic metal forming, rock science and powder compaction technology, etc.</p>
<p>A full characterisation of composites requires a thorough understanding of the failure behaviour under a multiplicity of combined stress states. A general loading of a lamina involves the application of six different stress components, namely three direct stresses (<italic>σ</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>σ</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>σ</italic><sub>3</sub>) and three shear stresses (<italic>τ</italic><sub>12</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>13</sub>, <italic>τ</italic><sub>23</sub>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312449885">Figure 1</xref>, where directions 1, 2 and 3 refer to fibre direction, transverse direction and through-thickness direction. In the general case for anisotropic materials (e.g. composites), nine different strengths are normally required to characterise their overall behaviour under uniaxial loading, applied in the material’s principal axes.</p>
<p>Hence, a lamina could be subjected to one the following six general states of stress of increasing complexity:

<p>In total, 215 different sets of stresses may be applied to a lamina and these sets are distributed among the above six states of stresses as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312449885">Figure 2</xref>. The figure shows that there are 66 different combinations for State (4) and only 8 for State (6).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312449885">Figure 3</xref> shows the number of sets attempted in the first WWFE. One can clearly see that the WWFE-II challenge of characterising the 3D behaviour of a lamina (and that is before we extend to consider laminates) is significantly greater. The challenge is further increased by the relative lack of maturity of formal test methodologies for generating the 3D data – especially the out of plane (through thickness) components. Difficulties are normally encountered in obtaining all the required information from the tests. Consequently, accurate data representing the behaviour of composites under 3D states of stress are relatively scarce. As a direct consequence of the above deficiencies, reliable predictive methods, if any exist at all, have not been subjected to thorough benchmarking and remain largely invalidated.</p>
<p>In order to meet this need, the authors launched WWFE-II, in 2007, building upon and employing the principles established during the first WWFE, with the objective of extending the assessment of predictive failure criteria from 2D to 3D states of stress. In particular, the WWFE-II involves posing a set of challenging test cases to validate and benchmark the triaxial failure theories. The cases would cover the following areas:
<list id="list6-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Behaviour of an isotropic polymeric resin material, without fibres under triaxial loading.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Triaxial behaviour of a fibre-reinforced polymer Unidirectional (UD) lamina, made of various fibres and resins, including the resin as above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>3D and through-thickness strength and deformation behaviour of multi-directional laminates under various triaxial stresses.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The loadings considered include:
<list id="list7-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Effect of hydrostatic pressure on the tensile and compressive strength of an isotropic material (polymer).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Effect of hydrostatic pressure on the longitudinal (along the fibres) and transverse (perpendicular) tensile and compressive failure of a UD lamina and multi-directional laminates.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Effects of hydrostatic pressure on shear strength, shear strain and shear stress strain curves.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Effects of in-plane loading on the through- thickness shear.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Behaviour of composite laminates under through-thickness loadings.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<sec id="sec3-0021998312449885"><title>Description of the test cases</title>
<p>The test cases in WWFE-II have been chosen carefully to stretch each theory to the full, in order to shed light on their strengths and weaknesses. They are focused on a range of classical, continuous fibre, laminated, reinforced polymer composites subjected, in the absence of stress concentrations, to a variety of triaxial loading conditions. The key issues being explored are:
<list id="list8-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The means by which the theories distinguish (if at all) between the effects of anisotropy and heterogeneity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The types of failure mechanism employed and the way that each is implemented within any given theory.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The accuracy and bounds of applicability of each theory.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Twelve test cases were identified for the purpose (see Kaddour and Hinton<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312449885">2</xref></sup> for details). They employed five lay-ups: (1) a base resin with isotropic properties, (2) a unidirectional laminate, (3) a cross-ply laminate, (4) an angle-ply laminate and (5) a quasi-isotropic laminate.</p>
<p>Six different fibre/matrix combinations were used and these are: (1) an epoxy, (2) T300/epoxy, (3) E-glass/epoxy, (4) S-glass/epoxy, (5) A-S Carbon/epoxy and (6) IM7/8551 materials.

<list-item><p>Eight of the fifteen original participating groups accepted the invitation and have taken part in WWFE-II, thereby providing valuable continuity between the two exercises.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Seven of the original participating groups are not taking part in WWFE-II for the following reasons:

<list-item><p>Two groups, (those led by McCartney and Chamis respectively), are taking part in WWFE-III and therefore wished to concentrate their efforts on that.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The situation of the other three groups is as follows:

<list-item><p>Sun did not have time, due to heavy commitments and other duties.</p></list-item>

</list></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>With regard to Hart-Smith, his reasoning for not taking part is as follows:
<list id="list12-0021998312449885" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>He believes he has a criterion for fibre failure, as described in his contributions to the first exercise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>He does not have a criterion for matrix failure.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hart-Smith made attempts to team up with one of his colleagues, Gosse,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312449885">3</xref></sup> to subject a new criterion, known as the strain invariant failure theory (SIFT), to the benchmarking process identified in this exercise. However, he was unable to make successful communications with Gosse, who was the originator of SIFT. As a result, he made other attempts to work with another colleague from the Boeing Company and those attempts came to a halt as Hart-Smith retired from the Boeing Company.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The organisers had also invited other people who were thought to have worked on failure under 3D stresses. The total number of groups invited was around 60, covering academia, experimentalists, software houses, research institutes, and spread through-out the international community. More than a third agreed to take part, some of which then withdrew. Around a third declined to participate, due to a variety of reasons (lack of available resource being a common issue) reasons. Finally, under a third did not respond, partly due to a lack of knowledge of the WWFE activities. The Appendices 1, 2 and 3, at the end of the article, show a list of those who were invited and (a) did not respond, (b) declined and (c) accepted and were provided with datapacks, for Part A and all relevant instructions, and then later withdrew.</p>
<p>A list of contributors currently taking part in WWFE-II is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312449885">Table 3</xref>. The list consists of 12 groups (covering 35 individuals as leaders and co-workers in the field), eight of which took part in the first exercise. The participants represent some twelve institutions /groups /individuals from seven countries. The ‘original’ eight were supplemented by inviting those who were regarded as representative of contemporary modelling tools and methodologies currently in use by research and design institutes around the world.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312449885">Table 3</xref> provides a summary of the participants, their institute, affiliation and references to the theory that each has employed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998312449885"><title>Methodologies employed in WWFE-II</title>
<p>The WWFE-II contains 12 different methods and failure criteria that have been employed, mainly, by their originators.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0021998312449885"><title>Bogetti’s model</title>
<p>This was represented by Bogetti et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312449885">4</xref></sup> in the same manner was that done in the first exercise. The model employs nonlinear 3D maximum strain failure criterion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998312449885"><title>Carrere, Laurin and Maire’s model</title>
<p>This model is proposed by a group from ONERA (France) who have been working on the development of physically based failure models. The group has worked closely with Chobache (ONERA) on damage modeling and on developing multiscale progressive failure models. They provided a new methodology that was described as micromechanical based hybrid mesoscopic (MHM) 3D approach which was capable of solving all the test cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312449885">5</xref></sup> It takes into account thermal stresses and nonlinearity due to material and progressive failure. The model is able to identify various modes of failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998312449885"><title>Cuntze’s model</title>
<p>Cuntze, a retired engineer, provided a failure criterion, known as failure mode concept (FMC) model, for predicting failure under 3D stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312449885">6</xref></sup> The model is an extension to that described in the first WWFE. The new model was employed to solve all the test cases, except test case 10.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998312449885"><title>Ha–Tsai’s model</title>
<p>Tsai’s failure criterion was an important part of the first WWFE. He employed the interactive failure method, widely known as Tsai–Wu’s criterion, to solve all the problems of that exercise. Based on the comparison study between the prediction of this criterion and available test data, it was noted that some aspects of the criterion did not capture some of the observations of some of the experimental data. These aspects involve the large enhancement in the biaxial compressive strength of a unidirectional lamina and its knock-on effect on the prediction of the strength of aircraft qualified composite laminates, such as quasi-isotropic carbon/epoxy composites.</p>
<p>Recently, Tsai published a book,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312449885">7</xref></sup> in which a new failure criterion was provided by Ha.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312449885">8</xref></sup> The criterion, known as micro-mechanics of failure (MMF), described by Ha, deviated from the original suggested by Tsai in many aspects, including (a) the elimination of the enhancement in the biaxial compressive strength predicted by the original Tsai–Wu’s theory (b) employment of finite element analysis to carry out the micro-mechanical analysis and (c) introduction of physically based criteria for fibre failure, matrix failure and interface failure.</p>
<p>At the end, Tsai together with a group from South Korea, led by Sung Ha, have provided a valuable contribution to WWFE-II. Their model will be referred to in WWFE-II as Ha-Tsai’s model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0021998312449885"><title>Hansen et al model</title>
<p>Hansen with his group at Wyoming University and FireHole Technology (USA) have provided a contribution based on the multi-continuum theory (MCT), proposed in the first WWFE. Their model was previously referred to as Mayes’s theory. The model uses a finite element analysis to predict failure on a microscopic level (matrix and fibres). They introduced new modifications to the model in order to increase its ability to predict the behaviour under 3D stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312449885">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0021998312449885"><title>Huang’s model</title>
<p>This was introduced by Huang in the first exercise. It is a micro-mechanics based analysis and uses bridging approach for predicting elastic constants. It also employs a generalised maximum stress criterion together with a plasticity model to predict the behaviour of the plastic matrix used in the composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312449885">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0021998312449885"><title>Hashin’s model</title>
<p>Hashin’s theory was developed in the 1980s and had been embedded as a failure criterion in many commercial codes, including ABAQUS, a widely used commercial finite element package.</p>
<p>During the WWFE-II, Hashin was approached by the organisers to take part. He indicated that he was unable to prepare a full paper due to a lack of time and resources, although he was keen on the triaxial test data and suggested to contact one of his colleagues. However, it was not possible to obtain a response from his colleague.</p>
<p>Kress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312449885">11</xref></sup> who joined the exercise at relatively late stages, was requested by the organisers to employ Hashin’s theory to solve the test cases. In order to comply with spirit of the exercise and involve Hashin, indirectly, the organisers suggested that Kress and Hashin work together on the paper’s submission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0021998312449885"><title>Pinho et al. model</title>
<p>Pinho and his group at Imperial College (UK), University of Porto (Portugal) and NASA (USA) has been working on the development of 3D physically based failure methodologies. They provided a new method which was capable of solving all the test cases. The method was used in conjunction with finite element analysis and takes into account pressure dependency, nonlinear material behaviour, damage, fibre buckling and other phenomenological aspects of failure modes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312449885">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0021998312449885"><title>Puck’s model</title>
<p>Puck’s method was one of the models that was benchmarked under 2D stresses in the first WWFE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup> and that was employed by Puck and Schürmann. They used an analytical computer code to solve the test cases.</p>
<p>In the WWFE-II, Schürmann started employing the same analytical code for solving the new test cases. However, another group at ISD (Stuttgart University, Germany), led by Kröplin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312449885">13</xref></sup> was working on the use of finite element code for solving and carrying out 3D stress analysis of composite structures. It transpired that Puck had made communications with this group to discuss participating in the WWFE-II. As a result, Schürmann withdrew from the WWFE-II in favour of Kröplin’s group.</p>
<p>At the end, Puck’s method was used by Deuschle and Kröplin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312449885">13</xref></sup> with a direct consultation and supervision from Puck, to solve all the 12 test cases. Hence, the model that was presented by Deuschle and Kröplin will be referred to as Puck’s model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0021998312449885"><title>Rotem’s model</title>
<p>This was represented by Rotem himself. The theory assumes a form of interaction between the various stresses acting on a lamina. In order to cater for 3D stresses, Rotem introduced new terms to the model he used in the first exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312449885">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0021998312449885"><title>Wolfe’s theory</title>
<p>This is based on the maximum strain energy principle that was originally carried out by Sandhu. Wolfe and Butalia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup> made a good contribution to the first exercise where they introduced modification to the theories, based upon the available experimental results under 2D stresses. Wolfe and Butalia, together with their colleagues (Zand and Schoeppner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312449885">15</xref></sup>), made other modifications to the theory to cater for 3D stress states. The theory was able to solve all the test cases of the WWFE-II.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-0021998312449885"><title>Christensen’s theory</title>
<p>Christensen was approached by the organisers but he indicated that he was unable to prepare a full paper. Ye et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312449885">16</xref></sup> was requested to employ Christensen’s theory to solve the test cases. In order to involve Christensen, indirectly, the organisers suggested that both Ye and Christensen work together to benchmark the original theory. Ye et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312449885">16</xref></sup> attempted to solve the majority of the test cases, except cases 10 and 11 and used linear analysis with no post failure modeling. Their model will be referred to in WWFE-II as Christensen’s model.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0021998312449885"><title>Methodologies not employed in WWFE-II</title>
<p>While the groups participating in the exercise have provided a large spectrum of available models, unfortunately no willing champions/originators would step forward to allow the evaluation of the following theories:</p>
<sec id="sec20-0021998312449885"><title>Maximum stress model</title>
<p>This was presented by Zinoviev in the first exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup> This is very simple to use for predicting the behaviour of a lamina under various 3D stresses. However, after the death of Peter Zinoviev our attempts to find an advocate from Peter’s former team to represent his theory in WWFE-II proved to be unsuccessful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0021998312449885"><title>Strain invariant failure theory</title>
<p>This has been developed by Gosse,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312449885">3</xref></sup> and it is believed that the development was part of an interaction between Gosse and Hart-Smith, when the latter was at the Boeing company. The organisers have invited both Gosse and Hart-Smith to take part in the exercise to gain greater insight into the theory. A number of contacts and communications were made with Hart-Smith and Gosse. As late as July 2009, and after a meeting between Gosse and the organisers held at ICCM-17 in Edinburgh, the organisers have provided Gosse with a small portion of the WWFE-II test cases to try the method on. The expectation is that a further effort might lead to Gosse attempting the WWFE test cases at a later date.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0021998312449885"><title>Dissipated energy density theory</title>
<p>The dissipated energy density (DED) approach, developed by Badaliance et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312449885">18</xref></sup> at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL, USA), is a significant departure from the existing failure methodologies. The organisers invited participation from the team who have pioneered this approach behind the methods and no response was received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0021998312449885"><title>Theories based on probabilistic methods</title>
<p>Methods for predicting the failure strength of brittle materials (e.g. ceramics) recognise the need to represent material strength as a statistical distribution, rather than as a single valued function. Given that many of the FRP mechanisms could be classed as ‘brittle’ (e.g. transverse tensile fracture of a lamina), one would expect there to be advocates for probabilistic based FRP failure theories. No such advocate emerged from the publicity/selection stage, though it should be noted that one small portion of Cuntze’s contribution does utilise some probabilistic features.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0021998312449885"><title>Other theories</title>
<p>There are other theories that have not been represented in the exercise and these include those that were presented in the first exercise:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup>
<list id="list14-0021998312449885" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>National and international standards, see Eckold in Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ten-percent rule, see Hart-Smith in Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Generalised Tresca, see Hart-Smith in Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chamis’s theory, see Chamis et al. in Hinton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312449885">1</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Hopefully the examples given above serve to show that the organisers have made every possible effort to engage with the broadest base of theoreticians and to encourage their involvement in WWFE-II. Whilst it has not always been possible to get full participation within the framework of WWFE-II itself, the expectation is that some of these groups (or their representatives and collaborators) will choose to attempt the test cases defined in the first WWFE and WWFE-II at a later date, and then produce papers indicating how well their theories have performed. Such new papers are not expected to have the same authority as those generated under the strict rules of the exercise, because the predictions will not be made ‘blind’. Nevertheless they can add to the collective understanding of this very complex area.</p>

<sec id="sec25-0021998312449885"><title>Review process and timelines and publication</title>
<p>All of the participants were sent an identical set of input data which was finalised after receiving feedback from participants (eg requests for additional parameters, clarification of details on loading/laminate configurations etc). Deadlines were set out so that all papers would be submitted on time. The papers were subjected to a stringent reviewing process, where each paper was reviewed at least once (and more typically requiring 3 iterations of revisions). The organisers had to extend the deadlines on a number of occasions to allow those who had not managed to submit their first or revised drafts to complete their work. Although the majority submitted their draft relatively early in the process, a few took a considerable amount of extra time – an inevitable feature of this form of collaborative working and best managed by having regular communication between organisers and participants to encourage progress.</p>
<p>WWFE-II is being run in two parts, following the guidelines adopted in the first WWFE:
<list id="list15-0021998312449885" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Part A is devoted to providing full details of the theoretical models and failure criteria of the participants and the results of their blind predictions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Part B is concerned with comparing the theoretical results with experimental results.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The WWFE-II is organised to run logically through a series of activities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998312449885">Table 4</xref>).
