<title>Cabot P.O.L. Cream</title>
<p>Cabot P.O.L. Cream is formulated to deliver the proven benefits of phospholipids—powerful natural antioxidants and the chief moisturizing agent in the skin, which penetrate the skin to provide long-lasting moisturizing and protection—to provide safe and effective treatment and protection of dry, cracked skin. Phospholipids are the prime building blocks of all forms of life, and they are thus indispensable to all forms of life and healthy skin by assembling and strengthening skin cell membranes, stimulating microcirculation, and accelerating the natural healing of superficially and seriously traumatized skin. For more information, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://CabotSkinCare.com">CabotSkinCare.com</ext-link> or call 800-645-5048.</p>

<title>CalleX® Ointment for Dry, Cracked Feet</title>
<p>Xenna Corporation’s diabetic-friendly NonyX® Nail Gel is sold in the foot care aisle of most pharmacies. Its patented exfoliating agent, ethanoic acid, gradually removes discoloring keratin debris, the buildup under toenails or fingernails that makes them appear yellow or dark. Twice-daily application on and under the nail results in clear, healthy-looking toenails in 5 to 9 months. Visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nonyx.com/resource">www.nonyx.com/resource</ext-link> for photos, research studies and samples. Xenna’s diabetic-friendly CalleX® Ointment for Dry, Cracked Feet is sold in the foot care aisle at Walgreen’s and Rite Aid. Highly moisturizing, CalleX is free of acids, parabens, lanolin, and preservatives. Its natural, patented enzymes gently remove dry skin and soften hardened areas on dry heels and soles without the need for scraping or scrubbing. The soft scent of natural peppermint oil also keeps feet smelling fresh with each application. Results are seen in 2 to 4 weeks.
