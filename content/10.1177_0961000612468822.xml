<p>There are of course many ironies associated with publishing in hard copy a book on moves towards developing a semantic web: as we are told at several points in this volume, the technological changes we are living through have begun to challenge the very notion of what a book <italic>is</italic>. But this is in many ways a strange book. It has been produced as a result of ‘the confluence of four research endeavours’: work for which Cope and Kalantzis are well known on changes in the communications – and especially the scholarly communications – environment; research undertaken in Australia over the past 10 years on changing technologies, markets and skills in the publishing supply chain; work undertaken by Common Ground Publishing on the Common Ground Markup Language and semantic publishing schemas and technologies; and finally more current work on ‘extending and applying those technologies for writing in educational contexts’ (p. 11). It has to be said at the start that the linkages between these four strands do not work well in this book. Cope and Kalantzis acknowledge that ‘the book speaks strangely at times’, and that it ‘speaks in several, at times incongruent voices’ (p. 11). They also acknowledge that its agenda may seem peculiar, because it ‘crosses backwards and forwards between philosophical-historical reflection and a call to techno-social action’ (p. 11). All in all, this does not make for an easy read. Although there are some references backwards and forwards between the 15 separate chapters, the book as a whole lacks coherence, and it is far from clear what audience it is aimed at (which is rather odd in a book that repeatedly makes the claim that we are on the verge of a world where audiences can become users, and the distinction between authors and readers will dissolve).</p>
<p>Of the 15 chapters, five are provided by Cope and Kalantzis, and much of what they write covers reasonably familiar ground. Thus they insist at several points that the production, representation and dissemination of knowledge – especially but not solely in the academic sphere – must be understood as both social and technological processes that are subject to change; that the rapid technological changes of the past two decades have presented unprecedented challenges to established systems of production, representation and dissemination; but that we have as yet not risen to the challenges or seized the opportunities presented by the digital revolution and the Web. They thus tell us in three separate chapters – twice with reference to a presentation made by Guédon at an Association of Research Libraries conference more than a decade ago – that ‘we are still in the age of digital incunabula’ (pp. 3, 92, 137); and that the possibilities opened up by semantic publishing have not yet been realised. They also provide – especially in their second and third chapters, on ‘What does the digital do to knowledge-making?’ and ‘Books and journal articles: The textual practices of academic knowledge’ – some reasonably clear accounts of some of the key changes taking place in the ‘fundamental mechanics of rendering’; the ‘new navigational order which is associated with this transition’(p. 119); and some of the implications of multimedia and multimodality. But their frustration is evident. Knowledge production ‘historically pivoting on the peer-reviewed journal and published monograph’ shows little signs of change. The ‘potentials for knowledge making which are as yet unrealised’ (p. 120) include semantic mark-up processes to improve discovery, data mining and machine translation; multimodal representations to provide a deeper, broader and less mediated view of knowledge; navigable databanks; and ‘co-construction of knowledge through recursive dialogue between knowledge creators and knowledge users’ (p. 120) (in which case the distinction between them begins to erode). This section of the book ends with a vision of a future where ‘the stuff that was formerly represented as the external stuff of knowledge can be represented and incorporated within the knowledge’ (p. 120); and where scholarly knowledge is produced in more ‘collaborative, dialogical and recursive’ (p. 120) ways. What is curious here is that there is no consideration of the social barriers to realising such a vision.</p>
<p>Either side of these chapters from Cope and Kalantzis, there are eight chapters by Liam Magee which take us on a crash course through epistemology and semantic theory, ontologies, and the problems of ‘the commensurability of knowledge systems’ (p. 32). Chapters on ‘The meaning of meaning: Alternative disciplinary perspectives’, ‘An historical introduction to formal knowledge systems’, and ‘Contemporary dilemmas: Tables versus webs’ do not make for easy reading as we are taken from Aristotle through Descartes, Leibniz, John Stuart Mill, Kant, Hegel and Marx, to Freud, Russell, Whitehead, Wittgenstein, Frege, Foucault, AJ Ayer, Turing, Tarski, Saussure, Popper, Austin, Kuhn, Quine, Derrida, Chomsky, Rorty, Hacking and many more. Some of the language in these chapters does not help. I for one feel that I am being asked to work unnecessarily hard to extract meaning from sentences like ‘To retain the geometric and spatial metaphor which is used throughout this study, conceptualisations frequently connect at orthogonal conceptual junctions and splices’ (p. 21). The problem of commensurability and interoperability across ontologies – themselves very loosely defined by Magee – is of course a critically important one that has to be addressed if the vision of the semantic web is to be realised. And information professionals need to work with a range of specialists from other disciplines if we are to make effective progress. But whether many of them will find Magee’s course in philosophy, the history of ideas, critical theory, linguistics and informatics useful in helping them to work effectively with others in that quest must be open to question.</p>
<p>The final chapters of the book begin to address the issues of commensurability and interoperability, and the requirements for the automated exchange of content in a more practical way. Cope and Kalantzis present what is in effect a manifesto for the Common Ground Markup Language. But it is by no means clear how this, or how Richard Vines’ and Joseph Firestone’s discussion of the technical and social aspects of interoperability relate to the theoretical sections of the book presented by Magee. Nor does it help that whole sections of text are repeated (see, for example pp. 376 and 398).</p>
<p>A clear and detailed account of the issues and challenges presented by moves towards the semantic web, especially as it relates to academic and research content, is sorely needed. I learned a fair amount from reading some sections of this volume; other passages I wanted to challenge; and yet others I found impenetrable. Overall, therefore, this collection of chapters, loosely connected and very lightly edited (there are numerous errors that a copy editor should have picked up), does not fill that gap.</p>
