<abstract>
<p>This article explores the performances and narratives of nature-based tourists, more specifically of trampers, on Stewart Island, a remote tourism destination located in the southern waters of Aotearoa/New Zealand. It does so by reflecting on the concepts of commodification and of spectacle and how these may influence the experiences of tourists on the wild landscapes of Stewart Island. The study used an interpretive and embedded methodology, where the author was able to engage with the experiences of Others while tramping for extended periods of time on the island. This article concludes that the trampers’ experience of nature on Stewart Island is modulated by a media-constructed and media-sold tourism concept that fits well in a cultural and physical landscape that is able to provide an experience associated with a produced ‘nature’. Nature is therefore constructed to allow for an experience that is designed prior to the actual performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Historically, outdoor recreation activities have been an important part of New Zealanders’ lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461090">Ross, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612461090">Star, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468797612461090">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468797612461090">Young, 2004</xref>). This lifestyle is epitomised by the popularity of outdoor recreation pursuits and is afforded by the extensive system of National Parks and conservation areas managed to provide a diverse range of nature-based leisure opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468797612461090">New Zealand, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461090">Ross, 2008</xref>). National Parks and other forms of protected areas make up 31.3% of New Zealand’s land area and are intended to be an integral part of these outdoor experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468797612461090">Ministry for the Environment, 2004</xref>). Within this context, tramping is one important cultural manifestation intimately associated with nature that is sold to both residents and tourists as part of this ‘outdoorsy’ New Zealand lifestyle.</p>
<p>Tramping is the term used in New Zealand to designate the activity of walking for leisure on tracks within parks and other outdoor environments for prolonged periods of time. Bushwalking, hiking, backpacking and rambling are terms used in similar ways in other countries such as Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom, but they carry their own cultural significance and therefore cannot be considered as direct substitutes for tramping. Tramping, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461090">Ross (2008)</xref> argues, is an activity that is typical of New Zealanders and is part of a culture that sees ‘being a New Zealander’ as an identity closely associated with nature. Accordingly, tramping tracks can roughly be defined as walking tracks situated within a natural setting and that require some skill and experience to undertake. Commonly this implies that the activity may involve an overnight stay, but that is not always the case. To be considered a tramping track, the surface needs to be to boot standard (one would not, usually, be able to do it on sandals, for instance), and a reasonable level of fitness, as well as basic outdoors skills, are required. In New Zealand, almost all tramping tracks are free to access, and one can choose to do them alone, with fellow trampers or as part of a commercial product. In fact, free access to tracks within the conservation state is paramount to the continuity of the prevalent discourse that reinforces this cultural identity closely associated with nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461090">Ross, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468797612461090">Hall and Higham (2000)</xref> pointed out that since the initial stages of European settlement in New Zealand, and the first conservationist impulses, recreation activities in forested areas, and in particular tramping, have been a core element of New Zealand society. Moreover, throughout the development and consolidation of the ‘clean and green’ image, the country has hosted an increasing number of tourists searching for outdoor experiences in its protected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461090">Cloke and Perkins, 1998</xref>). Tramping is one of the main activities pursued by these tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468797612461090">Ministry of Tourism, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>For these reasons, this article explores the New Zealand tramping experience as a manufactured tourism product sold to international visitors. In this article, tramping is dealt with not as a cultural tradition of New Zealand outdoor recreationists but rather as it is experienced by international tourists, particularly visitors to Stewart Island the so-called third island of New Zealand, where tourism, and tramping in particular, is the main source of income. My argument here is that in order to make sense of the tramping experience on the island, it is first necessary to understand the (historical) context in which the experience has been developed and marketed to visitors. Second, an understanding of the commodification process is needed, both generally and in the context of leisure in tourism. With these foundations laid, then the performances and narratives of trampers on Stewart Island during the course of this research project can be presented and explored in light of the notions of nature as commodity and stage for tourism experiences.</p>
<p>Before moving into the main sections of this article, however, it is important to clarify my use of the concept of ‘nature’, given the centrality of this concept to the argument presented below. Already, I have used the terms ‘natural environment’ and ‘outdoor environments’ to designate physical settings where ‘nature’ may be experienced. Later, I will present the nuances of the concept as experienced in this research project, but for now, it is important that the reader is informed that my use of the term ‘nature’ is metaphorical, a representation of a collective construction and that I am aware of the difficulties both in using and avoiding the use of this construct, as well as the difficulties involved in using an alternative, substitute term (for more on this see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468797612461090">Franklin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468797612461090">Macnaghten and Urry, 1998</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468797612461090">Jamal and Everett (2004)</xref> argue, nature ‘is as much an ideological marker as it is something real, for understandings about nature are deeply embedded in geopolitical and cultural influences, symbolic meanings, social constructions and historical influences’ (p. 3). I therefore frequently use single quotation marks to emphasise the distinction between nature and ‘nature’, where the former represents either ‘the essential quality and character <italic>of</italic> something; [ … ] the inherent force which directs either the world or human beings or both; [or] the material world itself, taken as including or not human beings’ (Williams as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468797612461090">Franklin, 2002</xref>: 22), and the latter represents the socially constructed and discussed notion of nature.</p>

<title>Tourism and outdoor recreation in New Zealand</title>
<p>New Zealand is internationally recognised for its outdoor recreation opportunities, and tourism in this country has developed based largely on ‘landscape’ consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468797612461090">Bell and Lyall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461090">Cloke and Perkins, 2002</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468797612461090">1998</xref>, Higham stated that the extensive National Park system, with its associated outdoor activities, was one of the major attractions for international inbound tourists in New Zealand, being central to the promotion of the country to international visitor markets. Since then, the number of international tourists has doubled and nature-based recreation and countryside sightseeing have continued to be the major activities pursued by these tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468797612461090">Ministry of Tourism, 2009b</xref>). In fact, the ‘clean and green’ image is so central that since 1999 Tourism New Zealand has adopted the brand ‘100% Pure New Zealand’ to promote the country as an internationally competitive tourism destination. Although the campaign was not created with the sole purpose of promoting the country’s natural landscapes and activities pursued in these spaces, ‘nature’ is nonetheless a central pillar of the New Zealand tourism brand.</p>
<p>According to Maurice Saatchi, one of the developers of the original ‘100% Pure<italic>’</italic> global campaign, New Zealand landscapes are authentic and therefore are meaningful for the tourist, providing for a non-conventional product. Although Saatchi refers to the country as ‘real’ and ‘authentic’, the idea behind the campaign he helped develop is that the product ‘nature’ is ‘manufactured’ and ‘packaged’ to serve the international tourist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612461090">Morgan et al., 2002</xref>). Even though his statements are founded on incontestable ‘facts’, such as the extensive preserved natural areas and the sublime landscapes suitable for a wide variety of outdoor recreation activities, the natural environment, as it will be illustrated below, is consumed and sold as a product guided by demand, and not so much engaged in as part of ‘ordinary’ human–natural environment relationships.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612461090">Perkins and Thorns (2001)</xref> affirm that the dramatic natural scenery of the South Island, with its fiords, the Southern Alps and scenic lakes, has been its main tourist attraction since the late nineteenth century. According to these authors, in the 1870s, the government began using ‘nature’ as one of the main tourism products of the country, highlighting the scenery and ‘natural landscapes’ in the first tourist brochures used in London and Australia to promote New Zealand as a destination. Undeniably, tourism, recreation and natural landscapes have been, for a long time, inseparable in this country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468797612461090">Shelton and Tucker, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612461090">Star (2002)</xref> argues that feelings of aesthetic admiration and emotional connection to the land also were important drivers for the protection of natural areas. During this process, initiated in the late nineteenth century, the New Zealand national identity began to be grounded on human relationships with the natural environment, particularly influenced by the Romantic notions of nature. As this identity is based on ‘real’ natural features, the adventurous, explorer spirit is constantly present in the image New Zealanders construct of themselves, and sell to the overseas tourism market, as they perceive their land as rugged, wild, extreme and inhospitable. A clear example of this is the ‘100% Pure’ campaign itself, which concentrates most of its effort on showing the dramatic landscapes of the Southern Alps, volcanoes of the North Island, Maori (indigenous) people performing a warriors dance and individuals engaging in adventurous nature-based activities. It is therefore only ‘natural’ that the country has become the ‘world capital’ for outdoor adventure tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461090">Cloke and Perkins, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important factor contributing to the construction and consolidation of this tourism image is the structured effort made by Tourism New Zealand to promote the country to the ‘interactive traveller’. In fact, the focus on the natural environment, clearly present in the 100% Pure New Zealand campaign, is a strategy to attract this market segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468797612461090">Ministry of Tourism, 2007</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468797612461090">Ministry of Tourism (2007)</xref>, this market is composed of ‘regular international travellers who seek out new, authentic experiences that involve <italic>engagement with natural and cultural environments</italic>’ (p. 20, emphasis added), highlighting the importance of nature to tourism development in this country. But more than that, ‘nature’ is sold to be physically engaged with, and not simply gazed upon, as the campaign and visitor participation patterns attest. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612461090">Perkins and Thorns (2001)</xref> have argued, ‘tourists are encouraged both to gaze at spectacular scenery and grapple with the challenge of nature’ and therefore perform as ‘gazers <italic>and</italic> active beings’ (p. 196, emphasis in the original). Such an understanding of tourism as embodied practice aligns well with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468797612461090">Franklin’s (2003)</xref> argument that
<disp-quote>
<p>whereas, for example, many early tourisms emphasised the disembodied subjectivity of the gazing tourist and the (ethnic, folk, bathing, native, local, animal etc.) bodies of the Other as objects of their gaze, increasingly in recent years it is their own bodies that many tourists attend to, as tourists. In other words, although the visual gaze is still an important part of tourism, tourists are increasingly doing things with their own bodies, with embodied objectives such as fitness, thrill, spirituality, risk, sensual connection, sexuality, taste (olfaction and degustation) and what I will presently refer to as ‘inscription’; and ‘flow’. (p. 213)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612461090">Perkins and Thorns (2001)</xref> argue that in the context of adventure tourism experiences in New Zealand, ‘nature’ is presented as a ‘challenge’ that needs to be ‘overcome’. Hence, unlike other tourist destinations, the emphasis on the gaze inadequately captures tourists’ experiences in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612461090">Perkins and Thorns, 2001</xref>). Here, performance <italic>in</italic> and <italic>with</italic> ‘nature’ is the product to be purchased and experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468797612461090">Fairweather and Swaffield, 2002</xref>). Active engagement with ‘nature’ adds intangible value to the tourism product, and its ‘consumption’, in a society that sells everything it creates, becomes almost compulsory. One starts to believe – or desire – that they need to engage in adventurous activities during their leisure pursuits. ‘Pleasure seeking’, suggest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468797612461090">Macnaghten and Urry (1995)</xref>
<disp-quote>
<p>is a duty since the consumption of goods and services becomes the structural basis of Western societies. Social integration [ … ] takes place through the ‘seduction’ of the market-place, through the mix of feeling and emotions generated by seeing, holding, hearing, testing, smelling, and moving through the extraordinary array of goods and services, places and environments, that characterise contemporary consumerism organised around a particular ‘culture of nature’. (p. 213)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this position, it follows that the product ‘nature’ needs to be viewed and discussed as part of a wider social context where different elements of our lives, including people’s desires for experiences, are constantly being involved in a process that we can generally call commodification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468797612461090">
<title>The commodification of nature</title>
<p>The commodification of nature as a location or place, and as ideological space, augmented by the recreational demand in these conceptual settings, begs questions regarding the different values associated with the practice of outdoor recreation and leisure. As the term commodification suggests, the object – in this case, the socially constructed natural environment and the experiences associated with it – ‘come[s] to be evaluated primarily in terms of [its] exchange value, in a context of trade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468797612461090">Cohen, 1988</xref>: 380). Therefore, other meanings associated with natural environments may be lost, displaced by the new understanding predicated on commodification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468797612461090">Duffy and Moore, 2010</xref>). Consequently, ethical positions formerly linked to outdoor activities in the natural world may be displaced also by the new codes that are introduced, or permitted, by the establishment of tourism ventures there. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612461090">Markwell (2001</xref>: 40) states, ‘the increasingly popular nature-based tourism and ecotourism industries have emerged to commercially facilitate (but which, simultaneously, may detract from or compromise) the human experience of nature’.</p>
<p>The commodification process is situated within, and engages with, a broader social context, which involves changes in societal structures and relationships of exchange. From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468797612461090">Marx’s (1990)</xref> perspective, commodification represents the conversion of use value into exchange value. Objects have an exchange value that is greater than their production value: ‘In this way commodification denotes an abstraction of the object from its use value and therefore from social references about the need for the object and the quality of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461090">Cloke, 1993</xref>: 55). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468797612461090">Marx (1990)</xref>, this abstraction, originating in the economic realm, is transferred to the social and personal domains. This process then results in significant distortions of the social and cultural constructions of commodities’ values, representing the ‘commodification’ of objects, and more widely, society. Such a process is exemplified in the tourism industry’s commitment to ‘adding value to’ and ‘extracting revenue from’ the natural world. As a tourism service provider in Milford Sound, one of New Zealand’s most visited ‘postcard’ locations, presents in a video with images of New Zealand’s natural environments: ‘Breathtaking New Zealand scenery; Available for purchase here’.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461090">Debord (1994)</xref>, expanding on Marx’s treatment of commodification, analysed the same phenomenon from a different perspective. He argued that this process is facilitated by a social consensus made possible through mass communication. For Debord, the idea of commodification of society involves more than the exchange of tangible goods but incorporates also social relations. Contemporary critical geographers, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461090">Benton (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468797612461090">Castree (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468797612461090">Harvey (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468797612461090">1998</xref>), argue that human–nature relationships also may come under the influence of commodification, even if their form is distinctive from one another (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468797612461090">Castree, 2003</xref> for more on the different ‘natures’ commodified). This analysis is useful in the tourism and recreation contexts as it allows the inference that people are drawn to consume abstractly constructed products and services, and that these are mere productions or spectacles. It means also that individuals and nature are both agents in a co-constructed relationship and that, consequently, the commodification process, although designed for and engaged by the masses in an almost consensual form, is not consensually accepted without resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468797612461090">Harvey, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Although tourism and recreation pursuits in the natural environment are not new activities; what can be seen today, in addition to the former practice, is the production of models for leisure practices and the homogenisation of the search for a meaningful leisure experience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461090">Debord (1994)</xref> demonstrates that one can analyse the production of such models within the context of post-industrial society consumerism and the homogenisation of this search as social consensus, constructed by the spectacle presented by mass communication media. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461090">Debord (1994)</xref>, the commodification in the society of the spectacle is clearly related to the production of ‘fake’ objects, services, relations and putative real activities. Tourism and recreation, as well as nature and the experiences associated with it, are formatted and sold. An example of how this phenomenon is expressed in New Zealand tourism is clear from a statement from Perkins and Thorns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612461090">2001</xref>) study:
<disp-quote>
<p>International tourists typically enter New Zealand at either Auckland or Christchurch international airports and then follow a sight-seeing circuit of the country’s major natural scenic attractions, reinforcing the importance of scenery, wild nature, thermal springs and the Māori in overseas tourists’ experiences of New Zealand. (p. 195)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The circuit is pre-packaged for the tourist, and the attractions are defined and follow the ‘clean and green’ image that is so well established by the New Zealand tourism marketing campaigns. Within this context, it can be understood how the appeal for ‘nature’ is constructed in the attractive discourse of the tourism industry. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612461090">Markwell (2001)</xref> argues, the ‘tourist-nature interactions are constructed and mediated by the tourism industry and associated agencies’ (p. 41).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1468797612461090">
<title>Stewart Island: the study setting</title>
<p>Stewart Island offers three formally constituted tramping tracks, all following a circuit format. The most visited, the Rakiura Track, is a 29-km tramping track, which runs relatively close to the only permanent settlement on the island. This track is classified by the Department of Conservation (DOC) as a <italic>Great Walk</italic>, which means that it is among the most internationally publicised tracks in New Zealand. <italic>Great Walks</italic> are considered New Zealand’s premier tramping tracks and have been classified as such because of their scenic value, crossing ‘areas of some of the best scenery in the country’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468797612461090">DOC (2011a)</xref> states on their official website. Currently, there are only nine <italic>Great Walks</italic> in the country, while there are hundreds of non-labelled tramping tracks. Their appeal as tourism products is, therefore, easily noticed, and astutely marketed by the tourism industry, which provides several services to ‘improve’ the tourism experience, such as guided walks, shuttles to and from start and end points of the tracks, gear hire and purchase, and private huts and/or shelters.</p>
<p>The Rakiura Track, however, is in some respects singular. First, out of the nine <italic>Great Walks</italic>, the Rakiura Track is one of only three that do not require booking at any time of the year. Also, the Rakiura Track is the only <italic>Great Walk</italic> that has not instituted a high-season fee for huts and campsites, keeping the fees comparable to other non-<italic>Great Walk</italic> huts throughout the year. But these measures are justified. The Rakiura Track presented the lowest total visitor numbers of the nine <italic>Great Walks</italic>, with just over 1500 visitors in the period between July 2008 and June 2009. The Abel Tasman Coast Track, by comparison, attracted over 30,000 visitors during the same period. On the other hand, according to <italic>Great Walks</italic>’ visitor statistics, during the period of this study, the Rakiura Track was consistently among the three tracks with the highest rate of international visitors, varying from 64% to 72% of all trampers on the track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468797612461090">DOC, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these singularities, the track conforms to <italic>Great Walks</italic> standards. It is well formed and signed, and suitable for people with limited backcountry experience. However, due to the natural, geomorphologic characteristics of the island, such as wet soils with poor natural drainage, visitors consider the Rakiura Track, compared to other <italic>Great Walks</italic>, less suitable for the inexperienced, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468797612461090">Wray et al. (2005)</xref> noted in their user survey of the Rakiura National Park. Usually, the track is completed in 2 or 3 days but can be finished in one long day, as I saw happen a few times while on the island. It is provided with two Great-Walk-standard huts and long sections of board walks and gravel surface, which makes it a relatively easy and comfortable track.</p>
<p>The Northwest and Southern Circuits, conversely, are considered challenging tramps and are classified as Tramping Tracks in DOC’s Track Categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468797612461090">DOC, 2011c</xref>). With long sections of deep and thick mud, constantly undulating country and very remote bush areas, only more experienced trampers are advised to venture on these tracks. However, with relatively well-managed trails, several markers and a few signs, even ‘first timers’ are able to complete the journey safely, although a good level of fitness and appropriate gear are essential. The Northwest Circuit is 125 km long and generally is completed in 9–11 days, whereas the Southern Circuit is 105 km long and usually is completed in 6–9 days. All of these tracks can be combined, forming a longer loop around the northern part of the island. This combination forms the longest tramping track in the country and even the Northwest Circuit alone is longer than any other single track in New Zealand. Such a status definitely enhances the ‘product’ appeal and attracts visitors from different countries to engage in a singular New Zealand experience.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I will discuss how the various experiences of tramping on Stewart Island were performed. First, however, I will detail how, as researcher and tramper, I engaged with the experiences of others on the island and how the co-constructed nature of these experiences informed and produced the knowledge contributed in this article.</p>

<title>The tools of this project</title>
<p>Based on a critical reflexive narrative approach grounded in a realist constructivist epistemology, I chose to engage with, and analyse, trampers’ practices and narratives about human–nature relationships through my own embeddedness within these practices and narratives, particularly on Stewart Island, where I had several opportunities to spend extended periods of time.</p>
<p>My first trip to Stewart Island was in March 2007, and since then, I have been to the island on 10 different occasions, in different tourism seasons, including school holidays, long public holiday weekends and during slow periods for tourist visits on the island. The trips varied greatly in length, from 4 to 24 consecutive days, and involved staying within the small community of island residents (Oban) or immersed in the tracks and huts of the National Park. On every visit, I explored different sections/areas of the National Park as well as the community, visiting the stores, pubs, visitor centres, talking to locals and tourists alike. I also took water taxis to remote areas, and I walked on, more than once, all the marked, and some unmarked, tracks on the island.</p>
<p>In every visit to the island, I spent at least two nights in backcountry huts but most often much longer than that, and these stays allowed me to spend a lot of time in close contact with different trampers (and/or hunters) on the island. Also, being ‘in the bush’ for consecutive days made it possible for me to meet several trampers on tracks. Wherever my destination and position, I would always try to make contact, however brief, with the people I encountered. My interactions with trampers ranged from short to long hut conversations, sharing information about the tracks, the island and the daily ‘adventures’. On a few occasions, I joined individual trampers or small tramping groups and tramped one or more parts of the long tracks with them. All these events, including my walks alone, form what I am calling my tramping experiences and inform my analysis of the tramping experiences of the others.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of my first few visits to Stewart Island was that, as part of a related research project, I was carrying questionnaire surveys to deliver to every hunter and tramper I met on the island. For this reason, I spoke with more than 200 visitors and was able to meet different people and hear different stories. This process provided me with great opportunities for listening to, and sharing experiences with, trampers (and hunters) on the island. Most people were intrigued about my research and would spend time telling me their thoughts about the place and the experiences they had on the island. These conversations were diligently documented in my personal diary, as I explain below. In addition, some people were interested enough to meet me outside the hunting/tramping environment, and I was able to digitally record our conversations, some of which lasted up to 2 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468797612461090">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The conversations formally arranged with trampers I met on the island were carefully planned but not overly structured, allowing the Other to actively participate in the construction of meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468797612461090">Holstein and Gubrium, 1995</xref>). Through these purposeful conversations, I was able to further explore the themes that were continually emerging in my daily experiences of tramping in New Zealand and, more specifically, themes that emerged from my experiences on Stewart Island. All recorded conversations were transcribed verbatim and were systematically read during the course of my research and during my writing. Remarks were constantly added to my notes, and when common themes were identified, sections were highlighted for further inquiry.</p>
<p>In all my visits, I carried a notebook where I wrote down notes on my day, describing encounters, emotions, experiences and conversations, as well as anything else I considered relevant at that particular moment. This diary constitutes part of my effort to embed myself into the tramping spaces of Stewart Island and also is part of my reflexive engagement with my research. Apart from repetitive readings of, and reflections on, my notes, I have selected passages and organised them into themes of interest. These themes often overlap the emergent themes arising from in-depth, recorded conversations, as well as from hut book entries, another important source of material for interpretation and discussion.</p>
<p>Hut books are a register that DOC leaves in every backcountry hut for visitors to supply their expected itinerary and dates of the current trip in order to provide information in case of emergencies. Apart from itinerary and dates of travel, these books also contain a space for general comments where visitors usually include impressions of their experiences. These accounts range in content, size and form, varying from single words (e.g. ‘Excellent!’) to pages-long stories, complaints, jokes or more generalised comments about their trip.</p>
<p>During my visits to the island, I routinely went through the hut book entries and copied verbatim in my diary comments that I found relevant to my discussions. Clearly, my understanding of what was relevant to be recorded changed over the course of my research, and it was not feasible to copy every single entry, therefore some inconsistency was found later when analysing them. These entries are, nonetheless, very useful particularly in the context of tourists’ experiences on the island. From my observations, the majority of the visitors engage in such reading, using hut books as a pastime and as a common starter to conversations with ‘strangers’. Therefore, the material collected from these hut books is considered to be an important tool for the development of my argument.</p>
<p>In addition to the hut books on the island, I was also able to access selected old hut books from DOC’s Southland Conservancy office. Again, comments were copied verbatim following the same premise, and in all cases, the activity in which the visitors were involved was remarked on in my notes. All entries extracted from hut books were subsequently organised into themes and combined with the larger material gathered through other methods, such as the diary notes and in-depth inter-views.</p>
<p>In sum, what follows is an account of some reflections I had of the tramping experience on the island, as recorded in situ, later interpreted to identify key themes and then rewritten into the present format. Although rigorously analysed and theoretically informed, my discussions here inevitably derive from my own interpretation of the experiences I engaged with while on Stewart Island.</p>

<title>Tramping performances on Stewart Island</title>
<p>I was there to interact with the people I met, and to live the tramping experience. But it was work, and the preoccupation with meeting, talking, seeing and trying to understand behaviours, values and feelings was always present in my mind. That immersion was what made it possible to feel and understand what I now formulate as the process of commodification and spectacle that happens with each one of us, in some way or another, while engaging with tourism experiences in the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461090">Debord, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>During the first few days of the tramp, I was constantly meeting people who would frequently ask how long it took to go from one hut to the other. That question was more often than not one of the first topics of conversation. Reading hut books, one could easily find this issue being raised again, with some people questioning DOC about the expected duration of each ‘leg’ of the tramp. Some comments would reinforce the forecasts made by the agency and some would complain, arguing that it was not a good prediction: ‘Track times are not accurate’ and ‘I walked for 7 hours from Bungaree hut to here [Christmas Village Hut]. DOC information isn’t correct!’.</p>
<p>Some of the hut books’ comments showed where my feelings of the primacy of time-taken were coming from: ‘The trail is challenging. Only five hours!’; ‘hey … I’m back &amp; Southern Circuit in 4 days. Nice but very tough!!!!’; ‘2.5 hours from Mason, wet feet for first time’; ‘4h from Freshwater [hut]’ and ‘5 h to come here girls, paddling and splashing in the mud, under our lovely rain’. For me, immersed in that environment and sharing these conversations with other trampers, it became clear that the ‘time-taken’ comments I read and heard were not coming from concerns over safety, as estimates made by DOC are supposed to attend to, but from a different motivation or aspect of their experiences. It is interesting to note that previous research on travel experiences has indicated that the actual movement between places forms an essential part of the experience of a place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468797612461090">Watts and Urry, 2008</xref>). However, if travel time had to be minimised to fit into a ‘race’ to reach the day’s destination, then this crucial part of emplacement, engagement in the journey, was being in some way diminished.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1468797612461090" position="float">

</fig>
<p>In my particular experience, this emphasis on time-taken started to make me too focus, during the day, on completing the tracks below the expected time, or at least within it, in some way as a response to the ‘pressure’ of time that trampers in general were constantly presenting to each other. For me, in the process of critically analysing my experience and those of Others, there could be no doubt that this was a disguised form of race. Whose race and against whom were aspects not clearly distinguished in the narratives, but the preoccupation with each other’s ‘lap time’ and one’s own performance in that environment was certainly evident in my readings of the hut book entries and in conversations that I was constantly a part of.</p>
<p>This idea of the tramp being a race made a lot of difference to how I was experiencing the environment. The tracks, which can be strenuous, were becoming harder and harder, and the hours seemed to stretch longer and longer. There was little joy involved, and I hardly ever noticed the scenery. When it started to become less and less pleasurable, I realised the effect of having engaged in those dialogues; they were becoming my truth. As a ‘bush-walker’ for more than 10 years, the feeling of being in the outdoors had never been so negative. I did not want to be part of the race but the race was ‘out there’ and that was what was making these trampers such an adventurous group holding values in common. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461090">Edensor (2001)</xref> argues
<disp-quote>
<p>particular tourist contexts generate a shared set of conventions about what should be seen, what should be done and which actions are inappropriate. Such shared norms instantiate a way of being a backpacker, a participant on a tour-bus or a member of a Club 18–30 holiday. (p. 60)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this context, being physically able to endure the track competently, that is, within or under the expected time, was ‘what should be done’. It also seemed that trampers were there to prove something to themselves and probably to others, to prove that they could tramp Stewart Island in a very competent way. The timing of the tramps – how long they would take to go from one hut to another – clearly had become a measure of this competence.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1468797612461090" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468797612461090-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>My years of involvement made me an experienced ‘tramper’, and I wanted to be recognised as such. To earn that status in this instance I had not only to be there, but also I had to tramp it that way, perform according to that norm. In the light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461090">Debord’s (1994)</xref> thesis, this is the product that is being sold and the adventure, which is part of the product ‘nature’, is mass produced. The experience of the product must be the same, for all, in search for a consensus, the aim of late capitalist societies: ‘people are led to consume a world which is constructed by others and not themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461090">Cloke, 1993</xref>: 56). The tourist space is produced by Others, but the adherence to the consensus that forms such a space is almost unconsciously performed. Although on Stewart Island most trampers and I were not involved in a commercial guided walk, where paying tourists have little option but to follow the same procedures, the performances and narratives were nonetheless strikingly similar between the tourists I met. These ‘collective’ performances support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461090">Debord’s (1994)</xref> argument of a consensus reached through the commodification and spectacularisation of society as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461090">Edensor’s (2001)</xref> point that consensus are reached through the construction, use and performance of shared norms.</p>
<p>Some hut book entries show that I was not the only one finding less and less enjoyment in my contact with that untamed environment: ‘mud on your face, rain in your hair, sandflies biting, kiwis fighting, tourists snoring, mud on your face’; ‘Surviving’ and ‘harder than you think this walk is’ were some of the comments under the title ‘activity’ in the hut books.</p>
<p>These comments indicate that nature, with all its constitutive elements, plays a secondary role, predominantly as setting, although physically felt and experienced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468797612461090">Valkonen (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468797612461090">Cloke and Perkins (2005)</xref> have challenged the idea that nature can be viewed as a ‘mere context’ for tourism activities as they recognise ‘how embodied beings, or other elements of nature, actively coconstitute the changing nature of places and coconstitute the performances which help to define those places’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468797612461090">Cloke and Perkins, 2005</xref>, p. 903), an idea with which I fully agree. My argument here does not imply that the environment does not ‘coconstitute the performances which help to define those places’. On the contrary, were not the environment on Stewart Island as harsh as it is, the ‘adventure’ for those tourists would not be worth the effort and the story later to be retold. However, what I argue is that those trampers on Stewart Island do not recognise nature as an agent, a subject, and the interaction with its elements serves only to give an extra flavour, or to make the adventure possible. Trampers wanted to complete the track: that is the commodity and that was their major goal. The track, an element of that ‘thing’ called ‘nature’, has been produced as an attraction and in the process has been ‘commodified and drawn in to the global tourism marketplace as [a product] to be consumed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468797612461090">Duffy and Moore, 2010</xref>: 746). Linda, a tramper from the United States, commented on her experience on Stewart Island with her boyfriend, a German university student:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes it’s frustrating, I think sometimes it’s annoying, sometimes you just feel like ‘couldn’t the trail be a little bit better? A little bit drier? Or go a different path, or …?’ I don’t know, but, I was definitely more positive than my boyfriend, he would get really down, really frustrated, especially if he started to get hungry, he would just, like, completely lose it. I was more kind of the one saying ‘it’s ok, honey, you can do it, we chose to do this’. (Linda)</p>

<p>The questions asked in conversations were never about the forest, the beaches, the birds – except for the kiwi<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468797612461090">2</xref></sup> – the wind or the sounds, but only about time. Nature and the natural environment seemed to play only a small part in the experience; it seemed as if they were only the backdrop to where the trampers’ major objectives and achievements were situated.</p>
<p>As our conversations continued, the topics expanded to include what sort of gear we had, how tiring the day had been and whether either of us had seen a kiwi – the second most important objective. A comment made by one tramper in a hut book was followed immediately by a response that emphasised how common this narrative of ‘I saw (or did not see) a kiwi’ was among Stewart Island trampers, and how this stresses the idea of nature commodified. In response to the inquiry ‘Where are the kiwis?’ was the suggestion ‘Perhaps there is more to Stewart Island than kiwis?’ It seems that the latter tramper became disturbed, as I did, with the constant ‘search’ for the ‘prized’ kiwi. These reactions can be considered then as subversions of the status quo, breaking with the homogenised adherence to the norms imposed by a system that commodifies the tourism experience in nature. Kurt too was uneasy with this standardised procedure, ‘ticking the box’ and saying ‘I saw a kiwi’:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean, you go there kind of hoping to see one, but we never, like, go looking. You know when people go out at night to go looking, at Mason Bay a lot of people went out at night and like, searching! Weird! and we didn’t and then the next morning we saw a kiwi, so we felt really lucky. But that’s how it’s supposed to be! [ … ] when we were out at Mason Bay people went out just to try and see them. (Kurt)</p>

</fig>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468797612461090">Mrozowski (1999)</xref> observed, ‘nature’ has become as much an object of consumption as any other in post-modern society. In this case though, the ‘adventure package’ is purchased bringing ‘nature’ with it, but only as an ancillary product. Although the people I met did not come with commercial tour operators, the idea of adventure is sold abstractly through advertisement and marketing campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461090">Cloke and Perkins, 2002</xref>). Tramping on Stewart Island is definitely one of the biggest products of this destination and unquestionably sold as an adventurous activity. While most trampers said that they were there, in the natural environment, to feel closely connected to ‘nature’, to feel ‘nature’ or to admire ‘nature’, what I experienced, and understood them to experience, on Stewart Island seemed far removed from that. Susan’s comment indicates the Romantic ideals entrenched in narratives about nature, but that are contradictory with other descriptions of the experience <italic>of</italic> nature:
<disp-quote>
<p>The morning walking from East Ruggedy down to that beach was like, what I think was one of my favourite mornings, seeing kiwis was really exciting and just, it was still pretty dark when we left, and then getting down to the beach as it was getting late, was cloudy so it wasn’t like spectacular or anything, but it was powerful, just like being down there, we were waiting the tide to get around that little crop in the end, yeah, I don’t know, just like I really started to feel like, like, I don’t know, it’s just like a cool feeling, you just really start, it just kind of hit me, like, we’re out in this island, close to the South Pole, away from everything, everything is so natural … (Susan)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The tramping performance had little relationship with an engagement with nature that went beyond romanticised narratives. As one tramper wrote, ‘the views could be better’, showing how little appreciation they were demonstrating for that natural environment and how they were expecting an almost standardised ‘spectacular landscape’ constantly to be presented to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468797612461090">3</xref></sup> In fact, such expectation is the norm, as it has become ‘implicit that the more embodied activities take place against spectacular backcloths’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468797612461090">Franklin, 2003</xref>: 223;).</p>

<title>Searching</title>
<p>Tramping certain tracks, in certain parts of the world, has become a mass product for the ‘adventurous some’. The selling of adventure in post-modern tourism inevitably is intermingled with a search for spectacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461090">Cloke and Perkins, 2002</xref>). The trampers of Stewart Island demonstrated, through their performances and narratives, that an opportunity to narrate this engagement with spectacle is available twice; once, certainly in the immediate rhetoric of the tramp, and second, when narrating recollections of the experience. The commodification and standardisation of the tourist experience, through marketing campaigns and the development of specific tourism products, such as tramping tracks in the Stewart Island environment, as well as the stage itself, in this case ‘nature’, with all its potential sensual and aesthetic powers, greatly influences the types of performances tourists engage in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461090">Edensor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612461090">Markwell, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It seems clear that tramping on Stewart Island illustrates a phenomenon in contemporary society simultaneously to get closer to, and further away from, nature, a dichotomy typical of the Romantic movement. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461090">Cloke (1993)</xref> argues, the interest in nature in such a detached way presents the tourist with an opportunity to feel engaged in a movement for environmental concern without really taking an active part in it. Although physically there, the tourist’s engagement with nature is fully mediated and produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612461090">Markwell, 2001</xref>) by what can be referred to as the commodification process of nature in contemporary society. In a ‘society of the spectacle’, adventure, one of such a society’s main products, is purchased and consumed. And the transformation of adventure in nature into a commodity to be ‘purchased and consumed’ does not need to involve the payment for guided services or tangible other goods, but the homogenisation of the experience and the narratives derived from it. More importantly, in the case of Stewart Island tramping, it involves the detachment of nature from the meaning of the experience, being now simply a product. In this view of society, nature comes to provide only the appropriate setting for the adventure to be experienced.</p>
<p>Another facet of the ‘society of the spectacle’ observed on this tramping experience was that of performing in accord with established behavioural standards and norms. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461090">Edensor (2001)</xref>, these codes and conventions form a ‘tourist habitus’ that is partially ‘determined by unreflexive, embodied, shared assumptions about appropriate behaviour in particular contexts’, and do not represent ‘types of people’, such as a broad category called ‘the international tourist tramper’, but more ‘as roles adopted rather than social categories made manifest’ (p. 60). In this sense, when I refer to (international) trampers on Stewart Island throughout this article, it is to the roles I witnessed they play while on the island, and not to a social category they automatically and permanently fit in.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on Stewart Island, the ‘kiwi’ product is one of the most advertised ones, and it is part of the tourism experience to search for it. Thus, even when hoping to encounter a wild animal, the kiwi, as part of the tramping experience, trampers searched for the spectacular, the sighting and not the engaging with. Only the spotting of a kiwi mattered. As one tramper reported, ‘I am really disappointed that I haven’t seen any kiwis. That was one of the main reasons I came to Stewart Island … I think the kiwi is just a myth to attract tourists!’ This comment encapsulates the replacement of use value by exchange value, the essence of commodification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468797612461090">Marx, 1990</xref>). Also, it goes further and stresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461090">Debord’s (1994)</xref> position by highlighting how a (natural) product – the kiwi – is constructed by tourism providers and becomes part of the cultural stories of trampers (the ‘buyers’ of the product) who disconnect the ‘object’ from its agency and expect only the production, the spectacle (i.e. the sighting of the kiwi). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612461090">Markwell (2001</xref>: 41) points out, ‘tourists [are] those who “chase myths” [ … ] Myths pervade tourism promotional material and help to confirm existing beliefs about places, cultures and nature’ (p. 41).</p>
<p>The trampers’ experience of nature on Stewart Island, therefore, is modulated by a tourism concept that is constructed and sold to visitors and that fits well in a cultural and physical landscape that is able to provide an experience associated with a produced nature. Nature is therefore constructed to allow for an experience that is designed prior to the actual performance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It was through my engagement with tourism experiences in nature, and drawing upon the New Zealand cultural background, that this article discussed tramping experiences in a particular New Zealand landscape within the concept of commodification of society and, more specifically, of nature. More generally, this article discussed the production of a recreational space, for international visitors in particular, through the commodification of nature, through its different elements (e.g. tracks and islandness) leading to its acting primarily as a setting, as a background to the experience. In my argument, New Zealand natural landscapes are sold to provide the setting for the experience; nature being an integral part of the experience but engaged in superficially as a mere stage for the tourism performance. I followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461090">Edensor’s (2001)</xref> position:
<disp-quote>
<p>Different tourist ventures are carried out upon particular stages – on beaches and mountains, in cities, heritage sites, museums and theme parks. These settings are distinguished by boundedness, whether physical or symbolic, and are often organized – or stage-managed – to provide and sustain common-sense understanding about what activities should take place. Indeed, the coherence of most tourist performances depends on their being performed in specific ‘theatres’. (p. 63)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Small wonder then that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468797612461090">Park (2006)</xref> called his book on the history of New Zealand’s conservation estate, and the tensions between preservation and tourism, <italic>Theatre Country</italic>. Nature is the ‘specific theatre’ and is advertised as producing certain types of experiences and performances.</p>
<p>In this context, to be ‘truly adventurous’ one needs to engage with a landscape that is ‘produced’ to stage such experiences; this landscape in New Zealand tourism is nature. With a stage defined, performances tend to become standardised, although ‘despite the prevalence of codes and norms, tourist conventions can be destabilized by rebellious performances, or by multiple, simultaneous enactions on the same stage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461090">Edensor, 2001</xref>: 60). There are common performances that can be noted in the experience of tramping in New Zealand tourism. I am aware, however, that such performances are not uniform but nonetheless reflect a collective construction. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461090">Edensor (2001)</xref> notes, ‘[w]hile such stagings cannot determine the kinds of performance which occur, the processes of commodification, regulation and representation that reproduce performative conventions ensure that distinctive performance can be identified at most sites’ (p. 63). Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468797612461090">Bell and Lyall (2002)</xref> point out, physically engaging with the landscape connects the tourist with the performance of the spectacle. Today, this forms part of the basis of New Zealand’s tourism product and, significantly, of Stewart Island’s tramping experiences.</p>

<p>I believe the use of the word conversation, instead of the standard ‘interview’, is important here to characterise my understanding of this process as a ‘two-way’ relationship, where meanings are being constructed together. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468797612461090">Holstein and Gubrium (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468797612461090">Kvale (1996)</xref> emphasise the active agency of participants in methodologies that include interview methods within a constructive perspective. These authors use the terms ‘active interview’ and ‘inter-view’, respectively, to stress the collective meaning-making that emerges from these opportunities, and I also occasionally borrow and use these terms.</p>

<p>Kiwi is a New Zealand endemic flightless bird, and most of its species are on the endangered list. On Stewart Island, one can find one of the best and well-preserved environments for the species, and ‘kiwi spotting’ is a famous tourist product of the island, as it is one of the few places in the country where you can see the bird in the wild and during daylight hours.</p>

<p>I am not able to identify from the hut book entry whether the tramper was a male or female, hence my use of ‘they/them’ instead of a gendered pronoun.</p>
