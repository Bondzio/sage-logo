<abstract>
<p>In the research reported here, we proposed and demonstrated the <italic>prediction-specificity</italic> effect, which states that people’s prediction of the general outcome of an event (e.g., the winner of a soccer match) is less accurate when the prediction question is framed in a more specific manner (e.g., guessing the score) rather than in a less specific manner (e.g., guessing the winner). We demonstrated this effect by examining people’s predictions on actual sports games both in field and laboratory studies. In Study 1, the analysis of 19 billion bets from a commercial sports-betting business provided evidence for the effect of prediction specificity. This effect was replicated in three controlled laboratory studies, in which participants predicted the outcomes of a series of soccer matches. Furthermore, the negative effect of prediction specificity was mediated by participants’ underweighting of important holistic information during decision making.</p>

<body>
<p>Imagine that there are two types of bets you can wager on the outcome of a soccer match. With one bet, you simply predict the general outcome, that is, who the winner of the match will be. With the other bet, you predict the specific outcome, that is, what the final score will be. If the rewards for both bets are determined only by whether you have correctly predicted the actual winner, which bet would you play? Would your choice of one bet versus the other affect how accurately you predict the winner?</p>
<p>Intuition suggests that the accuracy of predicting the winner should not be influenced by the type of bet because both bets involve predicting the overall direction of the results. If anything, prediction performance should be enhanced when guessing the score than when guessing the winner because score prediction, compared with winner prediction, demands more decision-making effort and thus should yield fewer judgment errors. However, on the basis of the battery of research demonstrating the detrimental effect of deliberative thought on decision quality, we propose that accuracy in predicting the general outcome can be substantially undermined if the prediction problem entails greater specificity.</p>
<sec id="section1-0956797612468760">
<title>Theory and Hypothesis</title>
<p>Contrary to common wisdom, evidence has suggested that people often make worse decisions after careful deliberation than they do spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612468760">Dijksterhuis &amp; Aarts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612468760">Dijksterhuis, Bos, Nordgren, &amp; van Baaren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612468760">Halberstadt &amp; Levine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612468760">Igou &amp; Bless, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612468760">Lerouge, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612468760">Pelham &amp; Neter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612468760">Wilson &amp; Schooler, 1991</xref>). In the domain of subjective attitude judgment, researchers have found that attitudes based on careful thinking and analysis of reasons are less reflective of one’s true internal preferences, so decisions based on these attitudes often result in greater dissatisfaction, regret, and attitude-behavior inconsistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612468760">Dijksterhuis &amp; van Olden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612468760">Nordgren &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612468760">Wilson et al., 1993</xref>). More germane to the current research, effortful information processing has been shown to impair judgment that has an objective criterion for quality, such as predicting the outcome of actual events. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612468760">Halberstadt and Levine (1999)</xref>, participants were either asked or not asked to analyze the reasons for their predictions about the results of basketball games. People who analyzed their reasons predicted fewer winners of basketball games and predicted margins of victory that differed more from the actual margins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612468760">Dijksterhuis, Bos, van der Leij, and van Baaren (2009)</xref> showed similar results in soccer-match predictions. Participants whose attention was distracted away from the prediction task outperformed those who had an opportunity to deliberate before giving responses.</p>
<p>Such counterintuitive findings are due to the biased weighing process of deliberative thought. In nondeliberative thought, people weigh the importance of attributes appropriately, whereas conscious thought suffers from a variety of biases that can jeopardize the natural weighing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612468760">Dijksterhuis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612468760">Halberstadt &amp; Levine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612468760">Levine, Halberstadt, &amp; Goldstone, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612468760">Nordgren &amp; Dijksterhuis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612468760">Wilson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612468760">Wilson &amp; Schooler, 1991</xref>). For instance, introspection about reasons leads people to weigh the attributes in a biased manner by giving relatively greater weight to the attributes that are more salient, justifiable, and easy to articulate.</p>
<p>Extending the aforementioned research on how intensive cognitive effort during decision making deteriorates people’s objective judgment, we investigated the effect of <italic>problem specificity</italic> on prediction performance. In daily life, a problem can be posed with different levels of specificity. For instance, in predicting whether tomorrow’s highest temperature will be higher or lower than today’s highest temperature, a person may be simply asked to pick one of the three categorical responses: higher, lower, or the same. Alternatively, a person may be asked to estimate the exact temperature. Similarly, when asked to predict which three movies at the box office will draw the largest audience, one may simply pick three movies or one may rank them from the highest to the lowest. Although guessing the exact degree of temperature or the right box-office rankings would be more difficult than simply picking the correct categorical response, there is no reason to assume that one’s prediction of the overall direction of the results will depend on the framing of the question or the scale used to respond to the question. Reflecting this belief, past research has interchangeably used questions with varying specificities to assess people’s predictions of events’ general results. For example, in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612468760">Halberstadt and Levine (1999)</xref>, both “winner” and “score” questions were used to predict basketball game winners.</p>
<p>However, we suggest that people confronted with a problem involving greater specificity, such as requiring both direction and direction margin, instead of direction only, are less able to accurately predict the overall result because of the change in information processing during decision making. As in the case of deliberative thought, providing a detailed response changes the consideration of decision factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612468760">Wilson &amp; Schooler, 1991</xref>). When a rather complicated task of predicting a specific outcome is encountered (e.g., guessing a score), people deliberate on the decision problems and, hence, are likely to take into account only a subset of the relevant information and weigh information in a less natural manner, which leads to greater judgment errors.</p>
<p>We tested the prediction-specificity effect in four studies involving the prediction of outcomes of actual sports games. In Study 1, we analyzed data from an actual sports-betting business and compared the prediction accuracy of bets wagered on general outcomes with those wagered on specific outcomes. In Studies 2a and 2b, we replicated the findings of Study 1 in a setting that allowed for experimental control. Finally, Study 3 provided evidence that the differential weighting of decision information underlies the effect of problem specificity on prediction accuracy.</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In Study 1, we analyzed approximately 1.9 billion bets from Korea’s largest and most popular sports-betting company, “Sports ToTo.” This business, which is operated by a government-sponsored organization to support the Korean Sports Foundation, allows people to place various types of bets for professional sports games in both domestic and foreign leagues (e.g., English Premier League), as well as in international competitions (e.g., World Cup soccer matches). Among the possible categories, we selected soccer and baseball as the targets of our analyses because these two categories offer two types of bets that differ in prediction specificity. For each of the two categories, games played between 2008 and 2010 (i.e., a 3-year span) were analyzed.</p>
<sec id="section3-0956797612468760">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0956797612468760">
<title>Soccer</title>
<p>For the soccer category, bets on the “win/lose” and the “score” predictions were analyzed. The win/lose bet simply requires wagering on whether the home team will win, tie, or lose (i.e., people simply choose one of the three general outcomes). The score bet calls for the prediction of the final score of the match. With the score bet, people predict the final score by choosing one of the six scores for each team: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+. Of all the matches played between 2008 and 2010, 89 matches were offered for both win/lose and score bets (total number of bets = 444,095,980). These matches consisted of 29 English Premier League games and 60 Korean Soccer League games. For the score bet, each individual bet was converted to a categorical response (i.e., win, tie, or lose).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612468760">1</xref></sup> The percentage of bets that were wagered on the home team’s wins, losses, and ties were 38.8%, 37.7%, and 23.5%, respectively, for the win/lose group and 38.2%, 38.1%, and 23.6%, respectively, for the score group, with no significant difference between the two types of bets, <italic>F</italic>(2, 87) = 0.22, <italic>p</italic> = .801.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0956797612468760">
<title>Baseball</title>
<p>In the baseball category, data from “Pick 3” and “Rank 3” bets were analyzed. In the Korean Professional Baseball league, each game day features four matches. For the Pick 3 bet, people predict the three highest-scoring teams among the eight teams playing on a given day, without considering the specific ranking of the three. For Rank 3 bets, people not only pick the three highest-scoring teams, but they also have to rank them in order from highest to lowest. Thus, both types of bets involve forecasting the general results in terms of the top three scoring teams, but Rank 3 bets deal with a greater specificity because they require the prediction of both categorical and ordinal responses. We analyzed 1,479,802,212 bets for the 163 match days from 2008 to 2010.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section7-0956797612468760">
<title>Soccer</title>
<p>The average percentage of bets in which the general outcome of the game was accurately predicted (i.e., win, tie, or lose) was 43.34% (<italic>SE</italic> = 2.44). Comparison between the win/lose and the score groups showed a greater percentage of correct predictions of the general outcome among the win/lose bettors (<italic>M</italic> = 44.44%, <italic>SE</italic> = 2.74) than among the score bettors (<italic>M</italic> = 42.24%, <italic>SE</italic> = 2.15), <italic>F</italic>(1, 88) = 9.71, <italic>p</italic> = .002, <italic>d</italic> = 0.10.</p>
<p>We examined whether the effect of prediction specificity was moderated by the characteristics of the games, in particular, the year in which the game took place, the league to which the game belonged, and the actual results of the game (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612468760">Table 1</xref>). We found no significant moderation by game year and league (all <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1.0). With respect to the actual outcome of the match, the win/lose group outperformed the score group as long as the game ended with a conclusive result: when the home team won (win/lose group: <italic>M</italic> = 50.98% vs. score group: <italic>M</italic> = 47.93%), <italic>F</italic>(1, 86) = 7.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, or when the home team lost (win/lose group: <italic>M</italic> = 58.47% vs. score group: <italic>M</italic> = 54.51%), <italic>F</italic>(1, 86) = 11.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. For the games that ended in a tie, the prediction accuracy of the win/lose and the score groups did not differ significantly (win/lose group: <italic>M</italic> = 22.99% vs. score group: <italic>M</italic> = 23.50%), <italic>F</italic>(1, 86) = 0.18, <italic>p</italic> = .668.</p>

<p>Next, as a post hoc analysis, we examined the potential influence of the predictability of the game (whether the actual results turned out as expected) on the specific effect using the following regression model: ln(win/lose % ÷ score %) = <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> + <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>(predictability) + <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>(predictability)<sup>2</sup>. This regression model included the predictability of the game, assessed by the actual percentage of people who correctly predicted the direction of the game results, its quadratic terms (included to capture nonlinear relations among variables) as independent variables, and the difference in prediction accuracy between the win/lose and score groups as a dependent variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797612468760">2</xref></sup> The results showed that the predictability of the game (<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.665), <italic>t</italic>(86) = 11.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and its quadratic term (<italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub> = −1.790), <italic>t</italic>(86) = 5.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, had a significant influence on the relative advantage of the win/lose group over the score group, which indicates that the enhanced accuracy of win/lose betting increases with the level of game predictability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0956797612468760">
<title>Baseball</title>
<p>The average percentage of bets in which the top three scoring teams were correctly predicted was 2.439% (<italic>SE</italic> = 0.149), which was significantly greater than the expected probability when three teams were randomly picked (1/<sub>8</sub>C<sub>3</sub> = 1.786%, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). As expected, there was a higher percentage of correct predictions of the top three scoring teams when the specific rankings were not considered (Pick 3 condition: <italic>M</italic> = 2.454%, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.150) than when the specific rankings had to be identified (Rank 3 condition: <italic>M</italic> = 2.423%, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.149), <italic>F</italic>(1, 162) = 5.08, <italic>p</italic> = .026, <italic>d</italic> = 0.18. In addition, the predictability of the game moderated the effect: Significant linear (<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1.963), <italic>t</italic>(160) = 3.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and quadratic (<italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub> = −30.499), <italic>t</italic>(160) = −3.45, <italic>p</italic> = .001, effects of predictability demonstrated that the relative advantage of Pick 3 to Rank 3 betting is higher for games in which the team expected to win did win than for games in which the team expected to win did not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0956797612468760">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The overall findings of Study 1 provided evidence that prediction problems requiring higher specificity have a damaging effect on prediction accuracy of the event’s general outcome. However, although our use of actual betting data guaranteed the results’ ecological validity and relevance, effect sizes were relatively small (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.10 for soccer and 0.18 for baseball). In addition, the results are open to alternative interpretations. First, the increased accuracy under the simple prediction conditions (i.e., win/lose or Pick 3 bet) can be attributed to the self-selection process. For example, people with high knowledge in the domain or individuals with high risk-avoidance tendencies might have participated more in the less specific bets. Second, the difference in prediction accuracy can be due to the reward structure employed by this specific betting game. Considering that the amount of payoff increases as the number of people who bet on the same result decreases, people in the specific betting category might have betted on unlikely-to-happen scores to hit the jackpot, thereby making more judgment errors. To control for these and other potential confounds often associated with field data, we replicated Study 1 in a controlled setting in the next study. Further, we investigated whether the prediction-specificity effect is moderated by individuals’ domain knowledge.</p>

<title>Study 2a</title>
<sec id="section11-0956797612468760">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In this study, people’s predictions for the 2010 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup games were examined. The study was conducted a few days before the actual event, and participants were asked to predict the outcome of each of the 16 games scheduled to be played at the group stage. Sixty-five undergraduate students participated in the study on a voluntary basis, and the best performers in the prediction task received a cash prize of $40. Each participant was randomly assigned to either the win/lose- or score-prediction group. Following the prediction task, people responded to six questions using a 7-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 7 = <italic>very much</italic>) to assess their knowledge about soccer (“interested in soccer,” “have good knowledge about soccer,” “my knowledge about soccer is higher than my peers’,” “interested in World Cup,” “watch World Cup games,” and “play soccer-related computer games”; α = .89).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0956797612468760">
<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The participants exhibited a significantly higher accuracy in predicting the general outcome of the match (win, lose, or tie) when they simply predicted whether the team would win or lose compared with when they forecasted the final score (win/lose condition: <italic>M</italic> = .463 vs. score condition: <italic>M</italic> = .414), <italic>F</italic>(1, 63) = 5.87, <italic>p</italic> = .018, <italic>d</italic> = 0.61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612468760">Fig. 1</xref>). To test the effect of individuals’ knowledge, we regressed the percentage of correct predictions of the general outcome on the prediction type (win/lose = −1, score = 1), the mean-centered knowledge score, and their interaction term. We observed only significant effects of prediction type (<italic>b</italic> = −0.024), <italic>t</italic>(61) = −2.45, <italic>p</italic> = .017, and knowledge (<italic>b</italic> = 0.017), <italic>t</italic>(61) = 2.13, <italic>p</italic> = .037. The two-way interaction between prediction type and knowledge was not significant (<italic>b</italic> = −0.006), <italic>t</italic>(61) = −0.78, <italic>p</italic> = .441. These results suggested that although experts demonstrated better performance than novices, prediction specificity was similarly harmful for both experts and novices.</p>

<title>Study 2b</title>
<p>The purpose of Study 2b was to corroborate the findings of Study 2a using a different payment scheme. Specifically, the participants in this study received monetary rewards corresponding to the number of correct predictions made. This payment schedule was more independent than that employed in Study 2a because the payoff depended only on an individual participant’s accuracy and not on how others betted. This setup reduced people’s motivation to distinguish themselves from other players by betting on unlikely scores.</p>
<p>A few days before the start of the 2012 European Football Championship, 86 undergraduate participants predicted results for the 18 matches played at the group stage (June 12–20, 2012). The participants were rewarded with a fixed amount of money for each correct prediction they made. In the win/lose condition, participants were informed that they would receive 10 cents for each correct prediction; in the score condition, they were informed that they would receive 40 cents for each correct prediction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0956797612468760">4</xref></sup> The findings confirmed our previous results: The win/lose group (<italic>M</italic> = .535) exhibited greater accuracy in predicting the general outcome of the matches than did the score group (<italic>M</italic> = .478), <italic>F</italic>(1, 84) = 4.48, <italic>p</italic> = .037, <italic>d</italic> = 0.45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612468760">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Study 3</title>
<p>In this study, we attempted to test the mechanism underlying the prediction-specificity effect. According to our assumption, the underperformance of the specific prediction group was due to their suboptimal processing of decision information. To test this claim, we compared the win/lose and score groups on the basis of their focus on global and local information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612468760">Lerouge, 2009</xref>). Global information refers to comprehensive data that indicate the overall circumstances of the issue (e.g., past performance of two teams). In contrast, local information, although more specific and detailed, reveals only partial information and is therefore less informative about the overall picture of the event (e.g., the offense ability of two teams). We conjectured that global, rather than local, information would be more diagnostic in predicting the general direction of the game results. Further, we expected that the score bettors, compared with the win/lose bettors, would be less able to take into account this important global information and would overrely on less-important local information.</p>
<sec id="section15-0956797612468760">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The main task was to predict the results of the 16 games in the first round of the 2011 FIFA Asian Cup games (January 7–29, 2011). One hundred participants were recruited from two undergraduate classes and were asked to predict the results of the games that were scheduled to be played during the following 9 days (January 12–20, 2011). Each participant was randomly assigned to either the win/lose-prediction or the score-prediction condition and was told that the contestants with the highest performance would receive a $40 cash reward.</p>
<p>Following the prediction, the degree to which participants considered each of six factors was assessed using a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>not considered at all</italic>, 7 = <italic>seriously considered</italic>). Three items were intended to capture global information (overall performance of the two teams in the past years, overall performance of the two teams in recent years, and overall impression of the two teams). The other three items tapped into local information (defense ability, offense ability, and coaching ability of the two teams).</p>

<title>Prediction accuracy</title>
<p>Consistent with the prior three studies, findings of Study 3 showed that the win/lose group (<italic>M</italic> = .504) displayed greater accuracy than did the score group (<italic>M</italic> = .458) in predicting the general outcome of the matches, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 4.12, <italic>p</italic> = .045, <italic>d</italic> = 0.39.</p>

<sec id="section18-0956797612468760">
<title>Mediation test</title>
<p>To test convergent and discriminant validities of the six consideration items, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis. The result showed two factors. The first factor (eigenvalue = 2.82) included overall past performance, overall recent performance, and overall team image. The second factor (eigenvalue = 1.32) included teams’ defense, offense, and coaching ability. Thus, the average ratings of the first three measures formed a composite index of global information (α = .68), and the average of the latter three variables formed a composite index of local information (α = .84).</p>
<p>First, we tested the diagnosticity of global and local information in predicting the overall results. No significant relationship emerged between individuals’ use of local information and how accurately the general outcome of the match was predicted (<italic>r</italic> = .001, <italic>p</italic> = .994). In contrast, valuation of global information was a significant predictor of prediction accuracy (<italic>r</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic> = .056). This confirmed our hypothesis that global, but not local information, served as useful input into the decision.</p>
<p>Next, we compared the degree to which the win/lose and score groups relied on different types of information during decision making. The win/lose bettors considered the diagnostic global information to a greater extent than did the score bettors (win/lose condition: <italic>M</italic> = 4.83 vs. score condition: <italic>M</italic> = 4.26), <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 5.27, <italic>p</italic> = .023, <italic>d</italic> = 0.37. However, no differences were found in the consideration of less important local information between the two groups (win/lose condition: <italic>M</italic> = 3.07 vs. score condition: <italic>M</italic> = 3.19), <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.53, <italic>p</italic> = .469, <italic>d</italic> = 0.12. This Betting Type × Type of Information interaction effect was significant, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 4.57, <italic>p</italic> = .035, η<sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .03.</p>
<p>A bootstrapping analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612468760">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612468760">Zhao, Lynch, &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>) further revealed that the effect of prediction specificity (0 = win/lose, 1 = score) on prediction accuracy was mediated by the extent to which participants relied on global information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797612468760">Fig. 2</xref>). The total effect of prediction type on prediction accuracy was negative and significant (<italic>b</italic> = −0.041), <italic>t</italic>(98) = −1.75, <italic>p</italic> = .083. The indirect effect of global information was significant (<italic>b</italic> = −0.007; 90% confidence interval = [−.028, −.001]). When the indirect effect was counted, the direct effect of prediction type on prediction accuracy was no longer significant (<italic>b</italic> = −0.033), <italic>t</italic>(97) = −1.42, <italic>p</italic> = .158.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>In everyday life, people often try to be specific to be accurate. Specific analysis is one of the recommendations most commonly proposed to company managers in forecasting business outcomes. For instance, a number of articles in the <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> suggest that an accurate forecast depends on a manager’s ability to acquire detailed information, use this information to accurately predict individual components, and combine the results to form an overall picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612468760">Barnett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612468760">Georgoff &amp; Murdick, 1986</xref>). In addition to managerial practice, the association between specificity and prediction accuracy is a pervasive belief.</p>
<p>However, the research reported here provides evidence that contradicts this common knowledge. In both field and laboratory studies, we demonstrated that people asked to predict a specific (vs. general) outcome were less accurate in forecasting the direction of actual sports games. Overall, this specificity effect was more pronounced for games in which the result was expected than for games in which the result was a surprise (Study 1). This premise held true across different payment schemes (Studies 1, 2a, and 2b). We further established that low accuracy in specific predictions stemmed from a failure to appropriately consider diagnostic global information (Study 3).</p>
<p>We note the connection between the current research and previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612468760">Dijksterhuis et al., 2009</xref>). Previous research centered primarily on how different levels of intensity or the amount of information processing affect prediction accuracy, whereas the present work focused on the effect of problem specificity on prediction performance. Although, on the surface, these phenomena may look different, we believe that the processes underlying the two effects share a kinship. As people’s deliberative thinking hinders accurate prediction through unnatural information weighting, people’s attempts to obtain the correct answer in a more complicated specific prediction problem lead to greater elaborative thinking, which in turn disturbs optimal information weighting.</p>
<p>However, we found that attribute weighting bias emerged only with global information and not with local information. This result is somewhat unexpected and inconsistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612468760">Wilson &amp; Schooler, 1991</xref>). We speculate that the diverging results could have stemmed from the different prediction contexts that involved different levels of decision involvement or from the way information processing was assessed. In particular, our postdecision self-report rating provided a limited picture of online decision processes. Thus, future research can address this ambiguity by using additional process measures. For example, one can compare the online decision time and the postprediction recall of global versus local information. Additionally, having people write justifications for their predictions and then analyzing such reasoning can provide clearer insights into underlying decision processes.</p>
<p>Although we validated the specificity effect in the sports-game domain, the same effect is expected to hold in other settings in which an objective criterion for decision quality exists and in which there is little randomness in an event’s outcome. Another interesting issue is the paradoxical situation in which an individual’s greater expertise results in poorer prediction performance. Experts are more likely to select a task that calls for a complicated calibration process because of their confidence in the prediction domain. For instance, a plausible situation is that in our soccer-match prediction, the preference for a score over a win/lose bet would be more pronounced for people with greater knowledge of soccer. Given our findings that experts and novices are equally vulnerable to specificity bias, situations in which an individual’s knowledge results in a poor decision through the self-selection process can be expected.</p>
