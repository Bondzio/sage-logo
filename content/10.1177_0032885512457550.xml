<abstract>
<p>This study presents Israeli female inmates’ attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison and incentives to participation. The major findings are (a) conflict exists between the prevalence of same-sex sexual relationships among Israeli female inmates and prisoner negative attitudes toward them, (b) nearly all same-sex sexual relationships among shorter-term female inmates are based on economic exploitation and other benefits, and (c) most Jewish and Muslim female prisoners express negative attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison but, at the same time, participate in them. Unlike most female prisons in the Western world, the single women’s prison facility in Israel lacks pseudofamily networks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To date, there have been relatively few studies examining the subcultures of female prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0032885512457550">Chesney-Lind, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0032885512457550">Faith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0032885512457550">Fletcher, Shaver, &amp; Moon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457550">Giallombardo, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032885512457550">Girshick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0032885512457550">Hefernan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512457550">Hopper, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0032885512457550">Morash, Robin Haarr, &amp; Rucker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032885512457550">Pollock-Byrne, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032885512457550">Propper, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512457550">Ward &amp; Kassebaum, 1965</xref>) as well as the kinship networks and types of relationships formed in such facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032885512457550">Girshick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457550">Greer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>). Both early and current research finds that many female inmates participate consensually in “pseudofamilies,” intimate [nonsexual] dyads and/or same-sex sexual couple relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0032885512457550">Alarid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0032885512457550">Gartner &amp; Krutschnitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512457550">Koscheski, Hensley, Wright, &amp; Tewksbury, 2002</xref>). These relationships were found to substitute for lost familial roles, including daughter, wife, father, cousin, and grandmother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>) and to form a significant aspect of female prison subculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032885512457550">Pollock-Byrne, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the complex variety of ties formed by female inmates in prison has been the subject of past academic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0032885512457550">Alarid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0032885512457550">Struckman-Johnson, Struckman-Johnson, Rucker, &amp; Bumby, 1996</xref>), two areas of study have been neglected and overlooked: (a) the attitude of female inmates toward same-sex sexual relationships in female prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032885512457550">Girshick, 1999</xref>), and (b) analyses of female inmates’ subjective explanations and incentives to participation in same-sex sexual relationships. This research seeks to address this gap in the understanding of same-sex sexuality in female prisons. The study focuses on two main themes, the attitudes of female prisoners toward same-sex sexual relationships and their motivations to take part in them.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>By design, prisons generally are single-gender institutions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0032885512457550">Sykes (1958)</xref>, deprivation of heterosexual relationships constitutes one of the most significant “pains of imprisonment” (Chesney-Lind &amp; Rodriquez, 1983; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0032885512457550">Faith (1993)</xref> presents an additional list of “pains of imprisonment” for female inmates, including the stigma of incarceration, anxiety about children, and the absence of heterosexual relationships. The replacement of heterosexual relationships (at least temporarily) with homosexual ones and their permanent psychological impact on prisoners has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457550">Giallombardo, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512457550">Koscheski et al., 2002</xref>). To date, the majority of criminological and penological literature refers to two main categories of same-sex sexual relationships in female prisons: <italic>play families</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0032885512457550">Heffernan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>) and <italic>same-sex</italic> sexual relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512457550">Koscheski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512457550">Ward &amp; Kassebaum, 1965</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0032885512457550">Bosworth (1999)</xref> argued that relying on these typologies of female inmates’ adaptations is problematic because they are based on traditional gender stereotypes of female behavior and do not acknowledge the full range of female experiences and identities.</p>
<p>In 1965, Ward and Kassebaum studied the sexual behaviors of adult female inmates at the California Institution for Women in Frontera. Their study revealed that 50% of prisoners had engaged in “some form of overt sexual experience at least sometime during their sentence” (p. 92). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457550">Giallombardo’s (1966)</xref> study in the West Virginia Women’s Federal Reformatory examined sexual relationships as well as the membership and relationship of inmates in pseudofamilies within the prison facility. Interviews with the inmates, staff, and the associate warden led Giallombardo to estimate that approximately 86% of the women had had a homosexual experience of some type during their incarceration. In addition, she discovered that many inmates participated in pseudomarriages as well as “make-believe” family networks. The reasons given for participation in these partnerships included interdependence, friendship, confidence, and access to institutional goods and services that would not be readily available to the individual inmate or couple. The women also utilized these pseudofamilies as a substitute family during incarceration, serving all the functions of a biological family (economic, protective, affectionate, recreational, and social) with the exception of reproduction. Same-sex sexual relationships within the family were limited to the parents. Giallombardo concluded that these dyad and kinship relationships evolved as a result of the female prisoners’ psychological, physiological, or sociological needs.</p>
<p>Another study of same-sex sexual behavior of female inmates was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0032885512457550">Tittle (1972)</xref> in a small coed narcotic treatment center for inmates. The study revealed that 14% of the prisoners reported homosexual behavior. The main reasons given for participation in same-sex sexual behavior were companionship, warmth, and love. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0032885512457550">Heffernan’s (1972)</xref> study of 100 female inmates in the Women’s Reformatory of the District of Columbia in Occoquan, Virginia, focused on the involvement of inmates in pseudofamilies as well as “game-playing” within the prison facility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032885512457550">1</xref></sup> The study, which was based on structured interviews and surveys, found that 71% of the population were involved in sexual relationships, but only 50% to 60% of the inmates were involved in a marriage. Pseudofamilies at Occoquan were viewed by the interviewees as a critical element of facility social order. Membership within these make-believe families supplied the inmate with a sense of stability, emotional and economic support, and access to information during her incarceration. These types of relationships were therefore favored and accepted.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0032885512457550">Nelson (1974)</xref> conducted a study of homosexual behavior in female correctional facilities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. On the basis of 119 questionnaires and 34 interviews, Nelson concluded that homosexual behavior was considered to be the norm in both prison facilities and that pseudofamily networks were prevalent at both prisons. Psychological security and sexual gratification were the important factors listed for voluntary participation in such conduct. An additional study, conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0032885512457550">Propper (1976)</xref> of four female juvenile institutions and three coed juvenile institutions, focused on homosexual behavior in correctional institutions. The research revealed that 14% of the inmates were “going with” or married to another inmate. In addition, 10% of the women reported passionately kissing a fellow inmate, 10% wrote love letters to a fellow inmate, and 7% reported sexual behavior beyond just hugging and kissing. Propper concluded that same-sex sexual relationships were affected by cultural, personality, and biological variables prior to incarceration, as well as physical and emotional satisfaction within the prison facility.</p>
<p>While examining pseudofamilies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032885512457550">Propper (1982)</xref> found that 49% of the respondents reported membership in a make-believe family. Furthermore, she found that make-believe family networks consisted of basically sexless relationships (sister/sister, mother/daughter) and that membership in such families was not associated with the potentiality of homosexual behavior. Affiliation to these families occurred mainly for the purpose of a sense of confidence, companionship, fondness, attention, status, esteem, and acceptance. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0032885512457550">Hopper (1980)</xref> revealed different findings in his study of 176 female inmates in the Florida Correctional Institution in Lowell, Massachusetts, including the existence of two separate pseudofamilies in prison: the conventional family—a sexless family unit centering on security, companionship, and affection—and an additional smaller family unit revolving around traditional initiatives as well as homosexual relationships. Hopper suggested that membership in this second type of family “provided an outlet of new sexual partners for females who were predisposed to homosexual behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512457550">Koscheski et al., 2002</xref>, p. 127). A large number of studies indicated that pseudofamilies did not always include sexual relationships and that these nonsexual relationships tended to provide more security, support, guidance, and love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032885512457550">Pollock-Byrne, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1998, Owen conducted a 3-year quasi-ethnographic study of the Central California Women’s Facility (CCWF). Her study revealed that 30% to 60% of the prisoners engaged in same-sex sexual behavior and that there was a complex system of interpersonal relationships among the inmates, which were based on emotional, practical, material, sexual, and familial foundations. She also discovered that the prison families and dyads crossed both racial and ethnic boundaries. Pseudofamilies at CCWF consisted of more experienced women (both in terms of their imprisonment duration and their actual age) assuming the role of mothers and/or mentors, younger inmates taking the role of the “kids,” and more aggressive, dominant women assuming the role of father or brother. These designations, however, were flexible and could change over time. Many entered into the prison family because they had either a disruptive family on the outside or no family at all.</p>
<p>Greer examined sexual relationships, make-believe families, and friendship in a Midwestern state female correctional facility. The results of this study, based on semistructured interviews with approximately 14% (<italic>n</italic> = 35) of the prison’s population, revealed that 15 women had been involved in or were currently involved in a sexual relationship with another woman. Reasons given for participation in this type of relationship included game playing, economic manipulation, loneliness, the need for companionship, and affection. Moreover, Greer discovered that make-believe families did not exist at this facility. She concluded that modern inmates have everyday, ongoing relationships with their families on the outside as well as access to media coverage of local and world events and, thus, pseudofamilies that were traditionally formed as a proxy for the family on the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457550">Greer, 2000</xref>) have become unnecessary.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512457550">Hensley, Tewksbury, and Koscheski (2002)</xref> conducted a study of consensual sex among female inmates. The purpose of their study was dual: (a) to address same-sex sexual behavior within a female correctional facility, and (b) to predict which female inmates were most likely to participate in five same-sex sexual behaviors (kissing, touching, receiving oral sex, performing oral sex, and a fifth variable constructed as a composite of the first four to measure the rate of homosexual behavior) based on several demographic and incarcerated-related variables. Hensley et al. reported that although the subcultures and behaviors of incarcerated women have changed, at least one third of the female inmates participating in their study continued to be same-sex sexually active during incarceration. The most significant variables in the models that predicted consensual same-sex sexual activity while incarcerated were age, amount of time served (see also Keys, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512457550">2002</xref>), and religion, with age showing the greatest influence on female inmates’ same-sex sexual behavior. Women under the age of 34 were more likely to have engaged in all five types of behavior. Women who had served longer prison sentences were more likely to have engaged in same-sex sexual activities with another inmate than women who had served shorter periods of time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032885512457550">2</xref></sup> In addition, women who reported a non-Protestant religious affiliation were more likely to have performed oral sex on another inmate than those who reported a Protestant religious affiliation.</p>
<p>As indicated by the research described above, same-sex sexual relationships in female-prison facilities are common and function as a means of coping with “imprisonment pains,” thus enabling inmates to serve their prison time with the least amount of psychological discomfort. However, relatively few studies have researched this topic thus far. The challenge for researchers is, therefore, to find ways to produce valid and reliable research concerning same-sex sexual relationships in female prisons and to increase our understanding of the nature, implications, and consequences of such relationships in female prison subculture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0032885512457550" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In order to both explore the way female inmates look at same-sex sexual relationships in prison and to attach meaning to the experience, a flexible research design was utilized. This methodology allowed access to subject matters that are not predicted a priori, as well as examination of the research subject matter from the standpoint of the research sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0032885512457550">Briggs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0032885512457550">Silverman, 1993</xref>). Qualitative methodology and the phenomenological semistructured interview were used to collect and analyze data from the participants. The final stage of the analysis is a description of the main trends that emerge from the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512457550">Stake, 1995</xref>). Such an approach enabled the researchers to incorporate unexpected contents, accommodating data as they emerged, thereby enhancing the quality and authenticity of the findings.</p>
<sec id="section4-0032885512457550">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 46 adult female prisoners from a single Israeli female prison, Neve-Tirza.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032885512457550">3</xref></sup> The ethnic ratio of inmates at Neve-Tirza prison participating in this study was approximately 65.2% Jews and 34.8% [Israeli] Arabs. All participants were literate women. The mean number of years of education for the inmates was approximately 12 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.60) and the mean age was approximately 37 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12.32). Most interviewees (approximately 46%) were single, about 24% were divorced, and approximately 26% were married. Most female inmates (59%) had children; 30% of those surveyed had been in jail previously, the mean number of incarcerations was 2.2 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.70), and the mean number of months served in prison was approximately 62 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 84.70, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032885512457550">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>An approval to conduct interviews with the inmates of Neve-Tirza Prison has been received from the Research Authority of Israel Prison Service (IPS), and the Israeli Police and Prison Service Ombudsman (following a human subjects review process). The list of participants was then delivered to the researchers by the Head of the Social Workers’ Unit in Neve-Tirza prison. Randomly selected female inmates were informed of the general purpose of the study (i.e., analyzing Israeli female inmates’ subculture) and asked about their willingness to participate. The confidentiality of the interviews was ensured, and all participants signed an official informed consent form provided by the IPS. This agreement included a statement from the inmate declaring her voluntary agreement to participate in the study, acknowledging that she may withdraw from the study at any time.</p>
<p>In the 5 months that followed, the researchers (two PhD, senior-lecturers criminologists, a women and a man, aged 55 and 46, respectively) jointly conducted 115 hr of in-depth semistructured interviews with the 46 participants. The interviews were held in the educational wing of Neve-Tirza Prison during the inmates’ spare time in the mornings and afternoons, each session lasting approximately 2.5 hr.</p>
<p>The interviews with the participants were scheduled a week in advance. On the days of the interviews, the researchers were accompanied to the educational wing by correctional officers. The inmate scheduled for an interview was escorted from her cell to the educational wing. Nonetheless, no correctional officer was present during any of the interviews. To ensure the participants’ safety, they were not allowed to leave the educational wing unaccompanied by prison wardens. Interviewees were encouraged to share their prison experiences, their pains of imprisonment, and their attitudes toward consensual same-sex sexual relationships in prison with the interviewers in a setting conducive to a sense of interpersonal involvement: The two researchers and a single participant were sitting by themselves in a large, comfortable room. There were no interruptions during the session, and the atmosphere was calm and amicable. All interviews were held in Hebrew and were audio recorded with the consent of the interviewees. Recordings were preferred to notetaking for several reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032885512457550">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0032885512457550">
<title>Research Tool</title>
<p>The phenomenological semistructured interview (Spradely, 2003) was chosen as the most appropriate research tool to achieve the main research objectives. This type of interview is based on a list of questions and topics (i.e., “a guide”), developed ahead of time by the interviewer, which need to be covered during the conversation in a particular order. The interviewer follows the guide but is able to follow topical trajectories in the conversation that may stray from the guide when he or she feels this is appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0032885512457550">Pogrebin, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0032885512457550">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main advantages of such a technique are (a) it can provide reliable, comparable qualitative data, (b) it allows informants the freedom to express their views in their own terms, and (c) it enables interviewees to correct misunderstandings and vagueness in the course of the interview (Van Maanen, 2003). A summary of the major findings was drawn at the final stage of the analysis to understand the discretion, attitudes, and experiences of the subjects (Fisher, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0032885512457550">Stake, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, a “self-report personal-details” questionnaire was distributed to all interviewees. The questionnaire included demographic questions, criminal histories, and age of criminal onset of the participants’ “primary” family members.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>In view of its essentially qualitative nature, the data were subjected to content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0032885512457550">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0032885512457550">Weber, 2001</xref>), which is generally applied to narrative texts such as transcribed interviews and published works. This type of analysis seeks to expound what can be learned through respondents’ understanding of events and close examination of the content and language of texts. The objective is to uncover aspects of meaning by examining the data qualitatively. In effect, content analysis is used to examine how respondents view and understand certain issues, as well as to help examine and understand their beliefs.</p>
<p>The analysis is based on the frequency with which themes appear in the data, indicating the respondents’ attention to these particular subjects in certain situations, and the intensity with which they relate to these subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0032885512457550">Pogrebin, 2003</xref>). In this research, intensity was measured by the level of importance that the respondents ascribed to the respective topics based on the words they used to refer to them. The analysis is essentially thematic and based on categorization of content areas.</p>

<title>Economic Manipulation</title>
<p>As much as 67% of the female inmates (<italic>n</italic> = 31) speculated that economic factors were the primary reason for involvement in same-sex sexual relationships. According to their testimonies, the unequal access to money and material goods among inmates directly leads to these relationships.</p>
<p><italic>YS</italic>, a 21-year-old inmate serving her second prison term, states, “It’s all about interests. [Financially poor] inmates will have sexual relationships with other inmates who have a lot of money and can buy them many things [products] in the [prison] canteen.”</p>
<p><italic>R</italic>, a middle-aged woman, agrees to the explanation above: “Sexual relationships in prison are nothing but exploitation. It’s disgusting but that’s the truth. Many women say that these kinds of relationships are disgusting but still continue performing them for economical reasons.”</p>
<p>Inmates continually referred to “canteen whores” when describing other inmates who participate in same-sex sexual relationships simply to improve their economic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457550">Greer, 2000</xref>). The majority of female inmates are expected to work if they do not participate in the prison education wing. These inmates are assigned to various jobs according to several factors, including willingness to work, physical and mental fitness, and length of sentence. However, this does not necessarily result in an equal distribution of income. Different job assignments receive varying amounts of financial compensation. The smallest amount of money a female inmate in the Neve-Tirza prison can earn is 150 Shekels (approximately US$43) per month, and the most is 2,000 Shekels (approximately US$446) per month. This money is credited to an inmate account and can be used by the women to acquire various products from the canteen. The maximum amount of money that can be disposed by each female inmate every month is 1,500 Shekels (nearly US$335). Furthermore, some inmates have family and friends who deposit money into their [prison] bank accounts; this money can also be spent (up to a maximum of 1,500 Shekels per month) by the female inmates at the canteen.</p>
<p><italic>HA</italic>, a 52-year-old female inmate, now serving a 50-month prison term, expresses the following point of view: “There are many prisoners who act like whores . . . they tell their partners that they have sexual relationships with them because they love and care for them, but it’s really [because they wish] to get many products from the canteen [for free] or drugs. It’s pure prostitution.”</p>
<p>Two additional interesting viewpoints relating to participation in same-sex sexual relationships on the basis of economic manipulation are expressed by <italic>IS</italic> and <italic>EA</italic> (respectively), two long-timers serving their first prison term:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are many sexual relations in the “dirty wings” (i.e., housing drug addicts) but unlike the “Savion wing” (i.e., housing nondrug users), they are disgusting and based on economical interests . . . a real whorehouse.</p>
<p>Many [wealthy] girls switch partners repeatedly . . . mainly, for canteen purposes. Kind of—I will give you money and canteen products and you’ll give me your body.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As in free society, the disparity in financial standing contributes to power differentials. Female inmates who have more money are perceived as being more powerful and dominant in the prison facility than those prisoners who have less fiscal support.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most female inmates who perceive same-sex sexual relationships as prostitution are short-term inmates (sentenced to 1 to 5 years). In contrast, inmates sentenced to a long prison sentence (5 years and more) conceptualize these relationships as an expression of emotion and friendship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0032885512457550">
<title>Love</title>
<p>As much as 17% of the interviewees talked about love and care as motivations for same-sex sexual relationships in prison.</p>
<p>In reflecting on love as a significant motivational factor for same-sex sexual relationships in prison, <italic>R</italic>, a 25-year-old Jewish inmate, muses: My [same-sex] sexual relationships are part of deep relationships . . . romantic relationships with my partner. . . . I love her, I care for her, I talk to her a lot . . . and when I was released, I got my kids to visit her in prison . . . she is part of my life.”</p>
<p><italic>SI</italic>, a prisoner with 4 more years to go in a six-and-a-half-year term, suggests, “In ‘Savion’ wing [as opposed to Wings ‘A’ and ‘B’ housing drug addicts], the lesbian relationships are not disgusting and involve love, compassion, and dignity.”</p>
<p><italic>HBA</italic>, a repeat offender serving her 10th term of imprisonment, comments, “In a cold, sad and miserable place like prison, women inmates give love, warmth and affection to each other . . . suddenly, you feel that there is a shoulder you can lean on and cry . . . it does not necessarily have to do with sex but more with fondness, care and security . . . someone is taking care of you. Many woman inmates have sexual relations because they are looking for tenderness and love.”</p>
<p>It should be emphasized, however, that several interviewees disagreed with the thought that same-sex sexual relationships in female prison are based on romantic love. Based on their comments, it was apparent female inmates do not experience same-sex sexual relationships with each other in prison on the basis of a concept of care and fondness but as a way of mitigating their frustrations.</p>
<p><italic>ZA</italic>, a young female inmate, now serving a 1-year term of incarceration, states: “There are many couples in prison. The only way I can explain this phenomena is that all the girls here go nuts . . . everybody [is having sex] with everybody . . . it’s the atmosphere we have here in prison. The odd thing about it is that girls that never experienced lesbian relations outside prison [become] lesbians inside the prison. I think it’s because of the frustration and the many hours they spend together. Serious couples act as a family—[they] eat together, shop together [in the canteen], and sleep together in the same bed.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0032885512457550">
<title>Sex</title>
<p>As much as 67% of the interviewees claimed that the hunger for sex as well as the deprivation of heterosexual sexual relationships present two major incentives for inmates to take part in same-sex sexual relationships in prison.</p>
<p>Inmate <italic>AH</italic> states, “Most girls here are not lesbians but [women who] play ‘sexual games’. Girls who serve long prison sentences crave for sex . . . so it [sexual relationship] is either for sex or interests . . . and if someone else [some other inmate] will tell you differently than she is bullshitting you.”</p>
<p><italic>AE</italic>, a lifer in her late 30s, suggests: “Many girls want to have sex [sexual relationships] because they miss the sex. They [those girls] come to you and ask you straightforward if they can ‘do you’ [have sexual relationships with you].”</p>
<p><italic>MZ</italic>, a first-timer serving a 4-year term, offers this observation: “Most lesbian relationships here [in prison] are ‘situational’ and not essential. 80%-90% of the women in prison have sexual relationships for sexual or economical reasons, but once they are out [released], they look for men.”</p>
<p>An additional perspective is expressed by <italic>N</italic>, a young woman with 3 years prison experience: “Let me tell you the truth . . . I’m a bisexual and I had many same-sex sexual relations outside [prison] and lesbian experiences in prison, and it is very different. The experience I had in prison was very aggressive . . . solely physical. Women [inmates] have sex [sexual relationships] just to fulfill some physical needs . . . that’s all! I think they [lesbian inmates] ‘imported’ this attitude to prison from the outside [the general society], and continue behaving like sluts inside [the] prison [facility].”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0032885512457550">
<title>Fear</title>
<p>Only one female inmate suggested fear as a significant reason for participation in same-sex sexual conduct in prison. Although she was the only inmate who related to this issue, the researchers decided to include her viewpoint in the research discussion due to its relevance and value.</p>
<p>Inmate <italic>N</italic>: “There are many inmates I know that have sexual relations with other women because they are afraid of them . . . it’s usually between young women who have begun serving their first sentence and older veteran inmates. It’s all about fear.”</p>
<sec id="section14-0032885512457550">
<title>Attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison</title>
<p>Nearly all interviewees described their attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison. Approximately 67% of the Jewish and Muslim inmates (65.2% and 34.8% of the research population, respectively) expressed negative attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison, 13% had positive attitudes, and 20% reported experiencing relatively neutral feelings toward participation in such relationships (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0032885512457550">Table 3</xref>). These respondents indicated that although they did not wish to become involved in intimate relationships with other women, they did not judge those individuals who did choose to engage in such activity harshly.</p>

<p><italic>YH</italic>, a 58-year-old woman, now serving a long first term of incarceration, expresses this point of view: “Many girls here are disgusting . . . lesbians . . . having [same-sex] sexual relations in my cell . . . I’m shocked . . . it makes me sick . . . revolting.”</p>
<p><italic>R</italic>, a prisoner in her early 40s, suggests: “Girls [inmates] who have same-sex sexual relationships in prison have reached the lowest possible level . . . even if one has to serve a long sentence, she can release [her sexual needs] by writing letters and books.”</p>
<p>Lastly, <italic>A</italic>, a 44-year-old female inmate serving a life prison term, states her negative attitude toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison: “One thing that many people and prisoners say about a newcomer is that she will be corrupted in prison . . . and this is one of the main reasons why inmates who never had same-sex sexual experiences on the outside begin having [sexual] lesbian relationships inside [the prison facility]. I believe these girls have weak characters and such relations are repulsive.”</p>

<title>Neutral Attitudes Concerning Same-Sex Sexual Relationships in Prison</title>

I accept any kind of conduct in prison and if the [lesbian] girls enjoy [having same-sex sexual relationships] than it’s fine with me . . . let them enjoy.”</p>
<p><italic>HA</italic>, a middle-class woman, supports the feelings mentioned above: “I judge no one. I’m apathetic towards sex in prison.”</p>
<p>An additional point of view, relating to the neutral attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison, is expressed by <italic>SI</italic>, a middle-aged Muslim inmate serving her first [and relatively long] prison term: “In the Savion wing [housing non–drug-addicted inmates] the lesbian sexual relationships are nice . . . with honor and warmth, but in the other two ‘dirty’ wings [housing women who are ex-addicts] it is horrible . . . revolting, dishonorable. Personally, I do not support or oppose [sexual] lesbian relations in prison and I never had any experience in lesbianism.”</p>

<sec id="section17-0032885512457550">
<title>Positive Attitudes Regarding Same- Sex Sexual Relationships in Prison</title>
<p>As much as 13% of the participants expressed positive attitudes to same-sex sexual relationships. For instance, a 40-year-old Jewish inmate and a 21-year-old Jewish inmate [correspondingly], serving their first term of imprisonment, expressed positive attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison:</p>
<p>Prisoner <italic>EA</italic> comments: “I never had and will never have same-sex sexual relationships in prison . . . mainly because, for me, it symbolizes a kind of breakdown . . . it’s like saying to yourself that you will never ever marry in the future. However, I support these kinds of relationships because I know they help many inmates and make them happy. Once, I was even a matchmaker [for such a relationship].”</p>
<p>Inmate <italic>N</italic>: “I won’t lie to you . . . I’m a bisexual, and I believe that it’s the right of every woman to choose what kind of [sexual] life she wishes. On the outside, same-sex sexual relations between women are gentle and pleasant.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study presents Israelis female inmates’ attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison as well as the major incentives to take part in them.</p>
<p>One significant finding of this study relates to the conflict between Israeli female inmates’ same-sex sexual behavior in prison and their attitudes toward such conduct. As much as 85% of the research population admit participating, at least once, in same-sex sexual relationships in prison, and 89% of the female inmates participating in this study, regardless of whether or not they approve of such behavior, consider same-sex sexual relationships a fairly significant aspect of prison subculture, describing them as extremely prevalent. However, only 13% of the research participants expressed positive attitudes toward this type of relationship. Furthermore, 67% of the interviewees demonstrate negative attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships, perceiving them as a form of prostitution and those who participate in them as “canteen whores.” These findings strengthen Keys’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512457550">2002</xref>) argument that same-sex sexual behavior among female inmates and prisoners’ attitudes toward such relationships are not congruent and, in some cases, stand in contrast. This suggests that such sexual conduct in prison may be an outcome of the prison atmosphere and/or economical necessity rather than female inmates’ sexual preference/tendencies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, those who define same-sex sexual relationships as prostitution are mainly short-term female inmates (sentenced 1 to 5 years). In contrast, long-timers (sentenced to 5 years or more) tend to characterize these relationships as an expression of love and companionship and, therefore, participate in these relationships in a sincere and long-lasting manner. These findings correlate with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512457550">Hensley et al. (2002)</xref>, revealing that women who had served longer prison sentences were more likely to have engaged in same-sex sexual activities with another inmate than women who had served shorter sentences. Our findings therefore indicate that perception of, and participation in, same-sex sexual relationships in female prisons are linked to the length of imprisonment.</p>
<p>A second important finding of this study concerns the motivation for participation in same-sex sexual relationships in prison. Nearly all same-sex sexual relationships among shorter-term inmates studied were based on economic exploitation and other benefits. Rather than forming relatively close interpersonal relationships with other female inmates, 87.5% of the female prisoners sentenced to a short-term sentence (<italic>n</italic> = 28) became involved in same-sex sexual relationships merely to improve their economic standing in the prison. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457550">Greer (2000)</xref> revealed in her study that 71% (<italic>n</italic> = 25) of the female inmates stated that economic manipulation was the main motivation to take part in same-sex sexual relationships. However, Greer did not distinguish between female inmates sentenced to a long prison term and those sentenced to a short term of incarceration. This phenomena stands in contrast to other research findings indicating that same-sex sexual relationships are experienced as noble and practical ways of obtaining love, companionship, sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457550">Giallombardo, 1966</xref>), status, and acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0032885512457550">Propper, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512457550">Ward &amp; Kassebaum, 1965</xref>), and, thus, as an appropriate substitute for heterosexual relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0032885512457550">Hensley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>An additional important finding of this study relates to the link between ethnicity and attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison. More than two thirds of the Jewish and Muslim female prisoners participating in this study expressed negative attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison but, at the same time, 90% (<italic>n</italic> = 27) of the Jewish prisoners and 81% (<italic>n</italic> = 13) of the Muslim inmates admit to participating, at least once, in them. Since most female inmates share the “attitude-conduct” conflict, regardless of ethnicity, it could be proposed that ethnicity does not affect their attitude and behavior with regard to same-sex sexual relationships and, more important, that ethnicity is a minor factor in same-sex sexual conduct in the current Israeli female prison subculture.</p>
<p>A fourth key finding of the study concerns the lack of pseudofamily networks in women’s prison. This finding stands in contrast to previous research findings from Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0032885512457550">Obergoot-Salev, 2001</xref>) and from various Western prison facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0032885512457550">Girshick, 1999</xref>; Huggins, Capeheart, &amp; Newman, 2006; Keys, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>). Prison family networks are formed in various Western female prison facilities as an “appropriate substitute” for biological and/or normative families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0032885512457550">Pollock-Byrne, 1990</xref>). Many female inmates enter into prison pseudofamilies because they have either no family or a disruptive family on the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0032885512457550">Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>). These family structures help female inmate to effectively cope with the “pains of imprisonment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457550">Giallombardo, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0032885512457550">Hawkins, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0032885512457550">Ward &amp; Kassebaum, 1965</xref>) and constitute a significant behavioral control mechanism by lessening the stress and depression of prison life (Days, 2001). Moreover, pseudofamily networks in female prisons reflect cultural gender expectations and are a way of enabling female inmates to maintain their self-identity and self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0032885512457550">Giligan, 1982</xref>). These relationships serve the social, economical, psychological, recreational, and physiological needs of female inmates (Day, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0032885512457550">Giallombardo, 1966</xref>; Keys, 2002) and, simultaneously, enable them to respond to social beliefs about gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457550">Greer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0032885512457550">Irwin &amp; Cressey, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study present a range of possible explanations.</p>
<p>The exploitative nature of same-sex sexual relationships among Israeli female inmates, which, as mentioned previously, is only one of the four categories of motivation to participate in same-sex sexual relationships in prison, resembles the general relationships in Israeli male prisons (Einat, 2005; Einat, in press). These relationships, in short, can be characterized by verbal and physical victimization, constant tests of masculinity (especially in relation to ability and readiness to fight, physical violence, and worry), and economical (<italic>Sub-Rosa</italic>) manipulations (Einat &amp; Wall, 2006). Such modes of conduct could be explained by the routine activities theory (Felson, 1987) and the differential association theory (Sutherland &amp; Cressey, 1978). The former assumes that any antisocial or delinquent act is an “outcome of a situation where an opportunity to perform a crime occurs . . . and one individual or more are motivated to commit it” (Gideon, 2003, p. 12). The latter claims that antisocial or delinquent behavior, similar to any type of conduct, is learned by means of interaction with significant others in a communicative process (Akers, 1997). Since victimization of fellow inmates is a normative learned process that functions as a principal criterion for membership in the Israeli prisoners’ subculture, it is perceived as a rational act (Becker, 1963). Similarly, the usage of same-sex sexual relationships as a way of economic exploitation is perceived as a rational and normative learned process in the Israeli female prisoners’ subculture. Accordingly, it could be speculated that Israeli female inmates are presently going through a “masculinization” and/or “liberation” process, meaning that they are becoming more like [male] inmates and freeing themselves from the constraints of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0032885512457550">Chesney-Lind, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0032885512457550">James, 1980</xref>). In this spirit, and in contrast to Girschik’s (1999) findings regarding the nonexploitative nature of same-sex sexual relationships in female prisons and the exploitative nature in male prisons, it may be suggested that this trend will continue to the point where most same-sex sexual relationships among Israeli female inmates will be based on manipulation rather than warmth and love. As for the scarcity of pseudofamilies, it could be argued that such networks, traditionally formed as a proxy for the family on the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457550">Greer, 2000</xref>), became redundant in the Israeli female prison subculture due to weekly meetings and everyday “phone calls” with the inmates’ families on the outside.</p>
<p>Last, the tremendous prevalence of same-sex sexual relationships in the only Israeli female prison facility in spite of negative inmate attitudes toward them may reflect the changing perpetrator of female prison sexual relationships. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0032885512457550">Festinger’s (1957)</xref> dissonance cognitive theory and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0032885512457550">Kelman’s (1974)</xref> arguments regarding the ability of behavior to change attitude when there is a conflict between these two variables (i.e., behavior and attitudes), it can be postulated that same-sex sexual relationships will continue to take place in the future and that the female inmates’ attitudes toward them will thus become increasingly positive.</p>
<p>The current study has two main limitations: (a) the validity of the inmates’ responses, and (b) sample size. First, as mentioned previously, all data were collected by phenomenological semistructured interviews. Since several studies have indicated that same-sex sexual relationships in female prisons are underreported due to reluctance of becoming a “snitch,” shame, and fear of being stigmatized as a “canteen whore” (Eigenberg, 1994; Einat, in press; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0032885512457550">Greer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0032885512457550">Koscheski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0032885512457550">Owen, 1998</xref>, pp. 21-22), it is possible that other sophisticated data collection techniques (i.e., ethnographic observation, written self-reports, interviewing past and future prison intelligence officers), as well as more convenient settings for interviews (i.e., outside the prison facility), may reveal more detailed data as well as additional findings not in the present work.</p>
<p>Second, the results of this research are based on interviews with only 25% of the total population of the female inmates in the prison facility. Hence, the researchers cannot be sure that the attitudes toward same-sex sexual relationships in prison as well as the incentives to take part in them stated in this article truly represent the perspectives and attitudes of the total female inmate population.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the researchers believe that the results of this study add to the existing knowledge base regarding the attitudes toward and role of same-sex sexual relationships in female prison facilities.</p>
<p>As a final note, it should be emphasized that female prison sexual relationship research in Israel and worldwide is currently incomplete and fails to adequately address the policy needs of correctional authorities. We know very little about how female prisoners create characterizations of sexuality, and very few studies have concentrated on similarities or differences in sexual terms and roles in prisons in different countries or regions. There is a lack of accurate data regarding sexual victimization and manipulation of female prisoners by correctional officers, and there is no gender-oriented research regarding the resemblance or dissimilarities in meanings, functions, and implications of same-sex sexual relationships in male and female prisons. The existing literature on female prison sexual relationships hardly touches upon any of these areas. There is a great need for additional research that addresses these issues, so that we can begin to explore the answers to these types of questions.</p>

<p>Preference was given to recording rather than taking notes during the conversation because (a) detailed notetaking can distract both researcher and interviewee and disrupt the conversation, (b) it is mentally exhausting to listen closely to everything said while taking accurate notes, and (c) it is important to keep data collection and analysis separate and avoid premature conclusions before all of the data are in, and taking notes requires the researcher to make judgments about what is <italic>important</italic> during the interview (Doyle, 2001).</p>

<p>The main advantage of such an interview is that it enables the interviewee to correct misunderstandings and vagueness in the course of the interview. This flexibility contributes to the quality and credibility of the interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0032885512457550">Rubin &amp; Rubin, 1995</xref>).</p>
