<abstract>
<p>Current Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines inadequately address the limitations of central venous pressure monitoring, which are due, in part, to right and left ventricular dysfunction associated with sepsis. Septic cardiomyopathy is well described in the literature but is both underrecognized and undertreated clinically. Direct cardiac assessment with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has documented advantages, but is limited by single evaluations and the need for advanced training. Recently, a disposable, monoplane TEE probe that provides for serial echocardiographic assessments in unstable patients to guide medical management, or hemodynamic TEE (hTEE), has been introduced. This article reviews a case of a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Child’s A cirrhosis who underwent an uneventful off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and 2 days later developed septic shock from pneumonia complicated by right ventricular dysfunction. hTEE provided a rational guide to fluid resuscitation, vasopressor, and inotropic therapy with ensuing patient convalescence. Although there is a lack of hTEE experience among current intensivists, there is a desire to learn echocardiography as witnessed by the success of echocardiography courses and interest among critical care fellows. Future work to assess echocardiographic hemodynamic protocols and their effect on outcomes will be important.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The surviving sepsis guidelines advocate goal-directed therapy for the treatment of septic shock with an initial resuscitation target central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 to 12 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure of ≥65 mm Hg using vasopressors if needed, urine output (UOP) of ≥0.5 mL/kg/h, and central venous oxygen saturation (S<sc>cvo</sc><sub>2</sub>) ≥70% or mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥65%. If the latter goals are not met, additional interventions including additional fluid, transfusion to a hematocrit &gt;30%, and/or the addition of an inotrope may be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612442686">1</xref></sup> Nevertheless, CVP and pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are known to be poor surrogate markers of volume responsiveness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612442686">2</xref></sup> as they are influenced by venous and ventricular compliance, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and valvular pathology. This is compounded in septic shock, which carries a high incidence of both RV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612442686">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612442686">4</xref></sup> and left ventricular (LV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612442686">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612442686">6</xref></sup> dysfunction. Although these limitations are well described in the literature, they are underappreciated in the clinical setting as the current standard of care still relies on CVP monitoring.</p>

<p>Direct assessment of cardiac function by echocardiography has documented advantages, but until recently has been limited to single, acute evaluations by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and by education and training among intensivists in both transthoracic echocardiography and TEE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612442686">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612442686"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612442686">9</xref></sup> The ClariTEE probe (ImaCor, Inc, Garden City, NY) is a disposable, monoplane TEE probe approved by the Food and Drug Administration for 72 hours of use that provides for serial echocardiographic assessments in unstable patients to guide medical management, or hemodynamic TEE (hTEE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612442686">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612442686">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although a full exam is not possible, a limited exam consisting primarily of the transgastric short-axis view and mid-esophageal 4-chamber view allows for assessment of RV and LV function and filling, and is easily repeatable to monitor response to therapy. Normally, the RV is two thirds the size of the LV as seen in the 4-chamber view. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), the movement of the tricuspid annulus toward the apex of greater than 2 cm, is another metric of free wall movement and RV function. Finally, gross assessment of wall thickening by visualization of the RV free wall is key to the hemodynamic assessment of function. Here we present a case that demonstrates the utility of hTEE in the management of a patient with new onset RV dysfunction from septic shock.</p>

<title>Case</title>
<p>SJ is a 48-year-old gentleman with a 50 pack-year history of tobacco abuse and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1 of 77% on no preoperative bronchodilators, alcohol abuse with Child’s A cirrhosis and prior delirium tremens (DT), a cardiac arrest, and peripheral arterial disease. He had been symptomatic for 3 to 4 months with dyspnea and palpitations exacerbated by activity, but finally decided to seek medical attention for hallucinations and palpitations after ingesting some Lortab that he had purchased on the street. Cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease. He underwent an uneventful off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting on hospital day 2, with complete revascularization and a normal ejection fraction on intraoperative TEE. Postoperatively, he received modest doses of benzodiazepines for DT prophylaxis per Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment protocol, but otherwise his postoperative ICU course was uneventful, and he was transferred to the step-down unit in stable condition on postoperative day (POD) 1. On POD 2, he returned to the ICU with septic shock manifested by hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 76%, hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s mm Hg, and oliguria with a UOP of 200 mL over 24 hours. He continued to deteriorate despite early cultures and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient required endotracheal intubation and bilevel mechanical ventilation for hypoxemia as he progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome from an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> pneumonia documented by a bronchial alveolar lavage culture. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and central venous line was initiated, as the patient required a substantial, 5-L fluid resuscitation and multiple vasopressors. Initially, the patient was on norepinephrine, but as the dose escalated &gt;10 µg/min, vasopressin 0.04 U/min was added as per our practice protocol. His initial S<sc>cvo</sc><sub>2</sub> was 47% and his base deficit and lactate went as high as −4.1 and 2.5 mmol/L, respectively. To guide resuscitation and monitor cardiac function, a ClariTEE probe was placed at the bedside with a Dobhoff feeding tube still in place. hTEE demonstrated new RV dysfunction with apical sharing, indicative of an enlarged RV, decreased TAPSE, and grossly decreased thickening of the RV free wall in the mid-esophageal 4-chamber view secondary to sepsis. The transgastric short-axis view demonstrated grossly normal LV function, but there was paradoxical septal motion in which the septum was bouncing toward the RV in systole and a characteristic “D” shaped LV from RV dilatation. Low-dose epinephrine at 2 µg/min was chosen in the setting of hypotension for inotropy and RV support with improvement of RV function over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451612442686">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1944451612442686">3</xref>). Subsequent to the initiation of epinephrine and initial improvement in RV function, a random cortisol level suggested relative adrenal insufficiency, so stress dose hydrocortisone was also added. Over the next 24 hours, the patient’s hemodynamics improved dramatically, and he was weaned off all vasopressors except for low-dose epinephrine, which was stopped a few hours later based on resolution of RV dysfunction. The patient’s ventilator was weaned over the next several days as the patient underwent diuresis and continued clinical improvement.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Right ventricular dysfunction occurs in about one third of patients in septic shock and is frequently found in conjunction with LV dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612442686">11</xref></sup> This septic cardiomyopathy is acute, reversible, and associated with low or normal filling pressures. RV failure in sepsis may be the result of acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or an intrinsic decrease in contractility from circulating cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451612442686">12</xref></sup> Although this has long been appreciated in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612442686">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612442686">4</xref></sup> it has been not been well addressed in clinical practice, including in the latest guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612442686">1</xref></sup> Assessment of endpoints of resuscitation and in particular, RV function, has been largely limited to the invasive measurement of PAP or noninvasive pulse contour analysis, esophageal Doppler, or bioimpedance. Pulse pressure variations are not necessarily associated with fluid responsiveness but can be related to RV failure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612442686">13</xref></sup> and assessment of RV ejection fraction by rapid thermistor may not adequately reflect RV dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612442686">14</xref></sup> Echocardiography, however, provides a means for direct and serial assessments of RV and LV function and volume status in the ICU. This allows for a rational approach to fluid resuscitation, vasopressor, and inotrope administration targeted at the underlying pathology, for example, hypovolemia or cardiac dysfunction, and the ability to monitor response to therapy over time. While RV dysfunction and sepsis may be reversed with norepinephrine alone by restoring coronary perfusion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612442686">11</xref></sup> in this case inotropic support with epinephrine led to the reversal of this new onset RV dysfunction. Although the effect of management changes guided by echocardiography on morbidity and mortality is not certain, clinical value from direct assessment in conjunction with other clinical findings is a rational approach to clinical practice when the evidence cannot fully guide our therapies.</p>
<p>This case highlights the rapid interval development of RV dysfunction in a previously normal heart over the course of 48 hours secondary to septic shock and the utility of direct assessment of cardiac function with hTEE. In the past, echocardiography has been limited by resources and education. There has been a reduction in both the size and cost of TEE systems and the development of small, disposable probes for TEE, similar in size to a nasogastric tube, which allow for serial, episodic assessment of cardiac function and preload. Institutions can thus have dedicated ultrasound machines for use in the ICU with immediate availability on a continuous basis. There is a lack of experience in the current practicing generation of intensivists limiting the spread of critical care ultrasound. However, the success of the many echocardiography courses shows the desire of clinicians to increase their knowledge. Residents and fellows are increasingly interested in echocardiography and many institutions, including our own, have or are developing an echocardiography training program for critical care fellows. It is time for the United States to join our European colleagues in using echocardiography as a cornerstone of resuscitation. Future work to assess echocardiographic hemodynamic protocols and their effect on outcomes will be extremely important.</p>
