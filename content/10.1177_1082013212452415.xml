<p>In present study, spray-dried sourdough was produced using a pilot scale spray dryer and the physico-chemical and microbial characteristics of the obtained sourdough powder were investigated. The application of the spray-dried sourdough at different levels (3%, 6%, 9% and 15%) in breadmaking was also evaluated. Bulk density, wettability and suspensibility of the sourdough powder were 0.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 98 s and 29%, respectively. The most of the powder particles were in a range of 106–250 µm. The spray-dried sourdough had a moisture content and ash content of 3.72% and 1.9% (db), respectively. The pH and total titratable acidity of the sourdough powder were 3.26 and 59 (mL of 0.1 N NaOH/10 g powder), respectively. Spray drying reduced lactic acid bacteria population of the sourdough to 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/g compared to the initial value of 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/g. Iranian traditional flat bread (Sangak) made with different levels of the sourdough powder had significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) lower pH and higher total titratable acidity compared to those of the control. The results of sensory evaluation showed that Sangak breads containing 15% sourdough powder were slightly darker and sourer than the other breads. Incorporation of spray-dried sourdough delayed bread staling, as judged by sensory panel. The results suggest that spray-dried sourdough at the level of 9% can be successfully used for Sangak breadmaking, leading to bread with an improved flavor and delayed staling.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013212452415" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of sourdough in breadmaking is one of the oldest biotechnological processes that are still popular as a mean to improve the quality of wheat breads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212452415">Clarke and Arendt, 2005</xref>). In addition to traditional sourdoughs, there are two forms of sourdoughs: liquid (fresh) and powder sourdough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452415">Kulp and Lorenz, 2003</xref>). The sourdough starter cultures were developed around 1910 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452415">Brandt, 2007</xref>) and were initially distributed in liquid form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013212452415">Santivarangkna et al., 2007</xref>). Sourdough starters contain high concentrations of living microorganisms and may be as simple or mixed starters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452415">Kulp and Lorenz, 2003</xref>). Microbial starters improve dough and bread characteristics and also increase the nutritive value and the shelf life of wheat breads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212452415">Cossignani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013212452415">Martinez-Anaya et al., 1993</xref>). Starter cultures have simplified the sourdough production and have led to a constant quality in breadmaking. However, they cannot affect fermentation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452415">Brandt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452415">Kulp and Lorenz, 2003</xref>). Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop shelf-stable dried sourdoughs as convenient bakery ingredients. Dried sourdoughs are obtained from mature sourdoughs and stabilized via freeze-drying, spray granulation, fluidized bed drying, drum drying and spray drying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452415">Brandt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212452415">Decock and Cappelle, 2005</xref>). The sourdoughs for drying should be pumpable with a dough yield more than 200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452415">Brandt, 2007</xref>). Spray drying is an economical process and also very suitable for the continuous production of dried powders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013212452415">Peighambardoust et al., 2011</xref>). Spray drying has been extensively used in the food industry, especially in dairy industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212452415">Gianfrancesco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013212452415">Schuck, 2002</xref>). Spray drying is also one of the most commonly used drying techniques in production of dried sourdoughs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212452415">Decock and Cappelle, 2005</xref>). In the spray drying process, liquid sourdough is sprayed into a hot drying chamber, resulting in moisture evaporation while sourdough droplets are falling down in the hot air. Depending on the drying technique, key flavor compounds may be reduced or increased after drying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452415">Brandt, 2007</xref>). Spray-dried sourdoughs are usually applied for low-acidity products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452415">Kulp and Lorenz, 2003</xref>). The physical characteristics and microbiological quality of sourdough powders can be different depending on the spray drying conditions. Physico-chemical and microbial characteristics of spray-dried sourdoughs are important. Physical characteristics affect powder behavior during storage and handling. Chemical properties, especially acidity, determine the technological and sensory characteristics of the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013212452415">Pagani et al., 2007</xref>). In the case of dairy powders, a number of tests have been developed as quality control measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212452415">Augustin and Clarke, 2008</xref>), but there are few reports on the properties of spray-dried sourdoughs. Therefore, in the present study, physico-chemical and microbiological properties of a spray-dried sourdough containing <italic>Lactobacillus paralimentarius</italic> were investigated. In addition, the functionality of such powder in improving the quality of Sangak flat bread was studied. <italic>L. paralimentarius</italic> was isolated from traditional sourdoughs in the rural regions of East-Azarbaijan province, Iran. It was also one of the most important <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species in Iranian traditional sourdoughs.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1082013212452415"><title>Ingredients</title>
<p>Commercial baker’s wheat flour with 12 g/100 g moisture, 10 g/100 g protein (db), 1 g/100 g ash and 322 s falling number was obtained from Tabriz-Kar flour mill, Tabriz, Iran. Baker’s yeast and also table salt were purchased from local market.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1082013212452415"><title>Microorganism and sourdough preparation</title>
<p><italic>L. paralimentarius</italic> used in this study was previously isolated from Iranian traditional wheat sourdoughs. The strain was cultured twice in MRS broth at 30 °C for 24 h under aerobic conditions. Microbial cells were then harvested using centrifugation (3000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), washed twice in sterile distilled water and resuspended in sterile distilled water. Sourdough was prepared by mixing 1500 g of wheat flour (1.8 g/100 g ash), 3750 mL of tap water and the inoculums of <italic>L. paralimentarius</italic> (10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/g) in a plastic container. Fermentation was performed inside a shaker incubator (speed of 150 r/min) at a temperature of 30 °C for 20 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013212452415"><title>Spray drying of sourdough</title>
<p>A pilot-scale spray dryer (Maham Sanat, Neishaboor, Iran) with a co-current configuration was used. A pump delivered the liquid sourdough to a rotary atomizer with atomizing air pressure of around 2 bars and sprayed sourdough particles were evaporated in a vertical drying chamber. The inlet and outlet air temperatures were 180 °C and 90 °C, respectively. Sourdough powder was collected directly both from the bottom of the chamber and from a cyclone. The powder was stored in air tight bottles at 4 °C for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013212452415"><title>Microbial analysis</title>
<p>The number of lactic acid bacteria in sourdough before and after spray drying was determined by surface spread method on duplicate plates of MRS medium. Liquid and spray-dried sourdough samples (10 g) were added to 90 mL of sterile 0.1% peptone water, homogenized and diluted in series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212452415">Kearney et al., 2009</xref>). Enumeration was carried out after incubation at 30 °C for 24–48 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013212452415"><title>Physico-chemical analysis of sourdough powder</title>
<p>Bulk density was measured by pouring 30 g of spray-dried sourdough into a dry measuring cylinder, tapping the cylinder and recording the volume. The bulk density was the ratio of powder weight to its volume and expressed as gram per cubic centimeter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013212452415">Wright et al., 2009</xref>). Suspensibility and wettability of the spray-dried sourdough were determined by a procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013212452415">Teera-Arunsiri et al. (2003)</xref>. Spray-dried sourdough sample was analyzed for particle size distribution through a number of sieves with different mesh sizes ranging from 53 to 500 µm. The total titratable acidity (TTA) and pH of the powder were measured following the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013212452415">Savić et al. (2007)</xref>. Moisture content was determined by oven drying at 102 °C according to the International Dairy Federation Bulletin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212452415">Anonymous, 1993</xref>) and water activity (a<sub>w</sub>) was measured with a water activity meter (Rotronic Hygropalm HC2-AW, Bassersdorf, Switzerland). Ash content was determined by incineration of the sample at 550 °C according to the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212452415">AACC (2000)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1082013212452415"><title>Breadmaking process</title>
<p>The spray-dried sourdough fermented by <italic>L. paralimentarius</italic> was used at the levels of 3, 6, 9 and 15 g/100 g of flour in the production of Sangak bread. Sangak is an Iranian flat bread, which is produced from wholemeal wheat flour. Bread dough formulation was 2000 g flour, 1700 mL tap water, 20 g baker’s yeast and 20 g salt. Breadmaking was carried out according to the traditional method for Sangak bread by an expert baker. All ingredients were mixed to obtain homogenous dough meeting requirements for Sangak baking. The ingredients were mixed in a spiral mixer (Sepah-Kar, Isfahan) at a speed of 40 r/min for 10 min in room temperature. Dough was subsequently fermented for 1 h at 30 ± 3 °C. Dough pieces (400 g) were sheeted and slid onto the hot pebbles of the oven by a special convex peddle. Baking was performed at 300 °C for 4 min. Breads were let to cool at room temperature before packaging. Bread was packed in plastic bags and kept at 25 °C before analysis. Analyses were performed over a 3 days of storage at room temperature. Baking trials were carried out in duplicate.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1082013212452415"><title>Bread evaluation</title>
<p>Moisture content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212452415">AACC, 2000</xref>), shelf-life and sensory characteristics of Sangak bread were evaluated during storage. The packed bread slices were stored at 25 °C for 5 days and checked daily for the manifestation of visible mold growth. The time for the molds to become visible in the bread was considered as bread shelf-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212452415">Gerez et al., 2009</xref>). The pH values and TTA of the dough and bread (in a fresh stage) were determined according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013212452415">Robert et al. (2006)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013212452415"><title>Sensory evaluation</title>
<p>Sensory evaluation was carried out using Iranian flat bread evaluation method reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212452415">Azizi et al. (2003)</xref>. A total of 10 trained food science students participated in the study. Panelists were asked to evaluate five coded pieces of Sangak bread using two questionnaires for sensory quality (appearance, color, acidic flavor, taste, softness, chewiness and overall acceptability) and sensory staling (taste, softness, chewiness and overall acceptability). Bread samples were evaluated 1 h after baking and on days 1, 2 and 3. Both sensory evaluation forms consisted five distinct points on hedonic scale (1 = extremely dislike, 3 = neither like nor dislike and 5 = extremely like). Panelists rinsed their mouths with tap water between each evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013212452415"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All tests were measured at least in triplicate, and data were averaged. The results of lactic acid counts before and after spray drying were expressed in CFU/g. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using SAS software (version 9.1). Data were compared using analyses of variance and by the Duncan’s multiple range test with a probability of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The results obtained from sensory evaluation of staling rate during storage were analyzed using a completely randomized design test.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1082013212452415"><title>Physico-chemical properties of spray-dried sourdough</title>
<p>The spray-dried sourdough had an ash content of 1.9% ± 0.02. The moisture content and water activity were 3.72% ± 0.17 and 0.16 ± 0.01, respectively. There are different drying methods to produce type III sourdough including spray drying and drum drying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452415">Kulp and Lorenz, 2003</xref>). It was shown that moisture content and water activity are important factors for storage stability of dried powders. In the case of food powders containing probiotics, water activity should be below 0.25 and moisture content below 5% for safe storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212452415">Chavez and Ledeboer, 2007</xref>). Our spray-dried sourdough had a moisture content of below 5%, which is acceptable for most powders.</p>
<p>Bulk density, wettability and suspensibility of the spray-dried sourdough were 0.6 ± 0.01 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, 98 ± 12 s and 29% ± 1.3, respectively. The results of the sieve particle size analysis were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212452415">Table 1</xref>. The most of the spray-dried sourdough particles were in a range of 106–250 µm. Bulk density is an important factor, which can influence physical characteristics of powder including dispersibility, wettability and instantizing. Drying parameters, atomization methodology, particle size distribution and shape of the powder have an important role in the final bulk density of powder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212452415">Augustin and Clarke, 2008</xref>). The spray-dried sourdough had a bulk density of 0.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, which was in the range of skim milk powders. The wettability is the other important attribute of powders for reconstitution. Reconstitution ability depends on the ability of a powder to be wet, to sink, to disperse and finally to dissolve. The wettability of the spray-dried sourdough was 98 s, and therefore, it is considered as a non-instant powder. Wettability and dispersibility of the powder can be influenced by particle size. Generally, large particles and particles in agglomeration form have good dispersibility. Larger and irregular shaped particles provide more space in the interstices for wetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212452415">Caric, 1994</xref>). Atomization parameters influence the powder shape and size. Spray-dried powders usually are spherical. Increasing spray pressure in rotary atomizer could produce more fine particles. As a result, dispersibility of these powders decreases as the percentage of fine particles is increased.

<p>The acidity of dried sourdoughs can vary between 15 and 60 (mL of 0.1 N NaOH/10 g sample) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013212452415">Pagani et al., 2007</xref>) or 40–220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452415">Brandt, 2007</xref>) depending on the production process of the sourdough, the initial raw material and drying technique. The flour type has a considerable effect on acidification characteristics of the sourdough and the property of sourdough bread. The acid values and flavor compounds in sourdoughs made from flour with high extraction rate (ash, 1.8%) were reported to be higher than the values in sourdoughs made from straight-grade flour (ash, 0.66%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212452415">Hansen and Hansen, 1994</xref>). In the present study, the sourdough was prepared from wholemeal flour, and therefore, the pH value of the obtained spray-dried sourdough was relatively low. Spray drying resulted in the reduction of lactic acid bacteria counts in the spray-dried sourdough with a microbial population of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/g. Lactic acid bacteria are exposed to heat and dehydration damage during spray drying. The factors that strongly influence the drying survival are bacterial species and outlet-air temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212452415">Carvalho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013212452415">Riveros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013212452415">To and Etzel, 1997</xref>). In this study, we used outlet-air temperature of 90 °C to yield a powder with a moisture content below 5%, which is required for storage stability. This temperature probably resulted in microbial cell death. Several authors also reported low survival rate at outlet-air temperature of 90 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013212452415">Kim and Bhowmik, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013212452415">To and Etzel, 1997</xref>). However, the spray-dried sourdoughs are concentrated and stable sourdoughs, which can give taste and flavor to end-product, facilitate the bread making process and create better working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452415">Kulp and Lorenz, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec15-1082013212452415"><title>Effect of spray-dried sourdough addition on acidity of Sangak dough and bread</title>
<p>The pH and TTA values of bread samples and their doughs before baking are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013212452415">Table 3</xref>. The control dough and bread had a significantly higher pH and lower TTA values than those of doughs and breads containing spray-dried sourdough. As expected, increasing the level of spray-dried sourdough in the bread resulted in decreasing pH values and consequently increasing TTA values. The pH values obtained for control bread, bread containing 9% and 15% spray-dried sourdough were 5.8, 5.36 and 4.58, respectively. However, depending on the rate of spray-dried sourdough addition, the pH of the dough and bread will vary. Similar results were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452415">Kulp and Lorenze (2003)</xref>. The pH values of 5.21 and 4.75 were reported for breads containing 20% and 40% sourdough, respectively. A decrease of TTA was observed in bread samples compared to fermented doughs due to the effect of baking on volatile short chain acids.

<p>Although a slightly darker crust was observed in bread containing 15% spray-dried sourdough, there were no significant differences (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the sensory attributes (appearance and color) among the bread samples at all levels of spray-dried sourdough addition (data not shown). There was no significant difference in acidic flavor and overall acceptability among bread samples. However, panelists judged breads containing 15% spray-dried sourdough slightly sourer compared to other breads due to its lower pH. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452415">Figure 1</xref> shows that breads containing 3% and 6% spray-dried sourdough were firmer than the control. The highest softness score (4.7 out of 5) was obtained for breads containing 9% spray-dried sourdough (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452415">Figure 1</xref>). Sensory characteristics of bread are the most important parameters influencing its acceptance by the consumers. Starter culture, type of flour, fermentation conditions and dough yield are factors that affect bread flavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013212452415">Katina et al., 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013212452415">Robert et al.

<sec id="sec17-1082013212452415"><title>Effect of spray-dried sourdough on Sangak bread staling</title>
<p>The results for sensory characteristics of Sangak breads stored at room temperature are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212452415">Table 4</xref>. There is a trend of staling in terms of significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduction in bread chewiness scores at all levels of spray-dried sourdough addition. The highest sensory scores of ‘taste’ were obtained for fresh samples (just after baking). The lowest taste scores were related for breads stored for 3 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013212452415">Table 4</xref>). This was due to the growth of molds (in some cases) and staling. There was a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the overall acceptability of bread samples containing spray-dried sourdough compared to those of control. Sangak breads containing different levels of spray-dried sourdough had the highest scores compared to those of control. The control bread staled at day 1 and had a firmer texture than the sourdough breads. Bread containing 9% spray-dried sourdough exhibited superior sensory characteristics upon storage. Increasing sourdough level to 15% had a negative effect. Bread containing 9% spray-dried sourdough maintained a softer texture than the other bread samples upon different days of storage. Some researchers reported that incorporation of sourdough delays bread staling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212452415">Corsetti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013212452415">Crowley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013212452415">Gül et al., 2005</xref>). The production of dextrins and organic acids as well as gluten proteolysis could impart in retarding bread staling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212452415">Arendt et al., 2007</xref>). Solubilization of arabinoxylans during long fermentation might be another reason for improved crumb softness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212452415">Katina, 2005</xref>). It should be noted that sourdough addition can have a negative effect on bread quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212452415">Armero and Collar, 1996</xref>) depending on the fermentation conditions and sourdough types. If fermentation conditions were not optimized, sourdough addition would even increase bread firmness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212452415">Katina, 2005</xref>).

<p>The appearance of molds on bread samples during storage at 25 °C was considered as bread shelf-life. Addition of sourdough powder showed no effect against molds. All Sangak breads were spoiled after 3 days. Fungal spoilage of wheat bread was reported to be mainly due to <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. This species is the most resistant mold and can grow at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013212452415">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>). In our study, the pH values of the breads were in the range of 4.58 to 5.34. Therefore, the pH probably was not low enough to retard mold growth. Similar results were also reported in the case of <italic>Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis</italic> sourdough bread and chemically acidified bread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013212452415">Ryan et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, baking conditions of Sangak bread might cause to produce breads with different thickness and crumb moisture contents. Consequently, high moisture content in crumb bread and also proper temperature during storage could provide suitable conditions for mold growth.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1082013212452415" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The development of sourdough powder holds a number of advantages over fresh sourdough including longer shelf-life, a constant product quality and lower transportation cost. This study demonstrated the possibility of producing spray-dried sourdough for breadmaking purpose. Physico-chemical analysis showed that spray-dried sourdough had physical properties, which is acceptable for most powders. Moisture content and water activity were low enough to provide longer shelf-life in the product. Nevertheless, the drying process resulted in the reduction of lactic acid bacteria counts in the sourdough, which could be avoided by some precautions in the spray drying process. Sensory analyses of bread containing spray-dried sourdoughs showed positive effects on retarding Sangak staling. Most of sensory attributes of Sangak bread were improved upon incorporating sourdough powder into the flour, especially at 9% addition.</p>
