<abstract>
<p>Received October 7, 2010, and in revised form November 10, 2010. Accepted for publication December 7, 2010. <bold>Background:</bold> Elderly patients comprise an increasing proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Advanced age and multiple comorbidities compromise their immunity and hence they may be more prone to succumbing to severe infection and have poorer outcome. We undertook this study to review impact of severe sepsis on mortality in the elderly patients. <bold>Methods:</bold> All patients admitted to a medical ICU of a tertiary care institute with severe sepsis or septic shock were prospectively included. Patients were divided into young (age below 60 years), old (age between 60 and 80 years), and very old (age above 80 years) groups. Data regarding baseline patient characteristics, admission APACHE II score, and ICU course including need for organ support and ICU length of stay were noted. Categorical data were analyzed using χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066610397116">2</xref></sup> or Fisher Exact test as appropriate and continuous data were analyzed using Student <italic>t</italic> test. Primary outcome measure was the ICU mortality. <bold>Results:</bold> Of 387 patients with sepsis, 132 patients who fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis/septic shock were included in the analysis. The most common suspected site of infection was lungs (45.5%), followed by urinary tract (21.2%) and abdomen (16.7%). Intensive care unit mortality in younger patients was 45.6% as compared to 60.7% in old and 78.9% in very old patients (<italic>P</italic> = .035). The relative risk (RR) for dying in the old age was 1.125 and RR for dying in the very old age group was 1.487 as compared to the young patients. There was an increased need for organ support in the elderly and very elderly population as compared to the younger population. On multivariate analysis, only age of the patient was found to be independently predicting ICU mortality (<italic>P</italic> = .002, OR: 1.038, 95% CI: 1.014-1.062). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The risk of dying from severe sepsis is considerably higher in the elderly and very elderly subgroup of patients with age as an independent risk factor for mortality. Hence, early aggressive care to recognize and manage severe sepsis is required to improve outcome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Globally, elderly population is increasing. This phenomenon of aging population is due to “demographic transition” in which both mortality and fertility is decreasing. The probability of survival to older age has improved in both absolute and proportional terms and is projected to increase further in the next few decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066610397116">1</xref></sup> The fastest growing age cohort is made up of those aged ≥80 years, which is increasing at an estimated 3.8% per year and projected to represent one fifth of all older persons by 2050.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066610397116">1</xref></sup> Older age is associated with an increased prevalence of chronic illness and functional impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066610397116">2</xref></sup> As a result, elderly people, including those who are ≥80, will be admitted more frequently to hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066610397116">3</xref></sup> As this cohort of elderly ICU patients is rapidly growing, a comprehensive evaluation on best care, triage decision-making, and advanced care planning for acutely ill older patients is urgently required to optimize recovery and outcome in this subset of population.</p>
<p>Sepsis remains a lethal disease with case fatality rates of 20% to 40% and contributes to nearly 20% of all in-hospital deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066610397116">4</xref></sup> The incidence of sepsis increases with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610397116">5</xref></sup> A data on sepsis patients from 1995 hospital discharge records in 7 US states reported a mean age of 63.8 years with an incidence of severe sepsis that had increased with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610397116">5</xref></sup> Older patients are more prone to infections due to the effects of aging, various associated comorbidities, use of invasive devices and interventions, and problems associated with institutionalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066610397116">6</xref></sup> The diagnosis of sepsis in this population can be difficult, as older patients may have atypical responses to sepsis and may present with delirium or falls, thus delaying therapeutic interventions that may influence their outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066610397116">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066610397116">7</xref></sup> However, there is limited epidemiological information about the impact of sepsis in elderly patients, regarding incidence, and outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610397116">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066610397116">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066610397116">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066610397116"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066610397116"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066610397116"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066610397116"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066610397116"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066610397116">14</xref></sup> Therefore, we conducted this prospective observational study in order to obtain information on outcomes of severe sepsis and septic shock in elderly patients admitted in the ICU of a tertiary care hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0885066610397116">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A prospective cohort study was conducted in an 8-bed medical ICU of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi. All adult patients admitted to the ICU over a period of 20 months from July 2008 to February 2010 with severe sepsis or septic shock was included in the study. Patients less than 18 years and those admitted without any evidence of severe sepsis or septic shock were excluded.</p>
<p>Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were defined according to the international guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066610397116">15</xref></sup> Sepsis was defined when the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (at least 2 of the following criteria: body temperature &gt;38°C or &lt;36°C; heart rate &gt;90 beats/min; respiratory rate &gt;20 breaths/min or PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;32 mm Hg; leukocytes &gt;12.000 cells/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066610397116">3</xref></sup> or &lt;4.000 cells/mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066610397116">3</xref></sup> or band forms more than 10%), was associated to the infectious focus documented by blood culture, bronchoalveolar lavage or tracheal aspirate, and urine. Severe sepsis was defined as sepsis plus organ failure, hypotension, or hypoperfusion and septic shock was defined as sepsis complicated by hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure &lt;60 mm Hg) despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Whenever severe sepsis or septic shock were suspected in the ICU, the physician on duty contacted the head researcher and ICU consultant on call to comply with the established international sepsis criteria for inclusion in the study.</p>
<p>Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their age. Patients were classified as young (age between 18 and 60 years); old (age between 60 and 80 years), or very old (age above 80 years). Data regarding patient demographics, admission acute physiology, and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score and ICU course including need for organ support and ICU length of stay were prospectively collected. Patients in these groups were compared with ICU mortality being the primary outcome measure and need for organ support being the secondary outcome measure</p>
<sec id="section3-0885066610397116">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We used SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) for the statistical analysis. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD and their means were compared using Student <italic>t</italic>-test. The categorical variables were compared using χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066610397116">2</xref></sup>-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was considered significant for the analysis. For intergroup and intragroup comparison of quantitative data, one-way ANOVA was used.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period of 20 months, 387 patients were admitted to the medical ICU with signs of SIRS or sepsis. Out of these, 132 (34.1%) patients who fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock were included in the analysis. The most common suspected site of infection was respiratory tract (60 patients, 45.5%), followed by urinary tract (28 patients, 21.2%), abdomen (22 patients, 16.7%), skin and soft tissues (10 patients, 7.6%), and others including central nervous system, pleural space, and cardiovascular system (12 patients, 9.1%).

<p>Various factors including age, sex, APACHE II score, and need for MV, renal or inotropic support, were analyzed in a univariate analysis for predicting ICU mortality.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sepsis is a frequently encountered problem, which is associated with a substantial mortality and consumption of significant proportion of health care resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610397116">5</xref></sup> Sepsis predominantly affects older population and in the present study also, a significant majority (56.8%) of the patients with severe sepsis belonged to age group of more than 60 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066610397116">16</xref></sup> Elderly patients admitted to the ICU have higher morbidity and mortality rates as compared to their younger counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066610397116">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066610397116">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885066610397116">17</xref></sup> Not only they had a higher rate of infection on admission but also had a higher risk of acquiring infection during their stay in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066610397116">18</xref></sup> Moreover, infection has been shown to be independently associated with a higher risk of death in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066610397116">16</xref></sup> In our study, we observed a significant increase in ICU mortality in old (60.7%) and in very old patients (78.9%) as compared to younger patients (45.6%; <italic>P</italic> = .035) with severe sepsis or septic shock. The RR for dying in the old age group was 1.125, and in the very old age group was 1.487, as compared to the young patients. This increase in mortality in older population was independent of the severity of the disease as there was no significant difference in APACHE II score, among the patients in the 3 groups.</p>
<p>Even though some investigators have found no association between age and death,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066610397116">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066610397116">14</xref></sup> several other studies on elderly patients with severe sepsis or septic shock have reported that increasing age is an independent risk factor for death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066610397116">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066610397116">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885066610397116">18</xref></sup> We found in this study that age is an independent risk factor for death. This increase in mortality in the elderly patients has often been attributed to a greater number of comorbidities, more severe presentation of diseases, impaired health functional status, and different therapeutic approaches to the aged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066610397116">16</xref></sup> Hence, elderly patients are not only more prone to develop infection but also may have a poorer outcome once infection develops, which may be attributed to multiple factors. First, the reason of increased susceptibility to infections may be due to age-related alteration in immune response, which ranges from failed antigen processing by leukocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885066610397116">19</xref></sup> to altered inflammatory cytokine expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066610397116">20</xref></sup> Besides mortality, age is also a consistent predictor of other outcome measures like incidence of nosocomial infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066610397116">21</xref></sup> need for mechanical ventilation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885066610397116">21</xref></sup> and long-term outcome in critically ill populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885066610397116">22</xref></sup> which may also be explained by an impaired immune response in the elderly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885066610397116">20</xref></sup> Second, age also influences the type of infection and its propensity for causing sepsis. Data suggests that respiratory tract is the commonest site for infection in the elderly, which is in accordance with our results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885066610397116">23</xref></sup> Third, the cause of increased mortality may be due to associated comorbidities. Although comorbidities are highly relevant for predicting outcomes in critically ill patients with sepsis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885066610397116">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885066610397116">25</xref></sup> it is unlikely that they fully account for the differences in susceptibility to sepsis given the nonsignificant difference in APACHE II scores between the 3 groups in our study. Finally, age-related conditions such as dementia or immobility (which are not taken into account when assessing APACHE II score) may contribute, but they are partially amenable to health care interventions.</p>
<p>In terms of need for organ support, there was no significant difference in the need for inotropic support or the need for renal support among the 3 groups in our study. However, there was a significantly increased need for mechanical ventilation in the very old age group of patients (<italic>P</italic> = .013). Some other studies have also shown that the need for mechanical ventilation in older patients is associated with poor outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885066610397116">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885066610397116">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Our findings may have broad implications in terms of both the care of sepsis in this population and the provision of health care. Most of the interventional sepsis trials invariably exclude elderly or very elderly patients who are at higher risk of death. However, these are the individuals most likely to develop sepsis and thus should be the targets of such controlled investigations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885066610397116">16</xref></sup> The limited available evidence regarding sepsis therapies in the elderly suggests that these therapies are similarly effective at improving survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885066610397116">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885066610397116">28</xref></sup> Increasing life expectancy combined with greater rates of sepsis in the elderly population may increase the need for intensive care resources in terms of triage, decision-making, expansion of ICU capacity, and advanced care planning. The risk of dying from severe sepsis is considerably higher in the elderly and very elderly subgroup of patients as compared to young patients. Hence, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion to quickly diagnose bacteremia or sepsis in older patients and initiate appropriate interventions in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Our study has few limitations. First, our study was done in a single centre and hence the results may not be generalized. However, the advantage of this was that the interobserver variability in definition of sepsis and septic shock was minimized as the same team of intensivists was involved in patient management throughout the study period. Second, we did not study the long-term survival and functional outcome in our patients. Indeed, short-term mortality is a crucial variable in judging the impact of intensive treatment in the ICU, which may help in better utilization of the limited ICU resources and may especially be more meaningful when assessing outcomes of elderly patients. Finally, we did not look at the impact of individual comorbidities and preadmission functional status on outcome. Instead, we used APACHE II score to define severity of disease and compare different patient groups as studies have demonstrated that APACHE II score is a good prognostic marker for sepsis in critically ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885066610397116">29</xref></sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Severe sepsis is common in the elderly and the very elderly subgroup of patients admitted in ICUs and they may be at a significantly higher risk of dying from severe sepsis with age as an independent risk factor for mortality. As the elderly patient population may be more vulnerable to succumb to severe sepsis, early aggressive care to recognize and manage severe sepsis is required to improve outcome.</p>
