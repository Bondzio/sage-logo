<p>Arrogant, but kind. Bombastic, but honest. Cruel, but objective.</p>
<p>Legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell fit all those descriptions (or are they contradictions?), and many more could be added to the list. Mark Ribowsky’s almost five-hundred-page book recounts Cosell’s struggles for acceptance within the sports broadcasting and journalism communities, his inability to fully embrace or reject his faith, his devotion to his family and a few friends, his often brutally cold treatment of colleagues, and his disdain for some of the events he covered. But there is little in any of these stories that has not been told before.</p>
<p>Indeed, the chief concern about this book is the absence of newer, fresher material about Cosell. Yes, there are multiple interviews woven into the narrative from people who knew him well, but there is a cavernous gap in research.</p>
<p>For example, despite the many interviews, Ribowsky never makes clear why he did not speak to either of Cosell’s daughters about the legacy of their father. He waits until late in the book to reveal that in the late 1970s, ABC’s leaders ordered the network’s video sports library to be destroyed to free up space in the vaults. Ribowsky also never makes clear if Cosell left behind personal papers, documents, or other items that would assist in helping the reader appreciate his talents and writing. He does offer one tantalizing item: “Cosell’s radio work began to feature creative uses of audiotape, which he himself archived—keeping thousands of hours stored and catalogued in his home. . . .” What happened to this material? How did Ribowsky learn about it? Did he attempt to gain access to it? No answers are provided.</p>
<p>These are a few examples of pertinent pieces of information either ignored or too easily dismissed by the author, who is a New York City writer and author of various books of sports and entertainment figures, including <italic>Don’t Look Back</italic>, about Satchel Paige and the Negro Leagues; <italic>He’s a Rebel</italic>, about rock promoter Phil Spector; and other books on the Supremes, the Temptations, and Stevie Wonder.</p>
<p>No biography about Cosell can be written without detailing his personal and professional relationship with Muhammad Ali. Of course, Parkinson’s disease has robbed Ali of the chance to share his thoughts about Cosell. Nevertheless, Ribowsky is able to weave his interviews, published stories written by others, Cosell’s own words, and other documents to advance his thesis that Cosell and Ali cared deeply about each other, and that Ali was one of few people who pierced Cosell’s coldhearted assessment of most professional athletes.</p>
<p>One interview subject told Ribowsky, “Howard used Ali. Ali used Howard. But the fact remains that Howard really cared about Ali. And essentially that’s what Howard was about. He cared about certain things, deeply and irrevocably. That came from a place way inside.”</p>
<p>The exploration of Cosell and Ali’s friendship is one of the strongest aspects of the book. Could any sports broadcaster today be as open in his or her respect for a professional athlete as Cosell was regarding Ali without being ridiculed? Considering that Cosell was criticized then, and in a media environment that was smaller in number and more comfortable with a kind of “buddy system,” the answer is obvious. Ribowsky does not state that himself, but his sources allow for that conclusion to come through.</p>
<p>Cosell called out those whom he believed deserved to be. He often delivered play-by-play with passion (and at other times with indifference). He used his bully pulpit to convince everyone that sports had to be seen as more than just wins, losses, and championships. Without question, no one today comes close to being Cosell. CBS’s Jim Nantz appears too corporate, for example, and NBC’s Bob Costas seems too cool. ESPN’s Jim Rome at times appears interested in assuming the Cosell image, but the number of people who consider him a journalist—which Cosell was—is far too small.</p>
<p>Ribowsky bemoans the absence of a successor to Cosell. “The irony is that while it might actually be easier to take stands like [Cosell did] today, given loosened media boundaries, examining broad issues in sports seems not to be worth the effort, if it is done at all. Have all the battles been won?”</p>
<p>There might be another reason: the Cosell legacy has such heavy baggage associated with it that it would forever weigh down the person who tried to sustain it. And it also would lead to a pink slip.</p>
<p>Ribowsky’s work should be read by the sports fan. It certainly will provide an enjoyable stroll down memory lane for people who grew up watching Cosell (whether they admired him is irrelevant) and ABC Sports. But it is not an academic work, so those in higher education will want to be careful about adopting it for any class on sports media except as very supplemental reading.</p>
