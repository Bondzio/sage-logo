            <p>Healthcare in America is at stake based on the pretense of doing the right thing. The current situation leaves many Americans without quality healthcare. By identifying and recognizing some of these issues perhaps healthcare professionals may begin to offer solutions and stand up for patients.</p>

      <p>Are American healthcare organizations doing the right thing? Are patients being denied healthcare? Do insurance companies and politicians act on the patients’ best interests? Doing the right thing was defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447558">Smith (2012)</xref> as: steadfast uprightness amid adversity, as honorableness with significant affiliations emerges with contentment (p. 88). Standing up for what one believes is the right thing and it may be uncomfortable and difficult however, it comes with great reward. Nurse practitioners (NPs) and other healthcare professionals do the right thing by being truthful and caring for patients in a kind, compassionate manner.</p>
      <p>Healthcare has many exciting possibilities and innovative ways to maximize quality of life. Along with dedicated, hardworking professionals are many advances in research and technology. Practicing from the humanbecoming school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447558">Parse, 1998</xref>) and other theoretical perspectives prompts patients and healthcare professionals to dialogue and cocreate positive experiences of health and quality of life. In contrast, how do corporations justify the lack of regard for patients and the healthcare professionals who have dedicated their lives to caring for others? Decision-making and strategic planning within healthcare continues to be fueled by the medical model, rather than what is best for the patient. Healthcare organizations are blurring the vision of quality, safety, and cost effective patient- focused care. Healthcare professionals have many challenges. Has doing the right thing gone by the wayside in healthcare? It is critical to prioritize the values of society in order that the people of the United States of America are not lost in the medical model regime.</p>
      <p>Medical care, modern technology, and insurance coverage come at a hefty price. Healthcare professionals have many challenges. NPs continue to be underutilized in healthcare. A criticism of the healthcare industry is that it does not acknowledge or appreciate the education, experience, and value of NPs. Many physicians do not support NPs or the possibility of creating a collaborative arrangement whereby many more Americans might be cared for in a quality, cost effective manner. Instead of trying to work together to create a balance for patients, the physicians continue to practice without regard to doing the right thing for others. This slippery slope is detrimental not only to patients but society as a whole. Many Americans are aware, on some level that this is occurring, but are unclear how to remedy the situation.</p>
      <p>A recent Institute of Medicine (2010) report provides significant suggestions to begin working in the right direction to resolve the healthcare dilemma. One solution is to utilize nurses as they should be; educated, experienced, and highly qualified to care for an increasing number of patients. Is this doing the right thing? This is certainly a beginning. There are many other ways to amend and enhance the healthcare system however, it is necessary to return to the theory of doing the right thing for everyone.</p>
      <p>Doing what is just and fair should be the paramount expectation of every discipline, not just nursing. Doing the right thing should be foundational in creating a positive healthcare environment for all. Are there theories and principles underpinning American healthcare? In practice, nurses must be open to creating opportunities to ensure that patients are the center of care. Despite adversity it is paramount to do the right thing for all. In order for this to occur, healthcare professionals must be diligent in creating change and challenging the status quo. There is much work to be done, quickly.</p>
