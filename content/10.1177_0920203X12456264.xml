<p>The book offers a comprehensive overview of China’s role in global governance – a topic of increasing interest among academic and policy communities. The discussion is centred on disputes between China and major countries and international organizations. According to the authors, global governance refers to the establishment of ‘rule systems that govern or steer the supply of global public goods by various actors to address various trans-sovereign problems in order to maintain a stable and responsive global order’. The book analyses eight major global issues: peace and security, finance and trade, human rights and humanitarian intervention, environmental protection, public health, food safety, energy security, and transnational organized crime. The book’s authors try to answer two thematic questions in their analysis: what sort of international public goods does China supply and in what areas; and does China take collective action with other state and non-state actors through international institutions or does it free-ride on the efforts of others instead?</p>
<p>The authors of this book argue that China’s participation in global governance varies across issues, depending heavily on whether it suits the country’s national interests and whether China is able to accumulate skills and knowledge in handling issues in which it is inexperienced. The authors argue that among the aforementioned eight major global issues, China’s participation is the most active in transnational crimes because crimes such as money laundering hurt China’s social order. Another reason is that China requires aid from international communities in order to solve such crimes. By contrast, China is loath to take part in human rights advocacy and humanitarian interventions. China’s high priority on the right to development is frowned upon by Western countries, whereas the latter’s emphasis on political rights and civic liberty is regarded by Chinese leaders as meddling with domestic issues and violating the sovereignty of China and other countries.</p>
<p>The book is a valuable reference for international relations students and scholars as well as policy consultants with a special interest in China. It is easy to read and it outlines the contours of global governance – a complicated topic for those new to the field of international relations. With the aid of indicators such as the amount of funds and personnel involved in the causes advocated by international organizations, the number of treaties signed for regulatory purposes, and the extent of harmonizing domestic legislations with China’s international commitments, the book provides an objective evaluation of China’s role in global governance. In the face of China’s emergence in the diplomatic arena, the international community expects China to assume a greater role. However, the Chinese leadership is hesitant because of such considerations as the concern for China’s sovereignty and that of other countries; competition from domestic issues which require the attention of its leaders; and a suspicion of conspiracy by Western countries to tie China’s hands through multi-lateral agreements at best or to subvert China through peaceful revolution at worst. The failure to assume an active role in global governance, however, works against China’s favour as it is unable to earn respect from the international community. China’s participation in global governance is especially crucial in view of the credit crunch faced by major Western countries, the euro crisis, and the flattening of Western economies.</p>
<p>Apart from strengths, the book also has its weaknesses. While it is comprehensive and easy to read, it hardly offers sufficient details on the issues discussed. For instance, in the discussion of peace and security, the book focuses on UN’s peacekeeping force and nuclear non-proliferation. It neglects important issues such as the smuggling of weapons, China’s rising national defence expenditure, and its assistance to Pakistan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka to construct ports that might be used to enhance China’s naval power in the Indian Ocean. China’s endeavours to fight terrorism, its endeavours in the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the implications of these efforts for human rights violation are not investigated. China’s promotion of renewable energy, which is crucial in global efforts to ensure environmental protection and energy security, is also unmentioned. However, these weaknesses are understandable, given that putting all the issues into a single book is extremely difficult if not impossible.</p>
